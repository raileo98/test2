    More flights, cheaper fares on the way: airport boss

<div class="itemFullText">
 The new three-runway system will enable more flights to and from Chek Lap Kok and will bring down air fares, Airport Authority chief Steven Yiu said on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  All three runways came into operation on Thursday, with officials eyeing a boost in capacity to 120 million passengers per year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yiu, the authority's executive director, told RTHK that airlines are queuing up to get hold of additional departure and arrival slots.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The airlines are excited about the three-runway system because they want to be able to operate more trips. If short-haul flights that take around four to five hours for a round-trip leave in the morning, that means they may be able to make three trips a day. From an operating point of view, this increases airlines' efficiency," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yiu said the authority is hoping to attract more airlines to use Hong Kong for lay overs and is hoping for more long-haul routes to be opened up.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the past six months, we have provided incentives to airlines if they are willing to provide flights to places that were not available before, or if they add flights to some of our strategic destinations," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that Hong Kong will remain an international aviation hub even if competition from other airports in the Greater Bay Area intensifies.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If we look at the economy in the Greater Bay Area, there is a total population of 86 million people, which is 10 times the Hong Kong population. The area also has the most vibrant economy in China. Even with the opening of all 11 runways in the area, I believe it will not be sufficient to satisfy all demand," he said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 More than 10 million people in Shenzhen will be allowed to visit Hong Kong as many times as they like from December 1, the authorities said on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Mainland officials have reversed their 2015 decision to limit such visits to once per week, allowing Shenzhen residents to apply for multi-entry permits to make repeated trips to the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  The maximum length of each visit will remain at seven days.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chief Executive John Lee expressed his gratitude to the central government for making the move.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee previously said he had requested a return to the earlier arrangement, which was scrapped due to concerns over parallel trading and overcrowding.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, from next year Zhuhai residents can apply for weekly trips to Macau, while those living in the Guangdong-Macau In-Depth Cooperation Zone in Hengqin will be able to go to Macau as many times as they like for up to seven days at a time.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong Premier League side Eastern on Thursday night crashed out of contention in the AFC Champions League Two – Asia's second-tier club football tournament – suffering a 4-1 defeat to Australian side Sydney FC in their Group E match-up at Mong Kok Stadium.
 <br>
  <br>
  Sydney jumped out to a commanding 3-0 lead in the first half, thanks to an early goal from Moroccan striker Anas Ouahim in the fifth minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  That was followed up by a 16th-minute half-volley by Patryk Klimala, as Ouahim deflected a shot for Sydney's third goal to close out the half.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eastern striker Noah Baffoe pulled one goal back for the home team with a glancing header from a free kick in the 49th.
  <br>
  <br>
  But it was Ouahim's individual brilliance that sealed the victory for the Australians, scoring a penalty in the 62nd minute to secure the first-ever hat-trick of his career.
  <br>
  <br>
  With one round left, the win guarantees Sydney's progression to the last 16 of the continental competition for just the second time in the club’s history.
  <br>
  <br>
  They next face Philippine side Kaya FC in their final group match on December 5, while Eastern will travel to Hiroshima to play Japan side Sanfrecce on the same day.

    Zeman calls for 'panda island' attraction

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A former chairman of Ocean Park says the theme park needs to make the most of its unique panda attractions to boost returns and get back to profitability.
 <br>
  <br>
  Allan Zeman, chairman of Lan Kwai Fong Group, told RTHK's
  <a href="https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/news-programmes/this-episode.htm?cmsid=77" target="_blank">
   Hong Kong Today
  </a>
  programme that outside of the mainland, nowhere else in the world had six pandas and Ocean Park should create a 'panda island' to capitalise on this.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The fact that we have six pandas, if they do a panda island, they find a piece of land... have all the six pandas together... panda restaurants, panda shops... panda games... really create something that no other part of the world has. And I think that would really drive a lot of business," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The park unveiled its latest full-year result on Thursday, saying it recorded a deficit of more than HK$71.6 million for the financial year ending in June, despite revenue and visitor numbers hitting five-year highs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zeman said promoting the "panda economy" would be key to the park's success going forward, especially after the government's time-limited subvention – capped at HK$280 million a year – ends after the 2025-2026 financial year.
  <br>
  <br>
  He pointed out the limitations facing Ocean Park in setting its own admission fees.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Ocean Park Corporation is a statutory board that is a not-for-profit organisation, aiming to provide education and conservation at an affordable price.

<img alt="US President-elect Donald Trump has said the tariffs would remain in effect until the flow of drugs and migrants into the US was controlled. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1781280_1_20241128203256.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum on Thursday ruled out a trade war with the United States after speaking with President-elect Donald Trump, who has threatened stiff tariffs to halt illegal immigration.
 <br>
  <br>
  "There will not be a potential tariff war," Sheinbaum - who has been scrambling to head off threatened tariffs of 25 percent on Mexican goods - told a daily news conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  She was speaking a day after a telephone call with Trump, who has threatened to slap tariffs on Canada and China in addition to Mexico.
  <br>
  <br>
  After their call, Sheinbaum and Trump offered differing accounts of what they had discussed regarding migration.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump claimed that Mexico's left-wing president had "agreed to stop migration through Mexico, and into the United States, effectively closing our Southern Border."
  <br>
  <br>
  Sheinbaum later said she had discussed a policy already in place, and denied Trump's version again on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I can assure you... that we would never - we would not be capable - of proposing that we were going to close the border," she said, adding: "Of course we do not agree with that."
  <br>
  <br>
  She said she had assured the Republican leader that a caravan of migrants assembled in southern Mexico, over which Trump had expressed concern, "will not reach the northern border," pointing to Mexico's "strategy" of preventing such convoys crossing its territory.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said that after that, the talks had no longer revolved around the threat of tariff hikes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump caused panic among some of the biggest US trading partners on Monday when he said he would impose tariffs of 25 percent on Mexican and Canadian imports and 10 percent on goods from China.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mexican Economy Minister Marcelo Ebrard warned on Wednesday that some 400,000 jobs in the United States could be lost if Trump followed through on his threat.
  <br>
  <br>
  He cited a study based on figures from US carmakers that manufacture in Mexico.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sheinbaum said Thursday that further conversations were planned between her government and Trump's transition team before his January 20 inauguration. (AFP)

<img alt="Jansen holds the ball after taking seven wickets in the first innings. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1781315_1_20241129075058.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Marco Jansen bowled South Africa into a dominant position as Sri Lanka crashed to 42 all out, their lowest total in Test cricket, on the second day of the first Test against South Africa at Kingsmead on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The left-arm fast bowler took seven for 13 as Sri Lanka were bowled out in 13.5 overs – the second-shortest completed Test innings in history.
  <br>
  <br>
  It gave South Africa a first innings lead of 149 after they had been dismissed for a modest 191 in their first innings.
  <br>
  <br>
  The hosts stretched their lead to 281 runs when they scored 132 for three in their second innings.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yet the 2.06-metre Jansen, one of the tallest players in international cricket, admitted that he struggled to control the ball at the start of his spell with a strong wind blowing across the ground being a "massive factor".
  <br>
  <br>
  Having played only in eight T20 matches since returning from a three-month "conditioning break", the 24-year-old Jansen sent down a wide and a no-ball before opening batsman Pathum Nissanka had to put bat on ball.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I struggled to get my wrist behind the ball. It felt like I was battling something but I just tried to make it work," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kagiso Rabada made the breakthrough for South Africa when he had Dimuth Karunaratne caught at first slip before Jansen, in his second over, bowled a delivery close enough to Nissanka to induce an edge to third slip.
  <br>
  <br>
  It sparked an inspired spell. Jansen's pace and bounce, allied with the ability to make the ball swing in as a variation to his natural angle across right-handed batsmen, proved devastating.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he still bowled another two no-balls. After at least two of his wickets he looked back anxiously at the umpire to make sure he hadn't over-stepped again.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said, though, that once he found his rhythm, "the ball was moving nice and quickly off the pitch. We knew if we put the ball in the right areas we would always be in the game."
  <br>
  <br>
  He said his break from cricket, ordered by Cricket South Africa, had refreshed him mentally.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I feel I can go for longer periods of time, concentrating at a high level," said Jansen. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Rasmus Hojlund scored twice as Manchester United won a chaotic Uefa Europa League encounter against Bodo/Glimt 3-2 on Thursday, giving Ruben Amorim a vital win in his first home game at Old Trafford.
 <br>
  <br>
  Alejandro Garnacho gave the home side a lightning start after a shocking error from opposition goalkeeper Nikita Haikin.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Hakon Evjen levelled for the Norwegians and Philip Zinckernagel surged down the right wing to give them a shock lead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hojlund pulled United level with a superb finish just before half-time and poked them ahead early in the second period.
  <br>
  <br>
  New United boss Amorim said the match was a "real ride" and that he was on a steep learning curve as he gets to know his players.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Of course I see what everybody sees – good moments, difficult moments, some confusion in the end trying to hold the result, but the lads did a great job," Amorim said after the match.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They ran, they pressed, they tried to do the thing we worked for these three days and we won," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  And he said he was touched by the reception he was given by the home fans.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The first thing is that half of the stadium doesn't know me, doesn't really know me," he added. "I came from Portugal. I did nothing for this love yet so the way they made me feel at home, it's so special."
  <br>
  <br>
  The former Sporting Lisbon boss, who has said his methods will take time to implement, made six changes from the side that laboured to a 1-1 draw against Ipswich in his first game in charge on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tyrell Malacia returned to the United line-up for the first time since the final game of the 2022 to 2023 season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bodo/Glimt also made multiple changes with one eye on domestic matters – they are top of the Norwegian league table by a point with one match to come. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 World number two Iga Swiatek has accepted a one-month suspension after testing positive for a banned substance, the International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA) announced on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Swiatek, 23, tested positive for the heart medication trimetazidine (TMZ) in an out-of-competition sample in August 2024, when the Polish player was ranked number one in the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ITIA, however, accepted that it was caused by "the contamination of a regulated non-prescription medication (melatonin), manufactured and sold in Poland that the player had been taking for jet lag and sleep issues".
  <br>
  <br>
  "The violation was therefore not intentional – the player's level of fault was considered to be at the lowest end of the range for 'No Significant Fault or Negligence'," the ITIA said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Reigning French Open champion Swiatek, who has five Grand Slam singles titles – four at Roland Garros and the 2022 US Open – accepted the suspension.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm finally allowed – so I instantly want to share with you something that became the worst experience of my life," an emotional Swiatek said in a post on social media.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the last two-and-a-half months I was subject to strict ITIA proceedings, which confirmed my innocence," she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The only positive doping test in my career, showing unbelievably low level of a banned substance I've never heard about before, put everything I've worked so hard for my entire life into question.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Both me and my team had to deal with tremendous stress and anxiety. Now everything has been carefully explained, and with a clean slate I can go back to what I love most."
  <br>
  <br>
  Swiatek was provisionally suspended from September 22 until October 4, missing three tournaments, which counts towards the sanction, leaving eight days remaining.
  <br>
  <br>
  She will also forfeit prize money from the Cincinnati Open, the tournament directly following the test, where she lost to Aryna Sabalenka in the final.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I know I will be stronger than ever," continued Swiatek. "Right now I'm just relieved it's over.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I want to be open with you, even though I know I did nothing wrong. Out of respect for my fans and the public, I'm sharing all the details of this longest and toughest tournament of my career," she went on to say. "My biggest hope is that you will stay with me." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Detroit Lions survived a late rally from the Chicago Bears, with a little piece of good fortune, to make it ten wins a row with a 23-20 win on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The opening game of a trio of Thanksgiving Day clashes went down to the wire but Chicago made a mess of their final possession, allowing Detroit to move to 11-1 on the season for the first time in franchise history.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Lions had led 16-0 at the half after three field goals and a 3-yard touchdown pass from Jared Goff to Sam LaPorta.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the Bears fought back strongly with three touchdowns in the second half – two of them on the connection between quarterback Caleb Williams and receiver Keeman Allen.
  <br>
  <br>
  When Williams found D.J. Moore with a superb 31-yard touchdown pass late in the fourth quarter, the Lions' advantage was reduced to three points.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chicago forced Detroit to punt on the next possession, leaving Williams with the ball and the chance to take the game to overtime or win it.
  <br>
  <br>
  A pair of penalties hampered the Bears' final drive but despite Williams taking a sack with 36 seconds left in the game, a field goal opportunity remained well within reach.
  <br>
  <br>
  But instead of taking a timeout, the Bears offense tried to set up to gain some more yards for kicker Cairo Santos losing precious time.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ball was snapped with just six seconds left and Williams threw an incomplete pass as the clock ran out.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Bears, who suffered their sixth straight loss, looked confused and frustrated while the sense of relief was evident on the faces of the Lions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was a crazy ending and we fought hard to the end to get it done – but it was scary," admitted Goff.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our defense held strong. Our defense, they'll bend not break and they made those plays at the end there and we win," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jared Goff went 21-for-34 for 221 yards and two touchdowns while on the ground, the running back pair Jahmyr Gibbs and David Montgomery put up 175 yards between them. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong government said on Thursday that it rejects and strongly disapproves of the European Parliament’s so-called resolution on Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  The European body earlier passed a non-binding resolution, calling for the “immediate and unconditional” release of all opposition figures who had been sentenced on national security charges.
  <br>
  <br>
  It called for sanctions to be imposed on Hong Kong and mainland officials, and demanded that Hong Kong’s favourable customs treatment be revoked.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, the SAR government said it strongly condemns the baseless claims made against its officials.
  <br>
  <br>
  A spokesperson stressed that as an inalienable part of the People’s Republic of China, Hong Kong needs to put in place a complete and effective set of national security legislation to safeguard national security.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that many other common law jurisdictions also have their own national security legislation, and that the European Parliament should not interfere in Hong Kong matters and China's internal affairs.
  <br>
  <br>
  The spokesman stressed that all trials in Hong Kong are being conducted in an open, fair and independent manner.

 Police said a 75-year-old man has been arrested on Thursday in connection with a fire that broke out along a road in Tsuen Wan the day before.
 <br>
  <br>
  The blaze, which destroyed part of a six-metre-tall noise barrier on Cheung Pei Shan Road near Shek Wai Kok Estate, disrupted traffic for much of the day on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chief inspector Law Sai-to of the Tsuen Wan district crime unit said the suspect was identified after reviewing CCTV footage and interviewing nearby residents.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He lives near the scene of the crime. When he was arrested, we found three medium-sized lighters and a utility knife on him. He was arrested on suspicion of arson and possession of offensive weapon, and is currently being detained for questioning," Law said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Investigations are continuing, he added.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Commissioner's Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Hong Kong on Thursday said it strongly disapproves and rejects a decision by Washington to update its travel advisory for Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  The office made the remarks a day after the US Department of State issued a “Level 2” alert for those intending to travel to Hong Kong, saying people should “exercise increased caution” due to the “arbitrary enforcement” of national security legislation in the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  A spokesperson for the office stressed Hong Kong is one of the safest and most livable cities in the world, adding that national security legislation – the formulation and implementation of which are in line with international practice and the rule of law – has brought stability to the territory.
  <br>
  <br>
  The spokesman pointed out that the SAR has welcomed 21 million visitors during the first half of this year, 64 percent more than the same period last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Foreign funds, enterprises and talented individuals also continued to pour in, showing the international community’s trust in Hong Kong,” he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The office called on the US to stop smearing Hong Kong through repeatedly issuing travel advisories, saying the SAR – as an open and free international city – will continue to welcome international visitors with open arms.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SAR government also issued a separate statement, calling on the US to stop using its travel advisories as a political tool to smear Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  A spokesperson stressed there are clear lines being drawn when it comes to the city's national security legislation, and tourists will not unwittingly fall foul of the law.

    Australia passes social media law banning youngsters

<div class="itemFullText">
 Australia passed a law on Thursday to ban social media for children aged under 16 after days of heated debate, setting a standard for other countries to follow in a global push to curb the power of Big Tech.
 <br>
  <br>
  The law, expected to take effect in November 2025, sets some of the toughest social media controls in the world and will force platforms to take reasonable steps to ensure age-verification protections are in place.
  <br>
  <br>
  After a parliamentary session that went into the night, the country's Senate, or upper house of parliament, voted to pass the law after the centre-left Labor government of Prime Minister Anthony Albanese won support from the conservative opposition.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Senate's approval for the law is the final legislative hurdle after the lower house, or House of Representatives, passed the bill on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Albanese, trying to lift his approval ratings ahead of an election expected in May, had argued that social media posed risks to the physical and mental health of children and is looking for support from parents.
  <br>
  <br>
  Australia plans to trial an age-verification system that may include biometrics or government identification to enforce the ban. The trial will run for several months and its findings would be reviewed by mid-2025.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under the law, companies could be fined up to A$49.5 million (US$32 million) for breaches.
  <br>
  <br>
  In submissions to parliament, Alphabet's Google and Meta said the ban should be delayed until the age-verification trial finishes, expected in mid-2025. Bytedance's TikTok said the bill needed more consultation, while Elon Musk's X argued the proposed law might hurt children's human rights.
  <br>
  <br>
  A Senate committee backed the bill this week, but also inserted a condition that social media platforms should not force users to submit personal data such as passport and other digital identification to prove their age. (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 German investigators suspect a Berlin doctor of killing eight elderly patients under his care and setting fire to some of their homes to cover up his crimes, prosecutors said Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The unnamed suspect, 40, who worked in palliative care for a nursing service, was remanded in custody in August on suspicion of killing four women aged 72 to 94 and starting fires at their homes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prosecutors in Berlin have now linked the suspect to four more deaths of men and women aged between 61 and 83, they said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police in August said the man was being investigated on four counts of manslaughter, one count of arson and three counts of attempted arson.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Berlin prosecutors said they were now treating the alleged killings as murder cases.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The accused appears to have had no motive for killing the people other than the act of killing itself," they said, accusing him of a "lust for murder".
  <br>
  <br>
  Police in August said the man was suspected of killing four female patients in the care of his nursing service in Berlin between June 11 and July 24.
  <br>
  <br>
  In one case, an 87-year-old woman was resuscitated after emergency services arrived, but died later in hospital.
  <br>
  <br>
  In another, the suspect allegedly started a blaze but the fire went out.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When he realised this, he allegedly informed a relative of the woman and claimed that he was standing in front of her flat and that nobody was answering the doorbell," police said.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the four new cases, which date back to the period from June 2022 to April 2024, the suspect is accused of killing two men and two women in Berlin.
  <br>
  <br>
  In one case, he is suspected of administering a cocktail of medications to a 70-year-old female patient in her apartment in Berlin's Tempelhof district and then starting a fire to cover up his crime.
  <br>
  <br>
  The fire department, called by a neighbour, was able to prevent the flames from spreading to the rest of the building.
  <br>
  <br>
  He is also accused of administering deadly medications to two men, aged 70 and 83, and to a 61-year-old woman. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The EU will invite British premier Keir Starmer for talks on defence with the bloc's 27 leaders in February, Brussels said Thursday, as the two sides push to rebuild ties after Brexit.
 <br>
  <br>
  A senior European Union official said Brussels intends to organise "informal retreats", starting with a meeting in Belgium on February 3 focused on security issues.
  <br>
  <br>
  The encounter would be the first of its kind between the EU and Britain since London's 2020 departure from the bloc.

  <br>
  "For this one, the idea is to invite the secretary general of NATO and the UK prime minister," the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
  <br>
  <br>
  The outreach to Starmer is part of efforts to forge better ties after the acrimony caused by Britain's exit from the EU.
  <br>
  <br>
  The British prime minister -- who came to power in July -- made his first visit to Brussels last month to launch the long road to a reset.
  <br>
  <br>
  As part of those efforts, he agreed with European Commission chief to start holding regular summits between the two sides from next year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Starmer's government has mooted reaching a "security pact" with the EU but details so far remain vague on what that would entail.
  <br>
  <br>
  The prime minister, who voted in the UK's 2016 Brexit referendum to remain in the EU, has insisted his reset will not mean reversing Brexit, which remains a politically toxic subject in the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  The February talks on defence will come at a crucial juncture, just after Donald Trump assumes power in the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  Britain and the EU have been staunch supporters of Ukraine in its war against Russia and are warily eyeing Trump's promises to end the conflict quickly.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brussels is currently reshuffling its top leadership, with former Portuguese prime minister Antonio Costa set to replace Belgium's Charles Michel as head of the European Council on Sunday. (AFP)

    HK restaurants urged to get Halal certification

<img alt="The SAR now has its first ever high-end Chinese restaurant certified as Halal-friendly. Photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1781253_1_20241128180947.jpg&q=55">

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Tourism Board and certification authorities are encouraging restaurants, hotels and attractions to enhance their Muslim-friendly offerings by obtaining Halal certification, with the aim of enriching the experience of Muslim visitors to Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  The board said on Thursday that the number of certified Halal and Halal-friendly restaurants has risen from approximately 100 at the start of the year to around 130.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SAR now has its first ever high-end Chinese restaurant certified as Halal-friendly.
  <br>
  <br>
  Saito Chau, culinary director of Chinesology, said the certification process was extremely detailed, encompassing everything from menu design and the procurement of cutlery and cooking utensils to selecting appropriate ingredients.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said that achieving the Halal-friendly status was a significant milestone in making Chinese cuisine more accessible to Muslim consumers.
  <br>
  <br>
  For example, the restaurant has recreated the popular "char siu", or Chinese barbecue pork, with beef instead.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Muslim diners do not know much about Chinese cuisines, many of whom have never tried Chinese cuisine before. This inspires us to offer a culinary experience to Muslim visitors that allows them to explore the sophistication of the Chinese culinary culture by getting to taste the dishes themselves," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Becky Ip, deputy executive director of the board, said the SAR is committed to expanding its outreach to visitors from Middle Eastern and Asean markets, recognising the significant potential and spending power of Muslim consumers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have just started the whole support to our agencies and also the [Incorporated Trustees of the Islamic Community Fund of Hong Kong] Board of Trustees for making Hong Kong more Muslim-friendly, particularly in the dining scene," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's just a beginning as we just started in June this year, so so far we have about 30 new restaurants joining as Halal-friendly restaurants. So hoping by doing so, we will have more. We'd like to see more restaurants participate in the scheme."
  <br>
  <br>
  Ip added that they have intensified promotional efforts in Muslim source markets to draw more visitors from Southeast Asia and the Middle East to Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[It is] very important to let Muslim travellers understand well [that when] they come to enjoy Hong Kong, it will also be very safe for them to eat the food in Hong Kong, where they stay will be very safe for them," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have actually brought a few delegations to the Middle East and quite some delegations to promote Hong Kong together with our trade partners in these areas, Middle East and Southeast Asian countries. Apart from that, we also have invited over the past few months a series of KOLs, media and trade partners to come and see Hong Kong themselves.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Particularly let them have a chance to sample our hotel facilities and sample the Hong Kong food they look forward to. It's very, very important."

<div class="itemFullText">
 The HK$141 billion three-runway system at Hong Kong airport went into operation on Thursday, with authorities hailing it as a historic moment for the city's aviation development.
 <br>
  <br>
  Three flights - two taking off and one landing - were handled simultaneously at Chek Lap Kok in the afternoon, witnessed by top SAR and mainland officials attending a ceremony.
  <br>
  <br>
  Guests included Chief Executive John Lee, Vice Minister of Transport Xu Chengguang and the director of Beijing's liaison office Zheng Yanxiong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The various airlines also need to fully enhance their services, strengthening major routes and to explore more new destinations for Hong Kong, especially to countries of the Belt and Road Initiative in order to raise industry competitiveness," Lee said.
  <br>
  <br>
  One of Hong Kong’s largest infrastructure projects in recent years, the three-runway system involved the reclamation of 650 hectares of land to house the 3.8 kilometre-long extra runway.
  <br>
  <br>
  The new system boosts the airport's capacity to 120 million passengers per year, on top 10 million tonnes of cargo.
  <br>
  <br>
  Airport Authority chairman Fred Lam pledged to continue to implement the Airport City blueprint unveiled in 2019.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It will attract travellers from all around the world, boost the flow of people and goods, and act as an engine of Hong Kong’s economic development," he said at the commissioning ceremony.
  <br>
  <br>
  The authority said that it is now taking forward the phase two development of AsiaWorld-Expo, while a large-scale storage facility and other new projects will be completed from 2026 to 2031.

 The Foreign Ministry said three Chinese nationals jailed in the United States have returned to China.
 <br>
  <br>
  That's after the White House said three Americans jailed in China were released and heading back to the US.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Following unremitting efforts by the Chinese government, three Chinese nationals wrongfully imprisoned by the American side have now safely returned to the motherland," Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning told a regular press briefing in Beijing on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said Beijing "consistently opposes the American side carrying out the suppression and persecution of Chinese nationals out of political aims, and will continue as ever to take necessary measures" to uphold their interests.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mao added a longtime "fugitive" was also extradited back to China.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier, Washington said it secured the return of three Americans classified by the US State Department as wrongfully detained.
  <br>
  <br>
  US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said he had spoken to Mark Swidan, Kai Li and John Leung, and that they were in good health. (Reuters/AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Labour and Welfare Chris Sun said on Thursday that the government cannot make the lives of carers better on its own and all sectors must work together to support them.
 <br>
  <br>
  Sun said he is pleased to see that various NGOs have already cooperated with the Social Welfare Department to help carers.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that carers who need help should not hesitate to phone the government's 182 183 hotline.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The person answering the call doesn't only chat with you to calm you," Sun said at an event.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If you are looking for temporary short-term care, the hotline will arrange it for you. If it's a very urgent situation, there will also be social workers rushing to help you."

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Thursday hinted there would soon be news on the administration's request for changes to visa arrangements for mainland residents visiting Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  In his latest Policy Address, Lee said he had asked Beijing to bring back multiple-entry visas for Shenzhen residents and to expand the number of cities that grant visas for weekly visits to the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm grateful that central government departments are studying the proposal to expedite the implementation. I believe there will be news soon," Lee said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "All units of the SAR government will do their utmost to coordinate the implementation of such measures, promote people-to-people exchanges, and inject new momentum into the tourism, catering and retail industries."
  <br>
  <br>
  Beginning in April 2009, Shenzhen residents were allowed to apply for Individual Visit Endorsements, with holders able to enter and exit the SAR freely within a one-year validity period.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the scheme was replaced with a "one-trip-per-week" arrangement in 2015 following concerns over parallel trading and overcrowding.

    Men feel less included in society, survey finds

<img alt="The Hong Kong Christian Service found that the city has an inclusion score of about 70 out of 100. Photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1781206_1_20241128131553.jpg&q=60">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Men feel they are less included in society than women, according to a survey conducted by the Hong Kong Christian Service.
 <br>
  <br>
  The group surveyed 1,026 people between May and June to gather their views on eight attributes affecting their sense of inclusiveness. These areas are employment, recreational facilities, housing, family life, social connections, education, healthcare and culture.
  <br>
  <br>
  The overall inclusion score was about 70 out of 100, which the group views as "average".
  <br>
  <br>
  But men scored lower than women in every aspect.
  <br>
  <br>
  A single father surnamed Wong said gender stereotypes have made parenting of his seven-year-old daughter difficult.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I have never seen any father help with changing a baby's diaper in the shopping mall’s baby care room. To avoid embarrassment, I would knock on the door to 'seek approval' from the mothers inside," Wong said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that he sometimes feels he is treated unkindly, saying he has overheard people talk about whether he might be a kidnapper when he holds his daughter's hand when they are out.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wilson Yung from the Hong Kong Christian Service called on society to be more accepting and to appreciate men's decisions over their family roles.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We analysed that maybe due to Chinese culture, which mainly sees a man taking the role of family income [earners], and childcare will rely on women. In the current situation the society is not too accepting for men to be child caregivers," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The survey also found that interviewees considered education to be the least inclusive area.
  <br>
  <br>
  The group said while the government has recently invested a lot resources in special needs students, there's a need for more tailored support, stressing that the current approach is too generic.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Thursday called on business leaders to help with Hong Kong's bid to join the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), the world's largest free trade agreement.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a speech at the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce International Business Summit, Lee said with growing partnership between Hong Kong and Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean), it's clear that the SAR is ready to join RCEP.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I believe that the next natural step in our growing ties with Asean is for Hong Kong to become a member of RCEP," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  RCEP is a free trade pact for the Asian-Pacific region that includes all 10 Asean member states.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong is fully prepared to join RCEP. Doing so will boost our ties in trade and benefit companies and investors throughout the nations of Asean and also RCEP," the CE said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And I continue to count on business leaders like your good selves, people who know Hong Kong well and appreciate the value that Hong Kong can add to RCEP, to speak up in support of our accession bid."
  <br>
  <br>
  Financial Secretary Paul Chan, who also attended the summit, said Hong Kong has a unique role in connecting the markets in the Global South, including mainland China, to the rest of the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan noted that many mainland companies have established supply chains in the Global South and Belt and Road countries, and Hong Kong can play the role of a super-connector.
  <br>
  <br>
  “[Mainland firms] need project and trade financing. They need world-class professional services. They need global capital and global talent. In order to do this, Hong Kong would be a very unique platform,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We are encouraging mainland companies coming to Hong Kong to set up their regional offices, even international offices, to support their global ambition.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The financial secretary also spoke about challenges facing the world "underscored by geo-economic fragmentation", such as threats by US President-elect Donald Trump to raise tariffs on goods from China, Canada and Mexico.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite that, Chan said the US and Europe remain important and valuable partners for the SAR and China as a whole, saying cooperation remains possible in "non-sensitive areas" such as infrastructure and climate-related activities.
  <br>
  <br>
  He stressed the SAR needs to engage proactively with the West and reach out to their markets to tell the true Hong Kong story, to tackle misconceptions and biases.
  <br>
  <br>
  Standard Chartered's President, International, Benjamin Hung, said business people he'd spoken to around the world were discussing the possibility of higher US tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said with China having the world's largest production capacity, firms shifting their manufacturing elsewhere may lead to rising costs and higher inflation, adding to consumers' burden.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Right now, diversification is the name of the game... This is like insurance, this is like buying protection, because nowhere in the world, unfortunately, can produce the quantity, the quality, and at the cost level that China can," Hung said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So 'China+1' is never going to be enough because 'China+1' isn't enough to compensate the volume of China. You need 'China+2', 'China+N'."
  <br>
  <br>
  He said Hong Kong’s role amidst the challenges isn't just to be a centre for supply chains, but also to manage capital.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The White House said three Americans jailed in China have been released and were heading back to the US.
 <br>
  <br>
  The trio – Mark Swidan, Kai Li and John Leung – had been considered by Washington to be wrongfully detained by Beijing. Swidan was facing a death sentence on drug charges while Li and Leung were jailed on espionage charges.
  <br>
  <br>
  US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said he had spoken to all three. "I told them how glad I was that they were in good health and that they'll soon be reunited with their loved ones," he said in a post on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  Politico, which first reported the release, said a number of Chinese citizens detained in the US would also be released.
  <br>
  <br>
  China's embassy in Washington did not comment on the case.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the US has upgraded its travel advisory for China.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US State Department changed its travel warning to China to level 2, advising US citizens to “exercise increased caution” when travelling to the country. It had previously been at level 3, telling Americans to “reconsider travel”. (Agencies)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ocean Park has recorded a deficit of more than HK$71 million for the financial year ending in June, despite revenue and visitor numbers hitting five-year highs.
 <br>
  <br>
  Announcing its results on Thursday, the theme park also said it will capitalise on the presence of six giant pandas to drive park attendance and income.
  <br>
  <br>
  From December 8, the public will get to meet two pandas sent by the central government as gifts to the SAR, followed by locally-bred twin cubs as early as February next year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will capitalise on the presence of six giant pandas in the park to drive citywide excitement, thereby increasing visitor numbers and revenue while promoting panda tourism and ecological conservation in Hong Kong," said Ocean Park chairman Paulo Pong.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the 2023-24 fiscal year, the theme park's total revenue increased 41 percent year-on-year to HK$1.18 billion, primarily driven by a 54 percent growth in admission income.
  <br>
  <br>
  Revenue from merchandise jumped 27 percent, while catering income rose 32 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The park also welcomed 33 percent more visitors at 3.14 million in 2023-24, when compared with the same period last year. Visitors from the mainland, India and the Philippines showed significant year-on-year growth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Still, the theme park recorded a financial deficit of HK$71.6 million in the period ending June 30.
  <br>
  <br>
  Excluding government subsidies and depreciation, its net operating loss narrowed for a third straight year to HK$297 million, with the park saying the figure reflected "sustained upward momentum in operations and business performance" with cost-saving and revenue-generating measures in place.
  <br>
  <br>
  As of the end of June, the park's bank balance and cash totalled roughly HK$1.66 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will continue to pursue diverse revenue sources and aim for continued improvement in our financial performance over the medium to long term, despite prevailing external economic uncertainties. Through our operating income, we seek to contribute to society, future generations, and environmental conservation, thereby reducing reliance on public finances," Pong said.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 NBA Eastern Conference leaders the Cleveland Cavaliers suffered their first home loss of the season with a surprise 135-124 defeat to the Atlanta Hawks on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Cleveland's second loss of the season came afer a strong second half display from Atlanta with De'Andre Hunter scoring 26 points off the bench, Jalen Johnson adding 22 points and Trae Young contributing 20 with a career-high 22 assists.
  <br>
  <br>
  Young put the game beyond the Cavs with a 39-foot three pointer to make it 129-122 with just under two minutes remaining, moments after he had turned the ball over.
  <br>
  <br>
  Johnson said Young's assists had been crucial to the victory, and that he deserved more credit for his role on the team.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He was really getting off the ball and finding everyone," Johnson said. "A lot of people don't necessarily talk about him, even though he's leading the league in assists – but they don't talk about him as the playmaker."
  <br>
  <br>
  The win moves the Hawks to 8-11 on the season, and Young said the team had shown what they were capable of.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They are a really good team who have been playing well all year, and I feel we have been a little inconsistent but the times that we have played well, we've played really well," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Donovan Mitchell scored 30 for Cleveland and Evan Mobley put up 22 points and 13 rebounds, but the Cavs missed out on a chance to become the first team to start with an 18-1 record.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the Houston Rockets needed overtime to beat the 3-14 Philadelphia 76ers, with Alperen Şengün scoring 22 points and claiming 14 rebounds and seven assists.
  <br>
  <br>
  Half of Şengün's points came in overtime, where the Rockets made sure of moving to 14-6.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere, James Harden scored 43 points for the Los Angeles Clippers as they beat the struggling Washington Wizards 121-96.
  <br>
  <br>
  Harden scored 23 of his points in the first quarter, and left the game late in the third quarter with the Wizards already condemned to their 13th straight defeat. (AFP)

Photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1781184_1_20241128112210.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Thursday warned that technology-related crimes are on the rise in Hong Kong, while vowing to work with other jurisdictions to take on the challenges new technology poses.
 <br>
  <br>
  At the Asia and Pacific Regional Conference of the International Association of Prosecutors, Chief Executive John Lee said the SAR attaches great importance to ensuring the security of cyber infrastructure.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In Hong Kong, a highly developed international financial centre where technology is easily accessible by all, criminals are increasingly turning to the use of cryptocurrencies, virtual assets and technology in committing traditional crime. And crimes executed solely through technology are also on the rise," Lee said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That's why Hong Kong places great emphasis on the security of cyber infrastructure, in fighting technology crime, locally and internationally."
  <br>
  <br>
  Secretary for Justice Paul Lam told the same conference that crimes involving modern technology present "novel challenges" to prosecutors, adding that it can be difficult to bring offenders to justice.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Modern technology is, of course, not inherently evil. It becomes evil only when it is misused and abused by criminals," Lam said. "Our overriding objective is not only to prevent, suppress and punish such misuses and abuses, but also to outwit the criminals by becoming better users of modern technology and make modern technology our close ally in our war against the criminals."
  <br>
  <br>
  Tong Jianming, first deputy prosecutor general of the Supreme People's Procuratorate, said it is important for jurisdictions to adapt to changes brought about by technological developments.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that Beijing is willing to collaborate with others on using modern technology in strengthening prosecutions and looking into effective ways to tackle crime.

    Analyst sees slight growth in home prices in 2025

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A property analyst says housing prices are bottoming out and should stabilise next year, with possible growth of under five percent.
 <br>
  <br>
  Hannah Jeong, head of valuation and advisory services at CBRE, was commenting after official data showed that home prices went up in October after declining for five months.
  <br>
  <br>
  Data showed private residential prices were up 0.6 percent month-on-month. In September, prices dropped to their lowest level in eight years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rents in October recorded their first fall since February, falling 0.3 percent month-on-month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jeong said the major reasons for the upswing in prices were local banks lowering their prime rates after the US central bank began cutting interest rates in September.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government relaxing the maximum loan-to-value (LTV) ratio for all residential properties to 70 percent, regardless of the value of the property and whether it is for self-occupation, also had an impact, she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think we only have three or two months to go. So the decline or the overall negative growth will continue within this year," Jeong said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But 2025, possibly we are bottoming out and then see slight positive growth, possibly less than five percent, or remain stable or flat. So that's the forecast for 2025."
  <br>
  <br>
  The analyst noted the rental market was performing quite well, with a yield reaching about 3.3 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said she expected this upward trend to continue in 2025, due to the number of people entering the city under various government talent schemes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jeong also said there was a very strong desire for home ownership in Hong Kong, and next year, when the supply of new flats was expected to peak at around 26,000, this would provide a good opportunity for potential homebuyers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So I think we are facing the supply peak, obviously, at the wrong time. But this will give a good opportunity to homebuyers. People were waiting a very long time and unfortunately during Covid, people thought the market will be soft. But we had a 2020 price peak and people are losing money, whoever bought at that moment," she explained.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So now people learned a lesson and expect that if the price is much more affordable at this moment, people want to have a home."
  <br>
  <br>
  She also said developers were keen to get rid of their new units and were offering good incentives in the first-hand market.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Former Barcelona and Uruguay striker Luis Suárez has signed a one-year contract extension with the Major League Soccer club Inter Miami and will line up under new coach Javier Mascherano next season, the team said.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 37-year-old striker has scored 25 goals in all competitions since joining the club before the start of this season including 20 in Miami's record-breaking regular season campaign.
  <br>
  <br>
  After winning the Supporters' Shield for the best record in the regular season, with a new points tally record, Miami were eliminated from the playoffs in the first round by Atlanta United.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since then Argentina head coach Gerardo Martino has left the club with his compatriot and Suárez's former team-mate at Barca, Mascherano appointed on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm very happy, very excited to continue for another year and to be able to enjoy being here with this fan base, which for us is like family," said Suárez.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We feel very, very connected with Suárez, and hopefully, next year, we can bring them even more joy," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Miami's president of football operations Raul Sanllehi said Suárez had shown he remains an elite level forward, but was also a key component in the dressing room.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Luis was not only our leading scorer this season, but also a leader for the group. His impact cannot be understated," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Suárez announced in September he was retiring from international duty with the Uruguay national team after scoring 69 goals in 143 games.
  <br>
  <br>
  The forward played in Europe for Ajax, Liverpool and Atlético Madrid and had a season in Brazil with Gremio before joining Miami. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Ruud van Nistelrooy is reportedly set to be appointed as Leicester City's new manager, various British media outlets said on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Van Nistelrooy recently left Manchester United after a short spell as interim manager and serving as assistant to Erik ten Hag.
  <br>
  <br>
  Leicester sacked Steve Cooper on Sunday after just 12 Premier League games in charge, with the Foxes 16th in the table and only one point above the relegation zone.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two of Van Nistelrooy's three wins in four games as United's caretaker boss in the past month came against Leicester in the League Cup and Premier League.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 48-year-old Dutchman has previous managerial experience from one year in charge of PSV Eindhoven from 2022 to 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sky Sports reported that he could even be appointed in time to lead Leicester in their next game away at Brentford on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  A prolific goalscorer, Van Nistelrooy enjoyed a glorious playing career, most notably at PSV, Man United and Real Madrid. (AFP)

    Kumara gives Sri Lanka edge against South Africa

<img alt="Sri Lanka players celebrate after the dismissal of South Africa's David Bedingham. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1781156_1_20241128070753.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lahiru Kumara struck twice as Sri Lanka's bowlers had the better of a rain-hit opening day of the first Test against South Africa at Kingsmead on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  South Africa were 80 for four when rain stopped play for the day shortly before lunch. Fast bowler Kumara took wickets in successive overs to put his team on top – and was denied a third wicket because of a no-ball.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There was a lot in favour of the bowling team and they bowled well. The deliveries that got wickets were all pretty decent," said South Africa batting coach Ashwell Prince.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's a skilled bowling line-up and obviously they have done their homework," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sri Lankan bowling coach Darshana Gamage said pace was Kumara's biggest asset. With a history of hamstring injuries, he is now being used as a Test specialist.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In this Test championship, we wanted to have all our bowlers fresh," said Gamage.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our biggest challenge is to have quicks who will win us Test matches and I can say that we have the nucleus now to do the job away from home," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sri Lanka's decision to bowl first on a well-grassed pitch paid off under a heavily overcast sky.
  <br>
  <br>
  Namesakes Ajitha and Vishwa Fernando dismissed both South Africa's openers with the total on 14.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tristan Stubbs and South African captain Temba Bavuma defended doggedly, taking the total to 29 after 13 overs.
  <br>
  <br>
  There was a flurry of scoring when Kumara came into the attack in the 14th over, with 17 runs added off his first over – four leg-byes, a no-ball and three boundaries by Stubbs.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the strongly-built Kumara found extra bounce with the first ball of his second over, having Stubbs caught at third slip for 16.
  <br>
  <br>
  The weather is expected to clear from Thursday and Prince said South Africa were in a reasonable position, referring to the first Test between Australia and India in Perth last weekend when two low first innings totals were followed by a strong Indian second-innings performance.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two-Test series is crucial to both sides' hopes of reaching next year's World Test Championship final at Lord's, with Sri Lanka sitting third in the table and South Africa fifth. (AFP)

    Liverpool sink Real to go top of Champions League

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Kylian Mbappé saw a penalty saved as Liverpool beat Real Madrid 2-0 on Wednesday to inflict a third Uefa Champions League defeat in five matches on the holders.
 <br>
  <br>
  Alexis Mac Allister and Cody Gakpo scored the goals in the second half as the Reds maintained their perfect record to return to the top of the table.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mohamed Salah also fired wide from the spot, but it mattered little as Liverpool secured a 17th win in Arne Slot's first 19 games in charge.
  <br>
  <br>
  Slot has already achieved what Jurgen Klopp could not as Liverpool boss by slaying the Spanish giants.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool had a score to settle with Madrid, who were unbeaten in eight previous meetings between the sides, including Champions League finals against Klopp's men in 2018 and 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  Defeat sends Carlo Ancelotti's side tumbling down to 24th in the table.
  <br>
  <br>
  "From the first minute they just took control of the game," said Madrid midfielder Jude Bellingham, in what was a disappointing return to England.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I just think they were more up for it than us, to be honest, which is really disappointing to say. It's a bad result against probably the best-performing team in Europe," he added. "It's no disgrace to come here and lose, but we are disappointed in how we performed."
  <br>
  <br>
  Only the top 24 progress to the knockout stage with the top eight advancing directly to the last 16.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool are well on course to do just that and the confidence coursing through a side also eight points clear at the top of the Premier League was in evidence throughout in front of a highly-charged Anfield crowd.
  <br>
  <br>
  Madrid were hamstrung by a lengthy injury list and made the trip to England without Vinicius Junior, Rodrygo, Dani Carvajal, Eder Militao, Aurelien Tchouameni and David Alaba.
  <br>
  <br>
  Young centre-back Raul Asencio has been pressed into action by those absences and he made a vital goal-line clearance on four minutes. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Several members of Donald Trump's incoming administration have received threats including bomb alerts, the FBI said on Wednesday, with one nominee reporting a pipe-bomb scare sent with a pro-Palestinian message.
 <br>
  <br>
  "The FBI is aware of numerous bomb threats and swatting incidents targeting incoming administration nominees and appointees, and we are working with our law enforcement partners," the agency said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Swatting refers to the practice in which police are summoned urgently to someone's house under false pretenses.
  <br>
  <br>
  Karoline Leavitt, a spokeswoman for Trump's transition team, earlier said that several appointees and nominees “were targeted in violent, unAmerican threats to their lives and those who live with them.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Elise Stefanik, a Trump loyalist congresswoman tapped to be UN ambassador, said her residence in New York was targeted in a bomb threat.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said in a statement that she, her husband, and her three-year-old son were driving home from Washington for the Thanksgiving holiday when they learned of the threat.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee Zeldin, Trump's pick to lead the Environmental Protection Agency, said his home was targeted with a pipe bomb threat sent with “a pro-Palestinian themed message.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The former congressman from New York said he and his family were not home at the time.
  <br>
  <br>
  As he prepares to return to the White House in January, Trump has already swiftly assembled a cabinet of loyalists, including several criticised for a severe lack of experience.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Republican, who appears set to avoid trial on criminal prosecutions related to attempts to overturn his 2020 election loss, was wounded in the ear in July in an assassination attempt.
  <br>
  <br>
  He has not commented on the apparent bomb threats. (AFP/Reuters)

<img alt="More than 10,000 protesters surged into the city, defying a lockdown and a ban on public gatherings to skirmish with 20,000 security forces. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1781120_1_20241127210502.jpg&q=40">

<div class="itemFullText">
 Pakistan police said on Wednesday they had arrested nearly 1,000 protesters who marched on the capital Islamabad demanding the release of jailed ex-prime minister Imran Khan, after crowds were evicted from the city centre in a sweeping security crackdown.
 <br>
  <br>
  Khan has been jailed since August 2023, sidelined by dozens of legal cases he claims were concocted to prevent his comeback in elections this year marred by rigging allegations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since the February vote, his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party has defied a government crackdown with regular rallies, but Tuesday's gathering was by far the largest to grip the capital since the poll.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 10,000 protesters surged into the city, defying a lockdown and a ban on public gatherings to skirmish with 20,000 security forces enlisted to turn them back.
  <br>
  <br>
  Islamabad Police Inspector General Ali Nasir Rizvi said 954 protesters had been arrested between Sunday and Tuesday, when crowds came within 1.6 kilometres of a public square they aimed to occupy.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government said at least one police officer and four state paramilitary personnel had been killed, before the main thoroughfare was cleared by forces armed with tear gas and batons early on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi said in a statement that security forces had "bravely repulsed the protesters" as PTI told activists on social media the rally was cancelled "for the time being."
  <br>
  <br>
  Khan made a statement from his cell outside Islamabad calling supporters to the capital on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the crowds were led by his key lieutenant Ali Amin Gandapur and his wife Bushra Bibi, who was also jailed earlier this year but released last month.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The movement is continuing and it will be ended only by Imran Khan," said Gandapur after retreating from Islamabad to northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province where he serves as chief minister.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif called the protests "extremism." Since Sunday, his ministers have held regular press conferences in central Islamabad vowing no mercy for the oncoming marchers. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks declined on Wednesday, retreating from records after pricing data showed an uptick in inflation, as leading companies fell after earnings reports.
 <br>
  <br>
  After three straight closing records for the Dow and Tuesday's record for the S&P 500, both dropped along with the Nasdaq in the final full trading session of the week.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones finished down 0.3 percent at 44,722.
  <br>
  <br>
  The S&P 500 fell 0.4 percent to 5,998, while the Nasdaq shed 0.6 percent to 19,060.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite Wednesday's lacklustre session, investors are optimistic about the upcoming period.
  <br>
  <br>
  A note from CFRA Research pointed out that December has historically been the strongest month of the year for the S&P 500 since World War II.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We project additional new highs through year-end as the S&P approaches our 6,145 target level," CFRA said in the note. "However, the year ahead could offer additional challenges, which will likely lead to a below-average full-year gain."
  <br>
  <br>
  The personal consumption expenditures price index rose 2.3 percent in the 12 months to October, up from 2.1 percent in September, the Commerce Department announced.
  <br>
  <br>
  The benchmark is closely watched by the Federal Reserve. Futures markets currently place the odds at about two-thirds that the Fed will cut interest rates again in December by a quarter of a percentage point.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among individual companies, both Dell Technologies and HP Inc. fell sharply on disappointment with their profit outlooks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dell slumped 12.3 percent and HP lost 11.4 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Department store Nordstrom also retreated, sinking 8.2 percent as it reported a 4.6 percent increase in revenues. But the company also reported lower profits in a move attributed to higher costs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Markets will be closed on Thursday and open for only a half-day on Friday. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Secretary Eric Chan on Wednesday said a three-day visit to the Greater Bay Area has offered authorities insight into developing the Northern Metropolis project in the New Territories.
 <br>
  <br>
  Concluding the three-day visit to Guangdong province attended by government officials and business leaders, Chan said the trip had met its goal.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This trip to different major cities is purely an introduction, an exchange. We do not require business representatives to make any investments," Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I hope that they are able to see business opportunities, because they are truly the experts in doing business. When they see business opportunities, naturally, they will hold discussions [with others]."
  <br>
  <br>
  During the trip, enterprises from Guangdong and Hong Kong signed 126 economic and trade cooperation projects worth a total value of more than 100 billion yuan.
  <br>
  <br>
  The delegation also learnt about a “large-scale, land-disposable” development model used in mainland cities, which the SAR administration hopes can be used to expedite development in the Northern Metropolis.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan also said the government will hold a "promotional event" relating to the mega project on Friday, with local, mainland and foreign companies expected to attend.
  <br>
  <br>
  Finance chief Paul Chan is hammering out the details and will make an announcement in due course, the chief secretary added.

<img alt="Hassan Fadlallah (centre) said there was full cooperation with the Lebanese state. File photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1781121_1_20241127211249.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hezbollah lawmaker Hassan Fadlallah said on Wednesday his group was cooperating with the army's deployment to southern Lebanon under the terms of a new truce with Israel, insisting "there will be no problem there".
 <br>
  <br>
  His remarks came as Lebanon's army said it had begun reinforcing its presence in the south, and as tens of thousands of residents streamed home after the sealing of an Israel-Hezbollah ceasefire following more than a year of hostilities and two months of all-out war.
  <br>
  <br>
  Responding to an AFP question about Hezbollah fighters' withdrawal north of the Litani River in accordance with the ceasefire deal, Fadlallah said the matter was "linked to Lebanese state measures and strengthening the army presence".
  <br>
  <br>
  "There is full cooperation on this issue and there will be no problem there," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Lebanese military said Wednesday that it had "begun reinforcing its presence in the South Litani sector and extending the state's authority in coordination with the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL)".
  <br>
  <br>
  An AFP journalist saw army troops and vehicles in two areas of south Lebanon on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fadlallah went on to say that Hezbollah had "no visible weapons or bases" in the south, but at the same time, noted the group "is a secret resistance... not a regular army".
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hezbollah's people are the people of these villages and towns, and most of the dead are from these villages," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Nobody can make residents leave their villages."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lebanon says at least 3,823 people have been killed in the country since exchanges of cross-border fire began in October 2023, most of them in recent weeks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati said the army would shore up its presence in the country's south, while urging Israel to withdraw and respect the ceasefire that came into force on Wednesday. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Banker Peter Wong has been named the new chairman of the University of Hong Kong (HKU) governing council, succeeding barrister Priscilla Wong after her term ends next month.
 <br>
  <br>
  The government on Wednesday announced the appointment of the banker, who was previously the Asia-Pacific chief executive officer at HSBC, for a term of three years with effect from January 1, 2025.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chief Executive John Lee, in his capacity as the university's chancellor, also appointed five new members to the governing council.
  <br>
  <br>
  They include former director general of civil aviation Simon Li; Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) Standing Committee member Irons Sze; lawmaker Rock Chen; former president of the Hong Kong Institute of Human Resource Management Wilfred Wong; and CPPCC delegate Samuel Yung.
  <br>
  <br>
  Five other current members will also leave the governing council, alongside the outgoing chairwoman.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The newly appointed members are all elites in the community, possessing outstanding capabilities and rich experience," the government said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The chief executive hopes that the new appointments will provide the HKU's governance with a new outlook and new impetus, begin a new chapter in governance, steer the HKU towards striving for excellence and provide fresh momentum to the university."
  <br>
  <br>
  The university, for its part, said it respects the appointments made by the administration.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The university will continue to pursue excellence and make contributions in academic excellence, talent cultivation and international cooperation," HKU said.
  <br>
  <br>
  In June, a task force was established amid a conflict among the university's leadership, with vice-chancellor Zhang Xiang complaining that he was left in the dark about appointments made by Priscilla Wong.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the government statement, the chief executive thanked the task force “for its unremitting efforts in coordinating the HKU's internal operations, enhancing communication, assisting in resolving issues, reaching a consensus, and achieving a positive outcome”.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The group will continue its work to facilitate collaboration between the new council and the management for the continuous enhancement of the HKU's governance effectiveness."

    Auditor finds hitches with care home voucher scheme

<img alt="The auditor said welfare officials need to resolve some administrative issues with the Residential Care Service Voucher Scheme.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Audit Commission said on Wednesday that it has found a number of administrative issues with a government voucher scheme for elderly people to pay for care homes, such as incorrect charges and widely varying application processing times.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a report, the commission said more than 5,700 applications for the Residential Care
  <br>
  Service Voucher scheme were received in 2022-23 and 2023-24, and as of the end of March this year, 3,179 vouchers had been issued.
  <br>
  <br>
  Welfare officials haven't given a timeline on how long applications should take, but the auditor found it can vary greatly, from issuance the same day all the way to a wait of seven months. The average time was 43 days, it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The auditor also found that some voucher recipients were wrongly sent bills for charges that were supposed to be covered by the government, or were overcharged by homes for extra items like nutritional drinks.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Social Welfare Department is tasked with inspecting service providers, as well as carrying out visits to check various aspects of the voucher scheme, such as the fees being charged.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the auditor found that in the previous three financial years, inspections were carried out 41 days late on average, while visits were 232 days overdue. The department blamed the delays on the Covid pandemic.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[The social welfare director should] take measures to ensure that service monitoring visits and inspections are conducted in accordance with the timeframes stipulated in the department's guidelines," the commission said.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also made a series of other recommendations, such a specific timeframe for processing voucher applications and a mechanism for vetting care home charges.
  <br>
  <br>
  The department said it agreed with the recommendations and will take the necessary follow-up action.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Four people who were jailed for conspiracy to commit subversion in Hong Kong's largest national security trial to date have appealed against their convictions and sentences.
 <br>
  <br>
  Former activist Owen Chow, former lawmaker Helena Wong, former district councillor Clarisse Yeung and ex-hospital worker Winnie Yu filed their appeals to the High Court on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The hearing date has not been scheduled, according to the judiciary website.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last week, the High Court handed down jail terms to 45 people for their roles in a scheme aiming to bring down the government by organising an unsanctioned Legco primary poll, with sentences ranging from four years and two months to 10 years behind bars.
  <br>
  <br>
  The four who lodged the appeals were among those who pleaded not guilty but were convicted after trial.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chow was slapped with a jail sentence of seven years and nine months; Yu received a prison term of six years and nine months; and Wong and Yeung were each sentenced to six-and-a-half years in jail.

    Auditor urges closer scrutiny of drone registrations

<img alt="The Audit Commission says it found numerous cases of " src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1781056_1_20241127152110.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Audit Commission has urged the Civil Aviation Department (CAD) to improve its verification procedures when registering drones, after finding multiple cases of "odd data" in the system.
 <br>
  <br>
  The commission said it looked at some of the more than 24,000 drone registrations recorded via the Electronic Portal for Small Unmanned Aircraft (eSUA) as of June this year, and found numerous discrepancies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rules on flying drones in Hong Kong, such as whether permission is needed from the authorities, vary depending – among other things – on the weight of the aircraft in question.
  <br>
  <br>
  But in some cases, the recorded weight of drones registered in the database did not match the standard weight for their model and appear to have ended up in the wrong category, the commission said in a report released on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also found that while drones should have a unique serial number, dozens in the database had duplicate numbers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another issue flagged up in the report was eSUA account holders deleting their accounts without deregistering their drones.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If an eSUA account has been deleted, there may no longer be any responsible person for the valid SUA [Small Unmanned Aircraft] held under the deleted account," the commission warned.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also discovered that as of June 30, several thousand registrations were "under verification" – with more than 1,250 languishing under this status for more than two years.
  <br>
  <br>
  The commission linked this to an earlier move by the authorities to streamline the registration process by scrapping a requirement for owners to provide a photograph of the registration label attached to their drone.
  <br>
  <br>
  "While CAD has drawn up plans and taken measures to handle the SUA under verification by 30 November 2024, CAD needs to continue to closely monitor the handling of the SUA under verification and take measures to ensure that those cases will be properly followed through," the commission said.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also found that as of the end of June, the CAD had dealt with 38 cases of suspected violations of the SUA Order under the Civil Aviation Ordinance, of which 13 involved tourists.
  <br>
  <br>
  "These indicated that visitors might not be well aware of the requirements under the SUA Order. With a view to enhancing the awareness of visitors on the SUA Order, CAD needs to make sustained efforts in arranging publicity and education targeting visitors," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Director-General of Civil Aviation, Victor Liu, said he generally agrees with the commission's recommendations.

    Police investigate cause of noise barrier fire

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Wednesday launched an investigation after a six-metre-tall noise barrier along a road in Tsuen Wan caught fire.
 <br>
  <br>
  Emergency personnel were called to Cheung Pei Shan Road near Shek Wai Kok Estate when the force received multiple fire reports at about 11am.
  <br>
  <br>
  Firefighters took about half an hour to put out the flames.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officers believe the blaze began beneath a footbridge near Shek Kuk House of Shek Wai Kok Estate, before spreading to the barrier.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chief inspector Law Sai-to of the Tsuen Wan district crime unit said emergency personnel did not find any accelerant at the scene.
  <br>
  <br>
  "During our investigations, we noticed some security cameras had captured the incident. However, since the location of the incident was accessible to anyone and was frequented by residents, and due to limited distance of the security cameras, the real cause of the fire is still under investigation," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The force added that though a 40-metre stretch of the road was burnt, the noise barrier structure was not at risk of collapsing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Videos posted online showed the structure engulfed in flames. "Wow, it's burning through the top," one driver in a video remarked.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another said: "There's no way we can drive through this."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Highways Department said it aims to fully reopen the road by early Thursday.

    Help make HK a green finance hub, CE tells bankers

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Wednesday told the banking sector to gear up and help realise the government's vision of turning Hong Kong into a regional green finance hub.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a luncheon session hosted by the Hong Kong Association of Banks, Lee pointed out that the government has issued HK$220 billion worth of green and sustainable bonds since May 2019.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee said a roadmap will soon be released to guide financial institutions in meeting international sustainable standards.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the coming weeks, we will launch a roadmap on the adoption of the International Financial Reporting Standards on Sustainability Disclosure. We aspire to make Hong Kong among the world's first jurisdictions to align local requirements with international sustainability reporting requirements," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, the chief executive noted that the government is just as committed to supporting the financial sector in innovation and adopting new technologies.
  <br>
  <br>
  He cited a new subsidy scheme launched earlier this year which gives a maximum grant of HK$150,000 for each approved fintech project.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The establishment in June of a dedicated proof-of-concept subsidy scheme for green fintech makes that clear. Among other things, it will provide early stage funding support for pre-commercialised green fintech projects,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Beyond its value in green and sustainable finance, fintech can help companies tap into new technology, including AI and blockchain, to boost efficiency and stay abreast of the competition.”

<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korea’s weather agency said the capital, Seoul, was blanketed on Wednesday by the heaviest November snowfall since records began over a century ago.
 <br>
  <br>
  The snowstorm grounded hundreds of flights and disrupted commuter traffic.
  <br>
  <br>
  The agency said 20 centimetres of snow fell in northern parts of Seoul and nearby areas, compared to the city's previous record of 12.4 centimetres on November 28, 1972.

  <br>
  The storm blanketed much of the country, with the country’s central, eastern and southwestern regions seeing about 10 to 23 centimetres of snow.
  <br>
  <br>
  At least 220 flights were cancelled or delayed at airports nationwide, while authorities ordered around 90 ferries to remain at port. They also shut down hundreds of hiking trails.

  <br>
  Icy road conditions slowed down the morning commute in Seoul, while emergency workers across the country responded to fallen trees, signs, and other safety risks.
  <br>
  <br>
  The weather agency said snowfall would continue in most parts of the country until Thursday. (Agencies)

 Customs officers on Wednesday said they arrested five men and two women in a series of anti-drugs operations this month involving "space oil" and an anaesthetic called etomidate, which is illegal to posses unless prescribed by a doctor.
 <br>
  <br>
  Officers said their operations led to the seizure of space oil capsules and etomidate powder with a total estimated market value of around HK$17 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The gaining popularity of space oil or etomidate, which is currently a part one poison abused by the young people, has aroused our enforcement attention," said acting assistant commissioner Wong Ho-yin.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The success of our enforcement in November demonstrates the strong determination of Hong Kong Customs in detecting the crimes relating to illicit etomidate or space oil," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong added that etomidate can cause tremors, dizziness, hallucinations and even brain damage.

    HKU to ensure Hong Kong's doctor supply

 The head of the University of Hong Kong's medical faculty said on Wednesday that it is important to ensure that support for all medical schools will continue after the establishment of a third such institute in the city.
 <br>
  <br>
  The government said earlier that a medical school will be set up in the Northern Metropolis. So far, three universities have submitted proposals to run it.
  <br>
  <br>
  Professor Lau Chak-sing said HKU will help ensure there are enough doctors to serve the people of Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will continue to do our very best in training the best doctors with diversification, so they will not just be good in looking after patients, but also have a good understanding of disease mechanism, medical and health research, and be able to contribute to research development in Hong Kong and beyond," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lau added that the university's plan to establish a new graduate-entry medical programme can help produce the right doctors for the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have been receiving students who have completed a first degree before joining us in studying medicine [as a second bachelor's degree]. We have some experience in these students, and these students are more mature, more empathetic, and we find this is a useful development within the medical faculty," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Lau said the faculty's new clinical trial centre in Hetao which opened last week will provide a one-stop platform for training medical talent in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the centre aims to increase the standards of clinical trials by coordinating different stakeholders' needs, including the two existing medical schools, and public and private hospitals.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The institute is a common platform to facilitate clinical trials development in Hong Kong, we hope to attract industry investment in Hong Kong, attract clinical trials to be performed and conducted in Hong Kong as well as the Greater Bay Area," Lau said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that the centre will train as much talent as possible so the city's medical industry can continue to thrive.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government is proposing that landlords who rent out poor quality subdivided flats face prison terms of up to three years and fines as high as HK$300,000.
 <br>
  <br>
  Plans to regulate such cramped homes include a minimum flat size of 86 square feet, or eight square metres, with rooms having a minimum height of 2.3 metres.
  <br>
  <br>
  Documents submitted to Legco on Wednesday set out proposals for further requirements, including fire detectors and fire-resistant walls, as well as a ban on toilets being placed on balconies or outer corridors of buildings.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials say as well as proper ventilation and lighting, each subdivided flat should have its own water and electrical meters.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Housing Bureau says renting out a flat that isn't certified would also be illegal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lawmakers are due to discuss the plans on December 2, with a public consultation exercise beginning the following day and lasting until February 10.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bureau says it hopes the bill will be passed next year and that registration of subdivided flats can get underway in the final quarter.

    Aussie social media bill closer to becoming law

<img alt="Australian legislation banning social media for people under 16 is closer to reality after it passed through the country's lower house of Parliament on Wednesday. File photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1781021_1_20241127122816.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Australia on Wednesday moved closer to banning social media for children under 16 after the parliament's lower house passed the bill even as Alphabet's Google and Facebook-owner Meta pressed the government to delay the legislation.
 <br>
  <br>
  Australia's House of Representatives passed the bill 102 votes to 13 after Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's centre-left Labor government secured bipartisan support for the ban.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Senate is expected to debate the bill later on Wednesday, with the government keen to ensure it is passed by the end of the parliamentary year on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  With widespread support of the bill, analysts said this all but guarantees the legislation will pass in the Senate, where no party holds a majority of seats.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bill would make platforms including TikTok, Facebook, Snapchat, Reddit, X and Instagram liable for fines of up to 50 million Australian dollars for systemic failures to prevent young children from holding accounts.
  <br>
  <br>
  If it becomes law this week, the platforms would have one year to work out how to implement the age restrictions before the penalties are enforced.
  <br>
  <br>
  Albanese, trying to lift his approval ratings ahead of an election expected in May, has argued that excessive use of social media poses risks to the physical and mental health of children and is looking for support from parents.
  <br>
  <br>
  The planned law would force social media platforms to take reasonable steps to ensure age-verification protections are in place. Companies could be fined up to A$49.5 million (US$32 million) for systemic breaches.
  <br>
  <br>
  Opposition lawmaker Dan Tehan told Parliament the government had agreed to accept amendments in the Senate that would bolster privacy protections.
  <br>
  <br>
  Platforms would not be allowed to compel users to provide government-issued identity documents including passports or driver’s licences. The platforms also could not demand digital identification through a government system.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Will it be perfect? No. But is any law perfect? No, it’s not. But if it helps, even if it helps in just the smallest of ways, it will make a huge difference to people’s lives,” Tehan told Parliament.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some youth advocates including Australia's human rights commission raised concerns the law would hurt children's rights to self-expression, but a YouGov survey released on Tuesday showed 77 percent of Australians backed the ban, up from 61 percent in an August survey.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lawmakers who were not aligned with either the government or the opposition were most critical of the legislation during the debate on Tuesday and Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  There were criticisms the legislation had been rushed through Parliament without adequate scrutiny, would not work, would create privacy risks for users of all ages and would take away parents’ authority to decide what’s best for their children.
  <br>
  <br>
  Critics also argue the ban would isolate children, deprive them of positive aspects of social media, drive children to the dark web, make children too young for social media reluctant to report harms they encountered and take away incentives for platforms to make online spaces safer.
  <br>
  <br>
  Independent lawmaker Zoe Daniel said the legislation would “make zero difference to the harms that are inherent to social media.”
  <br>
  <br>
  “The true object of this legislation is not to make social media safe by design, but to make parents and voters feel like the government is doing something about it,” Daniel told Parliament.
  <br>
  <br>
  “There is a reason why the government parades this legislation as world-leading, that’s because no other country wants to do it,” she added. (Agencies)

    Ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah takes effect

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon took effect on Wednesday, after more than a year of fighting that has killed thousands of people.
 <br>
  <br>
  The truce, which began before dawn, should bring a halt to a war that has forced tens of thousands of people in Israel and hundreds of thousands more in Lebanon to flee their homes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel has said it will attack if Hezbollah breaks the ceasefire agreement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ceasefire calls for an initial two-month halt to fighting and requires Hezbollah to end its armed presence in southern Lebanon, while Israeli troops are to return to their side of the border.
  <br>
  <br>
  An international panel led by the United States will monitor compliance.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ceasefire does not address the war in Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel's security cabinet approved the US-France-brokered agreement after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu presented it, his office said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The war has seen swathes of Lebanon pounded by air strikes and Israeli troops deployed across the border to battle Hezbollah militants.
  <br>
  <br>
  It began with Hezbollah launching cross-border strikes in support of its Palestinian ally Hamas following its October 7, 2023 attack on Israel.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lebanon says at least 3,823 people have been killed in the country since then -- most of them in the past several weeks, when Israel escalated its campaign against Hezbollah.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the Israeli side, the hostilities with Hezbollah have killed at least 82 soldiers and 47 civilians, authorities say. (Agencies)

    Lawmaker labels new arts blueprint 'a breakthrough'

<img alt="Works by German artist Markus Lupertz on display at this year's Art Basel Hong Kong. Under the government's blueprint, the city will strive to become an East-meets-West cultural exchange hub.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A member of the government's Advisory Committee on Arts Development says a new blueprint for the sector is a big leap forward.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lawmaker Johnny Ng told Hong Kong Today's Ben Tse that the development plan was very comprehensive and could build up the city as an East-meets-West centre for international cultural exchanges, as expressed in the National 14th Five-Year Plan.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government unveiled its Blueprint for Arts and Culture and Creative Industries Development on Tuesday, with dozens of measures for the city's creative industries.
  <br>
  <br>
  It spells out four key directions, including promoting Chinese culture, building an international platform for cultural exchanges, and refining the ecosystem for creative industries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ng told RTHK that the overhaul of arts funding was a "big breakthrough" that would see greater support towards individual artists or smaller groups.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We can see that some small and medium-sized artist groups will be funded by the ADC (Arts Development Council), while the nine largest major performing arts groups will be supported by ACAD (Advisory Committee on Arts Development). I think we can see that in between, there's some mobility we can enhance in order to support individuals, small artists to get funding," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Currently, government subventions are given to nine major performing arts groups - including the Hong Kong Ballet, the Hong Kong Philharmonic Orchestra and the Chung Ying Theatre Company - and grants to small and medium arts groups.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ng said that by striving to become an East-meets-West regional arts hub, tourism and other sectors in Hong Kong would also benefit.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was hopeful that more film festivals, art auctions and art tech exhibitions could be hosted in the SAR.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The public will get to meet two pandas sent by the central government as gifts to the SAR on December 8, a day after a greeting ceremony at Ocean Park.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chief Executive John Lee said the names of the giant pandas, which arrived here from Sichuan in September, will be unveiled by officials at the ceremony, following a naming competition organised by the government.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee added that he and his wife recently visited the pandas with Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism Kevin Yeung.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We saw that the pair of giant pandas were energetic and lively," he wrote on social media.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The park told me that the pair have adapted to their new environment very quickly, and they're doing well."
  <br>
  <br>
  The pair's addition raises to six the number of giant pandas currently in the SAR, after Ying Ying gave birth to a pair of cubs in August.

 State media shrugged off US President-elect Donald Trump's pledge to slap additional tariffs on Chinese goods in editorials late on Tuesday, accusing him of blaming China for the country's failure to address the fentanyl crisis.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump, who takes office on January 20, said on Monday that he would impose "an additional 10 percent tariff, above any additional tariffs" on imports from China.
  <br>
  <br>
  Editorials in the China Daily and the Global Times focused squarely on the reason Trump gave for imposing the tariffs: fentanyl.
  <br>
  <br>
  China Daily said scapegoating others cannot end the drug crisis in the US while the Global Times urged Washington not to take China's goodwill for granted regarding anti-drug cooperation, after Trump's remarks.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The excuse the president-elect has given to justify his threat of additional tariffs on imports from China is far-fetched," China Daily said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The world sees clearly that the root cause of the fentanyl crisis in the US lies with the US itself.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There are no winners in tariff wars. If the US continues to politicise economic and trade issues by weaponising tariffs, it will leave no party unscathed."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump on Monday also pledged 25 percent tariffs on goods coming from Mexico and Canada until they clamp down on drugs and migrants crossing the border.
  <br>
  <br>
  Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said he had a "good" conversation with Trump immediately following the president-elect's announcement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We talked about how the intense and effective connections between our two countries flow back and forth," as well as "some of the challenges that we can work on together," Trudeau told reporters in Ottawa.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Canadian leader has assembled a team of ministers to lobby US lawmakers and members of Trump's inner circle, a repeat of a charm offensive during his first term as president.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum suggested on Tuesday that Mexico could retaliate with tariffs of its own.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sheinbaum said she was willing to engage in talks on the issues but said drugs were a US problem. (Agencies)

 A former inmate has credited a local charity with helping him reintegrate into society and overcome many challenges in his life.
 <br>
  <br>
  John has now become one of the ambassadors of the Sports Change Life Foundation, which provides sports companionship and mentorship to inmates, rehabilitated individuals and those facing adversity.
  <br>
  <br>
  The foundation is one of the beneficiaries of this year's Operation Santa Claus (OSC) and has organised the project "Free Running Peer Exercise Reform Plan - Join Together to Save Calories for the Warmth Campaign".
  <br>
  <br>
  The idea is that the number of calories burnt during the exercise is exchanged for food and Christmas meals to be donated to the needy.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Before, I don't believe that I can keep running for 10 kilometres. But through this kind of practice, step by step, I can break through some obstacles and make me to build up my confidence and let me to believe that I can stand up again. It's very important to me to build a positive mindset to myself that helps me to reintegrate into the society," said John (not his real name).
  <br>
  <br>
  Fundraising director Chu Ki-sum said peer-running programmes were designed to train inmates and rehabilitated individuals as ambassadors, who eventually visit schools to share their experiences, inspire youth to steer clear of drugs and crime, promote healthy values, and prevent delinquency.
  <br>
  <br>
  John added that the funding would cover expenses for professional coaching, running equipment, resources, and school visits.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For the training and also after the training we have some gathering so this gathering can build a friendship to support them and just like the guardians to help them to integrate into society," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jointly organised by RTHK and South China Morning Post, OSC funds charitable projects that focus on children and youth, the elderly, the community, those with physical and mental disabilities, medical projects, and those concerning the environment.

    Man City blow 3-0 lead, extend winless run to six

<div class="itemFullText">
 Manchester City blew a 3-0 lead to draw 3-3 against Feyenoord in a Champions League thriller on Tuesday and extend their winless run to six games.
 <br>
  <br>
  The English champions did snap a five-game losing streak, but did little to boost confidence ahead of Sunday's trip to Premier League leaders Liverpool by conceding three times in the final 15 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pep Guardiola admitted his star-studded squad were "fragile" and lacking in confidence after the worst run of his managerial career.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two goals from Erling Haaland, either side of Ilkay Gundogan's deflected effort, looked set to restore some order for City.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the defensive frailties that have been the root cause for a staggering collapse in recent weeks was exposed in the closing stages.
  <br>
  <br>
  Anis Hadj Moussa, Santiago Gimenez and David Hancko hit back to salvage a vital point for the Dutch giants.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We concede a lot of goals because we are not stable," said Guardiola. "We lost a lot of games lately – we are fragile, and of course we need a victory."
  <br>
  <br>
  "The game [at 3-0] was good for the confidence, playing at a good level and the first time something happens we have problems," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  A draw leaves City with plenty of work to do to reach the knockout stages with trips to Juventus and Paris Saint-Germain to come in their next two Champions League games.
  <br>
  <br>
  Only the top eight progress directly to the last 16 with a place in the top 24 of the 36-team table enough to reach the playoff round.
  <br>
  <br>
  City drop to 15th on eight points from five matches, just one point ahead of Feyenoord in 20th. (AFP)

<img alt="Inter Milan's Stefan de Vrij waves to fans after the match. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1780968_1_20241127072051.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Inter Milan took another step towards direct qualification for the last 16 of the Champions League with Tuesday's 1-0 win over Leipzig which moved the Italians top of the table.
 <br>
  <br>
  Castello Lukeba's own goal midway through the first half was enough for Inter to win their fourth straight match in Europe's elite club competition.
  <br>
  <br>
  Italian champions Inter lead Barcelona and Liverpool, who host Real Madrid on Wednesday, by a point after a narrow win which should have finished with a more emphatic scoreline for the hosts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Simone Inzaghi's side return to their Serie A title defence at high-flying Fiorentina on Sunday after a routine win at a far from full San Siro.
  <br>
  <br>
  Leipzig meanwhile remain on no points after a fifth defeat in as many games in the Champions League, with even qualification for the play-offs looking tricky.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Arsenal extended their revival with a ruthless 5-1 rout of Sporting Lisbon to bolster their bid to reach the Champions League last 16 on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mikel Arteta's side ended a three-match winless run in all competitions by beating Nottingham Forest 3-0 in the Premier League last weekend.
  <br>
  <br>
  Leandro Trossard netted late on to give Arsenal five away goals in a Champions League game for the first time since 2008.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal's third win in five Champions League matches this season lifted them into seventh place, with the top eight teams in the revamped tournament earning automatic qualification for the last 16.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sporting's first defeat in Europe's elite club competition this season leaves them below Arsenal on goal difference.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal are nine points behind Premier League leaders Liverpool after their dip, but this swaggering effort suggested they are finally back in the groove.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arteta had challenged Arsenal to make a statement against Sporting and they responded in emphatic fashion.
  <br>
  <br>
  The north Londoners' first away win in the Champions League in six attempts was a welcome tonic after a 1-0 loss at Inter Milan in their last European fixture.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal's impressive performance was all the more notable as Sporting had crushed Manchester City 4-1 in their final Champions League game under Ruben Amorim, who has since taken charge of Manchester United. (AFP)
