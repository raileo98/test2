<div class="itemFullText">
 Arsenal beat Manchester City 5-1 to keep their Premier League title hopes alive, while Manchester United slumped to another meek 2-0 home defeat to Crystal Palace.
 <br>
  <br>
  In the battle between the top two for the past two seasons, the Gunners prevailed to move within six points of leaders Liverpool, who have a game in hand.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is a great day for us, especially with the necessity that we had to win the game," said Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal were gifted the perfect start inside two minutes as Manuel Akanji lost possession and Kai Havertz squared for Martin Odegaard to open the scoring.
  <br>
  <br>
  Erling Haaland headed in his 250th career club goal early in the second half to bring City level.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the defending champions are a pale shadow of their former selves this season and conceded within 105 seconds of the restart when Thomas Partey's shot deflected in off John Stones.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's happened all season, we are giving away too many things," said City manager Pep Guardiola. "You cannot lose the control, it's 95 minutes. You cannot finish in the way we played."
  <br>
  <br>
  Myles Lewis-Skelly would have been suspended if his controversial red card in a 1-0 win at Wolves last weekend had not been overturned.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 18-year-old made the most of that reprieve by curling in Arsenal's third for his first goal for the club.
  <br>
  <br>
  Havertz fired low and hard into the far corner with City cut open at will by the Arsenal counter-attack on 76 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  And another Arsenal teenager rounded off the rout when Ethan Nwaneri curled home in stoppage time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Defeat leaves City still in fourth but now 15 points off the top and realistically dethroned after four consecutive seasons as champions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Jean Philippe-Mateta was Palace's hero with both goals in the second half as United suffered a fifth defeat in their last six home league games.
  <br>
  <br>
  Victory takes the Eagles above the Red Devils in the table as Oliver Glasner's side climb to 12th.
  <br>
  <br>
  Three consecutive wins for United had lifted the mood around Old Trafford but it was back to square one for Ruben Amorim after another home display lacking in creativity and riddled with defensive lapses.
  <br>
  <br>
  Palace showed no mercy to secure the three points when Daniel Muñoz charged through the middle of the home side's defence and unselfishly squared for Mateta to knock in his sixth goal in five games. (AFP)

    Rubio meets Panama leader on Trump demands for canal

<img alt="Demonstrators hold a sign that reads in spanish 'Trump XXDTM, the canal is ours' as they protest against the visit of US Secretary of State Marco Rubio in Panama City. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790012_1_20250203005810.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US Secretary of State Marco Rubio entered talks on Sunday with Panama's leader to press President Donald Trump's demand that the United States take back control of the Panama Canal.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump has refused to back down on threats to seize the vital waterway and it remains unclear what Rubio can achieve diplomatically that would please him, with Panama firmly rejecting any claims against its sovereignty.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rubio, in his first meeting abroad as the top US diplomat, walked past an honor guard outside the whitewashed walls of President Jose Raul Mulino's official residence in the tropical capital's old quarter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rubio shook hands with Foreign Minister Javier Martinez-Acha and flashed a thumbs-up sign before heading into talks with Mulino. They made no immediate comments to the press.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rubio later in the day will tour the Panama Canal, the crucial link between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans through which some 40 percent of US container traffic passes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump and Rubio claim that China has gained too much power around the canal and could shut it down in a potential conflict, with catastrophic consequences for the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters on Friday, Trump said that Panama has "totally violated" the understanding when the United States handed back the canal in late 1999.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They've already offered to do many things," Trump said Friday of Panama, "but we think it's appropriate that we take it back."
  <br>
  <br>
  Scattered protests broke out in Panama ahead of Rubio's visit, with an effigy of him in a red, white and blue suit set on fire.
  <br>
  <br>
  Diojenes Sanchez, a professor who took part in the protests, vowed to defend Panama's sovereignty.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We firmly reject the claims of the United States to turn Panama into a protectorate and colony," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Panama Canal, which Trump has dubbed as a modern "wonder of the world", was built by the United States at the cost of thousands of lives of laborers, mostly people of African descent from Barbados, Jamaica and elsewhere in the Caribbean.
  <br>
  <br>
  The United States maintained control of the canal when it opened in 1914 but began to negotiate following deadly riots in 1964 by Panamanians angered over foreign control. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Australia captain Sam Kerr is slated to face trial in London starting on Monday (February 3) on charges of racially aggravated harassment of a police officer in 2023.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chelsea forward Kerr, one of the world's most recognisable women's soccer players and a sporting idol in her home nation, was charged in January 2024, almost a year after the incident was alleged to have occurred in London.
  <br>
  <br>
  The charge relates to an incident involving a police officer on 30 January 2023 in Twickenham, the Metropolitan Police has confirmed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kerr, 31, has pleaded not guilty and the trial at Kingston-upon-Thames Crown Court is expected to last four days.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kerr is Australia's all-time top scorer. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge saw a surge in travellers over Lunar New Year, officials say, with the number passing through the Zhuhai port hitting a record high on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Border inspection authorities said 156,000 inbound and outbound passenger trips were made through that port on the third day of the Lunar New Year.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was the highest number since the facility opened in 2018.
  <br>
  <br>
  From Tuesday to Friday, more than 454,000 passenger trips were recorded through the port, marking a 22 percent increase when compared with the same period last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Transport Department warned that it expected a large number of vehicles to use the bridge between Sunday evening and the early hours of Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials in Zhuhai said people were having to wait more than 40 minutes for inspections on Sunday afternoon.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Sunday said he expects Hong Kong interest rates will remain high for some time because of the tariffs the US has imposed on China, Canada and Mexico.
 <br>
  <br>
  An executive order from US President Donald Trump on Saturday introduced an additional 10 percent tariff on Chinese imports, with a rate of 25 percent for the other two countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said the tariffs will hurt Americans more than anyone else because the extra costs incurred will be passed on to consumers.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the resulting inflationary pressures in the US will also affect Hong Kong, he warned.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If their inflation stays high, that should also affect us. Because after all, with the dollar peg, when US interest rates are high, rates in Hong Kong should also be high," Chan said on Commercial Radio.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This adds to the burden of business and affects the business environment and to a degree adds constraints to asset markets. These are things that we have to fully consider."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said the SAR government has made plans to deal with potential Trump policies, describing the president's governance style as "rather extreme at times".

    Lakers to acquire Doncic from Mavs for Davis: reports

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Lakers and Mavericks on Sunday sent the NBA world into a frenzy, with multiple US media reporting that the teams had completed a trade that will send Luka Doncic to Los Angeles and Anthony Davis to Dallas.
 <br>
  <br>
  ESPN, which first reported the news, said while the two stars are at the center of the deal, the Lakers will also get Maxi Kleber and Markieff Morris, and the Mavericks will receive Max Christie and a 2029 first-round draft pick.
  <br>
  <br>
  The media outlet reported that the Jazz are also involved in the trade and will get Jalen Hood-Schifino and a 2025 second-round draft pick via the Los Angeles Clippers from the Lakers. Dallas is also sending a 2025 second-round selection to Utah.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I believe that defense wins championships," Mavericks general manager Nico Harrison told ESPN. "I believe that getting an All-Defensive center and an All-NBA player with a defensive mindset gives us a better chance. We're built to win now and in the future."
  <br>
  <br>
  Dallas came to the Lakers offering Doncic, and Los Angeles reportedly believed that the five-time All-Star has what it takes to someday be the face of the franchise, per ESPN. For now, he will be playing alongside LeBron James, who is in his 22nd NBA season.
  <br>
  <br>
  James was not informed that such a deal was coming, and Doncic, Davis, and players and a number of coaches on both sides were also left in the dark, according to ESPN.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both Doncic and Davis are currently sidelined due to injuries, as are Kleber and Hood-Schifino. Doncic hasn't played since Christmas Day due to a strained left calf, while Davis just went down on Tuesday with an abdominal muscle strain.
  <br>
  <br>
  There is no set date for Doncic's return, but when the 25-year-old first hit the shelf, the Mavericks said he would be re-evaluated in about one month. Davis will be re-evaluated sometime next week.
  <br>
  <br>
  Doncic has averaged 28.1 points, 8.3 rebounds and 7.8 assists in 22 games (all starts) this season. He has played only for Dallas in his seven-year NBA career after being selected third overall by the Hawks in the 2018 draft. Atlanta sent his draft rights to the Mavericks in exchange for the draft rights to Trae Young.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 31-year-old Davis has put up averages of 25.7 points, 11.9 boards, 3.4 assists and 2.1 blocks across 42 games (all starts) during the 2024-25 campaign. He is a 10-time All-Star (including this season), five-time All-NBA selection and five-time All-Defensive Team selection.
  <br>
  <br>
  Before reports of the trade emerged, the Lakers were fifth in the Western Conference at 28-19, while the Mavericks were three spots below them in eighth at 26-23. (Reuters)

    Subsidies for the elderly must be retained: SoCo

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Community activists are urging Financial Secretary Paul Chan to ring-fence spending on support for elderly people and look elsewhere as he seeks to balance the books.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Society for Community Organisation (SoCo) invited lawmakers Andrew Lam, Lam Chun-sing, David Lam and Tik Chi-yuen to a sharing session on Sunday to hear public concerns about living expenses, including worries about possible changes to a scheme that allows the over 60s to use public transport for just HK$2 per trip.
  <br>
  <br>
  A man surnamed Hau, aged 64, said he hopes the government won't bump the minimum age for the subsidised fares back up to 65.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I work as a security guard. Sometimes I have to go all the way to Tuen Mun from Sham Shui Po for work. Scrapping the HK$2 subsidy would add to my burden,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I’m working hard, but I would be getting less assistance from the government. Is the government trying to encourage people not to work?”
  <br>
  <br>
  In response, Tik said the travel subsidy has boosted elderly people's social mobility.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We see more elderly people going out to work, they are volunteering in the community. This can improve their health in general, which is creating value for society. With better health, the elderly will not need to rely on the public medical system, or other social assistance that much," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  SoCo said while it understands the government needs to cut back on spending to address a budget deficit, it is important that a range of subsidies are protected, including the carer allowance and community healthcare schemes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other elderly people invited to the sharing session spoke of the financial difficulties they face, even with the subsidies provided by the government.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I skip my meals to save up money. I haven’t eaten once in the past two days," said a woman surnamed Chin.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile a woman in her seventies told the lawmakers that she struggled to look after her health while also caring for her husband who is bedbound.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I’ve been suffering from body aches [from taking care of my husband]. It's also hard for us to get to the doctor as taxis often do not want to take customers in a wheelchair. My doctor told me to get an MRI scan, but I don’t have money for that,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The woman said she is not eligible for a carer allowance of up to HK$3,000 because she gets Comprehensive Social Security Assistance and the Old Age Living Allowance.
  <br>
  <br>
  In response, Lam Chun-sing said the government should consider relaxing the eligibility requirements for the carer allowance so people in the woman's situation can receive a portion of the subsidy.

<div class="itemFullText">
 How noisy 50,000 excited football fans can get will be put to the test this week as the roof of the main stadium is retracted for the first time in a series of trial runs at the new Kai Tak Sports Park.
 <br>
  <br>
  Officials say the stadium will be packed on Tuesday for a Hong Kong Premier League U22 match between Kitchee and North District.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a press briefing on Sunday, sports commissioner George Tsoi said opening the roof will allow the Environmental Protection Department to check how much of a noise nuisance events at the stadium could potentially pose to residents of nearby areas.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that officials also want to see how opening the roof affects the experience of those inside the venue.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Last time when we had a sports event in early January, we found that the overall ambience, when the retractable roof was closed, was very good. Because when the audience were cheering for their teams, the sound effects were very good," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This time, we are going to open the retractable roof to see how the ambience, as well as other production effects, would be going on in sports events."
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities said they also want to see how easy it is for 50,000 people to leave the stadium after an event, with services on the MTR's Tuen Ma and Kwun Tong lines to be enhanced and 10 special bus services to be laid on for the test event.

    Public agree changes needed over HK$2 fares: Paul Chan

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 There is broad public agreement that changes have to be made to Hong Kong's HK$2 transport fares for the over 60s, Paul Chan said on Sunday, as he suggested healthcare and education could also be in line for government spending cuts.
 <br>
  <br>
  On a Commercial Radio programme, the financial secretary said the intentions behind the HK$2 scheme were very good, but the expenses involved have been mounting since the eligible age was lowered from the original 65.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think there's a public consensus that the current scheme isn't financially sustainable over the long run, if no changes are made to it. So how should we change it?" he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There are so many different views. We're collecting them and then officials will assess them and discuss them internally. We're all looking at different proposals in detail."
  <br>
  <br>
  With his budget speech coming up on February 26, Chan said there is room to save money in areas including education and healthcare.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said universities have relatively large amounts of reserves, adding that everyone can play their part in the next couple of years to tackle the government's budget deficit.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister said, however, that the government will minimise the effects of expenditure cuts on the public.

    'Canada will hit US with retaliatory tariffs Tuesday'

<div class="itemFullText">
 Canada will hit back at US tariffs with 25 percent levies of its own on select American goods, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Canada will be responding to the US trade action with 25 percent tariffs against Can$155 billion (US$106 billion) worth of American goods," he said in a dramatic tone as he warned of a fracture in longstanding Canada-US ties.
  <br>
  <br>
  The first round of tariffs would target Can$30 billion worth of US goods on Tuesday followed by further tariffs on Can$125 billion worth of products in three weeks.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're certainly not looking to escalate. But we will stand up for Canada, for Canadians, for Canadian jobs," Trudeau said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tariffs will apply to "everyday items" such as American beer, wine and bourbon as well as fruits, vegetables, consumer appliances, lumber and plastics, he added -- "with much, much more."
  <br>
  <br>
  US President Donald Trump earlier announced broad tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China, citing a threat from illegal immigration and drugs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Canadian exports to the United States will face a 25 percent tariff starting Tuesday, although energy resources from Canada will have a lower 10 percent levy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trudeau said the trade conflict will have "real consequences" for Canadians but also for Americans, including job losses, higher costs for food and gasoline, potential shutdowns of auto assembly plants, and impeded access to Canadian nickel, potash, uranium, steel and aluminium.
  <br>
  <br>
  He offered a reminder that Canada has been at the US's side in its "darkest hours" from the Iran hostage crisis and war in Afghanistan, to deadly natural disasters such as Hurricane Katrina and the recent California wildfires.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're always there, standing with you," Trudeau said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If President Trump wants to usher in a new golden age for the United States, the better path is to partner with Canada, not to punish us."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Unfortunately, the actions taken today by the White House split us apart instead of bringing us together."
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier, Trudeau consulted with provincial premiers, who each said afterward that they would take additional measures such as taking US booze off local store shelves and seeking to immediately diversify their trade relationships. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China said on Sunday that it "firmly opposes" new tariffs imposed on Beijing by US President Donald Trump, vowing to take "corresponding countermeasures to resolutely safeguard our own rights and interests".
 <br>
  <br>
  Unveiling sweeping measures against major trade partners on Saturday, Trump announced an additional 10 percent tariff on Chinese imports on top of existing duties.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement on Sunday, the Ministry of Commerce slammed Washington's "erroneous practices", saying Beijing was "strongly dissatisfied with this and firmly opposes it".
  <br>
  <br>
  The ministry said Beijing would file a lawsuit at the World Trade Organization, arguing that "the unilateral imposition of tariffs by the United States seriously violates WTO rules".
  <br>
  <br>
  It added that the duties were "not only unhelpful in solving the US' own problems, but also undermine normal economic and trade cooperation".
  <br>
  <br>
  "China hopes that the United States will objectively and rationally view and deal with its own issues like fentanyl, rather than threatening other countries with tariffs at every turn," the ministry said.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said Beijing "urges the US to correct its erroneous practices, meet China halfway, face up to its problems, have frank dialogues, strengthen cooperation and manage differences on the basis of equality, mutual benefit and mutual respect". (AFP)

    Straka captures narrow lead at Pebble Beach

<img alt="Sepp Straka (left) fist-bumps Russell Henley during the third round of the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am golf tournament. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1789953_1_20250202084218.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Sepp Straka birdied four of the last five holes to grab a one-stroke lead over Rory McIlroy and Shane Lowry after Saturday's third round of the PGA Pebble Beach Pro-Am.
 <br>
  <br>
  The famed oceanside layout was struck by gusting winds, heavy rains and cold conditions for much of the day but Straka rallied for a two-under 70 to stand on 16-under-par 200 while McIlroy and Lowry battled through to shoot seven-under-par 65s.
  <br>
  <br>
  Austria's Straka, who stumbled out of the lead with three bogeys to start the back nine, closed his late run with a four-foot birdie putt at the par-5 18th to regain the top spot.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was a bit of a roller coaster out there," Straka said. "Things got pretty tough. Wind. Rain. I didn't handle them too well. Struggled all day with speed on the greens because of the wind. Didn't adjust really well until the last few holes."
  <br>
  <br>
  Straka, who won his third PGA Tour title just two weeks ago at the American Express event, opened with back-to-back birdies. But his second shot at the 10th faded right over a cliff and onto the beach to start a three-bogey run.
  <br>
  <br>
  He answered with birdie putts at 14 and 15, sank a 29-foot birdie putt at the par-3 17th, then blasted out of a bunker to four feet at 18 and sank the putt.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Really proud of the way I stuck it out and came back to get some birdies coming in. Hit some really big putts."
  <br>
  <br>
  Four-time major winner McIlroy birdied three of the last four holes and 2019 British Open champion Lowry birdied three of the final five.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It got really squally around seven, eight nine 10 for us. For me to play those holes at even par was huge," McIlroy said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Then it started to settle and it's a little more sheltered on the back nine and it was nice to pick up a few birdies on the way in."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lowry had seven birdies, two bogeys and an eagle but battled conditions much of the day.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Shot a good score but it was pretty miserable out there at times," said Lowry. "It was very important to birdie the easy holes because the hard holes were really hard."
  <br>
  <br>
  England's Justin Rose and South Korea's Tom Kim each shot 68 to share fourth on 202 with Australian Cam Davis, who shot 69.
  <br>
  <br>
  Northern Ireland's McIlroy seeks his 27th career PGA Tour triumph while Irish pal Lowry seeks his fourth PGA victory and first since he and McIlroy combined for last April's pairs crown at New Orleans.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Let's hope one of us does the business," Lowry said.
  <br>
  <br>
  McIlroy hopes for a rare California triumph.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Tomorrow would be big for a lot of reasons," McIlroy said. "It's exciting to try and get my first win of the season. Historically, the West Coast hasn't been that good for me. Haven't played great at this golf course."
  <br>
  <br>
  Third-ranked McIlroy birdied four of the first eight holes to make his early charge.
  <br>
  <br>
  He dropped his approach inside three feet at the 15th and tapped in for birdie, then sank a 26-foot birdie putt at 16 to grab the lead alone.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lowry matched him with a birdie putt from just inside 17 feet at 16.
  <br>
  <br>
  McIlroy hit the week's longest drive at the par-5 18th, 346 yards, then dropped his approach just inside 35 feet and two-putted to grab the lead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lowry matched him at the top again with a birdie at 18, blasting out of a greenside bunker to just outside seven feet and sinking the putt for the last of four back-nine birdies. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Mohamed Salah scored twice to take Liverpool nine points clear at the top of the Premier League by beating Bournemouth 2-0 on Saturday, while third-placed Nottingham Forest smashed Brighton 7-0.
 <br>
  <br>
  Salah's double took him above Frank Lampard as the sixth highest goalscorer in Premier League history with 178 goals on another significant day in the Reds' charge towards a record-equalling 20th English top-flight title.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bournemouth had not lost in 12 games in all competitions and beaten Arsenal and Manchester City at home earlier this season.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Cherries can count themselves unfortunate not to have extended that run as they hit the woodwork either side of half-time through Antoine Semenyo and Marcus Tavernier.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bournemouth were also furious over the awarding of a penalty that opened the scoring on the half hour mark as Cody Gakpo appeared to clip his own heels as he entered the box rather than being tripped by Lewis Cook.
  <br>
  <br>
  VAR did not intervene to overturn referee Darren England's original decision to point to the spot and Salah ruthlessly rifled home the resulting spot-kick for his 20th Premier League goal of the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bournemouth pressed in vain for an equaliser after the break as the in-form Justin Kluivert missed two big chances either side of Tavernier's strike off the post.
  <br>
  <br>
  But one moment of magic from Salah sealed a massive three points in the title race when he cut inside onto his favoured left foot and curled into the top corner.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It feels good to be scoring goals, to be winning, but my main target this season is to win the Premier League with the team so we must keep going," said Salah, whose future at Anfield beyond this season remains unclear.
  <br>
  <br>
  Second-placed Arsenal have a mountain to climb if they are to rein in Arne Slot's men and host defending champions Manchester City on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Forest moved level on points with the Gunners thanks to a scintillating performance that blew Brighton away at the City Ground.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nuno Espirito Santo's men had been beaten 5-0 by Bournemouth last weekend but bounced back in style with Chris Wood netting a hat-trick.
  <br>
  <br>
  Morgan Gibbs-White, Neco Williams and Jota Silva were also on target for Forest after Lewis Dunk's own goal opened the floodgates.
  <br>
  <br>
  "After what happened last week, the answer was good," said Forest boss Nuno Espirito Santo. "You get punched, you get up - fantastic!"
  <br>
  <br>
  The two-time European champions are on course for a place in the Champions League as they opened up a six-point cushion on fifth-placed Newcastle, who blew the lead to lose 2-1 at home to Fulham.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jacob Murphy put the Magpies in front at St. James' Park, but Fulham hit back thanks to goals from Raul Jimenez and Rodrigo Muniz to climb up to ninth and within four points of the top six.
  <br>
  <br>
  Everton's relegation fears in their final season at Goodison Park now appear over after thrashing Leicester 4-0.
  <br>
  <br>
  Abdoulaye Doucoure opened the scoring after just 10 seconds as David Moyes enjoyed a third win in his first four games since returning as Everton boss.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beto then took advantage of some woeful Leicester defending to score twice before half-time and Iliman Ndiaye rounded off a resounding win in stoppage time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wolves climbed out of the bottom three at Leicester's expense thanks to Jean-Ricner Bellegarde's strike to beat Aston Villa 1-0.
  <br>
  <br>
  Villa, who reached the last 16 of the Champions League in midweek, have now failed to win seven consecutive times after a European game to dent their chances of returning to the competition next season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ipswich look doomed after Southampton ended their wait for a league win since November with a 2-1 victory at Portman Road.
  <br>
  <br>
  Paul Onuachu scored the winner three minutes from time for Saints, who are still 10 points adrift of safety, but move to with seven of second-bottom Ipswich. (AFP)

 Financial Secretary Paul Chan says Hong Kong is in for an exciting year filled with major events.
 <br>
  <br>
  Writing on social media after attending the Lunar New Year Cup football match at Hong Kong Stadium on Saturday night, Chan praised both sides.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said the Hong Kong Legends and World Legends teams had delivered entertaining games, featuring impressive goals.
  <br>
  <br>
  The match was drawn 3-3 at full time, but the World Legends won a penalty shoot-out 6-5.
  <br>
  <br>
  He praised the lively atmosphere at the stadium, where around 20,000 fans turned up for the game.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said the game - featuring top international players and local soccer stars - was the perfect way for local and visiting soccer fans to celebrate the Lunar New Year holiday.

 Shenzhen authorities are investigating an explosion near the Man Kam To control point on Saturday night.
 <br>
  <br>
  Officials say they believe an oxygen tank on a lorry ruptured shortly past 7:30 in the evening, causing an explosion and a fire that was caught on a video and went viral on mainland social media.
  <br>
  <br>
  No one was injured, and the fire was put out within around half an hour.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Legends football team on Saturday evening did the SAR proud by holding the World Legends team to a 3-3 draw at full-time at the Hong Kong Stadium. In an entertaining encounter - littered with errors - the World Legends team had to claw their way back from 3-1 down to spare their own blushes. They went on to win the penalty shootout by 6 goals to 5.
 <br>
  <br>
  Li Kanglian scored the first goal for the Hong Kong Legends in the 31st minute. Seven minutes later, Ryan Giggs, who had a stellar career with Manchester United in the English Premier League, tied the score at 1-1 for the World Legends. But in first-half stoppage time, Li Kanglian scored again to give the Hong Kong Legends a 2-1 lead at half-time.
  <br>
  <br>
  About 4 minutes after the break, Ju Yingzhi made it 3-1 to the Hong Kong Legends. The World Legends piled on the pressure, and in the 75th minute, Luis Garcia headed in to reduce the deficit. In the 88th minute, Luis Garcia scored again from point-blank range, and the game went to penalties.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both teams scored their first five spot-kicks and the shootout went to "sudden death." Kaka of the World Legends scored the next penalty, but Lu Junyi missed, and the World Legends took the trophy.

    Unjabbed 19-month-old boy in intensive care with flu

<img alt="The Centre for Health Protection is calling on parents to make sure their kids get vaccinated. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1789926_1_20250201204812.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Centre for Health Protection on Saturday said a 19-month-old boy is in critical condition after being infected with influenza A. He was clinically diagnosed with influenza A complicated by severe pneumonia and is still hospitalised.
 <br>
  <br>
  He has not received the seasonal influenza vaccine.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since the flu season began in Hong Kong last month, a total of nine cases of severe influenza virus infections in children have been reported. Seven of the children had not been vaccinated.
  <br>
  <br>
  The authorities say they expect influenza activity to increase further, and the activity of other respiratory infectious diseases may also increase.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Centre for Health Protection said that in this latest case, the boy had been in good health before, but has had a fever and cough since Thursday. He was taken to the Baptist Hospital for treatment yesterday and subsequently transferred to Kwong Wah Hospital.
  <br>
  <br>
  He is currently still in the paediatric intensive care unit. The boy did not travel abroad during the incubation period and his home contacts have no symptoms at the moment.
  <br>
  <br>
  The centre said that as of January 26, the seasonal influenza vaccination rate for children aged six months to under two years old was still low, at about 20.9 percent. Although it has increased slightly compared to the same period last year, it is still lower than the vaccination rate of children in other age groups.
  <br>
  <br>
  The centre again called on people who have not yet received the seasonal flu jab to take immediate action, to reduce the risk of severe illness and death. The CHP also reiterated its call for all parents to make sure their children have been vaccinated.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Housing Winnie Ho on Saturday said it is inappropriate to simply look at projected unit completion as the total supply volume for private flats.
 <br>
  <br>
  Last week, the government announced that some 107,000 private units may be available for sale in the coming three to four years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Writing on her Facebook page, Ho said she is aware of online discussions about the number being overly optimistic and that there might not be that many flats available.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho explained that the figure includes completed units that are still unsold, units currently being built, and those whose construction hasn't started yet.
  <br>
  <br>
  The housing minister stressed that the administration has been consistent in how they release data, and such information can be traced back for more than a decade to avoid confusion.
  <br>
  <br>
  She also noted that nearly 19,000 private flats had been completed each year over the past five years, saying this shows the government’s success in balancing demand and supply.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Australia thrashed Sri Lanka by an innings and 242 runs on day four of the opening test in Galle on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Electing to bat, Australia amassed 654-6 declared in their first innings to take charge of the series opener at the Galle International Stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  They bundled out Sri Lanka for 165 in the first innings with Matthew Kuhnemann (5-63) leading the rout on a spin-friendly track.
  <br>
  <br>
  Made to follow on, Sri Lanka were all out for 247 to succumb to their heaviest-ever Test defeat. Jeffrey Vandersay (53) was the top scorer for Sri Lanka before being the last man out.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nathan Lyon and Kuhnemann took four wickets apiece.
  <br>
  <br>
  The second test begins on Thursday. (Reuters)

    Rescuers build slope to reach man in Japan sinkhole

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Japanese rescuers completed building a slope on Saturday to reach a truck driver stuck in a sinkhole, officials said, four days after his vehicle was swallowed by the cavity now 40 metres wide.
 <br>
  <br>
  Rescuers have been struggling with the operation as the hole – now the length of an Olympic swimming pool – expands since opening up on Tuesday in Yashio city, on the outskirts of Tokyo.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have just completed the work on the ramp," Saitama regional governor Motohiro Ono told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rescuers will use the 30-metre slope to send heavy equipment into the hole.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are going to clear the debris and rescue the driver as soon as possible," Ono said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Soil and debris covering the cabin of the 74-year-old driver have prevented any communication with him since midday on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Groundwater leaking into the sinkhole was mostly stopped on Saturday, public broadcaster NHK reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  With the walls of the hole – around 15 metres deep, according to NHK – eroding, rescue workers are unable to stay inside it for long.
  <br>
  <br>
  The hole was initially around five metres in diameter but combined with a larger cavity that opened during the rescue operation on Tuesday night.
  <br>
  <br>
  Heavy chunks of asphalt have fallen inside, making it difficult for rescue workers and heavy machinery to go near the chasm.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 1.2 million people living in the area have been asked to cut back on showers and laundry to prevent leaking sewage from hindering the operation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Around 2,600 cases of road sinkholes in 2022 were caused by sewer pipes, according to local media. Most were small, at only 50 centimetres deep or less.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2016, a giant sinkhole around 30 metres wide and 15 metres deep appeared on a busy street in Fukuoka city, triggered by nearby subway construction.
  <br>
  <br>
  No one was hurt and the street reopened a week after workers toiled around the clock. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Two devastating wildfires in Los Angeles were declared fully contained by firefighters on Friday after burning for more than three weeks, killing about 30 people and displacing thousands more.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Palisades and Eaton fires in Southern California's Los Angeles County were the most destructive in the history of the second-largest US city, burning more than 37,000 acres (150 square kilometres) and over 10,000 homes, causing damage estimated to cost hundreds of billions of US dollars.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cal Fire, the state's firefighting agency, updated the figures on its website on Friday to show 100 percent containment of both fires, meaning their perimeters were completely under control.
  <br>
  <br>
  Evacuation orders were lifted earlier, with the fires not posing a serious threat for days.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both blazes started on January 7 and their exact cause remains under investigation.
  <br>
  <br>
  But human-driven climate change set the stage for the infernos by reducing rainfall, parching vegetation, and extending the dangerous overlap between flammable drought conditions and powerful Santa Ana winds, according to an analysis published this week.
  <br>
  <br>
  The study, conducted by dozens of researchers, concluded that the conditions fuelling the blazes were approximately 35 percent more likely due to global warming caused by burning fossil fuels.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two fires destroyed thousands of structures over more than three weeks in the affluent Pacific Palisades neighbourhood of Los Angeles and Malibu, and in the Altadena community in Los Angeles County, forcing thousands of residents to evacuate their homes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our recovery effort is based around getting people back home to rebuild as quickly and safely as possible," Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said in a statement on Friday. "We are making sure that the Palisades will be safe as residents access their properties."
  <br>
  <br>
  City police chief Jim McDonnell said the presence of law enforcement officers in the area would be "more than 10 times" what it was before the start of the fires.
  <br>
  <br>
  Private meteorological firm AccuWeather has estimated the damage and economic loss at between US$250 billion and US$275 billion. (AFP)

    Sports dispute resolution scheme to start this year

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Deputy Secretary for Justice Horace Cheung revealed on Saturday that the pilot scheme for sports dispute resolution will be rolled out in the latter half of this year.
 <br>
  <br>
  The idea was first unveiled in the Policy Address last year with the aim of promoting sports arbitration.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cheung told a television programme that the scheme will run for two to three years.
  <br>
  <br>
  While it is not mandatory for subvented sports associations to participate in the test run, he said they are highly encouraged to do so.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said he believes sports groups can improve their governance by joining the scheme.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They can show the public that when they have internal issues that cannot be resolved, they are willing to solve them through a fair and open system which has good value for money," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is not expensive and won't take much time. And it won't hinder the development of elite athletes."
  <br>
  <br>
  Cheung noted that athletes participating in the Olympics have limited time and have to undergo intensive training.
  <br>
  <br>
  If the matter is dealt with in court, the athletes will lose the chance to participate in the competition due to ongoing legal procedures, he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The deputy justice chief pointed out that the arbitration rules will be set up by the middle of the year.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the government will look for a suitable arbitration body in the coming months, which has to be experienced and have close contact with the sports industry.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government will subsidise part of the cost of arbitration during the test run, he added.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A medical jet with six Mexican nationals on board crashed into a busy Philadelphia neighbourhood on Friday, authorities said, marking another US aviation disaster after a passenger plane and a military helicopter collided mid-air in Washington earlier this week.
 <br>
  <br>
  Video footage appeared to show the twin-engine plane descending at a sharp angle towards a residential area, sparking a huge fireball upon impact and showering wreckage over homes and vehicles.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said the aircraft was a Learjet 55 – an American-French business jet – that had taken off shortly before from Northeast Philadelphia Airport bound for Branson, Missouri.
  <br>
  <br>
  The crash happened just after 6:00 pm (2300 GMT).
  <br>
  <br>
  A young girl who had been in the United States for medical care, her mother, and members of the flight and medical crews accompanying her on board were killed in the crash, said the children's hospital that had treated her.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The patient had received care from Shriners Children's Philadelphia and was being transported back to her home country in Mexico on a contracted air ambulance when the crash happened," said Mel Bower, a spokesman for Shriners Children's.
  <br>
  <br>
  All six of those on board were Mexican citizens, the country's foreign ministry said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The airline company... confirmed to the consulate that six people of Mexican nationality were travelling on the aircraft," the ministry wrote on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  The operator, Jet Rescue Air Ambulance, confirmed in a statement to US media that there were two passengers and four crew, adding, "At this time, we cannot confirm any survivors."
  <br>
  <br>
  Dozens of emergency workers were on the scene outside Roosevelt Mall, a strip mall in Northeast Philadelphia with retailers and food outlets.
  <br>
  <br>
  US President Donald Trump posted on Friday on his Truth Social platform that he was "sad" to see "more souls lost" in the Philadelphia tragedy. He praised first responders, adding: "God Bless you all."
  <br>
  <br>
  Witnesses told local TV crews that they saw body parts in or near the wreckage, as Philadelphia City Council member Mike Driscoll said he feared residents or others on the ground may have been killed.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It doesn't look good. And it's a sad situation here," he told CNN.
  <br>
  <br>
  The FAA said it was launching an investigation with the National Transportation Safety Board. (AFP)

<img alt="Victor Wembanyama nails a three-pointer during the second half. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1789894_1_20250201152458.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Victor Wembanyama scored 30 points as the San Antonio Spurs produced their highest-scoring game of the season in a 144-118 blowout against the Milwaukee Bucks on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  French prodigy Wembanyama was in superb form at both ends of the court, hauling down 14 rebounds and making six blocks while draining five-of-11 attempts from three-point range.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wembanyama received plenty of scoring support from the Spurs lineup, with all of the starting five finishing with double-digit points tallies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stephon Castle scored 20 points while Harrison Barnes added 16, with Keldon Johnson chipping in with 24 off the bench.
  <br>
  <br>
  Giannis Antetokounmpo led Milwaukee's scoring with 35 points while Damian Lillard finished with 22 points.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the headlines belonged to Wembanyama, the former number 1 draft pick who once again displayed the sort of form that has earned him a call-up to next month's NBA All-Star Game in San Francisco.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I could feel like everybody was tired of losing," Wembanyama said afterwards. "So we didn't let go the whole game. The game was consistently hard, but there wasn't a moment where we let them go on huge runs. So I hope we can get inspired by that."
  <br>
  <br>
  San Antonio's caretaker head coach, Mitch Johnson, praised Wembanyama's influence in marshalling the Spurs defence.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I thought Victor was quarterbacking the defence tonight with his communication," Johnson said. "That's another level for him. He does so many tremendous plays with his talent and unique skill set. When he starts using his voice as a skill and connecting our defence as a team – it takes it to another level."
  <br>
  <br>
  In other games on Friday, a late burst of scoring from Nikola Jokic helped the Denver Nuggets overcome a 42-point display from Tyrese Maxey to dig out a hard-earned 137-134 victory over the Philadelphia 76ers on the road.
  <br>
  <br>
  Serbian star Jokic just missed out on adding to his season tally of 21 triple-doubles, finishing with 28 points, 13 assists and nine rebounds, but helped Denver get over the line by reeling off eight points late in the fourth quarter to settle a pulsating duel that saw the lead change hands no fewer than 16 times.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nuggets guard Jamal Murray was in scintillating form for Denver, finishing with 31 points, while Michael Porter Jr added 24 points.
  <br>
  <br>
  Maxey meanwhile was left empty-handed after another talismanic performance that included making six-of-11 from beyond the arc. Guerschon Yabusele backed Maxey with 28 points, with Kelly Oubre Jr scoring 27.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Nuggets improved to 29-19 with the win and remain fourth in the Western Conference, nine games behind leaders Oklahoma City. Philadelphia fell to 19-28 and are sitting in 11th place in the Eastern Conference table, just outside the postseason places.
  <br>
  <br>
  In New Orleans, meanwhile, Jayson Tatum's jump shot with 0.2 seconds remaining handed the Boston Celtics a thrilling 118-116 victory over the Pelicans.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tatum finished with 27 points while Jaylen Brown led Boston's scoring with 28.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere, Cade Cunningham poured in 40 points to inspire the Detroit Pistons to a 117-102 defeat of the Dallas Mavericks.
  <br>
  <br>
  After rattling in 18 points in the first half, Cunningham erupted for 16 in the third quarter before adding six more in the fourth as Detroit closed out the win.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tobias Harris added 17 points while Jalen Duren finished with 16 points, 13 rebounds and five assists for Detroit, who improved to 24-24 for the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kyrie Irving with 28 points led the scoring for Dallas, who were once again without the injured Luka Doncic. The Mavs fell to 26-23 following the loss.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Charlotte meanwhile, the Los Angeles Clippers made it two wins out of two on their three-game road trip with a 112-104 defeat of the Hornets. (AFP)

    Hamas hands two more hostages over to Red Cross

<div class="itemFullText">
 Palestinian militant group Hamas handed over two Israeli hostages to the Red Cross, live television images showed on Saturday, with a third expected to be transferred later in the day.
 <br>
  <br>
  Ofer Kalderon, a French-Israeli dual national and Yarden Bibas were seen being handed over to a Red Cross official in the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis, in the latest stage of a phased exchange of hostages for Palestinian prisoners.
  <br>
  <br>
  US-Israeli dual national Keith Siegel is expected to be handed over in another location later on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bibas is the father of the two youngest hostages, baby Kfir, only 9 months old when he was kidnapped by Hamas-led gunmen on October 7, 2023, and Ariel, who was 4 at the time of the cross-border attack.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamas said in November 2023 that the boys and their mother Shiri, who was taken at the same time, were killed in an Israeli airstrike. There has been no word on them since.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel is expected to transfer 182 Palestinian prisoners and detainees, Hamas said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Saturday is also expected to see the first Palestinians travelling from Gaza to Egypt through the newly reopened Rafah crossing. It will be opened initially for 50 injured militants and 50 wounded civilians, along with the people escorting them, with a further 100 people, most likely students, probably allowed through on humanitarian grounds.
  <br>
  <br>
  Seventeen of the 33 hostages due for release in the first stage of the ceasefire have now been released in exchange for 400 Palestinian prisoners and detainees.
  <br>
  <br>
  Negotiations are due to start by Tuesday on agreements for the release of more than 60 remaining hostages and the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza in a second phase of the deal.
  <br>
  <br>
  The initial six-week ceasefire, agreed with Egyptian and Qatari mediators and backed by the United States, has so far stayed on track despite a number of incidents that have led both sides to accuse the other of violating the deal.
  <br>
  <br>
  During the attack on October 7, 2023, Hamas killed some 1,200 people and took more than 250 hostage, according to Israeli figures.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel's campaign in response has destroyed much of the densely populated Gaza Strip and killed more than 47,000 Palestinians, according to Palestinian health authorities. (Reuters)

    University fees rise won't hurt competitiveness: Choi

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Education Secretary Christine Choi said on Saturday that a rise in school fees will not hurt the competitiveness of the SAR’s universities.
 <br>
  <br>
  Starting the next academic year, the government will hike the current tuition fees of HK$42,100 for eight public universities by just under 18 percent in phased increases over three years.
  <br>
  <br>
  The fees have been frozen for almost three decades.
  <br>
  <br>
  Choi told an RTHK radio programme that she believes the move will not affect the universities’ teaching, research and attractiveness.
  <br>
  <br>
  “For most of the time, apart from relying on government funding as their source of income, the institutions have also had donations. And besides undergraduate programmes, they've taught postgraduate programmes which consist of more self-financing students,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Universities have different sources of income. Of course, funding will have some impact on them. But we note that they also have relatively sound reserves or financial management.”
  <br>
  <br>
  She said the institutions will have sufficient time to make arrangements.
  <br>
  <br>
  Choi also revealed that the government has no plan to gradually increase the tuition fees of non-local students until it's recovered all costs.
  <br>
  <br>
  She noted that Singapore is charging non-local students between HK$100,000 and HK$200,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  Choi said that if the SAR hiked fees to more than HK$300,000, local universities will not be able to attract top talent.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Preliminary figures for the Lunar New Year point to a rebound in tourist numbers, including overseas visitors.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Tourism Board said on Saturday that Hong Kong attracted close to 680,000 tourists from Tuesday to Friday, a 6 percent year-on-year increase.
  <br>
  <br>
  The board's executive director Dane Cheng told a Commercial Radio programme that the percentage increase for overseas visitors was even better.
  <br>
  <br>
  “From Lunar New Year Eve to Thursday, there was a 12 percent year-on-year increase. People might feel that the vibe is better because most of them congregated in the tourist hot spots,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I hiked to the Peak with my family [on Friday], and it was super crowded. There were people in every mall and restaurant, and the Peak tram station was packed with people.”
  <br>
  <br>
  There were more than 560,000 mainland visitors in the first four days of their eight-day Golden Week holiday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cheng said he expects more mainlanders to visit Hong Kong in the coming days, noting many of them might have been spending time with their families earlier in the holiday.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also noted that about half of the inbound tourists stayed overnight, and most hotels were nearly fully booked

    Border travel smooth over Lunar New Year: CS

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Secretary Eric Chan said on Saturday that things went smoothly at the border crossings during the Lunar New Year holiday, despite changes from last year's travel arrangements.
 <br>
  <br>
  Unlike last year, border checkpoints at Lo Wu and Shenzhen Bay didn't extend their hours, leaving Lok Ma Chau/Huanggang Port and the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge Port to operate around-the-clock.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan told a Commercial Radio programme that officials had acted to ensure smooth travel arrangements for tourists heading back to the mainland.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Even though we didn't operate some border points right through the night, we were concerned that some people might think Lo Wu was still open after midnight, and take the train. So we made announcements on the trains to keep them informed, and in Sheung Shui, we arranged an overnight shuttle bus going to the border checkpoints that did remain open all night,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan also said he'd heard anecdotal evidence from the hotel sector and retailers that business is going well.
  <br>
  <br>
  He urged Hongkongers to stay in the SAR to spend, saying they can also find cheap and good quality options here.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the government had earlier partnered with five restaurant chains - Fairwood, Cafe de Coral, Tai Hing, Maxim's, and McDonald's - to distribute food coupons to about 50,000 elderly people through 214 elderly centres across Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  Each of them will receive five coupons, allowing them to buy designated meals at a discounted price of HK$25.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said the feedback has been positive so far, and he hopes it will motivate more isolated seniors to leave their homes and engage with the community.

 The Tourism Bureau said the Travel Industry Authority is working with Miramar Travel to help relatives of a male tour guide who died in a traffic accident in Shanghai on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The coach was taking a 16-member tour group to Shanghai Pudong International Airport when the accident occurred.
  <br>
  <br>
  Miramar general manager Alex Lee said the travel agency would not speculate on the cause of the incident, which is under investigation.

  "We've already contacted his family. Only one of them was in a position to go to Shanghai, but their mainland travel permit had expired," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Immigration Department is helping us to find a way to help the family member. Our company will also send a staffer to travel to Shanghai with his family."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee said all members of the six-day tour group have now returned to the SAR, including two who felt unwell and had undergone medical tests in a hospital in Shanghai.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that as far as he knew, no one had been arrested in relation to the incident.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Immigration Department said it's reached out to the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office in Shanghai, as well as the Travel Industry Authority, and would follow up on the case.

<img alt="Nvidia's chief executive, Jensen Huang, has discussed semiconductors and AI policy during a meeting at the White House. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1789865_1_20250201081117.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Jensen Huang, the CEO of AI chip giant Nvidia, on Friday met with President Trump as the company suffered a rough week on Wall Street over competition with China and the threat of tariffs on semiconductors.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump said he would be putting tariffs on imports of computer chips to the United States, which will punish Nvidia's business that depends on imported components, mainly from Taiwan.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was a good meeting, but eventually we're going to put tariffs on chips," Trump told reporters afterwards.
  <br>
  <br>
  High-end versions of Nvidia's chips face US export restrictions to the major market of China.
  <br>
  <br>
  That policy came under scrutiny this week when Chinese startup DeepSeek achieved widespread adoption of its latest AI model that was developed without access to Nvidia's export-blocked H100 chips.
  <br>
  <br>
  After the DeepSeek breakthrough, US media reported that the Trump administration was exploring ways to expand the restrictions to Nvidia's lower end chips.
  <br>
  <br>
  The DeepSeek model triggered a plunge in Nvidia's stock Monday, wiping out nearly US$600 billion in market value -- Wall Street's largest single-day loss ever.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We appreciated the opportunity to meet with President Trump and discuss semiconductors and AI policy," an Nvidia spokesperson said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Jensen and the president discussed the importance of strengthening US technology and AI leadership."
  <br>
  <br>
  Huang, whose company has become one of the world's most valuable firms on the back of the AI frenzy, was notably absent from Trump's January 20 inauguration.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk, who is a close advisor and major Trump donor, were given a central place during ceremonies and events, and contributed to the president's inauguration fund. (AFP)

<img alt="France's Leo Barre is too fast for Wales' Gareth Thomas. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1789862_1_20250201080120.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Antoine Dupont marked his return to Six Nations duty in style as he underlined his billing as the ultimate all-round rugby player by helping France to a crushing 43-0 victory over Wales in Paris on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Dupont missed last year's championship as he battled for a place on France's rugby sevens squad for the Paris Olympics.
  <br>
  <br>
  Needless to say, he made the side and duly scored a brace of tries in the final as France hit gold at their home Games.
  <br>
  <br>
  It silenced many critics who'd been quick to question the Toulouse scrum-half's decision to favour 7s over the national 15s team.
  <br>
  <br>
  In addition to his Olympic success Dupont last year won a French Top 14 and Champions Cup double with club Toulouse and guided France to an unbeaten November series.
  <br>
  <br>
  Against Wales on Friday, Dupont showcased the whole array of his playing abilities, from doughty defence to sniping attack, proving a thorn in the visitors' side at any opportunity.
  <br>
  <br>
  He darted over the tryline after taking a quick penalty early on, but was held up.
  <br>
  <br>
  Defence was next, a perfectly-timed man-on-ball tackle on Nick Tompkins snuffing out a potential Welsh attack.
  <br>
  <br>
  Then came an incredible assist, a pin-perfect cross-field kick for unmarked winger Theo Attissogbe in full play.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That is sublime from the world's greatest player," said BBC Radio Wales commentator Gareth Rhys Owen.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dupont turned provider once more for Attissogbe.
  <br>
  <br>
  A smart break saw Dupont break the defensive line, stepping outside Liam Williams and throwing out a looped pass to the winger for an easy run in.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You are kidding me, this guy can do it all!" was Welsh radio's response.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Magnifique!" retorted the French.
  <br>
  <br>
  A grubber through by Dupont almost saw left winger Louis Bielle-Biarrey threaten the line before a knock-on.
  <br>
  <br>
  But then, on the stroke of half-time, Dupont showcased his vision.
  <br>
  <br>
  One glance up from the base of a ruck and he threw out a 20-metre pass to Bielle-Biarrey for a simple touchdown.
  <br>
  <br>
  Three brilliant assists to set up three tries helped France motor into a 28-0 half-time lead, much to the delight of the Stade de France crowd.
  <br>
  <br>
  Remarkably for Dupont, it was his 37th try assist in 56 Test matches.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was also the second time he's managed a hat-trick of try assists in a Six Nations match, after having four against Italy in 2021. It took Dupont to 20 assists in the Championship, with only veteran Ireland scrum-half Conor Murray having more.
  <br>
  <br>
  Linking up with Toulouse teammate Romain Ntamack, making his first France start in 17 months after a string of injuries, Dupont thrived, with Thomas Ramos also linking in well from full-back.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dupont's run-out came to an end as France coach Fabien Galthie made six replacements in the 49th minute, eager to keep his star player's powder dry for sterner challenges to come.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We adapted to their defence, we put pressure on them, we adapted to what they offered us," Dupont said of the Welsh.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With the players we have, we were able to have the extra man right away and we were able to have answers."
  <br>
  <br>
  Turning to an away trip against England next weekend, Dupont said: "They've had some complicated results, they lost some of their matches in November, but we will take the games one by one.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They have a squad which is gaining momentum. We know what it is like to go and play at Twickenham. But the Championship is long, it was important to start well today." (AFP)

    Trump announces tariffs for China, Canada and Mexico

<img alt="Donald Trump has repeatedly threatened to impose tariffs on his return to the White House. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1789863_1_20250201080440.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 President Trump will implement tariffs on Saturday on the three largest US trading partners -- Canada, Mexico and China -- saying there was nothing they could do to forestall him while vowing further levies on various industries.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump has reiterated his plans for 25 percent tariffs on imports from neighboring Canada and Mexico, accusing them of failing to crack down on illegal migrants crossing the US border and on the flow of fentanyl.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also threatened a 10 percent duty for Chinese goods on the same day - also over the drug.
  <br>
  <br>
  White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt affirmed on Friday that the tariffs would be imposed from Saturday, February 1.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Both Canada and Mexico have allowed an unprecedented invasion of illegal fentanyl that is killing American citizens, and also immigrants into our country," she told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  She did not commit to exemptions on sectors, and rejected warnings that this would spark a trade war.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beyond the three countries, Trump told reporters in the Oval Office on Friday that tariffs on oil and gas could arrive around February 18.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Eventually we're going to put tariffs on chips, we're going to put tariffs on oil and gas," he said, without specifying which countries he would target.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also vowed to impose higher duties on steel and aluminium, and eventually copper imports.
  <br>
  <br>
  Washington was "absolutely" going to impose tariffs on the European Union in the future as well, Trump said, adding that the bloc "has treated us so terribly."
  <br>
  <br>
  Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau vowed an "immediate response" if Trump acted, while Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said her government was in close contact with Trump's administration.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has not specified tools he would use, though analysts suggest he could tap emergency economic powers, which allow the president to regulate imports during a national emergency.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing has rejected accusations of complicity in the fentanyl trade. Canada has also countered that below one percent of undocumented migrants and fentanyl entering the United States comes through its northern border.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some analysts believe tariff threats are a bargaining chip to accelerate the renegotiation of the existing trade deal, known as USMCA, between the United States, Mexico and Canada.
  <br>
  <br>
  But tariff hikes on the trading partners would likely prove a major shock, shaking up supply chains. (AFP)

    US markets fall on news of planned tariffs

<img alt="Wall Street ended lower, with investors unsettled by news of tariffs against China, Mexico and Canada. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1789861_1_20250201075532.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US markets retreated on Fridayafter the White House reaffirmed plans to introduce new tariffs against Mexico, Canada and China beginning February 1.
 <br>
  <br>
  US equities had spent much of the day in the black after Apple results and US inflation data that met expectations.
  <br>
  <br>
  But in a briefing on Friday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said tariffs against the three US trading partners would be imposed on Saturday, adding: "These are promises made and promises kept by the president."
  <br>
  <br>
  "The tariff talk in the afternoon injected a new wave of uncertainty," Briefing.com's Patrick O'Hare told AFP.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We think it just kind of proved to be a bit of a trigger for people to take some money off the table going into the weekend," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 0.8 percent at 44,544.66, the S&P 500 lost 0.5 percent to finish at 6,040.53 and the Nasdaq Composite eased 0.3 percent to 19,627.44.
  <br>
  <br>
  AI-related stocks, particularly key chipmaker Nvidia, had plunged early in the week after China's DeepSeek unveiled an artificial intelligence model rivalling those of American tech giants but developed at a fraction of the cost.
  <br>
  <br>
  Markets later clawed back most of those losses thanks to encouraging earnings and company strategy updates, and as some investors re-evaluated the risks US firms face from Chinese competition.
  <br>
  <br>
  Financial markets also digested the latest US inflation data, with the Federal Reserve's favourite inflation gauge, the Personal Consumption Expenditures index, accelerating for a third month in a row, reaching 2.6 percent in December as expected.
  <br>
  <br>
  "While there's still further progress to be made on inflation, investors can breathe a sigh of relief and refocus on the market's more notable fundamentals, like earnings growth and the economy," said Bret Kenwell, US investment analyst at the eToro trading platform.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier, London's benchmark FTSE 100 hit fresh highs, helped by an almost 12 percent surge in the share price of Smiths Group after the British engineering company said it planned to streamline its business and return substantial sums to shareholders.
  <br>
  <br>
  Paris and Frankfurt ended little changed as early rises fizzled. European stocks had one of their best months in two years in January with Europe-wide indexes rising six percent since the start of 2025.
  <br>
  <br>
  Data showed German inflation unexpectedly slowed in January, the first decline in months, bolstering the case for further rate cuts by the European Central Bank.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ECB cut rates on Thursday, its fifth reduction since June.
  <br>
  <br>
  Concerns over Trump's trade tactics pushed gold to new records above US$2,800 an ounce.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The gold price is proving its haven credentials, as investors choose it to hedge fears about Trump's tariff threats," said Kathleen Brooks, research director at XTB.  (AFP)

    Green projects affecting Arctic's Sami people: Amnesty

<img alt="A Sami woman from the Vilhelmina Norra Sameby, observes the movement of the reindeers. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1789842_1_20250131222318.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Climate change and efforts to curb it by moving away from fossil fuels are both threatening the rights and livelihood of Sami indigenous people in the Arctic, Amnesty International said on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  There are about 100,000 Samis, considered Europe's last indigenous population, many of whom live from traditional reindeer herding, which requires vast open spaces.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the expansion of infrastructure for renewable energy production and mineral extraction is hindering their ancestral ways of living, said the report, which Amnesty International drafted in partnership with the non-governmental Sami Council.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Climate change threatens the culture and existence of the Sami indigenous people in two ways," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Firstly, through direct environmental impacts such as changing weather conditions and ecosystems, and secondly, through the increasing number of energy projects and resource extraction... in the name of 'green' development and 'clean' energy transition."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Samis and their migratory herds are spread across the vast open spaces of Arctic Finland, Norway, Russia and Sweden.
  <br>
  <br>
  The report - entitled "Just transition or 'green colonialism'?" - takes the example of the Fosen wind farms in Norway, where 151 turbines were installed on what opponents said was traditional reindeer habitat.
  <br>
  <br>
  Norway's Supreme Court later ruled that the construction of the turbines was illegal, since it had no valid licences, and that it was violating Sami people's rights as granted by the United Nations.
  <br>
  <br>
  The case triggered a vast mobilisation of environmental and Sami activists, who demanded the turbines be demolished.
  <br>
  <br>
  It ended with a financial settlement with herders.
  <br>
  <br>
  The report highlighted other conflicts surrounding mine projects in the Swedish village of Ronnbac, and in Kasivarsi, Finland - both of which threatened reindeer herding, it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Amnesty and the Sami Council urged authorities in Nordic countries to increase consultations with Sami populations and seek their agreement before granting any new infrastructure projects that could infringe on their rights.
  <br>
  <br>
  These disputes add to the direct effects of climate change, which in the Arctic manifest themselves three or four times faster than elsewhere in the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among other challenges, temperatures are rising, with "frequent temperatures around 0 degrees Celsius".
  <br>
  <br>
  If rain falls on existing snow, it freezes and forms an ice crust over the surface, meaning reindeer cannot reach lichen, their main food source.
  <br>
  <br>
  Early ice melting means river crossings are not covered by sufficiently solid ice or are flooded, making herding and reindeer migration perilous or even impossible. (AFP)

 Reigning champions Real Madrid will face 2023 winners Manchester City in the plum tie of the play-off round of this season's Champions League, following Friday's draw.
 <br>
  <br>
  It is the fourth year running in which the sides have been drawn against each other in a knockout tie, with Real emerging victorious in a penalty shoot-out in the quarter-finals last season.
  <br>
  <br>
  City, who scraped through after finishing 22nd in the league phase in this first season of the new format for Europe's elite club competition, will be at home in the first leg before going to Spain for the return.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere, Celtic will face six-time European champions Bayern Munich, after the Scottish champions reached the knockout stage for the first time in 12 years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Paris Saint-Germain will play surprise package Brest in an all-French tie, while Juventus play PSV Eindhoven and Feyenoord take on AC Milan in two ties between former winners of the competition.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last season's Europa League winners Atalanta, who finished one place outside the top eight which offered a direct path to the last 16, will face Club Brugge of Belgium.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sporting of Portugal were drawn against last season's runners-up Borussia Dortmund, while Monaco will take on Benfica having lost at home to the Portuguese club in the league phase.
  <br>
  <br>
  The play-off ties will take place next month, with the eight winners going through to the last 16 along with the eight highest-placed sides from the league phase.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool, Barcelona, Arsenal, Inter Milan, Atletico Madrid, Bayer Leverkusen, Lille and Aston Villa are the sides already through to the last 16. (AFP)

 Moscow on Friday accused Ukrainian troops of killing 22 people in an occupied Russian village, including eight women who were allegedly raped before being executed.
 <br>
  <br>
  Ukraine controls dozens of border settlements in the Kursk region of western Russia since launching a surprise offensive in August and says about 2,000 civilians still live in areas it occupies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Russia has now retaken several towns.
  <br>
  <br>
  Russia's Investigative Committee had said on January 19 it was investigating the killing of "at least seven civilians" in the village of Russkoye Porechnoye, about 20 kilometres from the Ukrainian border.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Friday, it said it was now investigating the killing of "22 residents" between September and November.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among the victims, whose bodies were found in the basements of several homes, were eight women who were allegedly raped before being killed, the Investigative Committee said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov accused the international community of ignoring Russia's claims.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This must be talked about, shown, despite all the deafness of the international community and its unwillingness to pay attention to such atrocities," he told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Russian investigators said five Ukrainian soldiers carried out the killings and that one of them, Yevgeny Fabrisenko, was arrested during the fighting in the Kursk region.
  <br>
  <br>
  The committee released a video of the interrogation of a man identified as Fabrisenko, who confessed.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a briefing on Friday, Russia's foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said: "First, people were tortured, abused, then killed either by being shot or blown up."
  <br>
  <br>
  Russia and Ukraine have accused each other of killing civilians since the conflict began nearly three years ago. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The nation saw a surge in domestic trips on Friday as most people continued to travel to tourist attractions and visit their family on the 18th day of the 40-day Spring Festival.
 <br>
  <br>
  Around 11.8 million railways trips are expected to be made on Friday nationwide, and authorities have arranged an additional 545 trains to cater to the growing demand.
  <br>
  <br>
  As of Thursday, the total number of passenger trips made by train had surpassed 200 million during the Spring Festival travel rush, which began January 14.
  <br>
  <br>
  The holiday marks the world's largest human migration, each year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The first panda-themed special train of the Year of the Snake was launched on Friday morning.
  <br>
  <br>
  It features cultural heritage experiences, like skilled craftsmen aboard to showcase Yi ethnic hand-painted lacquer art, paper cutting, and other traditional crafts to passengers.
  <br>
  <br>
  The train - departing from the home of giant pandas in Chengdu - passes through various scenic spots along the route before it arrives at the "space city" Xichang.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities called on travellers to remain alert as travel disruptions are likely to happen in northwest and northeast China due to another round of rain and snow. (CCTV)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The racecourse has rolled out the red carpet for tens of thousands of people on Friday for the Chinese New Year Raceday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Some 86 thousand revellers came to Sha Tin Racecourse, according to the Jockey Club, including record high numbers of tourists from the mainland and overseas.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism, Rosanna Law, was in attendance and said she was delighted to see such a high turnout.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among the crowd was an Italian tourist, who told an RTHK reporter that he's thrilled to experience the unique horse racing culture in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's amazing. Lots of lights, sounds, crowds everywhere. It's similar but quite different because it's not so famous and popular in Italy. [Only] a few people follow horse racing."
  <br>
  <br>
  Another tourist from Canada said he enjoyed the festive atmosphere, including special Chinese New Year features and installations.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There's a Jockey simulator. That's one that I really wanted to do. We took pictures with the guy who's giving out candies. It's a very nice event and there's a lot of different things for Chinese New Year that make it truly special," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Law also told reporters that 216,000 travellers set foot in the SAR on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  A majority of them, or more than 187,000 were visitors from the mainland.
  <br>
  <br>
  This Lunar New Year marks the first since the government resumed the three percent hotel accommodation tax on January 1, after it had been suspended since July, 2008.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tourism minister said the tax is here to stay, as people have adapted to the measure before.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We've charged the three percent hotel accommodation tax before. As long as visitors have fun in Hong Kong, and think that it's good value for money, the three percent tax won't have too much of an impact on them."
  <br>
  <br>
  She noted that with many hotels reaching an occupancy rate of 100 percent these days, it showed that visitors were attracted by Hong Kong's festive spirit.
  <br>
  <br>
  Financial Secretary Paul Chan was also at the Sha Tin racecourse to officiate the opening ceremony with Law.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Jaren Jackson Jr. sank two free throws with 8.6 seconds remaining to lift the Memphis Grizzlies to a 120-119 victory over the visiting Houston Rockets on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Houston had an opportunity to win at the buzzer, but Fred VanVleet missed a 3-point attempt.
  <br>
  <br>
  Desmond Bane led the Grizzlies with 24 points, 12 rebounds and six assists. Luke Kennard scored 22 points, and Jackson finished with 21. Memphis ended the contest on a 13-4 run to register its seventh win in eight games.
  <br>
  <br>
  Houston, which had its four-game win streak end, got 25 points, six rebounds and five assists from Jalen Green. Dillon Brooks contributed 22 points and Amen Thompson had 21 points, seven rebounds, four assists and four blocks.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Rockets were seeking their first series sweep of the Grizzlies since 2009-10, having won the prior three matchups this campaign.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a matchup of two of the Western Conference's top three teams, the game featured 14 ties and 13 lead changes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Key starters for both teams - Grizzlies guard Ja Morant and Rockets All-Star Game selection Alperen Sengun - did not play. Morant, sidelined by right shoulder soreness, sat out for the 20th time this season. Sengun, who has a left calf contusion, missed a game for the first time in 2024-25.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trailing by 10 entering the third quarter, the Grizzlies opened the period on an 8-0 run powered by consecutive 3-pointers from Kennard. Using that momentum, Memphis chipped away at the Houston lead and eventually took a brief advantage at 79-78 on a shot by Santi Aldama.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Rockets recovered to pull ahead 96-92 at the end of the quarter.
  <br>
  <br>
  After giving up 38 points in the opening quarter and falling behind by seven in the second, the Grizzlies had difficulty closing the gap. Houston, which made eight 3-pointers in the first half, extended its advantage to 66-55 in the closing minutes of the second period and led 66-56 at the half.
  <br>
  <br>
  Green had three 3-pointers in the first half and 15 points, while Thompson added 14.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bane and Jackson topped Houston with 12 first-half points apiece. (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The police commissioner on Friday warned the public to be on guard, amid a rise in investment scams in recent months, with most cases involving cryptocurrency.
 <br>
  <br>
  Raymond Siu revealed that the frauds usually begin with fake romances - scammers would show concern for their target before providing them with a link.
  <br>
  <br>
  He emphasised the cases were too good to be true, and the public should never fall for them.
  <br>
  <br>
  The police chief also said there had been a surge in cases in which scammers pretended to be mainland officials.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Whenever the caller claims to be an official from the mainland, and says he - or she - is investigating a case etc, you can actually hang up immediately," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Even if they don't ask for money, you can hang up right away. These must be scams."
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that the force is working to roll out more measures to combat scams targetting students from the mainland, and hopes to intercept the cases at sources.

    Worshippers flock to Che Kung Temple for good fortune

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Worshippers on Friday flocked to Che Kung Temple in Sha Tin to pray for good fortune and prosperity in the Year of the Snake.
 <br>
  <br>
  According to Chinese traditions, people tend to avoid visiting family and friends on the third day of the Lunar New Year when quarrels are believed to be more likely.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police implemented crowd control measures as devotees queued to offer prayers and buy pinwheels, a traditional blessing item at the temple.
  <br>
  <br>
  One worshipper told RTHK that she's there to pray for good health.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The crowd seems smaller compared to last year, probably because many people are travelling abroad or up north," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  A pinwheel vendor who usually prices the items at HK$68 said sales are down by 60 to 70 percent compared to previous years.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was upbeat about the SAR's economic prospects, comparing the city to a phoenix.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I hope Hong Kong will thrive and return to its former glory. After all, Hong Kong is a phoenix that never dies. It's normal to have ups and downs," he said.

    HK sees a smaller rise in outbound tours over LNY
   </title>

<img alt="" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1789786_1_20250131105710.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Tourism Association said on Friday that even though the city saw a rise in outbound tour groups over the Lunar New Year holiday, it was smaller than the increase in 2024 when the city celebrated the festival for the first time since the lifting of Covid restrictions.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on an RTHK radio programme, executive director Timothy Chui said many of the tours were destined for Japan and South Korea.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said a flight was scheduled to Japan every 15 minutes, joking that it was even more frequent than buses.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chui said there were two factors leading to the change in the increment of tour groups.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[First] this Lunar New Year holiday and the Christmas holiday are just separated by about 20 days, which is very close," he explained.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Second, last year there was [so-called] 'revenge spending'. Customers signed up for tours. They didn't ask about prices, they just wanted to know if tours were available and how many vacancies there were. But this year, they've been comparing packages on offer - and prices."
  <br>
  <br>
  He said tour prices were similar to last year, except for those heading to the Greater Bay Area that cost slightly more.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chui revealed while usually only around 500 tours were bound for the mainland on the weekend, a daily 600 to 800 tour groups had set off for the mainland in the past few days.
  <br>
  <br>
  As for incoming tour groups, he said those staying overnight accounted for 50 percent of the total number of visitors.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chui said the number of mainlanders entering the SAR through the Shenzhen Bay port on Lunar New Year's Eve had surged by about 43 percent year-on-year. He said the increase was mainly due to the resumption of multi-entry permits for Shenzhen residents.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that hotels were almost 100 percent full between Lunar New Year's Eve and Saturday, and the figure will only start to come down next Monday and Tuesday.

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Trump -- speaking as the bodies of 67 people were pulled from Washington's Potomac River -- on Thursday blamed diversity hires for the midair collision between an airliner and a military helicopter.
 <br>
  <br>
  Officials confirmed the deaths of all those aboard both aircraft, and also cited pilot error on the helicopter in the nighttime crash. The Chinese Embassy in the United States said two Chinese citizens were among the victims.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump opend fire at what he said were left-wing diversity practices under his Democratic predecessors Joe Biden and Barack Obama that he claimed kept out good employees at the Federal Aviation Administration.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I put safety first. Obama, Biden and the Democrats put policy first," Trump said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They actually came out with a directive: 'too white.' And we want the people that are competent."
  <br>
  <br>
  Wreckage of the Bombardier jet operated by an American Airlines subsidiary protruded from the river surface, surrounded by emergency vessels and diving teams. It had been carrying 64 people.
  <br>
  <br>
  The army Blackhawk helicopter, which had three soldiers aboard, was also in the river.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are now at a point where we are switching from a rescue operation to a recovery operation," Washington Fire Chief John Donnelly said. Twenty eight bodies had already been found.
  <br>
  <br>
  The collision -- the first major crash in the United States since 2009 when 49 people were killed near Buffalo, New York -- occurred late evening on Wednesday as the airliner came into land at Reagan National Airport after a routine flight from Wichita, Kansas.
  <br>
  <br>
  Reagan National is a major airport located a short distance from downtown Washington, the White House and the Pentagon. The airspace is extremely busy, with civilian and military aircraft a constant presence.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dramatic audio from air traffic controllers showed them repeatedly asking the helicopter if it had the passenger jet "in sight," and then just before the crash telling it to "pass behind" the plane.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump opened his press conference by speaking of the nation's "anguish" and said that the investigation would take time.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, he then launched into an extended broadside against so-called diversity, equity and inclusion policies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump -- who began his presidency a week ago with an onslaught against decades-old measures aimed at preventing sexism and racism in the United States -- singled out Biden's openly gay transport secretary Pete Buttigieg.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He's run it right into the ground with his diversity," Trump said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Buttigieg responded on X, calling Trump "despicable."
  <br>
  <br>
  "As families grieve, Trump should be leading, not lying," he said. (AFP, Xinhua)

    Mainland competitors bite into Apple in China

<img alt="The Americas are still Apple's largest market, while iPhone sales slipped in markets like mainland China. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1789785_1_20250131104950.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Apple on Thursday said revenue hit US$124.3 billion in the year-end holiday quarter, but sales growth missed market expectations as the iPhone faces stiff competition, particularly in China.
 <br>
  <br>
  Apple logged US$36.3 billion in profit in what chief executive Tim Cook called its "best quarter ever."
  <br>
  <br>
  Revenue growth was powered by Apple's service and digital content unit, with iPhone sales slipping in markets like mainland China where they totalled US$18.5 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Overall iPhone sales in the quarter were US$69.1 billion, about US$500 million less than it took in for handsets in the same period a year earlier, according to an earnings release.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our record revenue and strong operating margins drove (earnings per share) to a new all-time record with double-digit growth," said Apple chief financial officer Kevan Parekh.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are also pleased that our installed base of active devices has reached a new all-time high across all products and geographic segments."
  <br>
  <br>
  In the quarter, Apple's services segment -- which includes Apple Music, iCloud, the App Store, and Apple TV+ -- reported revenue of US$26.3 billion, compared to US$23.1 billion in the same period a year earlier.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Americas remained Apple's largest market with US$56.2 billion in revenue, while Europe showed strong growth at US$33.9 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  "On the Apple intelligence side, we have not rolled out in China," Cook said on an earnings call.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We did see better results in the markets that we had rolled Apple Intelligence out in than markets we hadn't; and, of course, it's the most competitive market in the world."
  <br>
  <br>
  Investors are eyeing demand for new iPhones with artificial intelligence features, especially after Apple stumbled with the technology.
  <br>
  <br>
  Apple Intelligence is a new suite of software features for all devices that was announced at the company's annual developers conference, where it also announced a partnership with ChatGPT-maker OpenAI.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the short-term, the new powers include AI-infused image editing, translation, and small, creative touches in messaging, but not more ambitious breakthroughs promised by other AI players, such as OpenAI or Google.
  <br>
  <br>
  "While the company's cautious approach to AI rollout has drawn criticism, robust services growth and ecosystem expansion are providing crucial momentum to help ease its continued iPhone struggles in China," said Emarketer analyst Jacob Bourne.
  <br>
  <br>
  "However, Apple needs to accelerate its Apple Intelligence deployment and be a bit more aggressive in emerging areas like smart glasses development to maintain an innovative edge."
  <br>
  <br>
  Apple pushed out a software update in mid-January which disabled news headlines and summaries generated using AI that were lambasted for getting facts wrong.
  <br>
  <br>
  Apple's decision to temporarily disable the recently launched AI feature came after the BBC and other news organizations complained that users were getting mistake-riddled or outright wrong headlines or news summary alerts.
  <br>
  <br>
  The company hopes that customers are attracted to buy the latest iPhone models by its new AI powers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Along with Apple, other tech giants like Google, Microsoft and Amazon are convinced that generative AI's powers are the next chapter of computing and are boosting spending so as not to be left behind.
  <br>
  <br>
  Apple lost its status as the best selling smartphone brand in the Chinese market last year after a pair of local rivals surpassed it with surging shipments, according to industry data provider Canalys. (AFP)

    'More non-local race broadcasts to boost economy'

<img alt="The Jockey club wants to increase the maximum number of simulcast races and days per season to boost revenue. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1789787_1_20250131105717.jpg&q=40">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A lawmaker on Friday said the Jockey Club's plan to broadcast more non-local horse racing events will boost Hong Kong's tourism and betting revenue.
 <br>
  <br>
  The club wants to increase the maximum number of simulcast races per season from 25 to 55, and the maximum number of simulcast days per season from 37 to 70 in 2026/27.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lo Wai-kwok, who chairs the Business and Professionals Alliance, said local racing fans' appetite for international events is on the rise, and the change would benefit society.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It will increase investment and the Jockey Club's revenue. This benefits Hong Kong because the Jockey Club is actually a very successful social enterprise," Lo told a radio programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Most of its earnings flow back into society, not just through betting taxes paid to the Hong Kong government, but also through substantial investments in social welfare such as schools, hospitals and care homes."
  <br>
  <br>
  The lawmaker said the initiative is also expected to boost tourism, noting that the New Year's Day race saw mainland visitor numbers double to 4,120 compared to last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Apollo Ng, chairman of the Hong Kong Thoroughbred Breeders' Alliance, told the same programme that there aren't enough overseas race broadcasts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ng said the proposal will help keep local fans engaged - especially during the racing off-season from mid-July to early September, when some fans may travel elsewhere to gamble.
  <br>
  <br>
  The public have until February 21 to submit their views on the proposal to the Betting and Lotteries Commission.

<img alt="Manchester United's Kobbie Mainoo celebrates scoring the side's second goal with Alejandro Garnacho and Rasmus Hojlund. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1789782_1_20250131103809.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Manchester United booked their place in the Europa League last 16 with a 2-0 win at Romanian side FCSB, while troubled Tottenham turned to their young guns to advance via a top-eight finish on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Diogo Dalot and Kobbie Mainoo scored for United in the second half of their final league phase fixture at the National Arena in Bucharest.
  <br>
  <br>
  In north London, under-pressure Tottenham boss Ange Postecoglou was relieved to see Dane Scarlett, Damola Ajayi and Mikey Moore kill off Swedish minnows Elfsborg with their first goals for the club in a 3-0 victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  United, unbeaten in eight games in the tournament, finished in third place and Tottenham came fourth, ensuring the Premier League clubs both avoided the Europa League play-off round.
  <br>
  <br>
  The top eight automatically progress to the last 16, where they will be seeded against the winners of eight two-leg knockout play-off ties featuring the clubs ranked from ninth to 24th.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ruben Amorim's side extended their recent improvement to one defeat in seven games in all competitions with a third successive victory for the first time this season.
  <br>
  <br>
  United were patchy in the first half but Amorim sent on Amad Diallo and Alejandro Garnacho at the break and they helped turn the tide.
  <br>
  <br>
  United finally took the lead in the 60th minute when Mainoo guided a dangerous low cross into the six-yard box and Dalot timed his run to slot home with ease.
  <br>
  <br>
  Daniel Birligea almost hauled FCSB level immediately with a thunderous strike that nearly crossed the line after hitting the bar.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Mainoo's composed finish from Garnacho's cutback in the 68th minute put the result beyond doubt.
  <br>
  <br>
  "More than the win is to have time to train and have time to recover the players," Amorim said of United avoiding the play-offs.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The lads did a good job but we have to understand the opponent is not with all due respect the same level as the Premier League. We want to improve a lot with the way we play."
  <br>
  <br>
  At the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, it took three of the club's promising academy graduates to lift the gloom.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tottenham are languishing in 15th place in the Premier League, eight points above the relegation zone after winning just one of their past 11 top-flight matches.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last weekend's defeat against fellow strugglers Leicester condemned Tottenham to their longest winless streak in the league since 2008.
  <br>
  <br>
  Postecoglou admitted he's not sure of his job status after fans jeered the team and called for chairman Daniel Levy to quit during the Leicester debacle.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tottenham lost centre-back Radu Dragusin to a knee problem as their injury woes mounted in the second half, but his replacement Scarlett ended Elfsborg's resistance in the 70th minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dejan Kulusevski's cross picked out Scarlett and the 20-year-old striker headed home, just days after returning from a loan spell at second-tier Oxford.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ajayi, 19, had only been on the pitch four minutes when he converted Scarlett's pass to mark his debut in style in the 84th minute, and there was still time for Moore, 17, to strike in stoppage time.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was 'Made in Tottenham'. It's brilliant, the whole academy should be proud," Postecoglou said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We needed something tonight and the young lads stepped up. I'm sure they won't sleep because they are pretty excited."
  <br>
  <br>
  Scottish side Rangers made it to the last 16 after climbing to eighth place with a 2-1 win against Belgium's Union Saint-Gilloise at Ibrox.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nicolas Raskin and Vaclav Cerny scored for Rangers before Kevin Mac Allister's reply set up a tense finale.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jose Mourinho's Fenerbahce scraped into the play-offs, finishing in 24th place -- above Braga on goal difference -- after a 2-2 draw at Midtjylland.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lazio came top of the league phase despite a 1-0 defeat at Braga, while Athletic Bilbao beat Viktoria Plzen 3-1 to secure second place.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fifth-placed Eintracht Frankfurt, sixth-placed Lyon and seventh-placed Olympiakos comprise the rest of the top eight.
  <br>
  <br>
  Roma secured a play-off place, beating Frankfurt 2-0 through goals from Angelino and Eldor Shomurodov. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 US stock markets finished higher on Thursday after a heavy news day that included earnings from tech heavyweights, an ECB interest rate cut and reactions to a fatal US plane crash.
 <br>
  <br>
  Among the large companies reporting results, both Meta and Tesla advanced while Microsoft, Caterpillar and UPS all retreated.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The earnings news, in aggregate, hasn't knocked the socks off the market," said a note from Briefing.com analyst Patrick O'Hare.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished up 0.4 percent at 44,882.13.
  <br>
  <br>
  The S&P 500 gained 0.5 percent to 6,071.17, while the Nasdaq Composite Index gained 0.3 percent to 19,681.75.
  <br>
  <br>
  The European Central Bank cut its benchmark deposit rate by a quarter point to 2.75 percent, its fifth reduction since June last year and a move widely expected by observers.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ECB's latest decision comes a day after the Federal Reserve kept interest rates unchanged.
  <br>
  <br>
  US Treasury yields retreated as data Thursday estimated US economic growth at 2.3 percent in the fourth quarter, slowing from the 3.1 percent rate in the July to September period.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among individual companies, American Airlines dropped 2.5 percent as investigators began probing the causes of a crash involving an affiliate carrier of American Airlines and a military helicopter that claimed 67 lives.
  <br>
  <br>
  Most other US carriers also fell.
  <br>
  <br>
  More earnings from large companies are scheduled Friday, along with key US inflation data. (AFP)

 There are likely no survivors from a collision between a passenger jet and US Army helicopter in Washington DC, officials said on Thursday, as recovery operations pulled 28 bodies from the Potomac River into which both crashed.
 <br>
  <br>
  "At this point we don't believe there are any survivors," Washington Fire Chief John Donnelly told a news conference at Reagan National Airport, outside the US capital. "We are now at a point where we are switching from a rescue operation to a recovery operation."

  Donnelly said 27 bodies were recovered from the plane and one from the helicopter. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Tourists and locals were treated to a spectacular Lunar New Year fireworks display over Victoria Harbour on Thursday, the second day of the Year of the Snake.
 <br>
  <br>
  Divided into nine named pyrotechnic scenes, the show began with "A Brand New Beginning", featuring the lucky number eight in red.
  <br>
  <br>
  It then moved on to gold ingots, symbolising prosperity and abundance.
  <br>
  <br>
  The eighth scene "Double Luck and Goodness" showed six panda faces, representing the number of pandas in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  The show concluded with "Year of the Snake". This scene filled the sky with star-patterned pyrotechnics to the sound of Chinese gongs and drums.
  <br>
  <br>
  The display began at 8 pm and lasted 23 minutes. It was coordinated by the Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau.

 Thousands of people gathered around Victoria Harbour on Thursday for the New Year firework display, traditionally held on the second day of the Lunar New Year.
 <br>
  <br>
  A secondary school student told RTHK she had arrived at 3.30 pm.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I wanted to enjoy the festive atmosphere, and get a good spot. This is the first time I have come to see the fireworks. I think the weather is quite good today. I decided to go out and see how much better watching the fireworks is, compared to seeing them on television," she said, adding that she brought a book and some food to kill time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another man said he is looking forward to seeing the panda patterns, which appear in one of the scenes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I came at around one, and I think it's worth it. I brought a tripod and a camera to take photos. I think fireworks are so beautiful," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  A tourist from Shenzhen said he had come to Hong Kong just for the display.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think having more than 20,000 fireworks will be magnificent, and the themes are also very meaningful. I was busy seeing my relatives on the first day of the Lunar New Year, so I missed the fireworks in Guangzhou. I can also appreciate the view of Victoria Harbour, while seeing the fireworks here," the man said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police closed off a number of roads on both sides of the harbour ahead of the display.

    Scores feared dead in Washington DC air collision

<div class="itemFullText">
 Scores of people are feared dead after an American Airlines regional passenger jet and a US Army Black Hawk helicopter collided and crashed into the frigid Potomac River near Reagan Washington National Airport on Wednesday night, officials said.
 <br>
  <br>
  Officials did not provide a death toll from the collision. But US Senator Roger Marshall of Kansas, where the flight originated, suggested that all on board died, saying at a news conference at Reagan airport early Thursday that "it's really hard when you lose probably over 60 Kansans simultaneously."
  <br>
  <br>
  "When one person dies, it's a tragedy, but when many, many, many people die, it's an unbearable sorrow," he said. "It's a heartbreak beyond measure."
  <br>
  <br>
  Jack Potter, the president and CEO of the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority, emphasised at the same news conference that first responders were in "rescue mode."
  <br>
  <br>
  CBS News had reported that at least 18 bodies had been recovered, citing a police official. Two sources told Reuters multiple bodies had been pulled from the water.
  <br>
  <br>
  American Airlines confirmed that 64 people were aboard the jet: 60 passengers and four crew members. Three soldiers were aboard the helicopter, which was on a training flight, a US official said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The mid-air collision occurred as the passenger jet en route from Wichita, Kansas was on approach to land at Reagan. Radio communications between the air traffic control tower and the Black Hawk show that the helicopter crew were aware that the plane was in the vicinity.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Pentagon said it was launching an immediate investigation into the incident, which President Donald Trump appeared to blame on the helicopter crew and air traffic controllers in a post on Truth Social.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The helicopter was going straight at the airplane for an extended period of time. It is a CLEAR NIGHT, the lights on the plane were blazing, why didn't the helicopter go up or down, or turn," Trump wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Why didn't the control tower tell the helicopter what to do instead of asking if they saw the plane. This is a bad situation that looks like it should have been prevented. NOT GOOD!!!"
  <br>
  <br>
  Air traffic control recordings appear to capture the final attempted communications with the helicopter, call sign PAT25, before it collides with the plane, described as CRJ.
  <br>
  <br>
  "PAT25, do you have a CRJ in sight? PAT25, pass behind the CRJ," an air traffic controller says at 8:47 pm (0147 GMT), according to a recording on liveatc.net.
  <br>
  <br>
  Seconds later, another aircraft calls in to air traffic control, saying, "Tower, did you see that?" - apparently referring to the crash. An air traffic controller then redirects planes heading to runway 33 to go around.
  <br>
  <br>
  Video of the crash captured by a webcam at the nearby Kennedy Center showed the moment of impact between the aircraft and the helicopter, with a massive explosion lighting up the night sky.
  <br>
  <br>
  Just after the collision, an air traffic controller was heard saying over the radio, "I just saw a fireball and then it was just gone. I haven't seen anything since they hit the river."
  <br>
  <br>
  Relatives gathered at the airport said they were getting little to no information from officials about the incident, adding that they were hearing more about the incident from news reports.
  <br>
  <br>
  One woman told an airport official, "I don't know if she got on there or not," in apparent reference to a passenger on the crashed jet. She then collapsed in tears.
  <br>
  <br>
  Washington, DC, fire chief John Donnelly said at the news conference that at least 300 first responders were continuing to work on the "highly complex" rescue operation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Conditions out there are extremely rough for the responders," Donnelly said. "It's cold. They're dealing with windy conditions."
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked by reporters whether there were any survivors, he responded that "we don't know yet."
  <br>
  <br>
  Around 1:30 am ET, a Reuters reporter near the airport saw a helicopter circling in the sky and shining a spotlight into the water. A boat with a rescue team floated by with those aboard peering into the water with a flashlight.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier, dozens of police, ambulance and rescue units, some ferrying boats, staged along the river and raced to positions along the tarmac of Reagan airport. Live TV images showed several boats in the water, flashing blue and red lights.
  <br>
  <br>
  Airports authority CEO Potter said the airport would remain closed until at least 11 am on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 1982, Air Florida Flight 90 crashed into the 14th Street Bridge over the Potomac River, killing 70 passengers and four crew members. Only four passengers and one crew member survived.
  <br>
  <br>
  The last deadly major crash involving a commercial airliner in the US was in 2009, when all 49 people aboard a Colgan Air flight died when the plane crashed in New York state. One person also died on the ground.
  <br>
  <br>
  But a series of near-miss incidents in recent years have raised serious safety concerns.
  <br>
  <br>
  PSA was operating Flight 5342 for American Airlines, according to the FAA.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're cooperating with the National Transportation Safety Board in its investigation and will continue to provide all the information we can," American Airlines CEO Robert Isom said in a video statement. (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Golden State Warriors withstood Oklahoma City star Shai Gilgeous-Alexander's 52-point outburst to beat the Western Conference leading Thunder 116-109 on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Andrew Wiggins scored 27 points and Warriors superstar Stephen Curry scored 17 of his 21 points in the second half as Golden State erased a double-digit deficit and pulled away late for the victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We just stayed solid," said Curry, who entered the contest mired in shooting slump and had just four points on one basket in the first half. "Just all-around effort."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Thunder, fuelled by 31 first-half points from Gilgeous-Alexander, led by as many as 14 in the first half and were up 58-48 at the break.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the Warriors turned it around and they went into the fourth quarter tied.
  <br>
  <br>
  The teams traded the lead five times in the opening minutes of the final frame, Kevon Looney putting Golden State ahead for good with a pair of free-throws with 8:18 remaining.
  <br>
  <br>
  Curry's three-pointer put Golden State up 109-103 with 1:52 remaining. Wiggins added a three-pointer and Gary Payton II threw down a dunk as the Warriors pulled away.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We need every win possible," Curry said after the Warriors improved to 24-23 -- knocking on the door for a play-in tournament berth.
  <br>
  <br>
  "(We) haven't really developed anything consistent in terms of the win column. So this is a great test."
  <br>
  <br>
  The defeat dropped the Thunder to 37-9, a hair behind the Cleveland Cavaliers for best record in the league.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Short-handed Cavs, fueled by 34 points from Donovan Mitchell, beat the Miami Heat 126-106 to maintain their lead over the reigning champion Boston Celtics atop the East.
  <br>
  <br>
  Darius Garland, averaging 21.7 points per game for the Cavs, was held out to rest while Caris LeVert and Isaac Okoro remained sidelined by injuries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Evan Mobley scored 22 points and pulled down 15 rebounds and Ty Jerome added 20 points off the bench for Cleveland, who improved to 38-9 and remained 5.5 games ahead of the Celtics, who thumped the Chicago Bulls 122-100 in Boston.
  <br>
  <br>
  The New York Knicks are a further game back after a 122-112 victory over the Denver Nuggets.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kristaps Porzingis was the driving force in Boston, drilling eight three-pointers on the way to 34 points with 11 rebounds and three steals for the Celtics.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jaylen Brown added 28 points, six rebounds and six assists, Derrick White added 22 points and Jayson Tatum -- questionable to start with a sore knee -- scored 16.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Knicks, fuelled by 30 points and 15 assists from Jalen Brunson, notched a fifth straight win.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jamal Murray led the Nuggets with 33 points. NBA Most Valuable Player Nikola Jokic was in foul trouble early and finished with 17 points six rebounds and six assists for Denver, who slumped to a third straight defeat.
  <br>
  <br>
  Things got heated in Indianapolis, where Pascal Siakam scored 37 points and Tyrese Haliburton added 30 points and eight assists for the Indiana Pacers in a 133-119 victory over the Detroit Pistons.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two weeks after tempers flared when the teams met in Detroit, the Pistons' frustration was obvious.
  <br>
  <br>
  Detroit picked up a pair of technical fouls in the first 17 minutes and Isaiah Stewart was ejected after shoving Indiana's Thomas Bryant early in the second quarter.
  <br>
  <br>
  There were tense moments in San Antonio, where Kawhi Leonard and Norman Powell scored 27 points apiece to lead the Los Angeles Clippers to a 128-116 victory over the Spurs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ivica Zubac scored 21 points and grabbed 22 rebounds for the Clippers, and sparked the ire of Spurs star Victor Wembanyama when he gave the Frenchman a shove in the third quarter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wembanyama rose from the court and tried to chase down Zubac before he was held back by teammates and coaches.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zubac said he thought he'd been fouled by Wemby on a prior play and "reacted a little".
  <br>
  <br>
  "I let emotions take over a little bit, but I apologized to him," Zubac said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wembanyama, who finished with 23 points, 12 rebounds and four assists, admitted his own reaction was due to as much to "frustration" as anger at Zubac. (AFP)

    Tesla results come in lower than expected

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Tesla reported lower than expected profits on Wednesday but confirmed key 2025 benchmarks, saying it will return to sales volume growth and move forward with fully autonomous driving.
 <br>
  <br>
  The results -- the first since the return of Tesla CEO Elon Musk's ally Donald Trump to the White House -- capped a mixed year for Tesla in which Musk's big bet on US electoral politics was countered by profit pressures as Tesla's streak of annual car volume growth came to an end.
  <br>
  <br>
  The electric car company reported fourth-quarter profits of US$2.3 billion, down 71 percent from the year-ago quarter, where profits were boosted by a one-time tax benefit.
  <br>
  <br>
  Revenues rose two percent to US$25.7 billion, also missing analyst estimates, but reflecting a more than doubling of sales in energy generation and storage.
  <br>
  <br>
  Musk has sought to temper expectations about Tesla's near-term financial growth, while employing superlatives in touting Tesla's autonomous driving and robotic ventures, saying they could make Tesla "the most valuable company in the world by far," worth more than the "next five companies combined."
  <br>
  <br>
  Musk, who spent some US$270 million or more to help Trump win the White House, largely steered clear of political subjects during the 65-minute conference call.
  <br>
  <br>
  The company has been confronted by intensifying EV competition in leading markets, including China and the United States, where General Motors and Ford have introduced more models.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another factor has been lower sales than expected from the Cybertruck, Musk's futuristic auto giant that has won cheers from Tesla fans and jeers from critics.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Tesla expects growth in 2025, saying in its earnings release that "with the advancements in vehicle autonomy and the introduction of new products, we expect the vehicle business to return to growth in 2025."
  <br>
  <br>
  The company confirmed plans to unveil new, more affordable vehicles in 2025 and said its launch of a new robotaxi venture in parts of the United States was on track to begin this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tesla named its driver-assistance programs "autopilot" and "full self-driving" (FSD), even though the programmes require the driver to maintain attention, while rival robotaxi venture Waymo has achieved full driverless functionality in three US cities so far.
  <br>
  <br>
  Musk has repeatedly missed earlier targets towards full autonomy, quipping during Wednesday that he was like the boy who cried wolf.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But I'm telling you, there's a damn wolf this time, and you can drive it," Musk said. "In fact, it can drive you. It's a self-driving wolf."
  <br>
  <br>
  Musk said he intends to launch FSD as a paid service in Austin, Texas this year, where the company also plans to introduce robotaxi services.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Teslas will be in the wild," he said, describing a gradual expansion of service once the company can demonstrate its autonomous service is "unequivocally safer" than a human driver.
  <br>
  <br>
  Musk did not directly comment on how his alliance with Trump will affect Tesla.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shares of Tesla rose 4.4 percent in after-hours trading. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Manchester City came from behind to beat Club Brugge 3-1 and secure their place in the Champions League playoffs, as big guns Real Madrid, Bayern Munich and Paris St Germain also won to progress, while AC Milan and Juventus will join them despite both losing on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  A goal-stacked night of 18 simultaneous kick-offs in the final group match day of the competition's new format, eventually ended as the traditional format usually ended with all the big guns still alive.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool and Barcelona were the only teams already guaranteed a place in the top eight and automatic progress to the round of 16 and they stayed first and second respectively despite Liverpool losing 3-2 to PSV Eindhoven and Barca drawing 2-2 with Atalanta.
  <br>
  <br>
  Joining them are Arsenal, Inter Milan, Atletico Madrid, Bayer Leverkusen, Aston Villa and Lille, who produced the performance of the night to thrash Feyenoord 6-1.
  <br>
  <br>
  Although they eventually progressed reasonably comfortably, it was anything but for Man City at the Etihad. The 2023 European champions were exposed just before half-time when Raphael Onyedika brilliantly finished off a Brugge sweeping move.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mateo Kovacic pulled one back for City early in the second half but at that stage they were still heading out of the competition and they needed an own goal by Joel Ordonez to get the lead and then a third by Savinho to relax.
  <br>
  <br>
  The draw for the two-legged next stage takes place on Friday, where, unlike in previous years, teams from the same country and group can meet.
  <br>
  <br>
  The final is in Munich on May 31. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A US passenger plane carrying 64 people crashed into Washington DC's chilly Potomac River after colliding mid-air with a military helicopter on a night-time training exercise on Wednesday, prompting a major emergency response and the grounding of all flights.
 <br>
  <br>
  The plane had been about to land at nearby Reagan National Airport after flying from Kansas.
  <br>
  <br>
  American Airlines, whose subsidiary operated the flight, said "there were 60 passengers and four crew members on board the aircraft."
  <br>
  <br>
  A US Army official said the helicopter involved was a Black Hawk model carrying three soldiers -- their status currently unknown. They had been on a "training flight," a separate military spokesperson said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Washington police said "there is no confirmed information on casualties at this time."
  <br>
  <br>
  However, a massive search and rescue operation was in progress, with divers visible as they plunged into the Potomac.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Washington Post quoted unnamed sources saying police had started to pull multiple bodies from the snow-lined Potomac.
  <br>
  <br>
  Witness Ari Schulman described "a stream of sparks" and what looked like a large firework when the collision erupted overhead as he drove home.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Initially I saw the plane and it looked fine, normal. It was right about to head over land," he told CNN.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Three seconds later, and at that point it was banked all the way to the right... I could see the underside of it, it was lit up a very bright yellow, and there was a stream of sparks underneath it," Schulman added. "It looked like a Roman candle."
  <br>
  <br>
  President Donald Trump said in a statement that he had been "fully briefed" and said of any victims, "may God bless their souls."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Federal Aviation Administration ordered the grounding of all planes at Reagan National, and Washington's police said on X that "multiple agencies" were responding to the crash site in the Potomac.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kristi Noem, the country's new secretary of homeland security, posted on X that she was "deploying every available US Coast Guard resource for search and rescue efforts in this horrific incident at DCA."
  <br>
  <br>
  Police said fireboats had joined the operation on the river, where any work was complicated by the fact it was dark and close to freezing. Dozens of fire trucks headed toward the airport.
  <br>
  <br>
  The FAA said a Bombardier regional jet operated by American Airlines subsidiary PSA Airlines "collided in midair" with a Sikorsky UH-60 helicopter as it approached for landing at Reagan at around 9:00 pm (0200 GMT). The plane had left from Wichita, Kansas.
  <br>
  <br>
  US Senator Roger Marshall of Kansas said the collision was "nothing short of a nightmare."
  <br>
  <br>
  "I ask the world to join me in praying for Kansas this evening, the first responders, rescue crews, and all those involved in this horrific accident," he wrote on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  Questions were expected to focus on how a passenger plane with modern collision-avoidance technology and nearby traffic controllers could collide with a military aircraft over the nation's capital.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the airspace around Washington is often crowded, with planes coming in low over the city to land at Reagan airport and helicopters -- military, civilian and carrying senior politicians -- buzzing about both day and night.
  <br>
  <br>
  The same airport was the scene of a deadly crash in January 1982 when Air Florida flight 90, a Boeing 737, took off but quickly plummeted, hitting the 14th Street bridge and crashing through the ice into the Potomac River. 78 people died.
  <br>
  <br>
  Investigators concluded the pilot had failed to activate sufficient de-icing procedures.
  <br>
  <br>
  The last major fatal US crash was in 2009, when Continental Flight 3407 from New Jersey to Buffalo, New York crashed and killed all 49 people aboard. (AFP)

    Lunar New Year restaurant reservations up 10 percent

<div class="itemFullText">
 A catering representative said on Thursday that reservations at Chinese restaurants over Lunar New Year were up ten percent from last year.
 <br>
  <br>
  Association for Hong Kong Catering Services Management chairman, Leung Chun-wah, said despite a number of Hong Kong residents travelling during the holidays, those who stayed in the city were willing to spend.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Lunar New Year is the happiest festival for Chinese people. The number of people flying out was not too many, somewhere between 300,000 to 400,000 people. People still have to eat their meals, and they want to be happy while doing so. So, our business and reservation numbers both saw a ten percent increase," he said on an RTHK programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  A total of 357,927 Hong Kong residents departed the city on Wednesday, according to Immigration Department figures.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, Leung said restaurants generally saw just one round of customers early in the evening, as people's eating habits had changed during the Covid pandemic.
  <br>
  <br>
  "People eat early and leave early. We don't really see a second round of customers - those who go to restaurants at 8:30 pm for dinner," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Leung also noted that customers were spending less than before the pandemic.
  <br>
  <br>
  This year, the average spending per person was between HK$350 to HK$400 - similar to last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that the resumption of the multi-entry visa for Shenzhen residents only benefited restaurants in tourist spots, which recorded an around 20 percent increase in business.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Monetary Authority on Thursday said there's a chance that interest rates in the city will remain at "relatively high levels" for a while, after the US central bank kept the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Federal Reserve had left key overnight interest rates steady in the 4.25 percent to 4.50 percent target range, with its chair Jerome Powell saying there would be no rush to cut them again.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong's de-facto central bank said in response that the policy decision was "in line with market expectations".
  <br>
  <br>
  "However, the pace of future rate cuts remains uncertain as it is dependent on US inflation and labour market data developments, the effect of previous rate cuts, as well as the impact of fiscal, economic and trade policies adopted by the new administration on economic activity," the authority said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Interest rates in Hong Kong might still remain at relatively high levels for some time, and the extent and pace of future US interest rate cuts are subject to considerable uncertainty."
  <br>
  <br>
  The public should exercise caution when making property purchase, mortgage or other borrowing decisions, it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The authority added it would continue to closely monitor market developments and maintain monetary and financial stability.
  <br>
  <br>
  It stressed that the city's financial and monetary markets have continued to operate in a smooth and orderly manner.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Market liquidity condition has remained stable, and the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate stays steady," the authority said.

    Fortune urges practical measures, says rural chief

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A rural leader has urged officials to come up with policies that are practical rather than window dressing in the upcoming budget, after drawing a fortune stick for Hong Kong in an annual Lunar New Year ritual.
 <br>
  <br>
  On Thursday morning, Heung Yee Kuk chairman Kenneth Lau picked a No 24 "neutral" stick at the Che Kung Temple in Sha Tin.
  <br>
  <br>
  The stick corresponds to a prophecy that roughly translates to: "Live a life without wrongdoing, it is only greed that stirs up trouble; with the help of noble people, don't waste your efforts."
  <br>
  <br>
  Interpreting the message, Lau said it means doing the right thing and that Hong Kong needs the support of the country. He also appealed to Financial Secretary Paul Chan to roll out practical economic measures in his budget, which will be unveiled on February 26.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I hope the financial secretary will particularly take care of the middle class and the underprivileged, and not increase fees or taxes," Lau said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When putting in resources, officials should not do things that are just window dressing, they should be practical... Under this global economic situation and high interest rate environment, the government has to promote the economy."
  <br>
  <br>
  Each year, the head of the rural body goes to the Che Kung Temple on the second day of the Lunar New Year to draw a fortune stick.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lau initially thought he drew the number 20 stick, but later said he had made a mistake.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, the chairman of the Sha Tin Rural Committee drew an ill-omened No 82 stick for the Sha Tin community.
  <br>
  <br>
  Of the 96 sticks in the cup, 35 are “positive” sticks, 17 are “negative” ones, while 44 are "neutral".
