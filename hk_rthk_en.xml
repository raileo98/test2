<div class="itemFullText">
 Southampton have sacked manager Ivan Juric following their relegation from the Premier League, the club announced on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Southampton were condemned to relegation in record time after a 3-1 defeat at Tottenham on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Juric's bottom-of-the-table side have lost 25 of their 31 top-flight games in a wretched campaign.
  <br>
  <br>
  Relegation with seven fixtures left gives Southampton, last season's Championship play-off winners, an unwanted Premier League record, surpassing Derby and Huddersfield's relegations with six games left in 2008 and 2019 respectively.
  <br>
  <br>
  Juric took over from Russell Martin in December, with Southampton already deep in trouble, but the 49-year-old won only one league match, at Ipswich in February.
  <br>
  <br>
  Saints have lost seven of their past eight league matches.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We can confirm that we have today reached an agreement with our men's first-team manager, Ivan Juric, to end his spell at the club," said a Southampton statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Ivan came to Southampton at a tough time and was tasked with trying to improve a squad in a difficult situation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Unfortunately, we haven't seen performances progress the way we had hoped, but we would like to thank Ivan and his staff for their honesty and hard work as they fought against the odds to try and keep us up."
  <br>
  <br>
  Simon Rusk will take charge of the team as interim manager for the remainder of the season and will be assisted by Adam Lallana. (AFP)

<img alt="Paul Chan says investors should exercise caution going forward as market fluctuations are expected to continue. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1799293_1_20250407191203.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan said the Hong Kong stock market and the local currency remain robust and strong, after the US tariffs triggered the biggest single-day sell-off for the Hang Seng Index on record.
 <br>
  <br>
  The local bourse lost 3,021 points, or 13.2 percent, to close at 19,828.
  <br>
  <br>
  The percentage drop was the worst among major Asian markets on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to the press after trading ended, Chan said the plunge reflected grim global investor sentiment.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he pointed out that officials didn't see any "systemic market abnormalities" in the SAR, saying the local financial system is very sound and the Hong Kong dollar remains strong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Basically the market has been functioning orderly. There are substantial selling as well as buying interests. The spread between the two has been very tight, indicating that the buying power remains very strong," Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister noted that for some time going forward, it's unavoidable that the markets would continue to fluctuate, and investors should exercise caution and assess their risks.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said reciprocal tariffs from different counties against the United States and interest rate movements by central banks could add to market volatility.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We do not think the current volatility in the market warrants any drastic measures to be taken," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan added that officials will keep a close eye on the markets to guard against financial risks.

    World Expo hit with methane risk ahead of opening

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A level of methane high enough to potentially ignite a fire was detected at the World Expo site in Japan, organisers said on Monday, less than a week before the event opens.
 <br>
  <br>
  The gas was detected at an underground pit for electrical equipment during a test opening of the venue, said the Japan Association for the 2025 World Exposition.
  <br>
  <br>
  Organisers in the western city of Osaka barred people from coming near the affected area for about an hour to ventilate it.
  <br>
  <br>
  The site of Expo 2025, which opens on Sunday, was once a landfill. Discarded household waste creates large amounts of methane when it decomposes if left to rot.
  <br>
  <br>
  Although organisers have previously taken steps to prevent the gas from being trapped, they vowed on Monday to increase the frequency of monitoring.
  <br>
  <br>
  A fence will be installed so that visitors will not come near the affected area, while ventilation will also be improved, they said.
  <br>
  <br>
  In March 2024, a restroom at the venue under construction caught fire after a spark from welding work triggered an explosion due to methane trapped there.
  <br>
  <br>
  Expo 2025 will run for six months, involving around 160 countries and regions for a display of their technological and cultural prowess. (AFP)

    Britain may close hundreds of quangos to cut costs

<img alt="Quangos, or quasi-autonomous non-governmental organizations, will be reviewed with a view to closing or merging them or bringing their functions back into government departments. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1799284_1_20250407182022.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Britain said it could close hundreds of arms-length government agencies, as it looks to reform the state to cut costs and improve productivity in what it called "a new era of global instability".
 <br>
  <br>
  Britain has hundreds of quangos, or quasi-autonomous non-governmental organisations.
  <br>
  <br>
  These are taxpayer-funded but not controlled by ministers, and include public bodies such as the Health and Safety Executive, Network Rail and the Migration Advisory Committee.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Every quango across government will be reviewed, with a view to close, merge or bring functions back into [government] departments if its continued existence cannot be justified," the government said on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Britain is in belt-tightening mode as finance minister Rachel Reeves tries to meet her fiscal rules while also dealing with the fallout from US President Donald Trump's tariffs that have cut economic growth forecasts.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government warned that global instability meant it had to go "further and faster" in its reforms of the bureaucracy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last month, Prime Minister Keir Starmer said he was scrapping NHS England, a body overseeing the health system, and bring its functions back into the government's health department, aiming to save hundreds of millions of pounds.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some quangos would remain unaffected by the reforms, such as those which scrutinise government or protect the rule of law, the government said. (Reuters)

    HK stocks slump has retail investors seeing red

<img alt="Retail investors mostly saw red on the worst day for Hong Kong stocks in nearly three decades. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1799281_2_20250407180508.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Small-time investors in Hong Kong were left reeling on Monday as US President Donald Trump's punishing tariffs and Beijing's retaliation saw the city's stock market suffer its worst day in almost three decades.
 <br>
  <br>
  The benchmark Hang Seng Index fell by 13.2 percent – its biggest drop since 1997 during the Asian financial crisis.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a securities brokerage in Central, where more than a dozen elderly investors stared at numbers flashing red on computer screens, the mood was grim.
  <br>
  <br>
  A woman in her nineties, Tam, said she "hated" Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He cost me HK$200,000," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He's nonsensical, he says one thing and changes his mind a few minutes later... How can someone in such a lofty position act like that?"
  <br>
  <br>
  "[Trump] won't let it go, he's making a mess," said another retiree Lee.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Everyone around me is losing money."
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong resumed trading on Monday after a three-day break, which worsened the drawdown, according to Stanley Chik, head of research at Bright Smart Securities.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong's stock market had outperformed the United States since Trump took office, but Monday's rout wiped out HSI gains from the first quarter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Investors have taken a wait-and-see approach for weeks as Trump finalised his trade policies, Chik said, adding that the mood was not yet one of "despair".
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong tops the world in retail investor participation, with one 2023 survey showing that 48 percent of the respondents held or traded stocks in the preceding year.
  <br>
  <br>
  A 35-year-old man, Tsang, said his long-term investments lost around US$12,900 on Monday, but he would not consider selling yet.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I didn't expect it to get so bad," said Tsang, a bank employee.
  <br>
  <br>
  China A-shares may be more resilient, he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In this sort of fight (between China and the United States), it's hard to say who will suffer more."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lawyer Ray Chan, 30, was among those left unscathed on Monday, as he sold all his Hong Kong and US shareholdings two weeks ago, netting gains in the seven figures.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're clearly entering a bear market but I'm prepared," Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When [Trump] said there would be tariffs on April 2, I could guess where things were headed."
  <br>
  <br>
  It will take "at least a year" before he returns to the market, Chan said. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Nurturing talent is the "cornerstone" in innovation and technology (I&T) development, according to the city's tech chief on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Secretary for Innovation, Technology and Industry Sun Dong told a launch ceremony for the Polytechnic University's faculty of computer and mathematical sciences that SAR authorities have been taking steps to expand the pool of highly-skilled professionals and equip young people with skills needed for the future.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We firmly believe that nurturing talent is a cornerstone of innovation and technology development," Sun said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We continue to proactively promote science and mathematics education, and strengthen digital education, so as to provide talent support for developing Hong Kong into an international I&T centre."
  <br>
  <br>
  The university's newly established faculty focuses on three main disciplines: applied mathematics, computing, and data science and artificial intelligence.

    US tariffs 'amount to unilateralism and bullying'

<div class="itemFullText">
 China on Monday accused the US of unilateralism, protectionism and economic bullying with tariffs, while calling on representatives of American companies including Tesla to “take concrete actions” to resolve the tariffs.
 <br>
  <br>
  Putting “America First” over international rules harms the stability of global production and the supply chain and seriously impacts the world's economic recovery, Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The US is seeking hegemony in the name of reciprocity, sacrificing the legitimate interests of all countries to serve its own selfish interests, and prioritising the US over international rules," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is typical unilateralism, protectionism and economic bullying.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The abuse of tariffs by the United States is tantamount to depriving countries, especially those in the Global South, of their right to development," Lin added, citing a widening gap between the rich and poor in each country, and less developed countries suffering a greater impact.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said all countries should uphold consultation, joint construction and sharing, and "genuine multilateralism".
  <br>
  <br>
  He also urged countries to jointly oppose all forms of unilateralism and protectionism, and safeguard the international system and the multilateral trading system according to the United Nations and World Trade Organization values respectively.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last week, Trump put an additional 34 percent tariff on Chinese goods as part of “Liberation Day,” coming on top of two rounds of 10 percent tariffs already declared in February and March.
  <br>
  <br>
  China and other governments retaliated quickly. Beijing announced its own 34 percent tariff rate on US goods, mirroring Trump's tariff rate.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The sky won’t fall,” the People's Daily said, even if the US tariffs have an impact.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Faced with the indiscriminate punches of US taxes, we know what we are doing and we have tools at our disposal." (Agencies)

    'DC members shouldn't speak just for the sake of it'

<div class="itemFullText">
 Home affairs minister Alice Mak on Monday defended some district councillors who reportedly have not spoken during meetings for an entire year.
 <br>
  <br>
  Citing minutes, the Ming Pao newspaper reported that six appointed or ex-officio councillors never said a word at full council sessions in their first year in office.
  <br>
  <br>
  They're among 33 who reportedly didn't speak at around 80 percent of meetings.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mak said councillors might have opted not to speak for the sake of efficiency.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The councillors should definitely give their views on topics, but they don't want to repeat the same opinions," she told reporters after attending an event.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is not an efficient use of time – it'd be speaking for the sake of speaking, to hit a certain target in terms of numbers. That's definitely not what everyone wants to see."
  <br>
  <br>
  Mak noted that she herself had been a district councillor for more than 25 years before joining the government, and members were always prepared about agenda items and knew when to give their thoughts.
  <br>
  <br>
  She questioned if the public would want to see councillors give the same views hundreds of times, or better utilise their time by meeting with residents in the community.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister said the same idea applies at the legislature to avoid repetition.
  <br>

  She also said all district councillors met their performance targets.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mak added that mobile street booths will soon be set up to further boost communication between residents and district councillors, and announcements will be made in due course.

 From Monday, airline passengers have been banned from using and charging their power banks during flights and storing portable chargers in overhead compartments.
 <br>
  <br>
  The ban by the Civil Aviation Department came after a returning Hongkong Airlines' flight on March 20 had to make an emergency landing in Fuzhou due to a fire triggered by a portable charging device.
  <br>
  <br>
  An Air Busan plane that was also bound for Hong Kong caught fire as well in January at its home airport for the same reason.
  <br>
  <br>
  A traveller surnamed Cheng told RTHK at an in-town check-in centre that the regulation would not affect her in-flight experience.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I know about the rule, and I don’t think it will affect me,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I can still put my power bank under the seat, there is sufficient space.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I saw some news of planes catching fire due to these chargers, so I think for everyone’s safety, I am not in any rush to charge my phone.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Another flyer, Gillett, said he had not heard about the new rule.
  <br>
  <br>
  “No, not a word,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "No [impact on me] at all.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I don’t have any power banks, and I charge my phone ahead of time and turn it off when I’m on the plane.
  <br>
  <br>
  This was echoed by a passenger, Stark, who also does not own a portable charger.
  <br>
  <br>
  “No [effect on me],”she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I just watch the in-flight entertainment, and I just plug [my phone cable] into the [USB port in the seat in front].

<img alt="The Hang Seng Index ends 13.22 percent down at 19,828.30. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1799241_4_20250407172158.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Asian and European equities collapsed on a black Monday for markets after China hammered the United States with its own hefty tariffs, ramping up a trade war many fear could spark a recession.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trading floors were overcome by a wave of selling as investors fled to the hills, with Hong Kong's loss of 13 percent its worst in nearly three decades, while Taipei dived 9.7 percent, Tokyo almost eight percent and Frankfurt 10 percent in early trading.
  <br>
  <br>
  The benchmark Hang Seng Index lost 3,021.51 points to end 13.22 percent down at 19,828.30.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index tumbled 13.75 percent to end at 7,262.72, and the Hang Seng Tech Index plunged 17.16 percent to 4,401.51.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 13 percent loss for the Hang Seng Index marked its worst day since October 1997 during the Asian financial crisis.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Sunday, vice commerce minister Ling Ji told representatives of US firms its tariffs "firmly protect the legitimate rights and interests of enterprises, including American companies".
  <br>
  <br>
  Hopes that US President Donald Trump would rethink his policy in light of the turmoil were dashed when he said he would not make a deal with other countries unless trade deficits were solved.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something," he said of the ructions that have wiped trillions of dollars off company valuations.
  <br>
  <br>
  The savage selling in Asia was across the board, with no sector unharmed – tech firms, carmakers, banks, casinos and energy firms all felt the pain as investors abandoned riskier assets.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among the biggest losers, Chinese e-commerce titans Alibaba tanked nearly 18 percent and rival JD.com shed 15 percent, while Japanese tech investment giant SoftBank dived more than 11 percent and Sony gave up nine percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Market operator Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing was also hammered more than 14 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The rush to sell saw market turnover hit a record HK$621 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shanghai shed more than seven percent, with China's state-backed fund Central Huijin Investment vowing to help ensure "stable operations" of the market.
  <br>
  <br>
  Singapore plunged nearly eight percent, while Seoul gave up more than five percent, triggering a so-called sidecar mechanism – for the first time in eight months – that briefly halted some trading.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sydney, Wellington, Manila and Mumbai were also deep in the red.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We could see a recession happen very quickly in the US, and it could last through the year or so, it could be rather lengthy," said Steve Cochrane, chief Asia-Pacific economist at Moody's Analytics.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If there's a recession in the US, of course, China will feel it as well because demand for its goods will be hit even harder," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Australian Treasurer Jim Chalmers said spiralling trade tensions had "crushed confidence in markets".
  <br>
  <br>
  "When confidence craters, markets crash and that's what we've seen as a result of the US administration's self-defeating tariffs policy," Chalmers said.
  <br>
  <br>
  European stock markets plummeted at the start of trading on Monday, with Frankfurt slumping up to 10 percent and London and Paris each dropping about six percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Amsterdam and Oslo saw losses of more than five percent and Milan down over three percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  US futures also signaled further weakness.
  <br>
  <br>
  The future for the S&P 500 lost 3.7 percent while that for the Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 2.9 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The future for the Nasdaq lost 4.7 percent. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Under Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury Joseph Chan said on Monday the government will pay close attention to the stock market and ensure that the city remains financially stable.
 <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong stocks plunged on the first trading session after Beijing hit back over the US imposition of an extra 34 percent tariffs on Chinese goods by announcing reciprocal levies of the same quantum on American goods.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hang Seng Index was down about 9 percent in early trading on Monday, with tech, solar, banking and online retailers' shares plunging.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan told lawmakers that Hong Kong has a strong financial base that can deal with any volatility in the market and that authorities will stay vigilant to market changes.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Our fundamentals are very strong, liquidity is high, and therefore, we have been fair and open in our operation," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our core and fundamentals are very strong,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The government will continue to be vigilant together with the regulators to monitor closely the market to maintain a stable financial market.” (additional reporting by Reuters)

    Trump calls tariffs havoc 'medicine'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump warned foreign governments they would have to pay "a lot of money" to lift sweeping tariffs, characterising the duties as "medicine" and triggering further carnage across global financial markets on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking aboard Air Force One on Sunday, Trump indicated he was not concerned about losses that have already wiped out trillions of dollars in value from equity markets around the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I don't want anything to go down," he said as he returned from a weekend of golf in Florida.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said he had spoken to leaders from Europe and Asia over the weekend, who hope to convince him to lower tariffs as high as 50 percent due to take effect this week.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They are coming to the table," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They want to talk but there's no talk unless they pay us a lot of money on a yearly basis."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's barrage of tariffs announced last week was met with bewildered condemnation from other leaders and triggered retaliatory levies from China, the world's No 2 economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Billionaire fund manager Bill Ackman, who endorsed Trump's run for president, called for the tariffs to be paused to avert an "economic nuclear war".
  <br>
  <br>
  Investors and political leaders have struggled to determine whether Trump's tariffs are part of a permanent new regime or a negotiating tactic to win concessions from other countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Sunday morning talk shows, Trump's top economic advisers sought to portray the tariffs as a savvy repositioning of the United States in the global trade order.
  <br>
  <br>
  Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said more than 50 nations had started negotiations with the United States since Wednesday's announcement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said the tariffs would remain in place "for days and weeks."
  <br>
  <br>
  Japan, one of Washington's closest allies in Asia, is among countries hoping to strike some deal but its leader Shigeru Ishiba said on Monday results "won't come overnight". (Reuters)

    Djokovic not setting sights high for Monte Carlo

<img alt="Novak Djokovic says his eye infection began during the recent Miami Open semi-finals. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1799230_1_20250407125952.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 World No 5 Novak Djokovic, a finalist at the recent Miami Masters, said he did not have high expectations for the Monte Carlo Masters as he was suffering from the effects of an eye infection.
 <br>
  <br>
  Djokovic is a two-time winner in Monte Carlo but has not won any title since taking the gold medal at the Paris Olympics last summer.
  <br>
  <br>
  The hard courts of Miami marked a return to form even though the 37-year-old lost the final in straight sets to Czech teenager Jakub Mensik.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm glad that I found at least in Miami that joy on the court and, I feel, performance level," said the former world No 1 on Sunday ahead of the tournament.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Let's see if I can carry that into clay.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's obviously a completely different surface and I didn't have much time to get used to this tournament, so my expectations are not really high for the results here.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's more about trying to get matches and as many as possible, and obviously try to peak towards the end of the clay season which is, of course, most importantly in Paris."
  <br>
  <br>
  The French Open, which takes place on the red clay of Roland Garros between May 25 and May 8, is the second Grand Slam event of the season, following the Australian Open where Djokovic reached the semi-finals before bowing out, injured, to Alexander Zverev.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Serb admitted, however, that the eye infection and "a little bit of a viral infection" that he has been dealing with over the last week made him think twice about competing in Monte Carlo.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It started in semi-finals day in Miami and I did struggle with it in the finals but it's calming down, I guess.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm visiting the doctor later today so let's see. It should be okay."
  <br>
  <br>
  Given a first round bye, Djokovic will face a second round match against either the Chilean Alejandro Tabilo or another veteran of the circuit, three-time Grand Slam winner Stanislas Wawrinka. (AFP)

    Alcaraz admits Sinner pressure getting to him

<img alt="Carlos Alcaraz says he is at peace with not being able to displace Jannik Sinner from his top ranking. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1799227_1_20250407124847.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Carlos Alcaraz said pressure to reclaim the world number one ranking from the suspended Jannik Sinner has had a negative impact on his form this season.
 <br>
  <br>
  "A lot of people are asking me, or are telling me, that I have the chance to become number one if Jannik is not playing," Alcaraz said ahead of the Monte Carlo Masters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So probably that pressure has killed me in some way."
  <br>
  <br>
  The 21-year-old Spaniard added that staying at world number three has not come as a shock to him.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm not surprised because the people always say that we have to win the tournaments or the top people have to be there all the time playing finals or winning tournaments," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Four-time Grand Slam champion Alcaraz has endured a tough start to 2025, with his only title coming on the hard courts of Rotterdam two months ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the 1000 event in Monte Carlo signals the start of the clay-court season – a surface Alcaraz has excelled on.
  <br>
  <br>
  He won the French Open last year, as well as back-to-back Madrid Masters in 2022 and 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sinner has been out of action since accepting a three-month doping ban in February after twice testing positive for traces of clostebol in March last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 23-year-old Italian is due to return in time for the Rome Open in May.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alcaraz, currently trailing Sinner by 3,610 points in the rankings, said he has been at peace with not usurping the Italian as the world's best player.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm just thinking that I'm not able to become number one... in the clay season, even if Jannik is not playing, I don't have the chance to do it," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think I'm too far from Jannik. So I'm just here and I realise that I don't have to think about it and just go there and play.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That's my mindset right now."
  <br>
  <br>
  After being eliminated on his debut in 2022 and withdrawing from the last two editions, Alcaraz has yet to win a match on the Monte Carlo clay.
  <br>
  <br>
  Given a bye for the first round, he will seek to end that streak when he takes on the winner of round of 64 match between Francisco Cerundolo and Fabio Fognini. (AFP)

 The Airport Authority Hong Kong board has appointed Vivian Cheung as its chief executive.
 <br>
  <br>
  Her three-year term begins on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Secretary for Transport and Logistics Mable Chan offered the new CEO a warm welcome.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I trust that under Mrs Cheung's leadership, the Airport Authority will continue to strengthen the leading position of Hong Kong International Airport as an international aviation hub and promote the long-term development of the airport," the government said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan added that the government will work closely with the authority to lead the aviation industry to new heights.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cheung, for her part, expressed gratitude to the board and government.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The global business environment is increasingly challenging, but I am full of confidence in the future of our aviation industry," she said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With staunch support from the government, chairman and the board, Airport Authority Hong Kong colleagues and our business partners, we shall further consolidate Hong Kong International Airport’s leading position and develop the airport city as a new landmark in Asia."

  The appointment was endorsed on March 31 by the authority's board following approval by the SAR chief executive.

<img alt="Secretary for Justice Paul Lam says national security risks might still exist despite Hong Kong being very stable. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1799215_1_20250407114227.jpg&q=80">

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's justice chief has stressed that educating the public on national security is an ongoing effort, calling on people to stay vigilant against possible threats.
 <br>
  <br>
  In the run-up to the city's National Security Education Day on April 15, Secretary for Justice Paul Lam told local newspaper Sing Tao Daily that the push to raise public awareness should not be limited to certain days.
  <br>
  <br>
  For example, he said, one should not treat one's spouse well only on Valentine's Day, adding that national security education should similarly be an everyday thing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lam also warned that national security risks might still exist even though Hong Kong now has a very stable environment.
  <br>
  <br>
  One of six officials recently sanctioned by the United States, Lam said Washington's move might encourage more people to take part in work to safeguard national security.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the punitive actions would not affect him and that none of the officials placed on Washington's list left their job as a result of the sanctions.
  <br>
  <br>
  While no one would be happy to be sanctioned, Lam said, it did not mean that they had to be agitated and upset over it.

    Trial looms for Boeing over 737 MAX crash in Eithiopia

<div class="itemFullText">
 Boeing is poised to face a jury trial from Monday over the fatal 2019 crash of an Ethiopian Airlines 737 MAX plane, the first civil case related to the disaster to reach court.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Chicago trial, expected to last two weeks, was to feature two plaintiffs who lost family members in the calamity.
  <br>
  <br>
  But one of the complaints was resolved in an out-of-court settlement late on Sunday, a judicial source said, in line with most earlier litigants.
  <br>
  <br>
  Barring another last-minute settlement, the trial will begin on Monday with the selection of an eight-person jury.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have had some ongoing discussion that may continue throughout the day and the ensuing days," Robert Clifford, who represents relatives of several crash victims, told the US District court on Wednesday at a pre-trial hearing.
  <br>
  <br>
  A deal could also be struck even while the trial is underway.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Boeing plane crashed on March 10, 2019, just six minutes after takeoff from Addis Ababa on its way to Kenya, killing all 157 people on board.
  <br>
  <br>
  Relatives of 155 of the victims had sued Boeing between April 2019 and March 2021 for wrongful death, negligence and other charges.
  <br>
  <br>
  As of late last month, there were 18 complaints still open against Boeing, a source familiar with the case told AFP.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sunday's deal meant that a further three cases had been settled since then, multiple judicial sources told AFP.
  <br>
  <br>
  This week's Chicago litigation will now examine only the case of Canadian Darcy Belanger.
  <br>
  <br>
  Belanger, 46, who lived in Colorado, was a founding member of environmental NGO, the Parvati Foundation, and also worked in construction. He had been visiting Nairobi for a UN conference.(AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The financial secretary said on Monday Hong Kong is committed to creating a promising and successful future for Web3, or third generation Internet, development.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at the Web3 Festival Hong Kong that has attracted thousands of participants from around the world, Paul Chan pointed out that Web3 allows transactions to be carried out more efficiently, at a lower cost and with enhanced market transparency.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong's approach to Web3 is not simply about regulation," Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We aim to strike a balance, ensuring market integrity without stifling innovation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "After all, innovation entails risks.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The lesson we have learned is that we need to put it under a balanced regulatory framework so as to enable the sector to grow in a responsible and sustainable manner."
  <br>
  <br>
  He pointed out that innovation is crucial to the development of Web3, and regulators should adopt a technology-neutral approach.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan added that the government is looking to work with innovators and entrepreneurs from around the world to promote Web3 development and leverage its power for the greater good.
  <br>
  <br>
  He revealed that the Securities and Futures Commission has already issued licences to 10 virtual asset trading platforms.
  <br>
  <br>
  The four-day event staged at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre will conclude on Wednesday.

    Ghibli-style AI art can't match real animation: expert

<img alt="The new feature transforms photos into the soft pastel palette style of Studio Ghibli. Photo courtesy of Raj Shroff" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1799213_1_20250407113648.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A tech expert says people still prefer authentic animation over AI-generated art, despite ChatGPT's popular new function that creates Ghibli-style images.
 <br>
  <br>
  The new feature transforms photos and memes into the soft pastel palette style of Studio Ghibli — the renowned Japanese animation workshop behind “Spirited Away”.
  <br>
  <br>
  AI consultant Raj Shroff told RTHK he believes the effect is good marketing for the animation studio.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Studio Ghibli's viewership could increase by a factor of two, five or 10. The people that own Studio Ghibli, their employees and their current fans, they should be very happy that they're just getting free advertising," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  While the AI chatbot's usage and app downloads have hit record highs after the viral rollout, it has raised concerns about privacy and copyright.
  <br>
  <br>
  Studio Ghibli's founder Hayao Miyazaki previously expressed strong opposition to AI animation, and Miyazaki's son said in a recent interview that his father's creative work is irreplaceable.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shroff, for his part, thinks companies should follow ethical guidelines when developing features that replicate distinct artistic styles, such as watermarking AI-generated images.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked about the relationship between AI art and traditional animation, Shroff compares it to lab-grown diamonds versus natural diamonds.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Because AI animation or AI art is so easy to create, my personal theory is that the value attached to it will be a little bit lower," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When it comes to very hardcore or dedicated fan bases of Studio Ghibli or another style of animation, they may prefer the old-school animation methods. If a show is created using those techniques, it may actually be more valuable in the market," he said.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Alex Ovechkin scored his 895th NHL career goal, etching his name into ice hockey history by finally passing the previous all-time record he shared with Wayne Gretzky.
 <br>
  <br>
  Washington Capitals ace Ovechkin – who had tied Gretzky's 26-year-old mark with two goals on Friday – scored on a power play early in the second period of Sunday's clash at the New York Islanders.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 39-year-old Russian icon smashed in a long-range shot with 12:34 remaining in the second period to spark wild celebrations at the UBS Arena.
  <br>
  <br>
  An overjoyed Ovechkin dived along the ice in delight after his momentous strike, before being mobbed by team-mates as a packed arena rose in a standing ovation to the Russian's achievement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ice hockey's "Great One" Gretzky was in attendance along with National Hockey League commissioner Gary Bettman to witness Ovechkin's history-making strike, which was greeted by deafening chants of "Ovi, Ovi".
  <br>
  <br>
  Ovechkin meanwhile celebrated with his mother, wife and children, who came on to the ice as play was halted to mark the occasion.
  <br>
  <br>
  "What a day," Ovechkin said in an address to the stadium after play was stopped.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Like I always say, it's a team sport and without my boys, the whole organisation, the fans, the trainers, I would never stand here. I would never have passed 'The Great One'," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So fellas, thank you very much, I love you so much...And the last thing – to all of you fans around the world, in Russia, we did it boys."
  <br>
  <br>
  Gretzky meanwhile also spoke in tribute.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They say records are made to be broken, but I'm not sure who's going to get more goals than that," the Canadian told the crowd. (AFP)

Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1799169_1_20250407081504.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim said his side must improve "everywhere" after a dismal derby against Manchester City ended 0-0 on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  City's hopes of Champions League qualification remain in the balance as they remain fifth in the Premier League, which should be enough to reach next season's Champions League.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, Pep Guardiola's men are just two points above Newcastle, who have two games in hand on City.
  <br>
  <br>
  A point leaves United languishing down in 13th, but they had the better of a game limited in chances as they missed out on a first league double over City since 2019/20.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have so many aspects to improve. Everywhere we need to improve in every aspect: build up, transition, decisions in the final third," said Amorim.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Every player can improve, they are here because they showed something at other clubs. They have the quality, but we are still a team that plays on transition, we need to spend more time in final third to have more opportunities."
  <br>
  <br>
  Never in the Premier League era have neither City or United finished in the top four but that record is under severe threat in the coming months.
  <br>
  <br>
  A contest devoid of quality, intensity or fight summed up a dreadful season for both sides of the Manchester divide.
  <br>
  <br>
  After a record four consecutive league titles, City's form has fallen off a cliff to leave them at risk of not making the top four for the first time since 2009/10.
  <br>
  <br>
  United's only chance of Champions League qualification is by winning the Europa League as they are set for their worst ever Premier League finish.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Red Devils have shown flashes of improvement this week but also failed to score in their 1-0 defeat at Nottingham Forest on Tuesday to underline their problem in front of goal.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We just need to have a bit more of a killer instinct," said United captain Bruno Fernandes. "In the first half we had to many touches when we just needed one. We were patient, very organised but the killer instinct was missing today."
  <br>
  <br>
  Kevin De Bruyne started just days after announcing this will be his final season at City.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the Belgian's performance was the latest example that he is now a shadow of the figure Guardiola said will be remembered as one of the Premier League's all-time greats.
  <br>
  <br>
  City had the majority of the ball, but United were the more threatening side on the counter-attack in a pedestrian first half.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We were not good enough to punish them or hurt them a little bit more than what happened," said Guardiola. "We take the point. It would be better to win but still we are there."
  <br>
  <br>
  Phil Foden had the game's best chance just seconds after half-time but fluffed his lines with only Andre Onana to beat.
  <br>
  <br>
  The spectacle did marginally improve after the break as Omar Marmoush's powerful effort from a corner stung the palms of Onana.
  <br>
  <br>
  Joshua Zirkzee and Mason Mount's introduction off the bench added more thrust to the United attack in the final 20 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both had a chance to win it when Zirkzee's shot was clawed away by Ederson and Rico Lewis did well to get in the way of Mount's follow-up effort.
  <br>
  <br>
  There were smiles during a warm embrace between Guardiola and Amorim at full-time but those pleasantries disguised the fact that neither man can be happy with the state of their sides after a disappointing campaign. (AFP)

 Impeached Philippine Vice President Sara Duterte has returned home after nearly a month at her father's side in The Hague, where he is facing a charge of crimes against humanity, her communications team said Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  "My job here is done," she said ahead of her departure, saying former Philippine president Rodrigo Duterte's legal team was now set and she had filed the "last document" needed at the International Criminal Court.
  <br>
  <br>
  The vice president added the family no longer intends to seek financial aid to pay for her father's defence. "If we need to [sell] things to support our financial needs, we will do that," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rodrigo Duterte was arrested on March 11 and whisked away the same day to the Netherlands-based tribunal to face charges tied to his drug war, in which thousands of mostly poor men were killed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Daughter Sara followed him to The Hague immediately after and had been coordinating his legal affairs and acting as his mouthpiece, holding a number of press conferences outside the court building.
  <br>
  <br>
  She landed at Manila's international airport on Sunday night, according to her communications team.
  <br>
  <br>
  The vice president returns as her family's PDP Laban party is lagging in polls ahead of May mid-term elections that will determine 12 Senate seats and thousands of smaller positions across the archipelago nation of 117 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Duterte clan is embroiled in a bitter feud with President Ferdinand Marcos, a one-time ally and Sara's running mate in the 2022 presidential campaign, which they won in a landslide.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sara Duterte was impeached by the House of Representatives in early February for "violation of the constitution, betrayal of public trust, graft and corruption, and other high crimes".
  <br>
  <br>
  Her Senate trial is set to take place following the May 12 mid-term election, the results of which will determine who serves as her jurors.
  <br>
  <br>
  If convicted, the vice president would be barred from holding public office. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Luka Doncic scored 30 points as the Los Angeles Lakers produced a devastating display of long-range shooting to score a surprising 126-99 blowout over the No1 ranked Oklahoma City Thunder.
 <br>
  <br>
  A heavyweight showdown between the Western Conference leaders and the third-placed Lakers was effectively settled in the first half, as Los Angeles rattled in 15 three-pointers, a franchise record, to open up a 78-56 lead at the end of the second quarter.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Lakers never looked like surrendering that hefty double-digit cushion as they closed out a comfortable win to silence the Oklahoma City home crowd.
  <br>
  <br>
  The win saw the Lakers edge closer to securing one of the four remaining automatic playoff spots in the West after already-qualified Oklahoma City and Houston.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Lakers poured in 22 three-pointers across the game, with Doncic responsible for five of them. Austin Reaves had four three-pointers in his 20 point haul, while LeBron James added 19 points.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shai Gilgeous-Alexander led the Oklahoma City scoring with 26 points on an off-night for the Thunder, who shot just 43 percent from the field while making only 12-of-37 three-pointers.
  <br>
  <br>
  James meanwhile said the Lakers had been determined not to let up after making a fast start against the Western Conference leaders.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Between them and Cleveland, they're the best teams in the NBA," James said. "They're the number one team in the West so you can't let up no matter what the score is – they're always going to make a push. That's why they are where they are at this part of the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So it's a really good win for us and we can build off it... we're just trying to build our habits right now, going into the final stretch of the year."
  <br>
  <br>
  Reaves meanwhile believes the result augured well for the final week of the regular season, which reaches its conclusion on April 13.
  <br>
  <br>
  Six teams are battling for four playoff spots in the West, from the third-placed Lakers (48-30) down to the eighth-placed Memphis Grizzlies (46-32).
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's huge," Reaves said. "The way the standings are, you can go from third to eighth in the snap of a finger. So for us to come in and play such a good team the way we did tonight is big. Hopefully we can build on that momentum."
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere on Sunday, the Cleveland Cavaliers missed the chance to lock up the No.1 seeding in the Eastern Conference after suffering a 120-113 home defeat to the Sacramento Kings.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Boston Celtics meanwhile kept their slim hopes of grabbing No1 seed from Cleveland with a 124-90 rout of the Washington Wizards. (AFP)

    Seoul to set presidential election for June 3: Yonhap

    <![CDATA[<div>
<img alt="People attended a rally to celebrate the expulsion of South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol in Seoul on Saturday. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1799191_1_20250407101114.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korea's cabinet is expected to finalise a June 3 date for a presidential election following the removal of Yoon Suk Yeol last week for his short-lived martial law declaration, Yonhap news said on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Although not required by law, the cabinet will make the decision at a meeting on Tuesday, as it needs to approve a holiday for the event, Yonhap cited an unidentified government official as saying.
  <br>
  <br>
  RTHK's correspondent in Seoul, Frank Smith, said Lee Jae-myung, leader of the main opposition Democratic Party of Korea (DPK), was considered the frontrunner in a new election, having lost to Yoon in 2022 by a margin of less than one percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He's widely favoured. He's got something like a margin of 34 percent approval to nine percent for the second candidate of the Conservative bloc. So he's looking pretty good. He does have some legal problems, however, that could affect his campaign and possibly even prevent him from running, although he cleared a hurdle in that regard about two weeks ago," said Smith.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon was removed by the Constitutional Court on grounds of having violated his official duty by issuing the martial law decree on December 3 and mobilising troops to halt parliamentary proceedings.
  <br>
  <br>
  The law requires a new presidential election within 60 days if the incumbent dies or is removed from office.
  <br>
  <br>
  An official of the National Election Commission said the date mentioned in media reports was not final and would not become official until declared by the acting president, Prime Minister Han Duck-soo.
  <br>
  <br>
  Smith said he did not think Yoon's removal would be the end of the current political crisis in South Korea.
  <br>
  <br>
  "South Korea has some serious political divisions that really bubbled to the surface over the past four months. Those are going to remain here. For Yoon, on the legal front, the impeachment is just one aspect of this. He still has a criminal trial to go. His lawyers prioritised the impeachment trial and kind of set aside the criminal trial as much as possible... So he has some pretty serious charges of insurrection to face, again, looking at a long prison sentence and perhaps even a death penalty, although most people suggest that's quite unlikely."

<img alt="Hong Kong's benchmark fell by over 9 percent at the start of trading. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1799185_1_20250407093759.jpg&q=65">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial markets in Hong Kong and across the border dived on Monday as markets around the world crumbled in the face of a widening global trade war and fears it will unleash a deep recession.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Hang Seng index slumped more than 10 percent in morning trade which, if sustained, would make for the benchmark's largest daily fall since the 2008 global financial crisis.
  <br>
  <br>
  Banking stocks collapsed, with Hong Kong-listed shares of HSBC and Standard Chartered tumbling 15 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CSI300 blue-chip index fell more than 5 percent with selling in nearly every sector.
  <br>
  <br>
  The yuan slipped to its lowest since January and bonds rallied sharply.
  <br>
  <br>
  China, which is now facing US tariffs of over 50 percent, responded in kind on Friday by slapping extra levies on US imports.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mainland indexes of solar companies and household appliance makers notched losses around 10 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hang Seng volatility index shot to its highest since October.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shares of online giants Alibaba and Tencent were down more than 8 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's a harsh time when markets go down so dramatically," said Andrew Sullivan, founder of Asian Market Sense, who noted that the latest plunge came as investors race to liquidate some of their shares in the face of a cash crunch following a market meltdown, especially for those who trade using margin financing, or borrowing money from brokers to purchase an investment.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But one should get over the initial panic of wanting to sell, because a lot of the time these markets rebound within days or weeks," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That said, this current situation with tariffs being imposed by Trump, and then retaliatory tariffs by China does indicate that this is a situation that's unlikely to resolve itself anytime soon."
  <br>
  <br>
  For his part, Alex Wong, director of Alex KY Wong Asset Management, said "the [market sell-off] was beyond my expectation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is a liquidation sale as people sought to exit [the market]. But the magnitude of the decline was more than expected."
  <br>
  <br>
  He expects Beijing to offer stimulus measures in the short term to stabilise the market, such as a cut in the reserve requirement ratio for banks or a tax cut as part of a package of stronger fiscal support.
  <br>
  <br>
  Noting that the chance of the global economy to enter a recession this year has increased to at least 60 to 70 percent following the tit-for-tat tariff disputes between the world's two largest economies, Wong said a deal between the two sides is needed but difficult to realise.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China knows that if it complies with US demands, this will reinforce Trump's ego and he will ask for more later on, that's why China took a hard stance now. It would be very difficult for both sides to reach a deal.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We probably will be in a bear market for a long time," Wong said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, Sullivan noted that the a key event to follow is whether the US Congress representatives from both parties will stop Trump from implementing the reciprocal tariffs – by revoking the International Emergency Economic Powers Act and the National Emergency Act that Trump used to impose the tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Historically, if you saw the VIX index (a barometer for market uncertainty) is above 32, 33  percent, you'd normally get a policy changed by the government."
  <br>
  <br>
  "[But] the VIX index on Friday got above 40 percent, and we've seen no change of Trump turning about or evoking his trade policy. So it's a very difficult position," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But if they [Congress members] feel that their own caucuses and electorate are going to turn against them, they will have to make a choice.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Do they stick with Trump who is unlikely to have a third term, or do they stick with their electorate, and support them and go against trump?
  <br>
  <br>
  "That'll be a very interesting thing that we're likely to see in the next couple of weeks."

 A medical transport helicopter carrying a patient fell into the sea in southwestern Japan Sunday, leaving three of the six people aboard dead, the Japan coast guard said.
 <br>
  <br>
  The pilot, Hiroshi Hamada, 66; Kazuto Yoshitake, a helicopter mechanic and a 28-year-old nurse, Sakura Kunitake, were rescued by the coast guard earlier in the day after they were found in the waters clinging to inflatable lifesavers.
  <br>
  <br>
  The three suffered hypothermia, as their body temperatures dropped abnormally, but were conscious, an official with the coast guard told The Associated Press, speaking on condition of anonymity in line with regulations.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bodies of medical doctor, Kei Arakawa, 34; Mitsuki Motoishi, 86, the patient, and her caretaker Kazuyoshi Motoishi, 68, were later recovered by a Japan Air Self-Defense Force helicopter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Their hearts had stopped, and they were later confirmed dead by a physician.
  <br>
  <br>
  The coast guard deployed two planes and three ships to the area as part of the rescue operation.
  <br>
  <br>
  The six people were aboard what the Japanese call “a doctor helicopter,” on their way to a hospital in Fukuoka from an airport in Nagasaki Prefecture, when it crashed, according to the coast guard.
  <br>
  <br>
  The cause of the accident remains under investigation, the coast guard said Monday. (AP)

    Nikkei plunges on Trump tariff concerns

<div class="itemFullText">
 Japan's Nikkei share index plunged further on Monday, as US futures pointed to additional losses on Wall Street over President Donald Trump's punishing tariffs.
 <br>
  <br>
  In early trade in Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 was off 7.35 percent, adding to a 2.75-percent drop on Friday, while in Seoul the Kospi was off 4.8 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Australia's stock index plummeted 6 percent at the open on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba said on Monday that the government would continue to ask President Trump to lower tariffs against Japan, but acknowledged results "won't come overnight."
  <br>
  <br>
  "As such, the government must take all available means" to cushion the economic blow from US tariffs, such as offering funding support for domestic firms and taking measures to protect jobs, Ishiba told parliament.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ishiba said Trump's decision to slap tariffs on imports from Japan was "extremely disappointing and regrettable," adding that Japan would continue to explain that it had done nothing unfair to the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ishiba also said he was willing to visit the United States for a meeting with Trump as soon as possible. "But in doing so, we must ready a package of steps on what Japan could do," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's decision to slap a 25 percent levy on auto imports, and a reciprocal 24 percent tariff on other Japanese goods, is expected to deal a huge blow to Japan's export-heavy economy with analysts predicting the higher duties could knock up to 0.8 percent off economic growth. (Agencies)

    Second US child dies of measles, almost 650 ill

<div class="itemFullText">
 A measles outbreak has killed a second child in the southwestern United States, authorities said on Sunday, with almost 650 people now infected as the highly-contagious disease spreads.
 <br>
  <br>
  The school-aged child, who was unvaccinated and had no underlying health conditions, died on Thursday in the hospital from measles pulmonary failure, the Texas Department of State Health Services said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The child was receiving treatment for complications of measles while hospitalised," Aaron Davis, a spokesperson for UMC Health System in Lubbock, Texas, said in an email.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is the second death of a child in Texas since the measles outbreak began in late January.
  <br>
  <br>
  Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr, in a post on X, identified the child as eight-year-old Daisy Hildebrand.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kennedy, who has been an anti-vaccine advocate and previously has said vaccination is a personal choice, on Sunday said vaccines are the best protection against measles.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The most effective way to prevent the spread of measles is the MMR vaccine," he said in the post on X. He said that as of Sunday there are 642 confirmed cases of measles, 499 of those in Texas.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recorded cases stretching from Alaska to Florida, as well as in New York City.
  <br>
  <br>
  Texas had reported its first measles death, also of a child, in late February - marking the first US fatality from the disease in nearly a decade.
  <br>
  <br>
  The death of a New Mexico adult last month was also classified by the CDC as a measles-related fatality.
  <br>
  <br>
  The vast majority of measles cases tallied by the CDC - 97 percent - are patients not vaccinated against the measles, it said on April 3.
  <br>
  <br>
  The measles vaccine is 97 percent effective after two shots.
  <br>
  <br>
  Paediatricians and other doctors are pushing back against vaccine hesitancy and warning parents that vitamin A and other supplements touted by vaccine critics will not protect their children from the highly contagious and potentially fatal disease. (Agencies)

    World scrambles to temper Trump tariffs

<img alt="US President Donald Trump delivers remarks on tariffs in the Rose Garden at the White House, April 2, 2025. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1799149_1_20250407011036.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 More than 50 countries have sought talks with President Donald Trump in a scramble to ease punishing tariffs on exports to the United States, the White House said on Sunday, as trade partners braced for fallout.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Republican has remained defiant since unleashing the blitz of levies on stunned countries around the world on Wednesday, insisting that his policies "will never change" even as markets went into a tailspin.
  <br>
  <br>
  But his staggered deadlines have left space for some countries to negotiate, even as he insisted he would stand firm and his administration warned against any retaliation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "More than 50 countries have reached out to the president to begin a negotiation," Kevin Hassett, head of the White House National Economic Council, told CNN on Sunday, citing the US Trade Representative.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said they were doing so "because they understand that they bear a lot of the tariffs," as the administration continues to insist that the duties would not lead to major price rises in the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I don't think that you're going to see a big effect on the consumer in the US," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent also told NBC's Meet the Press that 50 countries had reached out.
  <br>
  <br>
  But as for whether Trump will negotiate with them, "I think that's a decision for President Trump," Bessent said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "At this moment he's created maximum leverage for himself... I think we're going to have to see what the countries offer, and whether it's believable," Bessent said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other countries have been "bad actors for a long time, and it's not the kind of thing you can negotiate away in days or weeks," he claimed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has long insisted that countries around the world that sell products to the United States are in fact ripping Americans off, and he sees tariffs as a means to right that wrong.
  <br>
  <br>
  But many economists have warned that tariffs are passed on to consumers and that they could see price rises at home.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the meantime, the uncertainty over trade and manufacturing has helped fuel a days-long panic in global markets. (AFP)

<img alt="The boy was shot dead in the West Bank town of Turmus Ayya. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1799159_1_20250407060637.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A Palestinian official told AFP that Israeli forces shot dead a teenager holding US citizenship in the occupied West Bank Sunday, while the Israeli military said it had killed a "terrorist" who threw rocks at cars.
 <br>
  <br>
  Omar Muhammad Saadeh Rabee, a 14-year-old "who was killed in Turmus Ayya, held US citizenship," the town's mayor, Lafi Shalabi, told AFP.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Israeli military said that during "counter-terrorism activity" in Turmus Ayya, "soldiers identified three terrorists who hurled rocks toward the highway, thus endangering civilians driving".
  <br>
  <br>
  "The soldiers opened fire toward the terrorists who were endangering civilians, eliminating one terrorist and hitting two additional terrorists," a military statement added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Palestinian health ministry said one person was in critical condition and another suffered minor injuries in the same incident.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shalabi said one of the wounded also had US citizenship. And Turmus Ayya, northest of the main West Bank city of Ramallah, is known for having many dual US-Palestinian citizens.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Palestine Red Crescent said its teams had taken the body of the deceased boy to a hospital. It also reported the injuries of two boys shot in the lower abdomen and thigh respectively, during "clashes" in Turmus Ayya.
  <br>
  <br>
  One of the two, 14-year-old Abdul Rahman Shehadeh, told AFP he was shot by a soldier while collecting fruit near the town.
  <br>
  <br>
  The second, who was shot in the abdomen, was identified as 14-year-old Ayoub Asaad by his father Ahed Asaad. He confirmed that the boy had a US passport.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ahed Assad said that an ambulance that took his wounded son to hospital was stopped by soldiers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We were stopped at a military checkpoint at the village entrance, and a soldier told me that he was the one who shot the three boys," he told AFP.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Palestinian Authority's foreign affairs ministry denounced the Israeli forces' "use of live fire against three children".
  <br>
  <br>
  "Israel's continued impunity as an illegal occupying power encourages it to commit further crimes", it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Violence has soared in the West Bank since the Gaza war started on October 7, 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israeli troops or settlers have killed at least 918 Palestinians, including militants, in the West Bank since then, according to Palestinian health ministry figures.
  <br>
  <br>
  Palestinian attacks and clashes during military raids have killed at least 33 Israelis, including soldiers, over the same period, according to official figures.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel has occupied the West Bank, home to about three million Palestinians, since 1967. (AFP)

<img alt="Protesters gathered during a rally in Paris in support of President of Rassemblement National parliamentary group Marine Le Pen, after she was convicted. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1799140_1_20250406211858.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 France's Marine Le Pen on Sunday invoked Martin Luther King's struggle for civil rights as her far-right party planned to rally its supporters after she was convicted of embezzlement and banned from public office.
 <br>
  <br>
  The bombshell judgement that could crush Le Pen's dream of winning the French presidency in 2027 has stunned the country's political establishment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some leftwing forces and the centrist camp staged counter gatherings on Sunday against the far right, while the judges who convicted Le Pen have received threats.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Sunday, ahead of the rally, Le Pen urged her supporters to take inspiration from one of America's pre-eminent advocates of nonviolence in the fight for equal rights for black Americans.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will follow the example of Martin Luther King, who defended civil rights," she told members of Italy's hard-right League party, who were meeting in Florence, via video-link.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Thank you, Marine, we don't want to take up any more of your time," said Italian deputy prime minister, League leader Matteo Salvini.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Today will be an important day for you, for France," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a meeting of President Emmanuel Macron's Renaissance party in the northern working-class Paris suburb of Saint-Denis, former prime minister Gabriel Attal accused the far right of "attacking our judges, attacking our institutions".
  <br>
  <br>
  "We, here, will never disqualify a court decision," said 36-year-old Attal, speaking in the presence of Prime Minister Francois Bayrou and fellow former premier Edouard Philippe, who also hopes to run in the 2027 presidential elections.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Monday, Le Pen, 56, was found guilty of embezzling European Parliament funds and given a partly suspended jail term and an immediate ban on holding public office.
  <br>
  <br>
  Her supporters branded the ruling politically motivated, but Macron insisted the French judiciary is "independent".
  <br>
  <br>
  US President Donald Trump called the sentence a "witch hunt" by "European leftists using lawfare to silence free speech, and censor their political opponent".
  <br>
  <br>
  Some left-wingers including members of the hard-left France Unbowed (LFI) party staged a counter rally in Place de la Republique which attracted several hundred people. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 North Korea said on Sunday that foreign elite runners arrived to take part in the first Pyongyang Marathon in six years.
 <br>
  <br>
  Athletes from China, Romania and other countries arrived in North Korea to participate in the event, state media KCNA news agency reported on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Video footage from KCNA showed hundreds of runners taking off from the stadium track starting point.
  <br>
  <br>
  The marathon is part of celebrations marking the birth of North Korea's founding leader Kim Il Sung in 1912 and is the largest international sporting event in North Korea.
  <br>
  <br>
  The race offers a rare opportunity for visitors to run through the streets of the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  The marathon course winds through central Pyongyang, passing key landmarks and heading out into the countryside just outside of the city centre, before returning back to the stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  The last edition of the Pyongyang Marathon was held in 2019 before the pandemic, during which the state sealed its borders in an effort to contain the virus. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Pope Francis, who is recovering after a serious case of pneumonia, made a surprise public appearance on Sunday as he mingled with crowds at the Vatican just two weeks after leaving hospital.
 <br>
  <br>
  "A good Sunday to all. Thank you very much", the 88-year old Pope said as he was wheeled through Saint Peter's Square in his wheelchair after a mass dedicated to the sick.
  <br>
  <br>
  Surrounded by a mass of smartphones and cameras, and attached to nasal breathing tubes, his voice was fragile but more audible than when he left the Gemelli hospital on March 23. His last public appearance was February 14.
  <br>
  <br>
  Francis is, in theory, undergoing two months of convalescence following his life-threatening health scare, with strict rest, no public activity and no contact with crowds. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Britain's Foreign Secretary David Lammy said it was "unacceptable" and deeply concerning that Israel had detained two UK lawmakers and denied them entry.
 <br>
  <br>
  Yuan Yang and Abtisam Mohamed, from the governing Labour Party, flew from London to Israel but were blocked from entering the country and deported, British media reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is unacceptable, counterproductive, and deeply concerning that two British MPs on a parliamentary delegation to Israel have been detained and refused entry by the Israeli authorities," Lammy said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I have made clear to my counterparts in the Israeli government that this is no way to treat British parliamentarians, and we have been in contact with both MPs tonight to offer our support.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The UK government's focus remains securing a return to the ceasefire and negotiations to stop the bloodshed, free the hostages and end the conflict in Gaza."
  <br>
  <br>
  Since renewed military operations last month ended a short-lived truce in its war with Hamas, Israel has pushed to seize territory in the Gaza Strip.
  <br>
  <br>
  The health ministry in Gaza said 1,249 people have been killed since Israel resumed intense bombing last month, bringing the overall death toll since the war began to 50,609. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Rain was compounding misery and presenting new hurdles for relief efforts on Sunday in Myanmar, where state media reported the death toll from a devastating earthquake had risen to nearly 3,500 people.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 7.7-magnitude quake struck on March 28, razing buildings, cutting off power and destroying bridges and roads across the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  Damage has been particularly severe in the city of Sagaing near the epicentre, as well as in Mandalay, Myanmar's second city and home to more than 1.7 million people.
  <br>
  <br>
  State media in the military junta-led country on Sunday said the earthquake caused 3,471 confirmed deaths and injured 4,671 people, while 214 remained missing.
  <br>
  <br>
  With people either having lost their homes entirely or reluctant to spend time in cracked and unstable structures, many Mandalay residents have been sleeping outside in tents.
  <br>
  <br>
  When wind and rain began battering the rudimentary shelters on Saturday evening, victims were forced to choose between passing the night in dry but risky buildings or outdoors in the elements.
  <br>
  <br>
  "People are trying to rebuild their lives now," said United Nations aid chief Tom Fletcher in a video filmed in Mandalay, posted to X on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They need food. They need water. They need the power back on," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Many people in the area are still without shelter, he said, describing the scale of damage in the area as "epic".
  <br>
  <br>
  "We need to get tents and hope to survivors as they rebuild their shattered lives," Fletcher wrote in another post.
  <br>
  <br>
  Aid experts warn that rainy conditions and scorching heat increase the risk of disease outbreaks at outdoor camps where victims were in temporary shelter. (AFP)

 The Transport Department on Sunday called on people coming to Hong Kong to see the band Coldplay this week to plan their journeys in advance.
 <br>
  <br>
  The British band will be the first to hold concerts at the new Kai Tak Stadium, with performances on April 8, 9, 11 and 12.
  <br>
  <br>
  The department said there will be special transport arrangements on those days, including bus routes to the border and extra trains on the MTR's Tuen Ma and East Rail lines.
  <br>
  <br>
  There will be cross-boundary coaches departing from Kai Tak, but tickets must be bought in advance.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As the traffic in the vicinity of the Kai Tak Sports Park (KTSP) is expected to be heavy, spectators should opt for public transport and avoid driving," a department spokesperson said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "No parking spaces will be provided in the KTSP during the event period."
  <br>
  <br>
  The department added that it will "mobilise the taxi trade" to pick up passengers at the stadium.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Four-time world champion Max Verstappen led from pole to chequered flag to win the Japanese Grand Prix on Sunday, his first victory of the 2025 season, with McLaren's Lando Norris second.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Dutch Red Bull driver crossed the finish line almost 1.5 seconds in front of Briton Norris, who held off his McLaren teammate Oscar Piastri of Australia in third.
  <br>
  <br>
  The win on a damp but drying track at Suzuka was Verstappen's fourth straight victory in Japan and closed the gap on Norris at the top of the drivers' championship to one point.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was tough. The McLarens were pushing me very hard," said Verstappen.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was a lot of fun but not easy pushing the tyres. I am incredibly happy.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Starting on pole made it possible to win."
  <br>
  <br>
  Ferrari's Charles Leclerc finished fourth ahead of the Mercedes pair of George Russell and Kimi Antonelli.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ferrari's Lewis Hamilton was seventh, with RB's Isack Hadjar next ahead of Williams' Alex Albon and Haas's Oliver Bearman.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yuki Tsunoda finished 12th in his first race for Red Bull since replacing Liam Lawson, having started from 14th on the grid in his home grand prix. Lawson was 17th for RB.
  <br>
  <br>
  Verstappen and Norris were involved in a flashpoint midway through the race as the two front-runners emerged from a pit stop.
  <br>
  <br>
  Norris drew up alongside Verstappen but the Dutchman refused to budge and Norris was forced onto the grass before sliding back onto the track.
  <br>
  <br>
  Norris said "he forced me off" but Verstappen told his team that he was not to blame.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He drove himself onto the grass," said Verstappen.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stewards reviewed the incident and decided not to investigate further.
  <br>
  <br>
  Verstappen has struggled to get to grips with his Red Bull this season, finishing second in Australia and fourth in China.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he pulled off a lap for the ages in qualifying in Suzuka, pipping Norris to claim his first pole of the season in a track-record time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Verstappen got away cleanly from Norris and Piastri at the first turn, with little change in the grid.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dutchman quickly established control by laying down the fastest lap and his lead grew over the early part of the race.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eighteen-year-old rookie Antonelli briefly took the lead while Verstappen and Norris were in the pits, to become Formula One's youngest-ever race leader.
  <br>
  <br>
  Verstappen soon reclaimed the lead and his team gave him the green light to push until the end of the race.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two McLarens stayed on his tail, with Piastri telling his team "I have the pace to get Max" but Verstappen could not be caught.
  <br>
  <br>
  Conditions at Suzuka had been dry all week, with a series of small trackside fires halting practice several times but rain early on Sunday removed any chance of a repeat in the race. (AFP)

    A&amp;E fee changes boost medical protection: minister

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Changes to fees for treatment at Accident and Emergency departments will provide the public with better medical protection, Health Secretary Lo Chung-mau said on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Planned adjustments will see the HK$180 charge for an A&E visit increase to HK$400 from next year for patients who aren't deemed to be critically ill or an emergency case.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other public hospital fees will also change, although there will be a HK$10,000 annual cap on payments.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lo told TVB that the reforms are akin to the government providing everyone in Hong Kong with free medical insurance.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are providing more medical protection to the poor and to those in need of urgent or critical care. This improved protection will benefit seven-and-a-half million people. Everyone in Hong Kong gets extra medical protection. It's just like the government gifting medical insurance to everyone," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lo also said the authorities are looking into charging patients for any appointments they miss, likening such a move to hotels billing guests who fail to show up.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hotels will keep your credit card information, and if you do not appear on the day, or only inform the hotel of your absence on the day, then you should be charged for that cost," he said.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong will calmly face any problems caused by US tariffs with the government providing support to local firms, Financial Secretary Paul Chan said on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Donald Trump administration last week imposed new tariffs on virtually all of Washington's trading partners around the world, including an extra 34 percent on Chinese goods.
  <br>
  <br>
  Writing on his weekly blog, Chan said US tariffs will put tremendous pressure on trade and the global economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the government has been on the alert and Hong Kong is already less reliant on the US when it comes to exports than in the past.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As unilateralism has gradually been on the uptrend in recent years, Hong Kong companies have made adjustments with regards to their export markets," Chan wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Data shows that last year, goods heading to the US accounted for 6.5 percent of the SAR's overall exports, compared to 8.6 percent in 2018."
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister said firms have been turning their attention to Asean and countries in the Middle East, while the government has been helping companies find new markets and with digitilisation.

    'Packaging reduction charter better than legislation'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Environment minister Tse Chin-wan has rejected the idea of legislation to force businesses to cut down on their use of packaging, saying many are willing to sign up to the cause voluntarily.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Environmental Protection Department (EPD) launched a "Packaging Reduction Charter" last week and more than 100 firms have signed up so far.
  <br>
  <br>
  The charter is aimed at eight sectors, including supermarkets, food and drink manufacturers and the hospitality trade.
  <br>
  <br>
  Writing on his official blog on Sunday, Tse said given that packaging comes in various forms, it would be difficult to set standardised versions via legislation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Firms signing up to the charter agree to submit an annual report on their use of packaging and the information will be collated by the government with a view to taking steps towards future improvements, he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister noted that as well as pledging to reduce their use of packaging or find sustainable alternatives, the companies involved have agreed to encourage their suppliers, business partners and customers to do the same.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong racing royalty Romantic Warrior came up just short at the Dubai Turf, as trainer Danny Shum's champion was edged by the slimmest of margins by Soul Rush from Japan in the early hours of Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Jockey James McDonald and the SAR's runners were among the leading pack for much of the 1,800 metre Grade One course, and led almost the entire way after the turn.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, they were overtaken by jockey Cristian Demuro's Soul Rush on virtually the last stride.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wrapping up his three-race trip in the Middle East, Romantic Warrior won the Jebel Hatta in Dubai and was also runner-up in the Saudi Cup in Riyadh.

    'AI guidelines push to help prevent data leaks'

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong firms making use of generative artificial intelligence may run the risk of data breaches, Privacy Commissioner Ada Chung warned on Sunday, as she explained how new advice issued by her office will help mitigate the dangers.
 <br>
  <br>
  Last week, Chung issued a checklist for companies that is designed to help them develop internal policies or guidelines on the use of Gen AI by their staff.
  <br>
  <br>
  It suggested that firms cover what areas of work AI can be used for, as well as data security, ethical considerations and the protection of personal privacy.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Some organisations may not know that if they input clients' personal information into AI, the AI may leak this information to another party," Chung told Commercial Radio.
  <br>
  <br>
  As an example, she said retail stores may use AI to analyse the preferences of their customers, but this could be problematic if they don't strip out information such as names and telephone numbers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chung said companies with questions on how their use of AI can comply with the requirements of the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance are welcome to make use of a new hotline her office has set up, adding that more promotion and education work will be carried out.
  <br>
  <br>
  The commissioner added that her team has the authority to investigate any incidents where people's privacy is endangered by a company's use of AI.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We can investigate incidents when we receive data breach reports and after that we can issue reports, or even publicly condemn the organisations involved. We can also issue enforcement notices to them and it is a criminal offence if an organisation does not abide by a notice," she noted.

    Jaguar Land Rover to pause UK car shipments to US

<div class="itemFullText">
 Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) will pause shipments of its UK-made cars to the United States for a month, it said on Saturday, as it considers how to mitigate the cost of President Donald Trump's 25 percent tariff.
 <br>
  <br>
  Jaguar Land Rover, which is owned by India's Tata Motors, confirmed the temporary export suspension after the Times newspaper reported the plan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Britain's car industry, which employs 200,000 people directly, is highly exposed to the new tariffs. The United States is the second-biggest importer of British-made cars after the European Union, with nearly a 20 percent share, data from industry body SMMT shows.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jaguar Land Rover, one of Britain's biggest producers by volume, said in its statement that the US was an important market for its luxury brands. It sells 400,000 Range Rover Sports, Defenders and other models annually and exports to the US account for almost a quarter of sales.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US 25 percent tariff on imported cars and light trucks took effect on April 3, the day after Trump announced tariffs on other goods from countries across the globe. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Donald Trump told Americans on Saturday to “hang tough” in the face of economic turmoil caused by sweeping tariffs introduced on April 2.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a post on his Truth Social site, the US President promised “historic” results from what he called an “economic revolution”.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alarm about the fallout of Wednesday’s tariff announcement has gripped global financial markets, with Wall Street's fear level at a five-year high while financial executives expressed shock and worry about economic growth.
  <br>

  Trillions were wiped off stock market values as investors said they were fearful about the risk of recession ahead. US stock markets slumped more than 10 percent in two days, with the Nasdaq Composite now in a bear market, as China imposed fresh tariffs on all US goods, sparking worries of an extended global trade war.

<img alt="Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta reacts on the pitch after the match between Everton and Arsenal at Goodison Park. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1799081_1_20250406071657.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Arsenal's faint hopes of catching Premier League leaders Liverpool are almost over after their 1-1 draw at Everton, while Aston Villa bolstered their bid for Champions League qualification with a 2-1 win against Nottingham Forest on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Leandro Trossard's opener for the Gunners was cancelled out by Iliman Ndiaye's penalty to leave Arsenal trailing 11 points behind Liverpool, who travel to Fulham on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool need just 11 points from their remaining eight games to secure a record-equalling 20th English top-flight title and first since 2020.
  <br>
  <br>
  With just two wins in their last six league matches, Arsenal have tamely surrendered in the title race and are destined to go another year without their first English crown since 2004.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta had said the best preparation for his side's Champions League quarter-final first leg against Real Madrid would be to win at Goodison Park.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the Spaniard showed he had one eye on the visit of the European champions with his team selection.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bukayo Saka was forced to wait for his first start since December as the England international was left on the bench alongside Martin Odegaard, Gabriel Martinelli, Jurrien Timber and Thomas Partey.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is a very tough place to come, a team who is very physical and direct. If you don't deal with it, it's hard to get momentum. The start of the second half was very poor," Arteta said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal's weakened line-up struck first in the 34th minute when Raheem Sterling picked out Trossard and his low shot took Everton goalkeeper Jordan Pickford by surprise as it squirmed into the net.
  <br>
  <br>
  Everton were unable to stop Liverpool's march to the title in midweek when they lost 1-0 in the Merseyside derby at Anfield.
  <br>
  <br>
  David Moyes' men did their arch rivals another favour as they drew level in the 49th minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  Myles Lewis-Skelly fouled Jack Harrison and Ndiaye stroked home from the penalty spot four minutes into the second period to put Liverpool within touching distance of the title.
  <br>
  <br>
  At Villa Park, Unai Emery's side climbed into sixth as early goals from Morgan Rogers and Donyell Malen saw off third-placed Forest, who got one back through Jota Silva.
  <br>
  <br>
  Villa's seventh consecutive victory in all competitions was the ideal preparation for Wednesday's trip to Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League quarter-final first leg.
  <br>
  <br>
  A top-five Premier League finish will almost certainly be enough for Villa to qualify for next season's Champions League.
  <br>
  <br>
  Villa sit below fifth-placed Manchester City on goal difference and within one point of Chelsea in fourth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wolves effectively sealed their survival and left Ipswich on the brink of relegation with a 2-1 win at Portman Road.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vitor Pereira's side trailed to Liam Delap's 16th-minute goal as the striker swept in Dara O'Shea's knockdown.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Pablo Sarabia drilled into the bottom corner to haul Wolves level in the 72nd minute, before Jorgen Strand Larsen prodded home on 84 minutes for his fourth goal in his last three games.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fourth-bottom Wolves are 12 points clear of third-bottom Ipswich with just seven games left, leaving Kieran McKenna's side almost certain to return to the Championship after just one season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wolves' victory also means bottom of the table Southampton will be relegated if they lose at Tottenham on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Crystal Palace beat Brighton 2-1 despite finishing with nine men in a bruising battle featuring three red cards at Selhurst Park.
  <br>
  <br>
  FA Cup semi-finalists Palace went ahead thanks to Jean-Philippe Mateta's third minute curler, before Danny Welbeck's close-range effort in the 31st minute dragged Brighton level.
  <br>
  <br>
  Daniel Munoz blasted Palace's winner in the 55th minute, but the Eagles had to dig deep for the win.
  <br>
  <br>
  Palace striker Eddie Nketiah was sent off for two bookings in the space of nine minutes, then team-mate Marc Guehi was dismissed for picking up a second yellow card in the 90th minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a frantic finale, Brighton's Jan Paul van Hecke was shown a red card for his foul on Daichi Kamada.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Billionaire US presidential adviser Elon Musk said on Saturday he hoped Europe and the United States would agree to join in a free-trade zone after US leader Donald Trump unleashed heavy global trade tariffs.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump's sweeping tariffs announced earlier this week sent global stocks tumbling, worried allies, and raised the prospect of others – possibly the European Union – raising tariffs themselves.
  <br>
  <br>
  The EU, which faces a 20 per cent tariff, has already vowed to retaliate in "a calm, carefully phased, unified way", EU trade chief Maros Sefcovic said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I hope that the United States and Europe can establish a very close partnership," Musk said in a video address to a gathering of the Italian hard-right party La Liga.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I hope it is agreed that both Europe and the United States should move ideally, in my view, to a zero-tariff situation, effectively creating a free-trade zone between Europe and North America," he added in the video, posted on Musk's social media platform X by La Liga's leader, Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini.
  <br>
  <br>
  The billionaire said he favoured "more freedom for people to move between Europe and North America" for work.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That has certainly been my advice to the president," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he reiterated his condemnation of what he saw as mass immigration. (AFP)

    China says US must 'stop using tariffs as a weapon'

<img alt='Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun wrote on Facebook that "the market has spoken," after Wall Street headed south two days in a row. File photo: AFP' src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1799060_1_20250405203120.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China said on Saturday "the market has spoken" in rejecting US President Donald Trump's tariffs, and called on Washington for "equal-footed consultation" after global markets plunged in reaction to the trade levies that drew Chinese retaliation.
 <br>
  <br>
  Xinhua news agency also published the central government's stance, saying the US should "stop using tariffs as a weapon to suppress China's economy and trade."
  <br>
  <br>
  "The market has spoken," Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said in a post on Facebook on Saturday. He also posted a picture capturing Friday's falls on US stock markets.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump introduced additional 34 percent tariffs on Chinese goods as part of steep levies imposed on most US trade partners, bringing the total duties on China this year to 54 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump also closed a trade loophole that had allowed low-value packages from China to enter the US duty-free.
  <br>
  <br>
  This prompted retaliation from China on Friday, including extra levies of 34 percent on all US goods and export curbs on some rare earths, escalating the trade war between the world's two largest economies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Global stock markets plummeted following China's retaliation and Trump's comments on Friday that he would not change course, extending sharp losses that followed Trump's initial tariff announcement earlier in the week and marking the biggest losses since the pandemic. For the week, the S&P 500 was down 9 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Now is the time for the US to stop doing the wrong things and resolve the differences with trading partners through equal-footed consultation," Guo wrote in English on Facebook.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a separate statement published by the Xinhua news agency, the central government urged the US: "Stop using tariffs as a weapon to suppress China's economy and trade, and stop undermining the legitimate development rights of the Chinese people."
  <br>
  <br>
  "China has taken and will continue to take resolute measures to safeguard its sovereignty, security and development interests," said the government.
  <br>
  <br>
  Washington "seriously undermines the rules-based multilateral trading system, and seriously undermines the stability of the global economic order," it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier on Saturday, several industry chambers of commerce ranging from those representing traders in metals and textiles to electronics, issued statements condemning the tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  China's chamber of commerce, representing traders in food products, called on "China's food and agricultural products import and export industry to unite and strengthen cooperation to jointly explore domestic and foreign markets." (Reuters)

<img alt="Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi received the Mithra Vibhushana medal from Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake as a sign of their friendship.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 India secured defence and energy deals with neighbouring Sri Lanka on Saturday during Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit.
 <br>
  <br>
  Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake rolled out the red carpet for Modi and conferred on him the country's highest civilian honour for "the deep personal friendship" shown to the smaller neighbour.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We believe that our security interests are aligned," Modi said during a televised ceremony from Dissanayake's office in the capital.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our security is interdependent and interconnected."
  <br>
  <br>
  A five-year defence cooperation agreement provides training of Sri Lankan military personnel in India as well as information and technology sharing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dissanayake applauded what he called "India's rise as a world power, not just a regional power."
  <br>
  <br>
  "I have reiterated our position to Prime Minister Modi that Sri Lankan territory will not be allowed to be used by anyone to undermine India's security," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Saturday, Dissanayake welcomed Modi – the first foreign dignitary to visit Colombo since the leftist leader swept to power last year – with a 19-gun salute.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two leaders also celebrated the start of construction of a 120-megawatt solar power project, developed as a joint venture between the two nations.
  <br>
  <br>
  The solar plant, located in the island's northeastern Trincomalee district, had been stalled for years but was reinvigorated with New Delhi's backing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Modi's visit to Sri Lanka followed a summit in Thailand and a string of meetings with leaders of neighbouring nations as he sought to shore up India's regional ties.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the sidelines of the Bangkok BIMSTEC meeting – the grouping of seven nations on the Bay of Bengal – Modi held a rare face-to-face meeting with Myanmar's junta chief, Min Aung Hlaing.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also held talks on Friday with the interim leader of Bangladesh, Muhammad Yunus – the first such meeting since a revolution in Dhaka ousted New Delhi's long-time ally Sheikh Hasina and sent relations into a tailspin.
  <br>
  <br>
  Modi also met on Friday in Bangkok with his Nepali counterpart, KP Sharma Oli – their first meeting since Oli returned to power last year – as well as Tshering Tobgay of Bhutan. (AFP)

 Thomas Müller will leave Bayern Munich this summer after a 25-year career at the German club.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 35-year-old Müller said on Saturday, in a joint announcement with Bayern, that his “incredible journey” with his boyhood club will end in July.
  <br>
  <br>
  The midfielder's contract is set to expire after the season and he's seen limited game time.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It’s clear that today is not like any other day for me," Müller said. "My 25 years as an FC Bayern Munich player will come to an end in the summer. It’s been an incredible journey, shaped by unique experiences, great encounters and unforgettable triumphs.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I feel immense gratitude and joy that I got to make this career with my beloved club. The special connection to the club and our fantastic fans will always remain. What I want as a farewell should be clear: titles we can celebrate together, and moments we’ll remember fondly for a long time.” (AP)

    HK won't impose countermeasures against US tariffs: FS

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Saturday said Hong Kong will not impose countermeasures even though the United States announced sweeping tariffs on countries around the world.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Trump administration announced the imposition of tariffs of 34 percent on Chinese imports, and Beijing authorities have struck back, imposing a 34 percent tariff on all US goods.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a seminar organised by the Hong Kong News-Expo, Chan said Hong Kong will not impose any countermeasures.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Allowing a free flow of capital and acting as a free port are our advantages, and this will not change. The SAR government, of course, strongly opposes the actions by the US, and we also need to be defensive," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But on the other hand, we think we should persist in being free and open. The rules-based multilateral trading system is our core."
  <br>
  <br>
  The finance chief said Hong Kong has an overseeing mechanism to identify risks that may threaten the financial system.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, he said companies from the United States and Western countries regarded the mainland and Hong Kong as "non-investable" markets in the past years.
  <br>
  <br>
  But foreign investors changed their mind with the rise of DeepSeek earlier this year, he said, reassessing the potential of the country's innovation and technological companies.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Director of Water Supplies said on Saturday that while the department is still reviewing water charges, its objective is to achieve the principle of user pays.
 <br>
  <br>
  Roger Wong revealed on a television programme that the public's average daily water consumption has dropped by 12 percent compared to during the pandemic.
  <br>
  <br>
  The department has been reviewing water charges, which have been kept at the same level for almost three decades, since last year, and Wong said the authorities also have to take into account people's livelihoods, as well as the current economic situation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have talked to a number of stakeholders - the catering, hotel and construction sectors, to learn more about their level of water consumption, and obtain their views on price adjustments," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's quite good. Many of them understood that the charge has not been adjusted for years, and find it reasonable if there's a change. But they said they hope the increment can be imposed in a gradual manner, instead of us charging them a lot more all at once."
  <br>
  <br>
  He also pointed out that water pipes in Hong Kong have been in use for about 20 years.
  <br>
  <br>
  About one to two percent of them are considered very old, the director said, and they are located near residential areas or busier roads.
  <br>
  <br>
  A working group has been set up to carry out the prevention of water mains bursts more efficiently, Wong added.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Four-time world champion Max Verstappen smashed the track record to snatch pole position for Sunday's Japanese Grand Prix ahead of McLaren's Lando Norris, as Yuki Tsunoda qualified a lowly 15th on his Red Bull debut.
 <br>
  <br>
  Verstappen clocked a blistering lap of 1min 26.983sec in his Red Bull, 0.012sec ahead of championship leader Norris, with McLaren's Oscar Piastri third.
  <br>
  <br>
  Verstappen set a new Suzuka track record with his final lap in Saturday's qualifying, pipping Norris right at the death.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Each session we kept making little improvements, then the last lap was flat out," said Verstappen, who has won the Japanese GP for the last three years.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In a Formula One car around here is insane. This is a proper highlight for us to be back on pole here."
  <br>
  <br>
  It was Verstappen's first pole position of the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dutchman is still looking for his first grand prix win of the new campaign.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ferrari's Charles Leclerc was fourth ahead of Mercedes' George Russell, with Mercedes' Kimi Antonelli sixth and RB's Isack Hadjar seventh.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ferrari's Lewis Hamilton was eighth, followed by Williams's Alex Albon and Haas's Oliver Bearman.
  <br>
  <br>
  Norris is looking for his second grand prix win of the season, after triumphing in the season opener in Australia.
  <br>
  <br>
  He finished second behind Piastri in China a fortnight ago in a dominant start to the campaign for McLaren.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm happy, congrats to Max, he did a good job," said Norris.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You have to credit something when it is a lap that good that he must have done. I got everything out of the car today, the gaps are tiny.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Good but not enough."
  <br>
  <br>
  Tsunoda was eliminated in Q2 in a disappointing first qualifying drive for Red Bull after being promoted in place of Liam Lawson last week.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Japanese driver finished one place behind Lawson, who returned to RB after just two races for Red Bull in a ruthless driver swap.
  <br>
  <br>
  Verstappen has not looked comfortable this week and he again complained to his team over the radio in Q1.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I still have the same problem, the tyres are not gripping on the front," the Dutchman said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alpine's Pierre Gasly, Williams's Carlos Sainz and Aston Martin's Fernando Alonso were eliminated in Q2 along with Lawson and Tsunoda.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sauber pair Nico Hulkenberg and Gabriel Bortoleto, Haas's Esteban Ocon, Alpine's Jack Doohan and Aston Martin's Lance Stroll were all eliminated in Q1.
  <br>
  <br>
  Doohan's practice on Friday ended when he crashed heavily into a barrier and mechanics had to work through the night to repair his badly damaged car.
  <br>
  <br>
  Qualifying was suspended for about eight minutes in Q2 when a small trackside fire broke out as sparks from the cars ignited the grass in the dry conditions.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was the fifth such incident of the weekend, with the second and third practice sessions also disrupted by fires.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rain has been forecast for Sunday's race. (AFP)

    Youth facilities to open in Kai Tak by October

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Home and Youth Affairs Alice Mak on Saturday said youth facilities will be set up at the original site of an isolation facility in Kai Tak by October this year.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chief Executive John Lee announced in his Policy Address last year that the government will turn the Kai Tak Community Isolation Facility into a "Youth Post" hostel and spaces for cultural and arts exchanges.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to the press, Mak said her bureau has finished assessing the tenders, and chosen Glorise Tourism & Culture, which is under the China Travel Service, as the organisation to operate the facility.
  <br>
  <br>
  It will be co-organised by CTG Development and Dorsett Hospitality International, she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They will transform 60 percent of the total floor area of the isolation facility into a youth hostel, and gradually organise youth and international exchange activities with cultural, arts and sports elements according to their five-year plan," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mak added that the lease term is five years, and the organisation has to operate the facilities on a self-financing basis.
  <br>
  <br>
  She expects the relevant facilities to commence operation in phases by October.

    Myanmar quake death toll passes 3,300

<img alt="Many people have to sleep outdoors because their homes were destroyed. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1799034_1_20250405153937.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The death toll from a major earthquake in Myanmar has risen above 3,300, state media said on Saturday, as the United Nations aid chief made a renewed call for the world to help the disaster-struck nation.
 <br>
  <br>
  The March 28 quake flattened buildings and destroyed infrastructure across the country, resulting in 3,354 deaths and 4,508 people injured, with 220 others missing, according to new figures published by state media.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than one week after the disaster, many people in the country are still without shelter, either forced to sleep outdoors because their homes were destroyed or wary of further collapses.
  <br>
  <br>
  A United Nations estimate suggests that more than three million people may have been affected by the 7.7-magnitude quake, compounding previous challenges caused by four years of civil war.
  <br>
  <br>
  The UN's top aid official on Saturday met with victims in the central Myanmar city of Mandalay – situated close to the epicentre and now grappling with severe damage across the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The destruction is staggering," Tom Fletcher wrote in a post on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The world must rally behind the people of Myanmar."
  <br>
  <br>
  The new toll was announced after the country's military junta chief Min Aung Hlaing returned from a rare foreign trip to a regional summit in Bangkok on Friday, where he met with leaders including the prime ministers of Thailand and India.
  <br>
  <br>
  The general's attendance at the summit courted controversy, with protesters at the venue displaying a banner calling him a "murderer" and anti-junta groups condemning his inclusion.
  <br>
  <br>
  His armed forces have ruled Myanmar since a 2021 coup, when they wrested power from the civilian government of Aung San Suu Kyi, sparking a multi-sided conflict that has yet to be resolved.
  <br>
  <br>
  The junta has reportedly conducted dozens of attacks since the earthquake, including at least 16 since a temporary truce was announced on Wednesday, the UN said on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Years of fighting have left Myanmar's economy and infrastructure in tatters, significantly hampering international efforts to provide relief since the quake.
  <br>
  <br>
  China, Russia and India were among the first countries to provide support, sending rescue teams to Myanmar to help locate survivors.
  <br>
  <br>
  The United States has traditionally been at the forefront of international disaster relief, but President Donald Trump has dismantled the country's humanitarian aid agency.
  <br>
  <br>
  Washington said on Friday it was adding US$7 million on top of an earlier US$2 million in assistance to Myanmar. (AFP)

    Manufacturers told to look for markets outside US

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The former president of the Chinese Manufacturers' Association of Hong Kong has called on entrepreneurs to look for new markets away from the US.
 <br>
  <br>
  On April 2, US President Donald Trump announced sweeping tariffs on countries around the world. They included a 34 percent tariff on Chinese goods, on top of the previous 20 percent levy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a Commercial Radio programme, Allen Shi said many manufacturers export goods to the US where there is a huge consumer market.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the future, we need to consider setting up in new markets such as the Middle East, Asean or the former Soviet states, or concentrating on domestic markets," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We cannot just rely on the US market."
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on the same programme, lawmaker Sunny Tan, who represents the textile and garment sector, said the industry felt powerless in the face of Washington's latest move.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he said manufacturers in the US would also suffer from the levies, as a lot of their low-value work is done overseas.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Friday, China said it would impose a 34 percent retaliatory tariff on all US imports from Thursday, in response of Trump's announcement.

    Housing Society to complete tenant checks in late 2026

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Housing Society on Saturday said it hopes to complete checks for well-off tenants by November of next year.
 <br>
  <br>
  The society introduced the "Well-Off Tenants Policy" in 2018. Last year, it was expanded to cover all households that signed new tenancy agreements.
  <br>
  <br>
  The society has already said it will start issuing new tenancy terms from September to the 25,000 households still awaiting checks. Housing Society chairman Ling Kar-kan said the new rental agreement says tenants must regularly declare their income and assets. He said those who refuse to sign must move out within four months.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ling said so far only a few tenants had been classed as being well off.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If we look at the Well-Off Tenants Policy, it has already been implemented on those signing new tenancy agreements," he told an RTHK radio programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There are about 4,000 households who have signed new terms and nine are well-off tenants. Among the nine, seven are paying 1.5 times the standard rent and the other two are paying twice the standard rent."
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the society would discuss the new policy with households before September.

    Retaliatory tariffs on US goods 'aim to cause pain'

<img alt="Lau Siu-kai, a consultant to the Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macau Studies, said China's measures were not gestures. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1799015_1_20250405103147.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A senior member of a leading national think tank says China's retaliatory tariffs on the US aim to cause pain. Lau Siu-kai, a consultant to the Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macau Studies, said that given the difficult trade situation, China's retaliatory measures were not gestures, saying otherwise they would be meaningless.
 <br>
  <br>
  On Friday, Beijing announced it would impose a 34 percent tariff on all US imports starting on April 10. The move was in response to US President Donald Trump's announcement on April 2 of a fresh round of tariffs targeting countries worldwide. They included a 34 percent tariff on Chinese goods in addition to the previous 20 percent levy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Washington also made no distinction between goods coming from the SAR and the mainland. In response, Lau said - apart from imposing countermeasures on Washington should Beijing request such a move - Hong Kong could also consider placing levies on US goods.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Terence Chong, executive director of Chinese University's Lau Chor Tak Institute of Global Economics and Finance, believes Beijing's latest round of tariffs will cause US stocks to fall further.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said a recession would likely occur in the US in the next few quarters due to inflationary concerns and the reduction in GDP caused by a decline in consumption.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chong also said the US might impose additional tariffs in response to Beijing's move, further reducing trade between the two countries.
