<div class="itemFullText">
 Shanghai authorities have partially reopened a metro line which was closed on Sunday morning after a train smashed into a fallen crane on the track.
 <br>
  <br>
  The train was badly damaged but no injuries were reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shanghai Metro said on social media that following emergency repairs, Line 11 services heading towards Disney Resort Station resumed around half a day after the crash.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xinhua News Agency said a crane at a construction site snapped and fell onto the tracks, causing damage to rail network facilities as well as the train.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Syria's new leader Ahmed al-Sharaa said on Sunday that weapons in the country, including those held by Kurdish-led forces, would come under state control.
 <br>
  <br>
  Sharaa spoke alongside Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan, after earlier meeting with Lebanese Druze leaders and vowing to end "negative interference" in the neighbouring country.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ankara-backed rebels played a key role in supporting Sharaa's Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), which headed a rebel alliance that seized Damascus on December 8, toppling long-time ruler Bashar al-Assad.
  <br>
  <br>
  During a press conference with Fidan, Sharaa said Syria's armed "factions will begin to announce their dissolution and enter" the army.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will absolutely not allow there to be weapons in the country outside state control, whether from the revolutionary factions or the factions present in the SDF area", he added, referring to the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sharaa also said "we are working on protecting sects and minorities from any attacks that occur between them" and from "external" actors exploiting the situation "to cause sectarian discord".
  <br>
  <br>
  "Syria is a country for all and we can co-exist together," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Syria's nearly 14-year civil war killed more than half-a-million people and displaced more than half its population, with many of them fleeing to neighbouring countries, including three million in Turkey.
  <br>
  <br>
  Turkey has maintained strong ties with Syria's new leaders, and has continued military operations against Kurdish-held areas in northeastern Syria. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A small plane carrying 10 people crashed into shops in the centre of the tourist city of Gramado in southern Brazil on Sunday, killing everyone on board, state government officials said.
 <br>
  <br>
  The aircraft's owner and pilot, Luiz Claudio Galeazzi, died along with the other nine passengers, all of whom were members of his family, according to Rio Grande do Sul Governor Eduardo Leite.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement published on LinkedIn, Galeazzi's company, Galeazzi & Associados, confirmed that the 61-year-old was on the plane, adding that he was traveling with his wife, their three daughters, several other family members and another company employee, who perished in the crash.
  <br>
  <br>
  In addition, 17 people on the ground were injured, Leite said at a press conference, with 12 still receiving hospital care, including two in a critical condition.
  <br>
  <br>
  Manufactured in 1990, the twin-engine Piper PA-42-1000 took off shortly after 9 am local time from nearby Canela airport and was heading to Jundiai in Sao Paulo state under unfavourable weather conditions, the governor said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted that the cause of the crash is being investigated by the Aeronautical Accident Investigation and Prevention Centre (Cenipa).
  <br>
  <br>
  Nestled in a mountainous region, Gramado is the most popular tourist destination in Rio Grande do Sul, which was severely impacted earlier this year by unprecedented floods that claimed dozens of lives, destroyed infrastructure and significantly disrupted the state's economy. (Agencies)

    Panama rejects Trump's threat to retake Panama Canal

<img alt="Panama's president reaffirms his country's sovereignty over the Panama Canal after Donald Trump threatened to retake control. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1784633_1_20241223090126.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Panama's president Jose Raul Mulino on Sunday dismissed recent threats made by US President-elect Donald Trump to retake control of the Panama Canal over complaints of "unfair" treatment of American ships.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Every square metre of the Panama Canal and its adjacent areas belongs to Panama and will continue belonging to Panama," Mulino said in a video posted to social media platform, X.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mulino's public comments, though never mentioning Trump by name, come a day after the president-elect complained about the canal on his Truth Social platform.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our Navy and Commerce have been treated in a very unfair and injudicious way. The fees being charged by Panama are ridiculous," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Panama Canal was completed by the United States in 1914 and returned to the Central American country under a 1977 deal signed by Democratic president Jimmy Carter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Panama took full control in 1999.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said if Panama could not ensure "the secure, efficient and reliable operation" of the channel, "then we will demand that the Panama Canal be returned to us, in full, and without question."
  <br>
  <br>
  Mulino rejected Trump's claims in his video message, though he also said he hoped to have "a good and respectful relationship" with the incoming administration.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The canal has no direct or indirect control from China, nor the European Union, nor the United States or any other power," Mulino said. "As a Panamanian, I reject any manifestation that misrepresents this reality."
  <br>
  <br>
  Later on Sunday, Trump responded to Mulino's dismissal, writing on Truth Social: "We'll see about that!" (AFP)

<img alt="People carry a banner that reads ''your hands are bloody'', during a protest against government policies, corruption and the negligence in Belgrade. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1784631_1_20241223085005.jpg&q=80">

<div class="itemFullText">
 Tens of thousands of people streamed into a central square in Serbia's capital on Sunday for a rally against populist President Aleksandar Vucic and his government, whose tight grip on power has been challenged by weeks of street protests led by university students.
 <br>
  <br>
  The rally at Belgrade's Slavija Square, one of the largest in recent years, was called by students and farmer unions. It was part of a wider movement demanding accountability over the November 1 collapse of a canopy at a railway station in the country's north that killed 15 people.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We are all under the canopy,” read one of the banners displayed at the main Belgrade square.
  <br>
  <br>
  Smaller rallies were also held in the cities of Nis and Kragujevac. The protest in Belgrade started with a 15-minute silence for the victims. Later, chants of “You have blood on your hands!” were heard.
  <br>
  <br>
  Many in Serbia blame the collapse on widespread corruption and sloppy work on the railway station building in the city of Novi Sad.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a show of confidence, the Serbian president on Sunday inaugurated a section of a newly-built highway in central Serbia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vucic said he wouldn't budge to opposition demands for a transitional government and accused his opponents of using students to try to seize power.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We will beat them again,” said Vucic. “They (the opposition) don't know what to do but to use someone's children.”
  <br>
  <br>
  In an apparent attempt to defuse the student-led protests, Vucic has been advertising what he said are “favourable” loans for young people to purchase apartments as well as attracting tens of thousands of doctors and other skilled people who have left the Balkan country for a better life in the West in recent years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prosecutors have arrested 13 people over the Novi Sad tragedy, including a government minister whose release later fueled public scepticism about the honesty of the investigation. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 New York City police announced on Sunday that they had in custody a “person of interest” in the early morning death of a woman who was lit on fire by a man she didn't know on a subway train.
 <br>
  <br>
  Police apprehended the suspect after receiving a report from three high school students, who had seen images of the suspect taken from surveillance and police body cam video.
  <br>
  <br>
  “New Yorkers came through again,” said New York City Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch, who described the case as “one of the most depraved crimes one person could possibly commit against another human being.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Tisch said the suspect and the woman, both of whom have not been identified, were riding a subway train without any interaction between them to the end of the line in Brooklyn at around 7.30am.
  <br>
  <br>
  After the train came to a stop, surveillance video from the carriage showed the man “calmly” walk up to the victim, who was seated motionless, possibly sleeping, and set her clothing on fire with what appeared to be a lighter.
  <br>
  <br>
  The woman's clothing then “became fully engulfed in a matter of seconds,” Tisch said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officers on a routine patrol discovered the woman on fire, standing in the middle of the carriage. She was declared dead at the scene.
  <br>
  <br>
  Unbeknownst to the officers, the suspect was seated just outside the train car, on a bench on the platform, Tisch said. Body cameras worn by the officers caught a “very clear, detailed look” at the suspect.
  <br>
  <br>
  The man had a lighter in his pocket when he was taken into custody, Tisch said. (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Washington quarterback Jayden Daniels threw five touchdown passes on Sunday as the Commanders halted Philadelphia's 10-game NFL winning streak with a 36-33 victory in which the Eagles also lost quarterback Jalen Hurts to a concussion.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Commanders piled up 22 points in the fourth quarter, rookie signal-caller Daniels finding Jamison Crowder with a nine-yard touchdown pass with six seconds left to secure what had seemed an unlikely win.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The game's never over until the clock hits zero," Daniels said after a win that kept the Commanders' playoff hopes alive while eliminating Dallas and San Francisco from contention.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It feels awesome," Daniels added. "Everybody can enjoy their Christmas now."
  <br>
  <br>
  "You got those guys that came in on the win streak they were on, they were hot and they’re a very good team," he went on to say. "And rightfully so, good offense, good defence, all-around well-prepared team and you want to go out there and see where you match up against those type of guys."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Eagles, who hadn't lost since September, were without Hurts for most of the game after he hit his head on the turf after a tackle in the first quarter and was ruled out with a concussion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kenny Pickett replaced him and threw for 143 yards with a touchdown and an interception, but at 12-3 the Eagles dropped out of a tie for best record in the NFC and failed to clinch the NFC East division title.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the Detroit Lions remained atop the NFC with a franchise-record 13th victory, cruising past the Bears 34-17 in Chicago.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stung by a loss to Buffalo that snapped their 11-game winning streak, the Lions jumped to a 20-point lead on the way to setting a single-season franchise record for points scored with 493 so far.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lios quarterback Jared Goff threw for 336 yards and three touchdowns, including an 82-yard TD pass to Jameson Williams, who had a career-high 143 receiving yards on five catches.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jahmyr Gibbs ran for 109 yards and a touchdown and the Lions used a trick play in which Goff pretended to stumble to spring tight end Sam LaPorta for a 21-yard touchdown pass on the opening drive of the second half. (AFP/AP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Kylian Mbappé scored a screamer and set up another goal as Real Madrid thrashed Sevilla 4-2 on Sunday to move second in La Liga above stuttering rivals Barcelona.
 <br>
  <br>
  After Atlético Madrid beat Barca on Saturday to claim top spot at Christmas, Carlo Ancelotti's side also took advantage with a comfortable home win which leaves them a point behind the leaders.
  <br>
  <br>
  Madrid coach Ancelotti said ahead of Sevilla's visit that Mbappé's adaptation period had ended following his summer switch from Paris Saint-Germain and the French forward proved the coach right with a strong performance and his 14th goal of the season across all competitions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fede Valverde also netted a brilliant effort from range, with Rodrygo Goes and Brahim Diaz on the scoresheet for the hosts too.
  <br>
  <br>
  Isaac Romero and Dodi Lukebakio scored for Sevilla, although they were thoroughly outplayed on veteran defender Jesus Navas' final game for the club.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think that we know each other better, my arrival changed a lot of things, and now, as the coach said, the adaptation is over and I feel very good in the team," Mbappé said. "We can see on the pitch that I click better with my team-mates and now we're all playing better."
  <br>
  <br>
  Mbappé, back after a brief absence with a thigh injury, scored for Madrid in midweek as they won the Intercontinental Cup.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was welcome relief for the forward after missing two penalties in recent weeks against Liverpool and Athletic Bilbao, as well as suffering criticism for his form.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I know I've got much more in my legs than I'm showing, but in the last games I've played better," Mbappé added. "The Bilbao game was good for me, I hit the bottom, I missed a penalty and it was a moment to realise that I have to give everything for this shirt and show my personality."
  <br>
  <br>
  With Vinícius Júnior suspended, Mbappé took the reins and broke the deadlock in the 10th minute as Madrid brought the ball out from the back and worked it to Rodrygo on the left flank.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Brazilian squared to Mbappé on the edge of the area, who took one touch to control, another to set himself and with his third, smashed a fierce effort past the helpless Álvaro Fernández.
  <br>
  <br>
  Madrid's second, 10 minutes later, was even better, with Valverde firing a screamer into the top corner from over 30 yards out after a short corner routine.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ancelotti's side were in full flow and the third followed in the 34th minute when Lucas Vázquez crossed for Rodrygo, who finished with aplomb. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Joao Fonseca became the second youngest champion of the NextGen ATP tournament on Sunday when he defied his lowly ranking of 145 to defeat Learner Tien in the final.
 <br>
  <br>
  Brazil's Fonseca, 18, came through 2-4, 4-3 (10/8), 4-0, 4-2 to see off his left-handed American opponent.
  <br>
  <br>
  He is the youngest champion at the event since current world number one Jannik Sinner claimed the title also at the age of 18 five years ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I was really nervous before the match. I knew it was going to be so difficult," Fonseca said before lifting the trophy with tennis legend Rafael Nadal watching on from the stands.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I played a final against Learner in juniors at the 2023 US Open and I know the way he can play," he added. "He is such a nice guy and a great player, so I knew it was going to be difficult, mentally and physically. But I got through."
  <br>
  <br>
  Fonseca, the lowest-ranked player in the eight-man field, won all five matches he played this week at the Red Sea venue.
  <br>
  <br>
  He began the year ranked at 730 in the world and having made a maiden ATP quarter-final in Rio this year, he will be aiming to make significant progress in 2025.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I need to believe when I go before a tournament that I can win," Fonseca said. "But now I have won it I am thinking, 'Wow, I made it'. I am very proud of myself." (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Liverpool swept four points clear at the top of the Premier League as Mohamed Salah's masterclass inspired a memorable 6-3 rout of Tottenham, while Manchester United crashed to a humiliating 3-0 home defeat against Bournemouth.
 <br>
  <br>
  Salah delivered a sublime performance featuring two goals and a pair of assists as Arne Slot's side ran riot in north London.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 32-year-old is now Liverpool's fourth top scorer ever with 229 goals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Salah's brace took him past Billy Liddell, with only Ian Rush (346), Roger Hunt (285) and Gordon Hodgson (241) ahead of him.
  <br>
  <br>
  The rampant Reds have won 21 of their 25 matches in all competitions under Slot and have a game in hand on Chelsea to strengthen their lead in the title race.
  <br>
  <br>
  This was a remarkable display of Liverpool's firepower as Luis Díaz and Alexis Mac Allister scored to put them in command.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For 60 minutes we did everything we had to do, we were comfortable and good with the ball – the main thing is we worked very hard," Slot said. "But you have to be on top of your game for the whole game and we didn't do that."
  <br>
  <br>
  James Maddison, Dejan Kulusevski and Dominic Solanke scored for Tottenham, but an eighth league defeat this season leaves them languishing in 11th place as the pressure mounts on Tottenham boss Ange Postecoglou.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If you want to discount the fact we're missing a goalkeeper, two centre-backs and a left-back and that hasn't coincided with how we're doing – I don't know what to say anymore," Postecoglou said of his critics.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, United boss Ruben Amorim, who once again left Marcus Rashford out of his squad, is set for a miserable Christmas following the worst result of his brief reign.
  <br>
  <br>
  Languishing in 13th place, United have suffered four defeats in nine matches in all competitions since Amorim arrived from Sporting Lisbon in November to replace the sacked Erik ten Hag.
  <br>
  <br>
  United's second successive loss after their League Cup exit at Tottenham on Thursday underlined Amorim's belief that their road back to the top will be long and arduous.
  <br>
  <br>
  United, who have conceded first in their last six games, were booed off at half-time, while the final whistle was greeted by more jeers from the few fans who stayed until the bitter end.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This game was hard on us. We suffered again on set-pieces and we were a bit nervous – I felt it in the stadium," Amorim said. "We have to suffer again but we will try to win."
  <br>
  <br>
  Amorim's decision to play without Rashford for the third consecutive game will face fresh scrutiny after United's wretched performance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Amorim surprisingly omitted the 27-year-old England forward from the squad for United's win at Manchester City last weekend, prompting Rashford to hint he was willing to leave the club for a "new challenge".
  <br>
  <br>
  Rashford was at Old Trafford wearing a United tracksuit amid his extended exile as Amorim made six changes from the line-up beaten 4-3 by Tottenham in the League Cup quarter-finals. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chinese world number five Zheng Qinwen pulled out of the season-opening United Cup on Sunday citing the need for more rest, but plans to be at the Australian Open.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 22-year-old is coming off a breakthrough season that reaped three singles titles, with the highlight winning Olympic gold in Paris.
  <br>
  <br>
  She also made her first Grand Slam final, at Melbourne Park, losing in straight sets to current world number one Aryna Sabalenka on the back of playing the mixed-teams United Cup.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zheng has opted for more rest this time ahead of the season-opening major from January 12.
  <br>
  <br>
  "After the long season that 2024 was for me, I need a few extra weeks of rest, recovery, and good training to get ready for the new season," she wrote on Instagram.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I had such a fantastic time at the United Cup in January of this year, and therefore will miss the event greatly.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Still, I'm so excited to be back in Australia soon and I will see you all in Melbourne in a couple of weeks."
  <br>
  <br>
  China begin their United Cup campaign against Brazil in Perth on Friday, leaving world No.175 Gao Xinyu as their top-ranked woman. (AFP)

    Trump threatens to take back Panama Canal

<img alt="Authorities in Panama did not immediately react to the post by the US president-elect. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1784591_1_20241222200032.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Incoming US president Donald Trump on Saturday slammed what he called unfair fees for US ships passing through the Panama Canal and threatened to demand control of the waterway be returned to Washington.
 <br>
  <br>
  He also hinted at China's growing influence around the canal, a worrying trend for American interests as US businesses depend on the channel to move goods between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our Navy and Commerce have been treated in a very unfair and injudicious way. The fees being charged by Panama are ridiculous," he said in a post on his Truth Social platform.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This complete 'rip-off' of our Country will immediately stop."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Panama Canal, which was completed by the United States in 1914, was returned to the Central American country under a 1977 deal signed by Democratic president Jimmy Carter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Panama took full control in 1999.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was solely for Panama to manage, not China, or anyone else," Trump said. "We would and will NEVER let it fall into the wrong hands!"
  <br>
  <br>
  He continued that if Panama could not ensure "the secure, efficient and reliable operation" of the channel, "then we will demand that the Panama Canal be returned to us, in full, and without question."
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities in Panama did not immediately react to Trump's post.
  <br>
  <br>
  Although he does not officially take office until next month, Trump has nevertheless been flexing his political influence in the waning days of President Joe Biden's administration.
  <br>
  <br>
  The real estate mogul boasted on the campaign trail that as an entrepreneur, he was uniquely positioned to fight for US business interests.
  <br>
  <br>
  An estimated five percent of global maritime traffic passes through the Panama Canal, which allows ships traveling between Asia and the US East Coast to avoid the long, hazardous route around the southern tip of South America.
  <br>
  <br>
  The main users of the passage are the United States, China, Japan and South Korea.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Panama Canal Authority reported in October that the waterway had earned record revenues of nearly US$5 billion in the last fiscal year. (AFP)

    Putin vows 'destruction' after Kazan drone strike

<img alt="Videos on Russian social media networks showed drones hitting a high-rise glass building. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1784590_1_20241222194935.jpg&q=30">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Russian President Vladimir Putin on Sunday vowed to bring more "destruction" to Ukraine in retaliation for a drone attack on the central Russian city of Kazan a day earlier.
 <br>
  <br>
  Russia accused Ukraine of a "massive" drone attack that hit a luxury apartment block in the city, some 1,000 kilometres (620 miles) from the frontier.
  <br>
  <br>
  Videos on Russian social media networks showed drones hitting a high-rise glass building and setting off fireballs, though there were no reported casualties as a result of the strike.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Whoever, and however much they try to destroy, they will face many times more destruction themselves and will regret what they are trying to do in our country," Putin said during a televised government meeting on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Putin was addressing the local leader of Tatarstan, the region where Kazan is located, in a road-opening ceremony via video link.
  <br>
  <br>
  The strike on Kazan was the latest in a series of escalating aerial attacks in the nearly three-year conflict.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ukraine has not commented on the strike.
  <br>
  <br>
  Putin has previously threatened to target the centre of Kyiv with a hypersonic ballistic missile in response to Ukrainian attacks on Russian territory.
  <br>
  <br>
  And the defence ministry has called Russian strikes on Ukrainian energy facilities over recent weeks retaliatory hits for Kyiv using Western-supplied missiles to hit Russian air bases and arms factories.
  <br>
  <br>
  The latest threat comes as Russia claimed fresh advances on the battlefield in east Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  The defence ministry said on Telegram that its troops had "liberated" the villages of Lozova in the northeastern Kharkiv region and Krasnoye -- called Sontsivka in Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  The latter is close to the resource hub of Kurakhove, which Russia has almost encircled and would be a key prize in Moscow's attempt to capture the entire Donetsk region.
  <br>
  <br>
  Russia has accelerated its advance across eastern Ukraine in recent months, looking to secure as much territory as possible before US President-elect Donald Trump comes to power in January.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Republican has promised to bring a swift end to the nearly three-year-long conflict, without proposing any concrete terms for a ceasefire or peace deal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Moscow's army claims to have seized more than 190 Ukrainian settlements this year, with Kyiv struggling to hold the line in the face of manpower and ammunition shortages. (AFP)

    Some minor works could be exempted in future: Linn

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Development minister Bernadette Linn said she expects at least a third of the 36,000 illegal housing structures subject to removal orders to be exempted, if legal amendments to the Buildings Ordinance are passed.
 <br>
  <br>
  Officials are proposing to allow certain unauthorised minor works to be kept if they have been checked and proven safe by approved professionals.
  <br>
  <br>
  The plan is to let officials focus on taking enforcement action against serious violations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a TVB programme on Sunday, Linn said the checking fee by authorised experts should cost several thousand dollars on average.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said the government is planning to give homeowners a grace period of three years – after the new laws are passed – to complete the inspection.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Buildings Department is conducting an analysis on this. It's possible that a third or half of these outstanding removal orders involve minor illegal structures," the minister said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That means that at least 10,000 of these orders could be subject to checks."
  <br>
  <br>
  Linn said items that could be exempted in future include enclosed balconies as well as flagpoles that are relatively small in size.
  <br>
  <br>
  The legal amendments also include tougher penalties for serious and major illegal structures, as well as a lower prosecution threshold.
  <br>
  <br>
  The development chief added that under the proposed new rules, people who inherit unauthorised works from the previous owner could still be prosecuted, if they didn't remove them within a certain period of time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Linn said this means that going forward, homebuyers should pay greater attention and exercise more caution when making a purchase.
  <br>
  <br>
  A two-month public consultation on the proposal is due to begin later this month, and the amendment bill could be tabled to the legislature in the first half of 2026.

    Man arrested for alleged burglary, attempted break-in

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police announced on Sunday that they have arrested and charged a 46-year-old man on suspicion of burglary and attempted burglary in connection with a string of cases.
 <br>
  <br>
  Senior Inspector Lau Wing-lam said the suspect is believed to have broken into 11 kindergartens, a construction site and an office in New Territories and Kowloon between May and this month, taking away cash and electronic gadgets worth over HK$230,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our investigation found that the man had acted alone. He pried open door locks or window frames using hard objects during the early hours of the day, and ransacked the place to steal cash and some electronic gadgets, such as computers, phones, and cameras," Lau said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The schools reported losses of more than HK$180,000 between them -- including HK$150,000 in cash -- while the construction site and office lost items worth about HK$43,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officers said they’ve been able to recover some of those items.
  <br>
  <br>
  The man is due to appear at the Fanling Magistrates' Courts on Monday.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A catering sector representative on Sunday said the resumption of the multi-entry visa scheme for Shenzhen residents has given restaurants a much-needed boost over winter solstice.
 <br>
  <br>
  Simon Wong, president of the Hong Kong Federation of Restaurants and Related Trades, said most eateries did “quite well” on Saturday night, with the sector recording nearly HK$400 million in sales.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Especially for Chinese restaurants, they can do two rounds of business, this has been quite good. Compared to last year, business has grown by about eight percent,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Some hotspots, like Tsim Sha Tsui, Causeway Bay and some other areas, were crowded with people.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong also revealed that he's expecting a 10 percent growth in sales over the Christmas and New Year period, with an anticipated surge in visitors from Shenzhen.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Hong Kong can provide the kind of atmosphere for Christmas. When we see that all the shopping malls and even the streets [are] filled with Christmas atmosphere, then people from the mainland would rather come to Hong Kong."
  <br>
  <br>
  The catering representative said he hopes travellers can stay in the SAR for a longer period of time to further boost the local economy.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A train was badly damaged after it crashed into a crane in Shanghai on Sunday morning.
 <br>
  <br>
  No one was injured in the accident.
  <br>
  <br>
  Footage circulating online apparently captured the dramatic moment, when the moving train – running at full speed – collided with the crane.
  <br>
  <br>
  Videos also showed the train suffering a substantial level of damage, with shattered glass all over the floor.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shanghai Metro said on social media that the crane had "intruded" into the track and damaged facilities on route 11 of the network.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said repairs are expected to take a considerable amount of time because of the complicated situation at the scene, adding that commuters should take other modes of transportation.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to mainland media, two cranes were lifting a steel frame just after 8am, when one of them suddenly snapped and hit the moving train.

<img alt="Paul Chan says Hong Kong will be even more proactive in encouraging multilateral exchanges and cooperation. File photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1784566_1_20241222130127.jpg&q=1">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan said on Sunday that the government will roll out more innovative products, systems and cross-border cooperation to boost the capacity and liquidity of the SAR's financial markets.
 <br>
  <br>
  He was responding to comments from President Xi Jinping that both Hong Kong and Macau need to continue to expand global connections and enhance their attractiveness.
  <br>
  <br>
  President Xi made the remarks when he attended the ceremony marking the 25th anniversary of the establishment of the Macau SAR on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among other things, the President also said the SARs have to accelerate their integration into the country's development plan, and play an even better connecting role in the new development paradigm.
  <br>
  <br>
  Writing on his weekly blog, Chan said Hong Kong therefore needs to promote more innovation, such as allowing the mainland to connect with more new emerging markets, while strengthening cooperation with traditional markets.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The higher liquidity and capacity of the Hong Kong market can better satisfy the fundraising needs of firms and organisations amid the geo-political situation and technological advancement," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The finance chief noted that while the country is facing challenges such as protectionism and unilateralism, it remains unwavering in promoting policies for high-level bilateral opening up.
  <br>
  <br>
  To this end, Chan said Hong Kong -- as "a super-connector and super value-adder" -- will be even more proactive in encouraging multilateral exchanges and cooperation.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that Hong Kong will join hands with what he called other brother cities in the Greater Bay Area to go on roadshows and seek foreign investment, and create more win-win business opportunities.

    Airport crowded as people leave HK for Christmas

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong International Airport said on Sunday that it is stepping up services as people begin to fly out for the Christmas break.
 <br>
  <br>
  Long queues snaked around check-in counters at Chek Lap Kok, with many travellers saying they’re excited to take a break.
  <br>
  <br>
  A woman, surnamed Koo, told RTHK she’s off to Thailand for a warm Christmas.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Five of us are joining a meditation camp there, then I'll visit Bangkok and Pattaya for six days. There's not much to do in Hong Kong. The atmosphere here isn't too good because people tend to go home early," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If we go out to Mongkok, I go home when it starts turning dark, probably because of the habits we picked up during the pandemic. But when we're away from the city, we stay up later because the atmosphere is better.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The Kwok family, meanwhile, said they’re looking forward to a white Christmas in Japan.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're going to Osaka! We're so happy! It's so much fun there - and we're going to Universal Studios Japan!" the son said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We bought the tickets way ahead, and we want our kids to experience Christmas somewhere different. If it snows, our kids will be able to look at the natural scenery," the father added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Airport Authority is advising people to travel to the airport via public transport.
  <br>
  <br>
  It had said earlier that it’s expecting to handle around 200,000 passengers daily over the Christmas period, reaching pre-pandemic levels.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President-elect Donald Trump announced on Saturday he has appointed television executive Mark Burnett, who produced the tycoon's reality show 'The Apprentice,' as special envoy to the United Kingdom, one of Washington's closest allies.
 <br>
  <br>
  "With a distinguished career in television production and business, Mark brings a unique blend of diplomatic acumen and international recognition to this important role," the Republican leader posted on his social media platform Truth Social.
  <br>
  <br>
  Burnett's role will be different from that of ambassador and does not need US Senate confirmation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Mark will work to enhance diplomatic relations, focusing on areas of mutual interest, including trade, investment opportunities and cultural exchanges," Trump said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Early this month Trump nominated Warren Stephens, a top Republican donor and billionaire investment banker, to be US ambassador to Britain.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Emmy Award-winning Burnett, who was born in London, is the creator of 'Survivor,' the reality competition series that became a US television juggernaut after its premiere in 2000. He has also produced other hit shows including 'Shark Tank' and 'The Voice.'
  <br>
  <br>
  He also served as chairman of MGM Worldwide Television Group from 2018 to 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  His biggest success was with 'The Apprentice,' the American reality program that aired on NBC under various formats for 15 seasons beginning in 2004.
  <br>
  <br>
  The show was widely credited with reversing Trump's fortunes and making him a household name in the United States before he announced his presidential run in 2015.
  <br>
  <br>
  'The Apprentice' mythologized him anew, and on a much bigger scale, turning him into an icon of American success," a profile of Burnett in The New Yorker magazine stated in 2018. (AFP)

    Usyk one of the world's greats after Fury win

<img alt="Oleksandr Usyk reacts after his fight against Tyson Fury. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1784549_1_20241222081918.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Oleksandr Usyk won his heavyweight championship rematch against Tyson Fury by unanimous decision on Saturday to stay unbeaten across two divisions and underline his right to be counted as one of the all-time greats.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Ukrainian, who forced the pace and repeatedly tagged Fury with his accurate left hook, was awarded the fight 116-112 by all three judges, handing Fury his second straight loss.
  <br>
  <br>
  Usyk's win takes him to 23-0 with 14 knockouts and extends one of the all-time best careers that includes Olympic gold and undisputed champion at cruiserweight.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He's a great fighter, it's a great performance," Usyk, 37, said of Fury, who was unbeaten over 35 fights until he lost their four-belt unification bout in May. "Unbelievable 24 rounds for my career."
  <br>
  <br>
  Only the WBA, WBO and WBC belts were on the line this time after Usyk, focused on the lucrative rematch, relinquished his IBF title rather than face challenger Daniel Dubois.
  <br>
  <br>
  By beating Fury seven months ago, "The Cat" had already joined the likes of Muhammad Ali, Joe Louis and Mike Tyson as undisputed heavyweight, and the first of the four-belt era.
  <br>
  <br>
  The defeat opens up an uncertain future for the 36-year-old Fury, now 34-2-1, who announced his retirement in 2022 only to change his mind and return to the ring.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fury, wearing a Santa-style red-and-white robe and bushy beard, appeared to Mariah Carey's "All I Want For Christmas Is You", before a determined-looking Usyk strode out in Cossack gear.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 6ft 9ins (206cm) Briton's jab held Usyk at bay early on and he landed a jarring right in round two. Usyk caught Fury flush with a left as he raised the pace in round three.
  <br>
  <br>
  They went toe-to-toe in a punishing fifth round, with Fury pummelling body shots while Usyk launched a flurry to the head. In the sixth, he stung Fury with a clean shot to the nose.
  <br>
  <br>
  The supremely fit Usyk, renowned for taking charge in the closing rounds, was the aggressor in the seventh, tagging Fury with a hook as the "Gypsy King" backed away.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fury regained the initiative in the ninth, wielding his jab and one-two combinations and leaning on the Ukrainian, utilising his career-heaviest 281lb (127.4kg) of weight.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was see-saw stuff as they traded blows but Usyk rocked Fury in the 11th with a lightning combination that ended with yet another left hook to the face.
  <br>
  <br>
  An Usyk uppercut to Fury's chin highlighted a furious final round and there was little doubt about the winner as the Ukrainian sank to his knees, arms aloft.
  <br>
  <br>
  Reports put the prize purse at US$190 million, with Usyk, as defending champion, expected to receive the bigger share -- a reversal of fortunes from May.
  <br>
  <br>
  The fight sits high in the portfolio of Saudi Arabia's oil-funded push into sports, which has drawn accusations of "sportswashing" its dubious human rights record.
  <br>
  <br>
  After Formula One, the LIV Golf tour, Newcastle United and a swathe of ageing football stars, the kingdom's strategy confirmed its crowning moment this month when it was awarded football's 2034 World Cup. (AFP

    Stellantis backtracks over planned Jeep layoffs

<div class="itemFullText">
 Stellantis confirmed Saturday it was reversing a decision to lay off 1,100 workers at its Jeep plant in the US state of Ohio, following the ouster of embattled chief executive Carlos Tavares.
 <br>
  <br>
  "No employees will be placed on indefinite layoff on January 5, 2025, due to the previously announced shift reduction. Employees are expected to return to work as scheduled after the new year," a Stellantis spokesperson said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The decision comes as "Stellantis continues to reassess its strategy in North America," the spokesperson added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The automaker had announced the job cuts at the plant in Toledo, Ohio in early November, saying it was part of an effort to "regain its competitive edge" amid struggles with falling sales.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stellantis, a 14-brand group that includes Chrysler, Peugeot and Fiat, had planned to trim operations at the Toledo South Assembly Plant from two shifts to one.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another 400 employees were to be transferred to a "third-party service provider."
  <br>
  <br>
  Stellantis sales sank in the third quarter, with a 42 percent drop in North America alone. The group offered promotional deals as US dealerships struggled to reduce their inventories.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Stellantis has significantly revised its approach since Tavares's December 1 exit, with the new interim CEO giving guarantees to the French and Italian governments on maintaining its production and investments in both countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  The French-Italian-American company had 258,000 employees worldwide at the end of 2003. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Manchester City slumped to their ninth defeat in 12 matches at Aston Villa on Saturday as Arsenal dismantled Crystal Palace 5-1 to reignite their Premier League title charge.
 <br>
  <br>
  Nottingham Forest stormed Brentford's fortress to briefly climb to third in the table and Alexander Isak scored his first hat-trick in the English top flight as Newcastle ran riot at Ipswich.
  <br>
  <br>
  City boss Pep Guardiola -- in the worst spell of his managerial career -- made multiple changes following last week's painful derby defeat to Manchester United but it was to no avail as his injury-hit side lost 2-1.

  <br>
  Jhon Duran scored his seventh Premier League goal of the season to put Villa ahead in the 16th minute and Morgan Rogers doubled the advantage for the impressive home side in the 65th minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  Phil Foden scored his first top-flight goal of the season in stoppage time but it proved too little too late for the flailing champions, whose spark has vanished.
  <br>
  <br>
  City have now lost six Premier League games in the current campaign, twice as many as they suffered during the whole of last season, when they were crowned champions for the fourth time in a row.
  <br>
  <br>
  Guardiola said he trusted his players to turn things around despite their shocking run of just one win from their past 12 games in all competitions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have to think positive and I have incredible trust in the guys," he told the BBC. "Some of them have incredible pride and desire to do it. We have to find a way, step by step, sooner or later to find a way back."
  <br>
  <br>
  A bullish Mikel Arteta said Arsenal, who have not won the Premier League title since 2004, are now firmly in the title picture after his team's thumping win at Selhurst Park.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gabriel Jesus, who scored a hat-trick against Palace in the League Cup on Wednesday, scored two more against the same opponents and there were also goals for Kai Havertz, Gabriel Martinelli and substitute Declan Rice.
  <br>
  <br>
  The third-placed Gunners are just three points behind Liverpool, who are in action at Tottenham on Sunday, but Arne Slot's men have played two games fewer. Chelsea are in second spot.
  <br>
  <br>
  At one stage earlier this month Liverpool had a yawning nine-point lead at the top of the Premier League.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are not even halfway so we're going to try and set something. For us it's on," Arteta told Sky Sports.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm going to enjoy Christmas with my family because when you win it's always better," added the Spaniard, whose side have finished as Premier League runners-up for the past two seasons.
  <br>
  <br>
  Forest won their third consecutive Premier League match to keep up their push for European football, condemning Brentford to their first home defeat this season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ola Aina slotted home the opener towards the end of the first half and Anthony Elanga made it 2-0 early in the second period.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's about enjoying the moment," said Forest boss Nuno Espirito Santo. "It's a very hard competition. Every game is so difficult and the next one is going to be very tough.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're very proud of all the things we've been able to achieve, but we've achieved nothing yet."
  <br>
  <br>
  Newcastle deepened Ipswich's plight and lifted themselves to seventh in the table with a 4-0 win at Portman Road.
  <br>
  <br>
  Isak volleyed Eddie Howe's team ahead in the first minute and Jacob Murphy doubled Newcastle's lead before Isak side-footed in from close range just before the break.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Sweden international scored his third nine minutes into the second half, poking the ball home after more fine work from Murphy.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was a ninth defeat in 17 games for Ipswich since they returned to the Premier League and they remain in the relegation zone, two points from safety.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mats Wieffer gave Brighton a 51st-minute lead against West Ham at the London Stadium but Mohammed Kudus equalised seven minutes later and the match finished 1-1.
  <br>
  <br>
  Away from Saturday's action, Premier League basement club Southampton named former Roma and Torino boss Ivan Juric as their new manager, replacing the sacked Russell Martin. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Saturday visited the site of a car-ramming attack on a crowded Christmas market that killed five people and injured more than 200 as he called for unity while condemning the "terrible catastrophe."
 <br>
  <br>
  Police arrested a 50-year-old Saudi doctor of psychiatry at the scene, next to the battered BMW SUV that had ploughed through the festive crowd on Friday night, leaving a trail of carnage and bloodied casualties.
  <br>
  <br>
  A sombre Scholz, dressed in black, was joined by national and regional politicians in the eastern city of Magdeburg, where they laid flowers outside the main church.
  <br>
  <br>
  He pledged that Germany would respond "with the full force of the law" to the attack but also called for unity as Germany has been rocked by a heated debate on immigration and security as it heads towards elections in February.
  <br>
  <br>
  The centre-left chancellor said it was important "that we stick together, that we link arms, that it is not hatred that determines our coexistence but the fact that we are a community that seeks a common future."
  <br>
  <br>
  He said he was grateful for expressions of "solidarity ... from many, many countries around the world" and added that "it is good to hear that we as Germans are not alone in the face of this terrible catastrophe."
  <br>
  <br>
  Mourning and bereaved residents had already left candles, flowers and children's toys at the Johanneskirche church, where a memorial service was planned at 7:00 pm (1800 GMT).
  <br>
  <br>
  As Germany was reeling from the shocking attack, which came eight years after a jihadist strike on a Berlin Christmas market claimed 13 lives, more details emerged about the Saudi man under arrest.
  <br>
  <br>
  Named by German media as Taleb A, he was a doctor who had lived in Germany since 2006 and held a permanent residence permit, working in a clinic near Magdeburg.
  <br>
  <br>
  He had long also worked as a rights activist who supported Saudi women and described himself as a "Saudi atheist". He had voiced strongly anti-Islam views, echoing the rhetoric of the far-right, according to his social media posts and past interviews.
  <br>
  <br>
  As his views expressed online grew more radical, he accused Germany's past governments of a plan to "Islamise Europe" and voiced fears he was being targeted by authorities.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Bild daily reported that an initial drug test had proved positive, after police officers on Friday used a test kit that can detect narcotics ranging from cannabis to cocaine and methamphetamines. (AFP)

 Ten people, including four children, have been killed in a stampede in Nigeria’s capital city as a large crowd gathered to collect food items distributed by a local church at a Christmas event, the police said on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The stampede occurred in the early morning hours at the Holy Trinity Catholic Church in Maitama, a high-brow part of Abuja, from where more than 1,000 people have been evacuated, police spokesman Josephine Adeh said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is the second such stampede in a week in Africa’s most populous country as local organisations, churches and individuals are increasingly organising charity events ahead of Christmas amid the country’s worst cost-of-living crisis in a generation. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Cyclone Chido, which ravaged the French archipelago of Mayotte, has claimed 76 lives in Mozambique, the National Institute of Risk and Disaster Management said on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chido made landfall in Mozambique on Sunday after tearing through the Indian Ocean island of Mayotte where hundreds of people are feared to have been killed.
  <br>
  <br>
  The cyclone struck Mozambique in northern Cabo Delgado province and destroyed nearly 62,000 homes, according to officials.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Shelter, food and Non-food items (NFIs) - particularly hygiene kits, dignity kits, soap and mosquito nets are identified as being the most urgent needs for the affected population," the International Organisation for Migration said in a statement. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 George Eastham, a member of England's 1966 World Cup-winning squad, has died at the age of 88, his former club Stoke City announced on their website on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Eastham, whose father also named George once played for England, won 19 caps for his country between 1963 and 1966.
  <br>
  <br>
  He did not play in England's 1966 campaign on home soil but the Blackpool-born winger was part of Alf Ramsey's squad that lifted the World Cup.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eastham made 124 and 207 league appearances for Newcastle and Arsenal respectively before moving to Stoke in 1966.
  <br>
  <br>
  Three years earlier he had been involved in a court case against the so-called 'slavery contracts' which improved players' freedom to move between clubs and duly reformed the British transfer market.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Stoke City Football Club family is immensely saddened by the passing of club legend George Eastham OBE at the age of 88," his former club said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eastham represented the club for eight seasons in the top division of the English game.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He is perhaps best remembered as the man whose goal secured the 1972 League Cup in a 2-1 victory over Chelsea at Wembley," said Stoke.
  <br>
  <br>
  After retiring, Eastham tried his hand at management, taking charge of Stoke for a short spell in the late 1970s.
  <br>
  <br>
  He later emigrated to South Africa where he was a football coach for local black children. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A Thai national was sentenced to death and two Germans were handed life sentences for the gruesome murder of a German real estate broker near the resort town of Pattaya, Thai media reported.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Pattaya Provincial Court delivered the death sentence to Shahrukh Karim Uddin, a Thai of Pakistani descent, on Friday for the murder of Peter Ralter Mack, 62, in July 2023, the Bangkok Post newspaper reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mack's dismembered body was found inside a freezer covered in a thick layer of tape at a residence in an outer Pattaya suburb in southern Thailand's Chonburi province.
  <br>
  <br>
  German nationals Olaf Thorsten Brinkmann and Petra Christl Grundgreif confessed to the crime during the trial and their sentences were reduced from capital punishment to life in prison as a result.
  <br>
  <br>
  All three defendants were found guilty of premeditated murder and concealing a body.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mack disappeared after telling his wife he was meeting another property realtor, although his family later believed he had been lured away and kidnapped.
  <br>
  <br>
  The court heard evidence that the group planned to dispose of Mack's body at sea and transferred 3.35 million baht (US$98,000) out of his bank account. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Organisers of an exhibition football match between former Real Madrid and Barcelona stars have issued an apology, after arrangements for a meet-and-greet session with veteran players reportedly left some fans disappointed.
 <br>
  <br>
  On Friday, Real Madrid fans complained they paid HK$6,880 to meet the La Liga legends but were unable to get their autographs and take photos with them.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to organisers, fans could purchase an "experience set" that included a ticket to the star-studded match at Hong Kong Stadium, an autograph session with either one of the teams in the morning, and other merchandise items.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Real Madrid Hong Kong Fans Club said "an unpleasant incident" happened at the meeting and had notified the police.
  <br>
  <br>
  The club also accused the organisers of not following through with their remedial measures such as arranging for a group photo to be taken before the match, and that fans were unable to hand their own memorabilia directly to the players for a signature.
  <br>
  <br>
  In an apology on Saturday, organisers said they're keeping in close contact with the fans club and those affected to "properly handle relevant matters."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Regarding the issue that arose in [Friday's] signing event, we have done our best to deal with it immediately and are proactively working out solutions with affected fans and related parties," they said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are aware that this incident has aroused public attention, and we deeply apologise for the inconvenience and confusion caused."
  <br>
  <br>
  Organisers also vowed to make better arrangements to avoid similar situations from happening again.

    Thousands celebrate winter solstice at Stonehenge

<img alt="Research suggests Stonehenge may have had political as well as spiritual significance. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1784513_1_20241221183146.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Thousands of tourists, pagans, druids and people simply yearning for the promise of spring marked the dawn of the shortest day of the year at the ancient Stonehenge monument on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Revellers cheered and beat drums as the sun rose at 8:09 am (0809 GMT) over the giant standing stones on the winter solstice – the shortest day and the longest night in the Northern Hemisphere. No one could see the sun through the low winter cloud, but that did not deter a flurry of drumming, chanting and singing as dawn broke.
  <br>
  <br>
  There will be less than eight hours of daylight in England on Saturday – but after that, the days get longer until the summer solstice in June.
  <br>
  <br>
  The solstices are the only occasions when visitors can go right up to the stones at Stonehenge, and thousands are willing to rise before dawn to soak up the atmosphere.
  <br>
  <br>
  The stone circle, whose giant pillars each took 1,000 people to move, was erected starting about 5,000 years ago by a sun-worshipping Neolithic culture. Its full purpose is still debated: Was it a temple, a solar calculator, a cemetery, or some combination of all three?
  <br>
  <br>
  In a paper published in the journal Archaeology International, researchers from University College London and Aberystwyth University said the site on Salisbury Plain, about 128 kilometres southwest of London, may have had political as well as spiritual significance.
  <br>
  <br>
  That follows from the recent discovery that one of Stonehenge’s stones – the unique stone lying flat at the centre of the monument, dubbed the “altar stone” – originated in Scotland, hundreds of miles north of the site. Some of the other stones were brought from the Preseli Hills in southwest Wales, nearly 240 kilometres to the west,
  <br>
  <br>
  Lead author Mike Parker Pearson from UCL’s Institute of Archaeology said the geographical diversity suggests Stonehenge may have served as a "monument of unification for the peoples of Britain, celebrating their eternal links with their ancestors and the cosmos." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Pakistani Taliban claimed a brazen overnight raid on an army outpost near the border with Afghanistan on Saturday, which intelligence officials said killed 16 soldiers and critically wounded five more.
 <br>
  <br>
  The siege started after midnight and lasted about two hours as around 30 militants pummelled the mountainous outpost from three sides, one senior intelligence official said on condition of anonymity.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Sixteen soldiers were martyred and five were critically injured in the assault," he said. "The militants set fire to the wireless communication equipment, documents and other items present at the checkpoint."
  <br>
  <br>
  A second intelligence official also anonymously confirmed the toll of dead and wounded in the attack in the Makeen area of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, 40 kilometres from the Afghan border.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pakistan's domestic chapter of the Taliban claimed the attack in a statement, saying it was staged "in retaliation for the martyrdom of our senior commanders."
  <br>
  <br>
  The group claimed to have seized a hoard of military gear including machine guns and a night vision device.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pakistan's military has not yet issued a statement on the incident.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pakistan has been battling a resurgence of militant violence in its western border regions since the Taliban's 2021 return to power in Afghanistan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Islamabad accuses Kabul's rulers of failing to root out militants staging attacks on Pakistan from over the border.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Pakistani Taliban – known as Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) – share a common ideology with their Afghan counterparts who surged back to power three years ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kabul's new rulers have pledged to evict foreign militant groups from Afghan soil.
  <br>
  <br>
  But a UN Security Council report in July estimated up to 6,500 TTP fighters are based there – and said "the Taliban do not conceive of TTP as a terrorist group."
  <br>
  <br>
  The report said the Afghan Taliban show "ad hoc support to, and tolerance of, TTP operations, including the supplying of weapons and permission for training."
  <br>
  <br>
  The spike in attacks has soured Islamabad-Kabul relations. Security was cited as one reason for Pakistan's campaign last year to evict hundreds of thousands of undocumented Afghan migrants. (AFP)

 A projectile fired from Yemen struck Israel's commercial hub of Tel Aviv early on Saturday, wounding 16 people, the military and emergency service providers said, the second such attack within days.
 <br>
  <br>
  Israel's military said it had failed to intercept the projectile, which struck a district of Tel Aviv municipality, forcing many residents to leave their homes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yemen's Houthi rebels later claimed responsibility for the attack, saying it used a ballistic missile and was directed at "a military target of the Israeli enemy."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Iranian-backed Houthis have repeatedly launched missile attacks against Israel in solidarity with Palestinians since the war in Gaza began more than a year ago, most of which have been intercepted.
  <br>
  <br>
  In return, Israel has struck multiple targets in Yemen, including ports and energy facilities in areas controlled by the Huthis. (AFP)

    Winter solstice drives Hongkongers to spend more

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hongkongers appeared to be more generous with their spending as they prepared for winter solstice gatherings on Saturday, but wet market stall-holders remained cautious about their business.
 <br>
  <br>
  The day, in Chinese tradition, is typically celebrated with family, when people gather for a meal at home or at a restaurant.
  <br>
  <br>
  People at wet markets were looking to spend a bit more than usual, with some opting to shop for hot pot.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I plan to spend around HK$1,000... I think I should stay home to celebrate during holidays," said shopper Ma.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another shopper, surnamed Cheung, said he was willing to almost double his usual spending of HK$300 and had a budget of more than HK$500.
  <br>
  <br>
  But vendors at wet markets were not hoping for a jump in business on the festive day.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There isn't much of a difference nowadays whether it's a holiday or not... There are fewer large families and fewer people are buying ingredients at the market," said merchant Yeung. "Business has gotten worse one year after the other."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Business has been a bit quieter than before... Although there were fewer people, some still came to the wet market to shop because they know it's winter solstice," said another stall owner.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Cleveland Cavaliers delivered a reality check to newly crowned NBA Cup champions Milwaukee on Friday, dominating the Bucks 124-101 to push their league-best record to 24-4.
 <br>
  <br>
  Donovan Mitchell scored 27 points and Darius Garland added 16 for the Cavs, who led by as many as 36 points as the Bucks struggled in the absence of injured guard Damian Lillard.
  <br>
  <br>
  Giannis Antetokounmpo, who led the Bucks to victory in the NBA Cup final against the Oklahoma City Thunder on Tuesday, scored 33 points with 14 rebounds and three steals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Khris Middleton, back from illness, scored 14 points off the bench for Milwaukee, but starting guards Andre Jackson Jr and AJ Green were a combined 0-for-9 from the field, neither contributing a point.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Cavaliers, winners of seven of their last eight, improved to 15-1 at home and got good news with the season debut of Max Strus – who had been sidelined with hip and ankle injuries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Strus scored nine points in 19:07 minutes off the bench for Cleveland and drilled three of their 20 three-pointers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We did it on both ends of the floor," Mitchell said. "We set the tone, offensively, defensively. Knowing they had a long trip back (we were) trying to get going early, push the pace, and we did it for 48 minutes."
  <br>
  <br>
  Bucks coach Doc Rivers, who had called it "weird" to pick up regular-season action after playing the semi-finals and final of the in-season tournament in Las Vegas, said the game was not a good gauge of where the Bucks are.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We were flat, tired, whatever you want to call it," Rivers said. "There's no read on tonight's game... give them all the credit."
  <br>
  <br>
  In Philadelphia, the 76ers' star center Joel Embiid wore a protective mask as he returned after missing one game because of a sinus fracture to score 34 points in a 108-98 victory over the Charlotte Hornets.
  <br>
  <br>
  Embiid, who had been expected to sit out at least through Saturday after taking an inadvertent blow to the face last week, added five rebounds, nine assists, two steals and two blocked shots.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tyrese Maxey scored 23 points and Kelly Oubre Jr added 22 for Philadelphia, who notched their fourth win in five games as they try to climb into the race for a play-in berth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Embiid has been largely absent from the Sixers' stuttering season. The 2023 NBA Most Valuable Player was appearing in just his seventh game of the campaign after his troublesome left knee delayed his season debut.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Oklahoma City Thunder, who fell to the Bucks in the Cup final on Tuesday, notched their second victory since then, beating the Heat 104-97 in Milwaukee.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jalen Williams scored 33 points and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander added 25 for the Thunder, who were coming off a victory over the Orlando Magic on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tyler Herro scored 28 points and grabbed 12 rebounds to lead the Heat, but Miami clearly missed the contribution of star forward Jimmy Butler, who departed in the first quarter and was ruled out for the rest of the game because of illness.
  <br>
  <br>
  Miami's Bam Adebayo departed briefly in the third quarter after taking an accidental elbow over his left eye. He returned after receiving seven stitches and finished with 17 points and 10 rebounds. (AFP)

    Indian denies hospital rape and murder of doctor

<img alt="Tens of thousands of ordinary Indians joined doctors in protests after the brutal attack. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1784491_1_20241221151438.jpg&q=60">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An Indian man on trial for raping and murdering a 31-year-old doctor has pleaded not guilty, his lawyer said on Saturday, a crime that appalled the nation and triggered wide-scale protests.
 <br>
  <br>
  The discovery of the doctor's bloodied body at a government hospital in the eastern city of Kolkata on August 9 sparked nationwide anger at the chronic issue of violence against women.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sanjoy Roy, 33, the lone accused in the case, pleaded not guilty before the judge in a closed court on Friday in Kolkata, his lawyer Sourav Bandyopadhyay said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I am not guilty, your honour, I have been framed," Roy told the court, Bandyopadhyay said, repeating his client's words.
  <br>
  <br>
  Roy, a civic volunteer in the hospital, was arrested the day after the murder and has been held in custody since.
  <br>
  <br>
  He would potentially face the death penalty if convicted.
  <br>
  <br>
  The court began hearings on November 11, listening to evidence from some 50 witnesses, but it was on Friday that Roy took the stand.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Judge Anirban Das questioned him with more than 100 questions during the six-hour-long on-camera deposition, that continued until late in the evening," Bandyopadhyay said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Roy had earlier proclaimed his innocence to the public while screaming from a prison van outside the court before a hearing in November.
  <br>
  <br>
  Doctors in Kolkata went on strike for weeks in response to the brutal attack.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tens of thousands of ordinary Indians joined in the protests, which focused anger on the lack of measures for female doctors to work without fear.
  <br>
  <br>
  India's Supreme Court has ordered a national task force to examine how to bolster security for healthcare workers, saying the brutality of the killing had "shocked the conscience of the nation."
  <br>
  <br>
  The gruesome nature of the attack drew comparisons with the 2012 gang rape and murder of a young woman on a Delhi bus, which also sparked weeks of nationwide protests.
  <br>
  <br>
  The trial continues. The next hearing is set for January 2, 2025. (AFP)

    'Voluntary reporting of illegal structure not amnesty'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Development Bernadette Linn said on Saturday that a proposal to bring back the mechanism for voluntary reporting of unauthorised building works in village houses in the New Territories doesn't equate to granting them amnesty.
 <br>
  <br>
  The previous reporting period lasted for eight months in 2012.
  <br>
  <br>
  Property owners who reported unauthorised building works that were built on or before June 28 2011 and imposed less risk didn’t have to fix them immediately, but had to conduct regular safety inspections every five years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Linn said that the department doesn’t have enough staff to deal with all the cases at present, but stressed that the scheme does not mean property owners don't need to do anything.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It’s not like we won’t prosecute you for the unauthorised works even if you have find someone to conduct regular inspections,” she said on an RTHK radio programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  Linn said it may take until 2030 for the department to complete other more urgent matters in urban areas, and then they'll look at how to handle the village house situations.
  <br>
  <br>
  The development minister noted that the Buildings Department has so far checked  roughly 60,000 village houses, out of about 99,000, and found that around half had unauthorised building work.
  <br>
  <br>
  There could be over 100,000 unauthorised building works among all village houses in total, she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, Linn reiterated plans to toughen fines for unauthorised building works isn’t about punishing people, but about getting them to take the issue seriously.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government hopes to amend the Buildings Ordinance, including raising the maximum fine for unauthorised building works from HK$400,000 to HK$2 million, alongside the existing risk of a two-year prison term.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities are also proposing a fixed penalty of HK$6,000 for owners who ignore statutory building inspection notices, which apply to premises that are 30 years old or more.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The government's intention is not to punish our property owners or citizens. What we hope is that through our legislation, we can establish rigorous provisions that encourage and urge everyone to comply with the law,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have many ageing buildings. We want to prompt everyone to take the requirement for building inspections seriously."
  <br>
  <br>
  She said officials will seek input from the public and professional groups when the two-month consultation on the proposal begins later this month.

    Paediatrician warns of 'severe' flu season

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A paediatrician on Saturday has urged the public not to lower their guard this flu season, urging Hongkongers to get vaccinated for what could be a severe winter flu season.
 <br>
  <br>
  Mike Kwan, from the University of Hong Kong's Department of Paediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, said infection numbers are expected to spike in January.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kwan said the SAR's flu season might be comparable to Australia's experience earlier this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Just looking back [at] Australia, the Southern Hemisphere, the flu season in fact was quite severe. So I expect, in the Northern Hemisphere this winter, our flu season will still be quite severe," Kwan said after appearing on a radio programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is why we are advocating the flu vaccination to all our citizens. The severity of flu infections in our community really depends on the percentage of our vaccinations, what we regard as herd immunity."
  <br>
  <br>
  Kwan said the vaccination rate among children aged six months to three years was relatively low.

 The chairman of Ocean Park said on Saturday that thousands of visitors have flocked daily to see An An and Ke Ke, the pair of pandas gifted by the central government, since their public debut earlier this month.
 <br>
  <br>
  Paulo Pong also told a Commercial Radio Programme that he's optimistic that December visitor numbers will show a significant increase.

  “We've noticed more visitors from Southeast Asia, and it's great to see people from Europe and the US coming back too. That's why we are expecting good results this month,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pong said tourists from India and the Philippines are surging as well.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Tourists from India are topping the charts this year, with a fourfold increase for 2023-2024. Well, the base numbers might be low, but the growth from India and the Philippines is still quite impressive,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Many local families are also expected to visit the theme park over the weekend and also the upcoming Christmas and New Year holidays, he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The theme park posted a deficit of more than HK$71 million for the financial year ending in June even though visitor numbers and revenue reached five-year high.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pong said 30 percent of the park’s spending is earmarked for conservation and education work, which he described as “hard to measure in monetary terms.”
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the park understands the importance of achieving break-even and will work hard to broaden its income sources, including launching panda-themed products and attracting new visitors.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also expressed hope of getting longer term government subsidies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Currently, Ocean Park receives government funding of HK$280 million each year to cover its expenditure on conservation and education work. But this is scheduled to end in 2026.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, Pong noted experts estimated the twin panda cubs will be safe and ready to meet the public when they turn six months old, which will be around February.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he said it might be tricky to have the twins and their parents, Ying Ying and Le Le, appear together in one venue, noting the park needs to monitor how they interact and their safety is the park's priority.

<div class="itemFullText">
 German police arrested a Saudi Arabian man after a deadly car-ramming attack on a Christmas market Friday in which an SUV barrelled through a crowd of revellers at high speed, leaving a trail of bloody carnage.
 <br>
  <br>
  At least two people were killed, one of them a young child, and 68 injured, said authorities in the city of Magdeburg, located about 130 kilometres (80 miles) southwest of Berlin.
  <br>
  <br>
  The suspect was a 50-year-old medical doctor from Saudi Arabia living in the eastern state of Saxony-Anhalt, said regional premier Reiner Haseloff, speaking at a scene cordoned off and guarded by police commandos.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have arrested the perpetrator, a man from Saudi Arabia, a doctor who has been in Germany since 2006," he told reporters, calling the attack a "catastrophe" for the city and the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  "From what we currently know he was a lone attacker so we don't think there is any further danger."
  <br>
  <br>
  German media partially named the suspect as Taleb A. and said he was a doctor of psychiatry.
  <br>
  <br>
  The black BMW barrelled through the crowd at high speed just after 7:00 pm local time (1800 GMT) when the market was filled with revellers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Video footage showed the driver's arrest as police with their handguns trained shouted "lie down, hands on your back, don't move!" at the bearded man with glasses who was lying on the ground next to the heavily damaged car.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police said the vehicle drove "at least 400 metres across the Christmas market" leaving a trail of bloodied casualties, debris and broken glass at the city's central town hall square.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ambulances and fire engines rushed to the chaotic site, which was doused in blue police lights and wailing sirens, as badly injured people were treated on site and rushed off to hospitals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cries and screams rang out as around 100 emergency responders deployed to the litter-strewn market decorated with Christmas trees and festive lights.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The pictures are terrible," said city spokesman Michael Reif.
  <br>
  <br>
  The deadly carnage recalled a 2016 jihadist attack in which a Tunisian man driving a lorry killed 12 people in a Christmas market in Berlin, the country's worst such attack.
  <br>
  <br>
  A 13th victim died later having suffered serious injuries in the assault, claimed by the Islamic State (IS) group.
  <br>
  <br>
  German Chancellor Olaf Scholz wrote on X that "the reports from Magdeburg raise the worst fears".
  <br>
  <br>
  "My thoughts are with the victims and their families. We stand by their side and by the side of the people of Magdeburg. My thanks go to the dedicated rescue workers in these anxious hours."
  <br>
  <br>
  Scholz was expected to travel to the city on Saturday, said the state premier.
  <br>
  <br>
  German Interior Minister Nancy Faeser has recently called on people to be vigilant at Christmas markets, although she said that authorities had not received any specific threats.
  <br>
  <br>
  The domestic security service had warned it considers Christmas markets to be an "ideologically suitable target for Islamist-motivated people". (AFP)

    Congress passes funding bill with Democrat help

<img alt="US president-elect Donald Trump has made it clear he's willing to see a shutdown if he does not get his way on the spending package. File photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1784460_1_20241221090155.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The US House of Representatives voted on Friday to avert a government shutdown with just hours to spare, with Democrats joining Republicans to advance a funding bill keeping the lights on through mid-March.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lawmakers sent a package to the Senate that would keep federal agencies running through mid-March -- but the upper chamber only has until midnight (0500 GMT) to follow suit or federal agencies will begin shutting.
  <br>
  <br>
  Although the House is run by the Republicans, who introduced the bill, 34 of the party's backbenchers voted against it, while almost every Democrat was a yes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Today, Democrats stood firm in our commitment to collaboration, not division. The American people deserve a government that works for them," senior Democratic Congressman Bennie Thompson posted on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  If senators drag their feet, the government will still cease to be funded at midnight, and non-essential operations will start to grind to a halt, with up to 875,000 workers furloughed and 1.4 million more required to work without pay.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Democratic-led upper chamber would be expected to follow the House, however, and the main question now is how quickly senators will move.
  <br>
  <br>
  Congress's setting of government budgets is always a fraught task, with both chambers closely divided between Republicans and Democrats.
  <br>
  <br>
  The latest drama intensified after Republican President-elect Trump and tech billionaire Musk, his incoming "efficiency czar," pressured his party to renege on a funding bill they had hammered out with Democrats.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two subsequent efforts to find compromise fell short, leaving Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson at the last chance saloon as he huddled with aides to keep government agencies running.
  <br>
  <br>
  If the bill fails Senate scrutiny, non-essential government functions will be put on ice. Employees in key services like law enforcement would continue working but would only be paid once government functions are back up.
  <br>
  <br>
  Many parks, monuments and national sites would close at a time when millions of visitors are expected.
  <br>
  <br>
  The House-passed bill avoids all that by funding the government until mid-March in a package that includes IS$110 billion in disaster aid and financial relief for farmers.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is essentially the same as a bill that failed miserably in a vote on Thursday -- except without a two-year suspension of the country's self-imposed borrowing limit demanded by Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  Musk appeared again to be doing his best to marshal conservatives against the deal ahead of the House vote, as he posted: "So is this a Republican bill or a Democrat bill?"
  <br>
  <br>
  The influence of the world's richest man over the Republicans -- and his apparent sway with Trump -- has become a focus for Democratic attack, with questions raised over how an unelected citizen can wield so much power.
  <br>
  <br>
  There is growing anger even among Republicans over Musk's interference after he trashed the original funding agreement in a blizzard of posts -- many of them wildly inaccurate -- on his social media platform X.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Last time I checked, Elon Musk doesn't have a vote in Congress," Georgia House Republican Rich McCormick told CNN.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Now, he has influence, and he'll put pressure on us to do whatever he thinks the right thing is for him. But I have 760,000 people that voted for me to do the right thing for them."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Senate's expected rubber stamp could take days under the rules governing the upper chamber, unless members agree unanimously to waive normal procedure.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has been clear that he is willing to see a shutdown if he does not get his way. (AFP)

<img alt="Wall Street ended the week higher. File photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1784456_1_20241221074028.jpg&q=80">

<div class="itemFullText">
 US markets rebounded on Friday following a pullback in US Treasury yields as markets braced for a looming US government shutdown.
 <br>
  <br>
  Data showed the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index rose 2.4 percent in the 12 months to November, up from 2.3 percent in October, the Commerce Department said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the reading came in lower than expected, prompting a pullback in US Treasury bond yields that had risen after Federal Reserve policy makers signaled earlier this week they expect fewer interest rate cuts in 2025.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stocks fell sharply on Wednesday after the Fed decision.
  <br>
  <br>
  But on Friday, the broad-based S&P 500 finished at 5,930.85, up 1.1 percent for the day but down about two percent for the week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.2 percent to 42,840.26 and the Nasdaq Composite: was up1.0 percent at 19,572.60.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have seen a nice rebound from what was, in our view, an overreaction to the Fed's outlook on Wednesday," said Angelo Kourkafas of Edward Jones, pointing to Friday's inflation data as a supportive factor for equities.
  <br>
  <br>
  Treasury yields pulled back following comments from Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Austan Goolsbee, who expressed confidence that the PCE data showed that inflation was returning to the Fed's target of two percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Over the next 12 to 18 months, rates can still go down a fair amount," Goolsbee told CNBC.
  <br>
  <br>
  Investors were also keeping watch on developments in Capitol Hill.
  <br>
  <br>
  US lawmakers raced to stave off a government shutdown set to bite within hours after Donald Trump and Elon Musk sabotaged a bipartisan agreement that would have averted a shutdown.
  <br>
  <br>
  If no deal is struck, the government will cease to be funded at midnight, and non-essential operations will start to grind to halt, with up to 875,000 workers furloughed and 1.4 million more required to work without pay.
  <br>
  <br>
  European stocks finished the day lower although they cut their losses as Wall Street rebounded, with data showing tepid retail sales in the UK in the runup to Christmas dampening sentiment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among individual companies, Nike dipped 0.2 percent as it reported lower earnings while new CEO Elliott Hill outlined steps to get the slumping sports giant back on track. Analysts pointed to Nike's near-term outlook, which suggests a turnaround will not be quick.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carnival jumped 6.4 percent following an upbeat 2025 forecast that included a 20 percent rise in profits to $2.3 billion. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Officials said they were satisfied with the inaugural concert that was being held at the Kai Tak Arena on Friday, saying it had generally met the government's expectations.
 <br>
  <br>
  The show was aimed at testing the venue’s readiness for hosting mega events and its possible impact on the surrounding neighbourhood.
  <br>
  <br>
  Around 5,200 ticket holders attended the Chill Thai Music Festival, which featured local boy band Mirror, girl group Collar and various Thai performers.
  <br>
  <br>
  The performance kicked off at around 6.50pm -- 20 minutes behind schedule -- and ended at 10.45pm.
  <br>
  <br>
  A spectator surnamed Wong said while the acoustic system wasn’t perfect, instructions were clear and staff were helpful.
  <br>
  <br>
  "To be honest, since it's the first time, there's room for improvement. I'd give it 50 marks," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Everything was clear and plenty of people were helping out. When we went in, people voluntarily helped us check our tickets and find our seats. There were also many signboards, and this place was easy to find."
  <br>
  <br>
  "We needed to wear Airpods to protect our ears because the music was too loud," another spectator, surnamed Chan, said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Commissioner for Sports George Tsoi -- who attended the test event with Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism Rosanna Law and Acting Secretary for Security Michael Cheuk -- said authorities were generally happy with how things went.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The show today slightly overran, but we have systems and mechanisms in place to handle such situations, including communication protocols with public transport operators," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tsoi added that various audio and visual setups will continue to be fine-tuned to improve overall spectator experience.

<img alt="Headline prices, however, rose just 0.1 percent from October, pointing to a slight slowdown in what is sure to be welcome news for the US Federal Reserve. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1784421_1_20241220223027.jpg&q=50">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure rose for a second straight month in November according to government data published on Friday, although the increase came in a touch below expectations.
 <br>
  <br>
  The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index rose 2.4 percent in the 12 months to November, up from 2.3 percent in October, and 2.1 percent in September, the Commerce Department said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, headline prices rose just 0.1 percent from October, pointing to a slight slowdown in what is sure to be welcome news for the US central bank.
  <br>
  <br>
  This was slightly below the median forecasts from economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires and The Wall Street Journal.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Wednesday, the Fed cut interest rates by a quarter point and signalled a slower pace of cuts ahead, triggering a sharp sell-off in the financial markets.
  <br>
  <br>
  The independent US central bank is responsible for tackling inflation and unemployment, largely by hiking or lowering interest rates to affect demand.
  <br>
  <br>
  This indirectly impacts the cost of borrowing for consumers and businesses, affecting everything from mortgages to car loans.
  <br>
  <br>
  Excluding the volatile food and energy segments, the core PCE price index was up 2.8 percent from a year earlier, and by 0.1 percent from a month earlier.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both figures were slightly below expectations. (AFP)

 Football fans were treated to a nostalgic evening as former Real Madrid and Barcelona stars faced off in a highly anticipated exhibition match at Hong Kong Stadium on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The game brought together veteran players from the two iconic clubs, including Iker Casillas and Roberto Carlos for Real Madrid, and Thierry Henry and Xavi Hernández for Barcelona.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It’s good to see the players,” said football enthusiast Mike.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The people that are here are really enjoying themselves.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Many fans attended the game to watch their favourite players in action.
  <br>
  <br>
  Benjamin, a French native, was excited to see a legend from his home country grace the field again.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I [used to] only see Thierry Henry on TV,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “For me, it was an opportunity to see the legendary player [in person].”
  <br>
  <br>
  Real Madrid supporter Carlos shared similar sentiments.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It was really nice [to see Luis Figo play in person]. I saw him 10 years ago back in Madrid, and to see him play here is really nice,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The match ended in a one-sided 5-2 victory for Barcelona. But for many of the spectators, being able to witness the historic rivalry was what mattered most.

    Trump threatens tariffs unless EU buys more oil, gas

<img alt="Donald Trump says tariffs will make the United States rich. File photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1784413_1_20241220211049.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President-elect Donald Trump on Friday threatened the European Union with tariffs if the bloc does not reduce its "tremendous" trade gap with Washington through oil and gas purchases.
 <br>
  <br>
  "I told the European Union that they must make up their tremendous deficit with the United States by the large-scale purchase of our oil and gas," Trump said in a post on his Truth Social platform in the early hours of Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Otherwise, it is TARIFFS all the way!!!"
  <br>
  <br>
  According to US figures, goods imports from the EU were US$553.3 billion in 2022, while its exports to the bloc were US$350.8 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  This puts the US goods trade deficit with the EU at US$202.5 billion that year.
  <br>
  <br>
  EU chief Ursula von der Leyen had already suggested to Trump in November that the United States could supply more liquefied natural gas to the bloc to replace Russian energy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Replying to questions on Trump's threat on Friday, an EU spokesman said the 27-nation bloc was open to talks, noting that the US also enjoyed "a substantial trade in services surplus vis a vis the EU."
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are ready to discuss with President-elect Trump how we can further strengthen an already strong relationship, including by discussing our common interests in the energy sector," EU spokesman Olof Gill told a press briefing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump, who takes office in January, has made sweeping threats of slapping tariffs on US trading partners – including Canada, Mexico and China – which could send reverberations across the global economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Accusing Canada and Mexico of allowing the United States to be flooded with illicit drugs and undocumented migrants, he had threatened a 25-percent import tariff, while vowing at least 10 percent against Chinal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier this month, the European Union concluded a massive trade deal with four South American countries – Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay – which aims to create a 700-million-customer free-trade area.
  <br>
  <br>
  Von der Leyen had said the agreement would build trade bridges as "strong winds are blowing in the opposite direction, towards isolation and fragmentation" – comments largely seen as a nod to Trump's threats to hike tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some analysts have said Trump's tariff threats could be bluster, or an opening shot for leverage in future trade negotiations when he comes into office.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Trump has continually insisted that "properly used" tariffs would be positive for the US economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our country right now loses to everybody," he told reporters at his Florida residence earlier this week. "Tariffs will make our country rich." (AFP)

    English Rugby Union chairman quits amid pay row

<img alt="Tom Ilube had been facing calls for his removal after a grassroots revolt. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1784410_1_20241220203617.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Rugby Football Union chairman Tom Ilube has stepped down amid a row over the scale of the governing body's executive bonuses, saying the issue had become a "distraction."
 <br>
  <br>
  The move on Friday follows an outcry over RFU chief executive Bill Sweeney's paycheck of £1.1 million (US$1.37 million) for the 2023/24 financial year, which included a bonus of £358,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Times reported that Bill Beaumont, who held the role from 2012 to 2016 and in November stepped down as World Rugby chairman, is being lined up to fill the position on an interim basis.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I have decided to step down from my role as chair of the RFU as recent events have become a distraction from the game, but will stay on to ensure a smooth transition to a new chair as soon as one is in place," Ilube said in a statement issued by the RFU.
  <br>
  <br>
  The RFU, which held an emergency council meeting on Wednesday, has announced an independent review of its executive pay scheme.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ilube had been facing motions calling for his removal after a grassroots revolt gathered enough support to trigger a special general meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm pleased that an independent review of the LTIP (long-term incentive plan) scheme has been commissioned and look forward to its findings once completed," said Ilube's statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It has been an honour to chair the RFU and I look forward to once again enjoying the game that I grew up with from the touchline and watching it grow."
  <br>
  <br>
  Many in the game are furious at the amount earned by Sweeney given the RFU reported an operating loss of £37.9 million for the same period, the highest it has ever recorded.
  <br>
  <br>
  In addition, 42 staff were made redundant in September.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the pitch, the England men's team won just five of their 12 matches in 2024 and grassroots participation is in decline.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sweeney's position is also under threat, with a motion for the RFU board to dismiss him set to be tabled at the forthcoming special general meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ilube was head of the remuneration committee that signed off the long-term incentive plan that is the basis for the bonuses awarded to Sweeney and other executives. (AFP)

    Biden cancels US$4.28bn more in student debt

<img alt="President Biden says he had promised to make higher education a ticket to the middle class. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1784408_1_20241220203036.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Joe Biden said on Friday he was cancelling student loans for an additional 55,000 Americans, which would amount to wiping out US$4.28 billion in debt in his final month in office.
 <br>
  <br>
  The mass cancellation of debt is for "teachers, nurses, service members, law enforcement officials, and other public service workers who have dedicated their lives to giving back to their communities," he said in a statement issued by the White House on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  With this new crop of beneficiaries, it would mean "nearly 5 million people" have been approved for debt relief during Biden's administration.
  <br>
  <br>
  "From Day One of my administration, I promised to make sure that higher education is a ticket to the middle class, not a barrier to opportunity," the outgoing president said.
  <br>
  <br>
  US Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona said in a statement that Friday's approval brings the total amount secured during Biden's four years in office to "nearly US$180 billion in life-changing student debt relief for nearly five million borrowers."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Democratic president had instigated a landmark forgiveness programme in 2022 to cancel hundreds of billions in student debt – which would have made certain borrowers eligible to receive US$20,000 in cancellations, while the vast majority were eligible for US$10,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the conservative-dominated Supreme Court overruled the program in 2023, stating that given the large sum, the president had overstepped his powers.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the United States, colleges can often cost anywhere between US$10,000 and US$70,000 a year, leaving some graduates with crushing debt as they enter the workforce.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to the Pew Research Center, one in four American adults under 40 have student loan debt, with the median amount owed being between US$20,000 and US$25,000 in 2023, varying by education level. (AFP)

    Malaysia to resume search for missing MH370 plane

<img alt="Malaysia agreed to launch a new search for Malaysia Airlines flight MH370, which disappeared mysteriously 10 years ago. File photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1784393_1_20241220183504.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Malaysia's government has agreed in principle to accept a second “no find, no fee” proposal from a US company to renew the hunt for flight MH370, which is believed to have crashed in the southern Indian Ocean more than 10 years ago, Transport Minister Anthony Loke said on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Loke said cabinet ministers gave the nod at their meeting last week for Texas-based marine robotics firm Ocean Infinity to continue the seabed search operation at a new 15,000-square-kilometre site in the ocean.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The proposed new search area, identified by Ocean Infinity, is based on the latest information and data analyses conducted by experts and researchers. The company’s proposal is credible,” he said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Boeing 777 plane vanished from radar shortly after taking off on March 8, 2014, carrying 239 people, mostly Chinese nationals, on a flight from Malaysia’s capital, Kuala Lumpur, to Beijing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Satellite data showed the plane deviated from its flight path to head over the southern Indian Ocean, where it is believed to have crashed.
  <br>
  <br>
  An expensive multinational search failed to turn up any clues, although debris washed ashore on the east African coast and Indian Ocean islands.
  <br>
  <br>
  A private search in 2018 by Ocean Infinity also found nothing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Loke said the government will not be required to pay Ocean Infinity unless the plane's wreckage is discovered, under the same “no find, no fee” deal.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said his ministry hopes to finalise negotiations for terms and conditions of the agreement with Ocean Infinity in early 2025.
  <br>
  <br>
  “This decision reflects the government’s commitment to continuing the search operation and providing closure for the families of MH370 passengers,” he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ocean Infinity CEO Oliver Punkett earlier this year reportedly said the the company had improved its technology since 2018.
  <br>
  <br>
  He has said the firm is working with many experts to analyse data and narrow the search area to the most likely site. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 More than 13 million passenger trips in and out of Hong Kong will take place over the Christmas and New Year holidays with the majority via land borders, officials said on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Immigration Department said about 11 million trips will likely be made through land boundary control points from Saturday to New Year's Day.
  <br>
  <br>
  The number of departures via land is estimated to peak at 595,000 on Christmas Day and the inbound figure is likely to reach a high of 626,000 on December 29, officials said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Border control points at Lo Wu, Lok Ma Chau and Shenzhen Bay are expected to be busy, authorities said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "To cope with the anticipated heavy traffic during the festive period, the [Immigration Department] has minimised leave for frontline officers for flexible deployment and operation of extra clearance counters and kiosks," the government said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Additional security guards will also be deployed to provide crowd management support."
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials also said further details will be announced "as soon as possible" regarding government requests to extend the service hours of two border checkpoints on New Year's Eve.

    HA to beef up manpower ahead of winter flu surge

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hospital Authority (HA) on Friday said it will beef up manpower and bed capacity to guard against a potential surge in patients during the upcoming holiday period.
 <br>
  <br>
  This came as the Centre for Health Protection (CHP) reported a mild increase in both Covid and influenza cases, with the numbers expected to rise further in January.
  <br>
  <br>
  The HA said it will activate special measures for peak periods from Saturday, including reducing non-urgent hospital admissions and boosting manpower in public hospitals by 10 to 20 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dr Larry Lee, a chief manager with the authority, told a press conference that he's confident public hospitals have enough capacity to cope with a surge in demand.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The most important bit of it is to increase the bed turnover, including making use of our command centre and the day centre, so that we can aim our patients not lasting too long in our hospitals so that we can cater more emergency admissions," Lee said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "According to experience, our measures have improved and enhanced our capability to cope with the increased demand. So if the situations and the service activity will be similar to last year, I think we can cope with it."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee said the HA will also relaunch a special refund arrangement at accident and emergency departments to ease the pressure on services. Patients who don't want to wait any longer to be seen can apply for a refund of the HK$180 fee within 24 hours of registration.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CHP, meanwhile, appealed to high-risk individuals to get flu vaccines to protect themselves.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A Macau-based academic on Friday said the SAR should think of ways to bring people to neighbouring Hengqin Island, which is partly leased to the territory, to diversify its economy.
 <br>
  <br>
  During a speech at the inauguration of the new Macau government, President Xi Jinping urged authorities not to deviate from the purpose of the Guangdong-Macau In-Depth Cooperation Zone in Hengqin and Macau.
  <br>
  <br>
  The area offers support for Macau in diversifying its economy and developing four key industries: big health; innovation and technology; financial services; conventions and exhibitions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[Hengqin] is highly developed, but it still lacks population," City University of Macau's rector Jun Liu told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If we really think about Hengqin as an expanded area, as a collaboration zone, we need to have people. We need to have policies to support four areas of economic diversification, we need to retain those highly qualified graduates... On the other hand, we really need to look elsewhere for great talent from around the world."
  <br>
  <br>
  The professor also said the new government under Chief Executive Sam Hou-fai is expected to take forward measures and initiatives, after the previous administration had laid the groundwork.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Now, it seems that we are [in] a better position to move forward with more vision, more hands-on strategies," Liu said.

    Police arrest 39 over 'staged traffic accidents'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Thirty-nine people were arrested this week on suspicion of staging traffic accidents to try to defraud the government out of money granted to injured victims, police said on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The suspects, aged between 19 and 48, are suspected of making false claims worth a total of HK$2 million in relation to 33 allegedly fake accidents.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Earlier this year, an internal audit by the Social Welfare Department found fraudsters using falsified documents to apply for the Traffic Accident Victims Assistance Scheme," Senior Inspector Lam Tsz-lim said at a press briefing.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Police investigations found some of these claims were linked to an organisation which orchestrates staged traffic accidents. One such incident involved 13 people."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lam noted that 275 people were arrested last month over suspicious claims under the scheme worth a total of HK$14 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  The police said money was not paid out in relation to most of the suspicious claims connected to the latest arrests.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Social Welfare Department said it verifies every application stringently and is carrying out more random checks on medical certificates submitted by applicants.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If false medical information, fraudulence or other criminal elements are suspected, the SWD will refer the case to the police for investigation and recover the overpaid assistance payments from the relevant applicants," a spokesperson said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The department also warned that people convicted of providing false information to obtain money from the accident victims scheme risk a jail term of up to 14 years.

    US govt shutdown looms as bill fails in Congress

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A spending bill backed by Donald Trump failed in the US House of Representatives on Thursday as dozens of Republicans defied the president-elect, leaving Congress with no clear plan to avert a fast-approaching government shutdown that could disrupt Christmas travel.
 <br>
  <br>
  The vote laid bare fault lines in Trump's Republican Party that could surface again next year when they control the White House and both chambers of Congress.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump had pressured lawmakers to tie up loose ends before he takes office on January 20, but members of the party's right flank refused to support a package that would increase spending and clear the way for a plan that would add trillions more to the federal government's US$36 trillion in debt.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I am absolutely sickened by a party that campaigns on fiscal responsibility and has the temerity to go to the American people and say you think this is fiscally responsible," said Republican Representative Chip Roy, one of 38 Republicans who voted against the bill.
  <br>
  <br>
  The package failed by a vote of 174-235 just hours after it was hastily assembled by Republican leaders seeking to comply with Trump's demands.
  <br>
  <br>
  A prior bipartisan deal was scuttled after Trump and the world's richest person Elon Musk came out against it on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson provided no details when reporters asked him about next steps after the failed vote.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will come up with another solution," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Government funding is due to expire at midnight on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  If lawmakers fail to extend that deadline, the US government will begin a partial shutdown that would interrupt funding for everything from border enforcement to national parks and cut off paychecks for more than two million federal workers.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US Transportation Security Administration warned that travellers during the busy holiday season could face long lines at airports.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bill that failed on Thursday largely resembled the earlier version that Musk and Trump had blasted as a wasteful giveaway to Democrats.
  <br>
  <br>
  It would have extended government funding into March and provided US$100 billion in disaster relief and suspended the debt.
  <br>
  <br>
  Republicans dropped other elements that had been included in the original package, such as a pay raise for lawmakers and new rules for pharmacy benefit managers.
  <br>
  <br>
  At Trump's urging, the new version also would have suspended limits on the national debt for two years -- a move that would make it easier to pass the dramatic tax cuts he has promised.
  <br>
  <br>
  Johnson before the vote told reporters that the package would avoid disruption, tie up loose ends and make it easier for lawmakers to cut spending by hundreds of billions of dollars when Trump takes office next year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Government is too big, it does too many things, and it does few things well," he said. (Reuters)

    Japan inspects US air base over chemical spill

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Japanese authorities on Friday staged an inspection of a US military base in Tokyo, a government spokesman said, after being informed by the American side of a chemical leak.
 <br>
  <br>
  Japan's probe at the Yokota Air Base followed a US notice two months ago that water containing PFOS -- classified by the World Health Organisation as "possibly carcinogenic to humans" -- had spilled from the site.
  <br>
  <br>
  PFOS is part of a large group of man-made chemicals known as PFAS, sometimes called "forever chemicals" because they do not degrade easily, experts say.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US military informed Tokyo in October that the PFOS-laced water had leaked from an area of the base where a fire-fighting drill was being carried out, Fumitoshi Sato, deputy chief cabinet secretary, told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This inspection was realised in response to the fears and concerns harboured by local residents, and we will continue to work together with the US side," Sato said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials including from the defence ministry and Tokyo's metropolitan government visited the site on Friday, he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yokota Air Base was not immediately available for comment.
  <br>
  <br>
  America's military presence in Japan has frequently stoked local discontent in the past, with everything from noise to pollution to helicopter accidents.
  <br>
  <br>
  This frustration is perhaps most evident on the southern island of Okinawa, which despite comprising just 0.6 percent of Japan's landmass, hosts the vast majority of the country's US military bases.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier this month, the United States began relocating thousands of Marines from Okinawa, with an initial "detachment of approximately 100 logistics support Marines" transferred to the US island territory of Guam. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping on Friday directed Macau to diversify its economy as one of his four “hopes” for its new administration, after swearing in the SAR’s new Chief Executive, Sam Hou-fai.
 <br>
  <br>
  The president expressed confidence the SAR will open up new horizons for development and keep creating new glories.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a speech marking the 25th anniversary of Macau's return to the motherland, Xi also laid out his expectations for the government to improve governance, build a high-level platform to enhance China’s connections with the international community, and safeguard social harmony and stability.
  <br>
  <br>
  The president urged the gambling hub to cultivate new industries in alignment with China's national development strategies.
  <br>
  <br>
  "At present the overall situation in Macau is stable, but the internal and external environment is undergoing profound changes," Xi said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Efforts should be made to promote moderate economic diversification... [with a] focus on cultivating new industries with international competitiveness."
  <br>
  <br>
  President Xi also highlighted the importance of Hengqin Island, which was partly leased to Macau to boost its land supply for non-gaming development.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The central government decided to develop Hengqin with the goal of fostering Macau's development of a diversified economy and to facilitate the living and employment of Macau residents," Xi said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There can be no development of industries and projects that do not align with this positioning."
  <br>
  <br>
  He also highlighted the crucial role that the One Country, Two Systems model has played in ensuring the city’s success in the past 25 years.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Macau's splendid achievements since its return to the motherland is proof to the world that 'One Country, Two Systems' has a clear systemic advantage and strong vitality," Xi said, adding that the framework "must be adhered to over the long term."
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that young people in the city should continue to build on the successes of One Country, Two Systems, and urged authorities to help nurture the next generation.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The SAR government and all sectors in society should care more about them and help them develop, and create a better environment and conditions for them,” Xi said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I hope all young people will care about Macau and the country, set lofty goals, be pragmatic, and fulfil the role of builders and successors of the cause of One Country Two Systems.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The president said Macau has been shining like a “bright pearl” and that its people have benefitted from its economic and social development over the years.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The sense of gain, happiness and security of Macau residents have strengthened significantly,” Xi said. (Additional reporting by agencies)

    Smart system to take effect at Ting Kau Bridge
   </title>

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Transport Department on Friday said it will implement a smart highway system at Ting Kau Bridge by the end of this month.
 <br>
  <br>
  It said the system has the ability to detect traffic accidents, and make appropriate arrangements to ensure a smooth traffic flow.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on an RTHK programme, Assistant Commissioner for Transport (Strategic Studies) Leung Sai-ho said the Automatic Incident Detection System can notify staff at the Tsing Ma Control Area in 10 seconds if it notices any abnormalities.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In cases in which a car suddenly stops moving, or slows down, or drives in the opposite direction, or objects fall on to the road, the system can analyse footage and deduce that a traffic incident has happened and tell our staff to act," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If we do not have such systems, we will have to detect incidents through the human eye, which would take minutes," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Leung said on-site staff may open up the hard shoulder of Ting Kau Bridge southbound to ease traffic flow, along with lane control signals and variable message signs to allow vehicles to pass by.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added message boards have already been installed along the road, aiming to provide real-time information to drivers.
  <br>
  <br>
  The system will be in place on December 29 for a one-month trial.
  <br>
  <br>
  The department said a mid-term review would be conducted in around six months if the scheme runs smoothly.
  <br>
  <br>
  Leung said the department would analyse traffic data collected and fine tune its implementation of the system.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wesley Wan, honorary life president of the Hong Kong Automobile Association, told RTHK that the city's drivers are familiar with having variable message boards on highways.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They [drivers] are already used to the notice board and the electronic notice on the highway. But I've noticed many times the government puts on some road safety message instead of the road information on the spot. They should inform motorists of the real-time information on the highway instead of just a road safety message," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wan also said the one-month trial period may be too short for data to be collected.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They [the government] spent a lot of time to install the system for this trial. So my question is, why just a one month trial? If we are lucky that there's no accident happening during this month, then we'll have no data. So I think the trial, with all this preparation work, the trial should be longer," he said.

 Sam Hou-fai was on Friday sworn in as Macau's chief executive in an inauguration ceremony officiated by President Xi Jinping.
 <br>
  <br>
  The new Macau CE's oath was administered by the president.
  <br>
  <br>
  In his inauguration speech, Sam said he “felt honoured of taking the great responsibility” of being the SAR’s leader.
  <br>
  <br>
  He vowed to lead the new administration to unite all sectors of the community, and to fully, faithfully and resolutely implement One Country, Two Systems.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sam stated that he and his governance team would bear President Xi's speech in mind and take on the great responsibility of leading the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We will make every effort in making Macau as a city with rule of law, vitality, culture and happiness,” Sam said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “With the solid backing of our country, and the united efforts of our citizens, we are confident and capable of making greater achievements [under] One Country, Two Systems. We will make Macau, which is ‘a pearl on the nation's palm', be brighter,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sam also said in safeguarding the nation's sovereignty and development interests, his administration would continue to strengthen patriotic education.
  <br>
  <br>
  The new CE added he would improve efficiency and governance to provide more convenient services to citizens.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sam said he appreciated the country's support and the efforts of the three former Macau chief executives.
