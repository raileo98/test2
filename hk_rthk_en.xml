<img alt="The government is hoping that a cross-border railway link between Hung Shui Kiu and Qianhai will become operational in 2035. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798240_1_20250331131812.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government is looking into the possibility of having a single contractor design, build and operate a planned cross-border railway in the northwestern New Territories and says officials will start gauging developers' interest later this year.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong-Shenzhen Western Rail Link, which is a key component of the Northern Metropolis, is aimed at connecting Hung Shui Kiu with Qianhai.
  <br>
  <br>
  Estimated to come into operation in 2035, the proposed 18-kilometre cross-border railway is expected to take residents from one place to the other in 15 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Transport minister Mable Chan said the administration is considering different options for the project, including a "design, build and operate" contract.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the second half of the year when we invite intentions and expressions, we will then know whether [it can be] a design, build and operate [model] or whether it is [having] design and build as a contract and then operation as another contract," Chan told lawmakers on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Experienced operators can take up the operation solely, or they can partner up with other operating companies."
  <br>
  <br>
  Three stations along the proposed link will be in Hong Kong and two will be across the border. A co-location arrangement is expected to be adopted for immigration and customs facilities on the Shenzhen side.
  <br>
  <br>
  While some lawmakers called for both of the stations in Shenzhen to have checkpoints, the transport chief said officials are still hammering out details of the arrangement with mainland counterparts.

    Trump 'not joking' about bid for third term

<img alt="Donald Trump chats with Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick, left, on board Marine One upon arrival at the White House on Sunday. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798236_1_20250331125457.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 President Donald Trump said “I’m not joking” about trying to serve a third term, the clearest indication he is considering ways to breach a constitutional barrier against continuing to lead the country after his second term ends at the beginning of 2029.
 <br>
  <br>
  “There are methods which you could do it,” he said in a telephone interview on Sunday with NBC News from Mar-a-Lago, his private club.
  <br>
  <br>
  He elaborated later to reporters on Air Force One from Florida to Washington that "I have had more people ask me to have a third term, which in a way is a fourth term because the other election, the 2020 election was totally rigged.” Trump lost that election to Democrat Joe Biden.
  <br>
  <br>
  Still, Trump added: “I don’t want to talk about a third term now because no matter how you look at it, we’ve got a long time to go.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The 22nd amendment, added to the Constitution in 1951 after President Franklin D Roosevelt was elected four times in a row, says “no person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Any attempt to remain in office would be legally suspect and it is unclear how seriously Trump might pursue the idea.
  <br>
  <br>
  The comments nonetheless were an extraordinary reflection of the desire to maintain power by a president who had violated democratic traditions four years ago when he tried to overturn the election he lost to Biden.
  <br>
  <br>
  “This is yet another escalation in his clear effort to take over the government and dismantle our democracy," said a statement from Rep. Daniel Goldman, a New York Democrat who served as lead counsel for Trump's first impeachment. "If Congressional Republicans believe in the Constitution, they will go on the record opposing Trump’s ambitions for a third term.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Steve Bannon, a former Trump strategist who runs the right-wing “War Room” podcast, called for the president to run again during a speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference last month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kayla Thompson, a 30-year-old former paralegal in Wisconsin, said she would “absolutely” like Trump to serve another term.
  <br>
  <br>
  “America needs him. America is headed in the right direction and, if he doesn’t do it, we’re probably headed backwards," said Thompson, who was attending a campaign event on Sunday with Elon Musk in Green Bay for a state Supreme Court race.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jeremy Paul, a constitutional law professor at Boston’s Northeastern University, said "there are no credible legal arguments for him to run for a third term.”
  <br>
  <br>
  NBC's Kristen Welker asked Trump if one potential avenue to a third term was having Vice President JD Vance run for the top job and “then pass the baton to you.”
  <br>
  <br>
  “Well, that’s one,” Trump responded. “But there are others too. There are others.”
  <br>
  <br>
  “Can you tell me another?” Welker asked.
  <br>
  <br>
  “No,” Trump replied.
  <br>
  <br>
  Derek Muller, a professor of election law at Notre Dame, noted that the 12th amendment , which was ratified in 1804, says “no person constitutionally ineligible to the office of president shall be eligible to that of vice-president of the United States.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Muller said that indicates that if Trump is not eligible to run for president again because of the 22nd amendment, he is not eligible to run for vice president, either.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I don’t think there’s any ‘one weird trick’ to getting around presidential term limits,” Muller said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump, who would be 82 at the end of his second term, was asked whether he would want to keep serving in “the toughest job in the country” at that point.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Well, I like working,” the president said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump suggested that Americans would go along with a third term because of his popularity. He falsely claimed to have “the highest poll numbers of any Republican for the last 100 years.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Gallup data shows President George W Bush reaching a 90 percent approval rating after the attacks on September 11, 2001. His father, President George H.W. Bush, hit 89 percent following the Gulf War in 1991.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has maxed out at 47 percent in Gallup data during his second term, despite claiming to be "in the high 70s in many polls, in the real polls.” (AP)

    Duterte lawyer insists ICC 'has no jurisdiction'

<img alt="Friends and relatives of some of the thousands killed during former Philippine president Rodrigo Duterte's 'war on drugs' call for justice and his conviction by the International Criminal Court in Manila on Friday. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798229_1_20250331121432.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Rodrigo Duterte's lead lawyer said there was a "compelling" argument to throw out the International Criminal Court case against the former Philippines president before it even comes to trial.
 <br>
  <br>
  Nicholas Kaufman said in an interview in The Hague he hoped to stop the case before the ICC confirms the charges against Duterte by arguing the court cannot exercise its jurisdiction.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the Philippines' withdrawal from the court had become effective well before an investigation was authorised.
  <br>
  <br>
  Duterte, 80, faces a charge of crimes against humanity for murder over his "war on drugs" that claimed the lives of thousands of mostly poor men, often without proof they were linked to drugs.
  <br>
  <br>
  British-Israeli lawyer Kaufman, 56, said: "Coming back to the jurisdictional point, obviously you don't need to be the dean of a law faculty to realise that that's going to be a huge issue at pre-trial."
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think that the jurisdictional argument is compelling as defence counsel.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I believe that it should succeed and I would be hugely disappointed if it doesn't succeed.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We hope to persuade the judges pre-trial that it [the court] cannot exercise its jurisdiction over the case.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There won't be a confirmation-of-charges hearing if the judges rule in our favour."
  <br>
  <br>
  A confirmation of charges hearing, where prosecutor and defence first lay out their evidence, is currently scheduled for September 23.
  <br>
  <br>
  The issue of jurisdiction is key in this case as the Philippines withdrew from the ICC in 2019.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, when the court issued its arrest warrant for Duterte, it noted that the alleged crimes took place while the country was still an ICC member.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As the alleged conduct has taken place between 1 November 2011 and 16 March 2019 on the territory of the Philippines, it falls within the court's jurisdiction," the ICC said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ICC chief prosecutor's application for his arrest said Duterte's alleged crimes were "part of a widespread and systematic attack directed against the civilian population" in the Philippines.
  <br>
  <br>
  The families of victims of his war on drugs see the ICC case as a long-awaited chance for justice.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another likely critical issue for the defence will be Duterte's arrest on March 11 and his rapid handover to the ICC in The Hague.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I view it as a kidnapping, nothing more or less. It's an extrajudicial rendition. He was given no due process, just slung over to the Hague," Kaufman said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This was in complete contravention of Philippines law."
  <br>
  <br>
  The former president's sudden detention came amid a spectacular deterioration in relations between the two most powerful families in Philippines politics.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Duterte and Marcos clans teamed up to win an election landslide in 2022 that saw Ferdinand Marcos become president and Sara Duterte, daughter of the imprisoned Rodrigo, vice-president.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sara Duterte has since been impeached on charges that include an alleged assassination plot against the president.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rodrigo Duterte "should have been brought before a judge before he was thrown onto a plane and dumped in The Hague.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That didn't happen. As I've said already, this is a political hit job," said Kaufman.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The politics in that country basically ended up in a situation where they needed to get him out of the picture.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The incumbent government did not want him in the picture anymore."
  <br>
  <br>
  Kaufman said he was visiting his client virtually every day in the ICC detention centre, a couple of kilometres from the beach in the suburb of Scheveningen.
  <br>
  <br>
  Duterte was "adjusting to the reality of prison life. That's not easy for anyone," according to his lawyer.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the former president was in "good spirits," said Kaufman, whose previous clients at ICC include former Congolese rebel leader Jean-Pierre Bemba and Aisha Kadhafi, daughter of the deceased Libyan dictator.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kaufman said he was concerned that the ICC, currently under fire from all sides and even US sanctions, would be reluctant to give up such a high-profile case.
  <br>
  <br>
  "My only fear is that this court is starved of cases at the present moment and might be loath to let a case like that go, to slip through its hands." (AFP)

    Kai Tak operators 'inexperienced in serving big crowd'

<img alt="Allan Zeman believes operators will learn a lesson from the Sevens, after some fans complained about not being able to get food at the venue. File Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798224_1_20250331112814.jpg&q=35">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Kai Tak Sports Park will "learn a good lesson" from hosting the Hong Kong Sevens and be better prepared in the future following complaints by fans over their inability to get food at the venue, a business tycoon said on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Some rugby fans had complained over the dearth of food at Kai Tak Stadium, where the three-day tournament was held, after the government had told operators to enhance their food supply services.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They're inexperienced at handling a crowd that big and I think they will learn a good lesson," said Lan Kwai Fong Group chairman Allan Zeman on RTHK's Backchat programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was the first time they were slammed over three days with that many people, and not expecting how much food they could sell, how much drinks they could sell... They probably would stock up in the future."
  <br>
  <br>
  The tournament has welcomed more than 110,000 visitors in total.
  <br>
  <br>
  The figure fell slightly short of Hong Kong China Rugby's 139,000 expectation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lawmaker Vincent Cheng, who is also the vice chairman of the Major Sports Events Committee, told another RTHK radio show that this might be due to the event being held in the Hong Kong Stadium for decades.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think that's because the Kai Tak venue is much bigger than Hong Kong Stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  "My understanding is that 90 percent of the tickets were taken up but there's still room for more ticket sales," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I believe the event will now have made its reputation and I hope there will be more visitors in the future."
  <br>
  <br>
  Cheng, who was among those attending the Sevens, said the atmosphere was very good and that overall operations had been very smooth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kowloon City district councillor Cheung King-fan said there were some complaints by Kai Tak residents about noise coming from the fans' village located on the east side of the stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I have reflected the issue to the organiser, park operator and the Environmental Protection Department," he added.

<img alt="Novak Djokovic had no answer for the creativity and speed of the Czech ace. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798220_2_20250331110937.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Novak Djokovic faced a series of obstacles in the Miami Open final: a delay of more than five-and-a-half hours before the match, an eye infection and a slippery court due to high levels of humidity following the rain.
 <br>
  <br>
  But the largest roadblock was the youth and power of 6-foot-4, 19-year-old phenom Jakub Mensik, who outdueled the 37-year-old Serbian in two tiebreakers 7-6 (4), 7-6 (4) to win his first ATP title.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ranked 54th entering the tournament, the Czech Republic teenager plowed through Djokovic with poise and a stellar 130 mph serve.
  <br>
  <br>
  He collected 14 aces and got broken only once.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mensik bashed a service winner on match point and fell on his back.
  <br>
  <br>
  “You’re the one I idolized when I was young,″ Mensik said to Djokovic during the ceremony after the match that lasted two hours and three minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I started playing tennis because of you.″
  <br>
  <br>
  Mensik’s victory spoiled the party for Djokovic, who was seeking his 100th career title and a record seventh in the Miami Open.
  <br>
  <br>
  Djokovic will have to wait, while the teenager looks ready to join the elite.
  <br>
  <br>
  “This is a joyous moment for him and his family – an unbelievable tournament, first of many,″ Djokovic said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It hurts me to admit it, you were better. In the clutch moments you delivered the goods. For a young player like yourself, this is a great feature.″
  <br>
  <br>
  The crowd pulled hard for Djokovic, who hadn’t played here since 2019.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than three-quarters of the fans stuck around despite the massive delay, chanting “No-vak!’’ and singing his name across critical parts of the match.
  <br>
  <br>
  Djokovic, far from a fan favorite here earlier in his career, saluted the fans, saying it was one of the warmest crowds he’s had ever.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the men’s leader with 24 Grand Slam titles seemed compromised by his eye issue, with redness seen under the eyelid.
  <br>
  <br>
  Djokovic applied eyedrops during two changeovers in the first set. It was unclear if it affected his vision.
  <br>
  <br>
  During the set, he also slipped twice on the court.
  <br>
  <br>
  The humidity reached 90 percent after hours of rain disrupted the card.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sweating profusely, Djokovic asked the umpire for a bucket of sawdust to sprinkle on his wet grip.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mensik had lost to Djokovic in a three-setter in October at the Shanghai Masters but the youngster said before the match he had played too nervously.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mensik was playing his first ATP 1000 final.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was not quite two years old when Djokovic won his first Miami Open title in 2007.
  <br>
  <br>
  There was more fearlessness this time than in Shanghai.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mensik got up 3-0 with an early break but Djokovic broke back at 4-3, then held for 4-4 after fans chanted his name.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mensik held for a 6-5 lead in a game that saw Djokovic take a tumble in the doubles alley chasing a drop shot.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mensik served it out with his seventh ace.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the first-set tiebreak, Mensik charged ahead 5-0.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mensik executed a leaping backhand volley winner and Djokovic muffed a routine forehand drop shot into the net to fall behind 5-0.
  <br>
  <br>
  On set point, Mensik slugged an overhead smash for a winner.
  <br>
  <br>
  The match was scheduled for 3am Hong Kong time but the players didn’t take the court until almost six hours later due to rain and organisers deciding on completing the women’s doubles final.
  <br>
  <br>
  The South Florida rain began during the women’s doubles final pitting Mirra Andreeva and Diana Shnaider against Cristina Bucsa and Miyu Kato, with Andreeva and Shnaider leading 3-0 in the first set.
  <br>
  <br>
  The women’s players returned to the court later after the rain stopped and the courts were readied by court-drying machinery.
  <br>
  <br>
  But rain began minutes later before warmups and the umbrella-toting players left the court again.
  <br>
  <br>
  The women returned to the court an hour later and resumed play.
  <br>
  <br>
  Andreeva and Schnaider went the distance, prevailing in a third-set match tiebreaker 6-3, 6-7 (5), 10-2. (AP)

 An SAR government rescue team is on its way to quake-hit Mandalay in Myanmar.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 51-strong team, including firefighters, doctors and nurses, had earlier arrived in the country's capital, Naypyidaw.
  <br>
  <br>
  There, they rested briefly at the Myanmar National Centre for Disease Control and met diplomats from the Chinese embassy.
  <br>
  <br>
  While they originally planned to work in Naypyidaw, Myanmar officials asked them to go to Mandalay instead – which is near the epicentre of the 7.7-magnitude quake on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The rescue squad departed overnight but had to pause their journey due to a night curfew on the roads, according to a Facebook post by the Security Bureau on Monday.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Seven players and members of coaching staff were ejected after a wild brawl broke out during the Minnesota Timberwolves' 123-104 victory over the Detroit Pistons in the NBA.
 <br>
  <br>
  A testy duel between the two sides at the Target Center in Minneapolis erupted into chaos early in the second quarter when Minnesota's Naz Reid took exception to being bumped by Detroit's Ron Holland as he drove towards the basket.
  <br>
  <br>
  Reid jabbed a finger angrily at Holland as the two players squared up after the incident.
  <br>
  <br>
  It escalated rapidly, with players from both sides being sucked into the melee that spilled into the spectator seats at courtside.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Wolves' Donte DiVincenzo was in the thick of the uproar and tumbled backwards into the seating as a scrum of players and team officials grappled around him.
  <br>
  <br>
  The protracted scrap lasted around a minute before tempers cooled and the officiating crew began to determine who was at fault.
  <br>
  <br>
  When it was over, the Timberwolves' Reid and DiVincenzo – who could be seen with what looked like large scratch marks near his neck – were tossed along with the Pistons' Marcus Sasser, Isaiah Stewart and Holland.
  <br>
  <br>
  Detroit Pistons head coach J B Bickerstaff was also ejected while Minnesota's assistant coach Pablo Prigioni was also tossed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Minnesota head coach Chris Finch later suggested Detroit's overly physical approach early in the game had triggered the flashpoint.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked for his view of the incident, Finch replied: "Two guys went at it, and then spilled over into the crowd which was super dangerous.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Then obviously it just kept escalating, and escalating, mostly from their side to be honest with you.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I thought leading up to that the game was way too physical.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was a little lopsided in its physicality and I thought it was bound to happen. It just felt like it was coming.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We knew they were a super physical team. They hit you, they hold you...but I just thought it got to a point where players were going to take matters into their own hands, and you don't ever want that."
  <br>
  <br>
  Detroit coach Bickerstaff, meanwhile, accused Prigioni of triggering the incident that saw them both ejected.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There was things said by their assistant coach," Bickerstaff said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And I'm in the same boat as my guys are in.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're going to defend each other and I'm not going to let people say belligerent things about my guys.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And it's that simple. So he said what he said. He knows what he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Again, I didn't think it crossed the line to escalation of anything, but in that moment, I understand, you know, the refs' position."
  <br>
  <br>
  US media reported meanwhile that a young fan sitting at courtside who had been caught in the chaotic scrum was later presented with a Minnesota team jersey by Alex Rodriguez, the former Major League Baseball star who is now a part owner of the Timberwolves. (AFP)

    China's factory PMI expands at fastest pace in a year

<img alt="Official data shows the purchasing managers' index for manufacturing was up 0.3 percentage points from February. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798209_1_20250331101633.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China's manufacturing activity expanded at the fastest pace in a year in March, an official factory survey showed on Monday, in a positive sign for the world's second-largest economy as it deals with an escalating US trade war.
 <br>
  <br>
  The official purchasing managers' index (PMI) was 50.5 in March versus 50.2 in February, above the 50-mark separating growth from contraction. It was the highest PMI reading since March 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  The non-manufacturing PMI, which includes services and construction, accelerated to 50.8 from 50.4.
  <br>
  <br>
  China has kept its economic target for this year unchanged at "around five percent", despite new tariffs from US President Donald Trump, which threaten to hit the massive export sector, a key driver for the US$18 trillion economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government has pledged more fiscal stimulus, increased debt issuance, further monetary easing and put even greater emphasis on boosting domestic demand to cushion the impact of the trade war.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has imposed a cumulative 20 percent tariff on all Chinese imports since returning to the White House in January.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US president is also preparing to announce "reciprocal" tariffs on Wednesday, a move designed to address trade imbalances, which could hit Chinese goods with additional levies. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The board of Hong Kong conglomerate CK Hutchison said on Monday it has not made any decision on its global telecommunications business, in response to media reports about a potential spin-off listing of the assets.
 <br>
  <br>
  "From time to time, the Group receives proposals and explores and evaluates opportunities that may be available, with a view to enhancing long term value to shareholders, including possible transactions relating to the assets and operations of the company's global telecommunication businesses," the board said in a stock exchange filing.
  <br>
  <br>
  A spin-off listing would be among those options, according to the filing.
  <br>
  <br>
  The board said no decision has been made about any transaction and there is no certainty a transaction will take place.
  <br>
  <br>
  Reuters reported on Friday, citing sources, the company is mulling a spin-off of global telecom assets and would list the business on the London stock exchange. (Reuters)

    China discovers major oilfield in South China Sea

<img alt="CNOOC says the new oilfield is around 170 km off the coast of Shenzhen. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798194_1_20250331091600.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC) has discovered an oilfield in the South China Sea with proven reserves exceeding 100 million tonnes, Xinhua news agency reported on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The newly-found Huizhou 19-6 oilfield is around 170 km off the coast of Shenzhen and sits at an average water depth of 100 metres, the report said, adding that test drilling has yielded a daily production of 413 barrels of crude oil and 68,000 cubic metres of natural gas.
  <br>
  <br>
  Huizhou 19-6 is China's first large-scale integrated clastic oilfield in the deep to ultra-deep layers, the report said.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to CNOOC, offshore oil and gas exploration in deep to ultra-deep layers face multiple challenges, including high temperatures, high pressures, and complex conditions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, clastic reservoirs, an important component of deep-sea hydrocarbon deposits, generally have low permeability, making the identification of large oil and gas fields more difficult.
  <br>
  <br>
  Peng Guangrong, a geologist at CNOOC's Shenzhen branch, noted that 60 percent of the world's newly-discovered oil and gas reserves have come from deep layers. With abundant resources and a low level of exploration, deep to ultra-deep layers are expected to drive future growth in oil and gas reserves and production.
  <br>
  <br>
  CNOOC's CEO says China's oil and gas exploration in the eastern South China Sea has seen consecutive breakthroughs, with oilfields exceeding 100 million tonnes in reserves discovered for two straight years. (Xinhua)

<img alt="Repatriation flight with migrants deported from the US lands in at Simon Bolivar International Airport in Maiquetia, Venezuela. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798190_1_20250331090008.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Venezuelan authorities reported the arrival on Sunday of a new flight of 175 migrants expelled by the United States, including a gang leader - the first time Caracas has confirmed a criminal was among the deportees.
 <br>
  <br>
  US President Donald Trump has launched a crackdown on migrants since coming to power in January, deporting hundreds of people to Latin America that his administration has branded as "gangsters."
  <br>
  <br>
  "For the first time in these flights... someone of weight arrives who has been claimed by the Venezuelan justice system," said Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister added that the man was "not from Tren de Aragua," referring to the Venezuelan gang that Washington branded a "foreign terrorist organisation" and claims many of the deported Venezuelan migrants belong to.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cabello received the migrants at the Maiquetia International Airport that serves Caracas.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He belongs to a gang from Trujillo state, the gang... El Cagon," Cabello added, without offering further details on the criminal's identity.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cabello said that of the migrants received by Venezuela so far, none were members of Tren de Aragua.
  <br>
  <br>
  Venezuela and the United States broke off diplomatic relations in 2019, but had a rapprochement in January to agree on deportation flights.
  <br>
  <br>
  That cooperation was interrupted for a month after Washington cracked down on Venezuela's oil sector, but flights resumed a week ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sunday's flight was the third to land since the resumption.
  <br>
  <br>
  In total, 918 people have arrived in Venezuela after being deported from the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another 553 migrants have returned from Mexico, although it was unclear whether they were originally deported from US soil.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to the United Nations, almost eight million Venezuelans have left their country, fleeing an economic crisis that began to show signs of recovery in 2021.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government claims that more than 1.2 million have returned. (AFP)

    Starmer, Trump discuss possible US-UK trade deal

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Keir Starmer and Donald Trump spoke on Sunday and had "productive" talks towards a UK-US trade deal, the British Prime Minister's Downing Street office said on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Since Britain's exit from the European Union at the start of the decade, successive UK governments have sought to strike a trade deal with the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They discussed the productive negotiations between their respective teams on a UK-US economic prosperity deal, agreeing that these will continue at pace this week," a statement read.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They agreed to stay in touch in the coming days."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump himself has dangled the prospect of a "great" deal that could help the United Kingdom avoid, or at least soften, the blow caused by the tariffs the US president has promised.
  <br>
  <br>
  Unlike the EU, Britain has declined to retaliate against the tariffs already imposed on the country's steel industry.
  <br>
  <br>
  Though the previous Conservative government did not manage to ink a deal in, Labour party leader Starmer came away from a Washington visit in late February hopeful of reaching an agreement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The UK is believed to want a trade deal ahead of Trump's so-called April 2 "Liberation Day", when he is set to unveil a range of tariffs for different trading partners.
  <br>
  <br>
  But any such accord is yet to see the light of day. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The World Health Organisation (WHO) said on Sunday that the Myanmar earthquake was a top-level emergency as it urgently sought US$8 million to save lives and prevent disease outbreaks over the next 30 days.
 <br>
  <br>
  The WHO said the high numbers of casualties and trauma injuries were at high risk of infection due to limited surgical capacity in the country, while the underlying conditions in Myanmar meant the quake was likely to intensify the risk of disease.
  <br>
  <br>
  "WHO has classified this crisis as a Grade 3 emergency - the highest level of activation under its Emergency Response Framework," the United Nations health agency said in its flash appeal for funds.
  <br>
  <br>
  The initial 7.7-magnitude quake struck near the central Myanmar city of Mandalay on Friday, followed minutes later by a 6.7-magnitude aftershock.
  <br>
  <br>
  The quake has killed more than 1,700 people in Myanmar and at least 18 in neighbouring Thailand.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Myanmar, "preliminary assessments indicate high numbers of casualties and trauma-related injuries, with urgent needs for emergency care. Electricity and water supplies remain disrupted, worsening access to health services and heightening risks of waterborne and food-borne disease outbreaks," the WHO said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Trauma-related injuries - including fractures, open wounds, and crush syndrome - are at high risk of infection and complications due to limited surgical capacity and inadequate infection prevention and control."
  <br>
  <br>
  The WHO said hospitals were overwhelmed, while the scale of deaths, injuries and damage to health facilities "are not yet fully understood".
  <br>
  <br>
  The agency said displacement into overcrowded shelters, combined with the destruction of water systems and sanitation infrastructure, had sharply increased the risk of communicable disease outbreaks. (AFP)

File photo: AFP' src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798193_1_20250331091507.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Richard Chamberlain, the Emmy-nominated actor and 1960s heartthrob who rocketed to fame in the TV medical drama "Dr Kildare" and starred in the mini-series "Shogun" and "The Thorn Birds" has died at the age of 90, publicist Harlan Boll said.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chamberlain died late on Saturday in Hawaii from complications from a stroke, he said in a statement on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chamberlain was an instant hit, and became a teen idol, as the handsome Dr James Kildare in the series that ran from 1961-1966. The Guardian newspaper said the then 27-year-old actor "looked like he had been sculpted by a loving god out of butter, honey and grace."
  <br>
  <br>
  The breakout role was the start of a six decade-career that spanned theatre, films and television.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chamberlain was dubbed the "king of the mini-series" after appearing in several TV dramas in the 1980s and earned plaudits on stage in roles ranging from Professor Henry Higgins in "My Fair Lady" and Captain von Trapp in "The Sound of Music" to Shakespeare's Hamlet and Richard II.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also was the original Jason Bourne in the 1988 mini-series "The Bourne Identity."
  <br>
  <br>
  "What's fascinating about Richard is that his range is enormous. His ability to be different each time out is what makes him such a valuable property," producer Susan Baerwald told the New York Times in 1988.
  <br>
  <br>
  The versatile actor was nominated for four Emmys -- as an English navigator in 17th century Japan in "Shogun" (1981), a love-torn priest in "The Thorn Birds" (1983), Swedish diplomat Raoul Wallenberg in "Wallenberg: A Hero's Story" (1985) and for the title role in the 1975 TV movie "The Count of Monte-Cristo."
  <br>
  <br>
  Most of his roles were as romantic leading men, which is why he did not publicly reveal he was a homosexual until he was 68 years old. He feared it would ruin his career. For much of his life he said he pretended to be someone else. "When you grow up in the ’30s, ’40s and ’50s being gay, it's not only ain't easy, it's just impossible,” he told the New York Times in 2014. "I assumed there was something terribly wrong with me. And even becoming famous and all that, it was still there."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chamberlain said it was a tremendous relief after he acknowledged his sexuality in his 2003 autobiography "Shattered Love: A Memoir."
  <br>
  <br>
  "I had no fear left," he said in a 2019 interview. "It was a wonderful experience. People were open, friendly and sweet."
  <br>
  <br>
  Born George Richard Chamberlain on March 31, 1934, in Los Angeles, he was the youngest of two sons. He had hoped to be an artist but switched to acting after attending Pomona College in California.
  <br>
  <br>
  His acting career was put on hold when he was drafted into the US Army in 1956 and served in Korea. After his discharge, Chamberlain returned to Los Angeles, where he co-founded a theatre group and had small parts on TV before becoming Dr Kildare.
  <br>
  <br>
  The success of the TV show led to a brief singing career and film roles opposite Julie Christie in "Petulia" (1968) and "The Madwoman of Chaillot" (1969) with Katherine Hepburn. He had a brief run in the musical "Breakfast at Tiffany's" with Mary Tyler Moore. The show closed after four previews.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the late 1960s, Chamberlain moved to England where he honed his acting skills in the BBC series "The Portrait of a Lady" and as Hamlet at the Birmingham Repertory Theatre.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Dr Kildare was a huge hit in England, and I heard that all the London reviewers were coming to rip this interloper to pieces," he said in an interview. "But we got very good reviews."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chamberlain returned to the big screen as Lord Byron in the drama "Lady Caroline Lamb" (1972), "The Three Musketeers" (1973) and as a villain in the disaster film "The Towering Inferno" (1974).
  <br>
  <br>
  Throughout his career he mixed roles in Broadway plays, including Tennessee Williams' "The Night of the Iguana," with musicals, TV and films.
  <br>
  <br>
  After coming out publicly, he played both gay and straight characters in TV shows including "Brothers & Sisters," "Will & Grace" and "Desperate Housewives."
  <br>
  <br>
  The actor released a book of haiku poetry in 2012 and narrated Audubon environmental television specials.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chamberlain lived in Hawaii for many years and had a three-decade relationship with actor and writer Martin Rabbett, his co-star in the 1986 adventure film "Allan Quatermain and the Lost City of Gold." The couple parted in 2010 but remained close friends.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He is free and soaring to those loved ones before us. How blessed were we to have known such an amazing and loving soul," Rabbett said in a statement. (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Marcus Rashford's first goals for Aston Villa inspired a 3-0 win against Preston that sent his side into the FA Cup semi-finals for the first time in 10 years.
 <br>
  <br>
  Rashford struck twice in the second half at Deepdale to end Preston's stubborn resistance before Jacob Ramsey wrapped up Villa's long-awaited return to the last four.
  <br>
  <br>
  Villa will face Crystal Palace, 3-0 winners at Fulham on Saturday, in the semi-finals at Wembley on the weekend of April 26 to 27.
  <br>
  <br>
  Revitalised since joining Villa on loan from Manchester United during the January transfer window, Rashford is beginning to show the form that made him one of England's brightest stars prior to his steep decline over the last two years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Amid concerns over his attitude and off-field behaviour, Rashford was deemed expendable by United manager Ruben Amorim, after also clashing with former Old Trafford boss Erik ten Hag.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 27-year-old hadn't scored since netting for United against Everton on December 1.
  <br>
  <br>
  Deployed in the central striker's role that often seemed to dent his confidence at United, Rashford was too dynamic for second-tier Preston to handle in the latest sign that his career might not be destined to end in disappointment after all.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's a great feeling, I feel like I've been getting fitter and playing better football since I've been here. It's always nice for a forward to get a goal so hopefully it continues," Rashford said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I missed a lot of football before joining up with Villa. It's step by step. My body feels good and I'm enjoying my football for now," he added. "We're very ambitious. We'll see where it takes us."
  <br>
  <br>
  While struggling United have been mired in turmoil, Rashford has benefited from moving to upwardly mobile Villa.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Manchester City came from behind to reach the FA Cup semi-finals for a record seventh consecutive season with a 2-1 win over Bournemouth, but victory came at a cost as Erling Haaland hobbled off injured.
  <br>
  <br>
  Haaland had seen a first-half penalty saved before Evanilson put the Cherries in front.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Norwegian made amends by equalising four minutes into the second period before being forced off with an ankle injury.
  <br>
  <br>
  His replacement, Omar Marmoush, took just two minutes to score the winner from a second assist by the impressive Nico O'Reilly as City booked a semi-final clash against Nottingham Forest.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Seven times in a row reaching semi-finals in the FA Cup – this is outstanding. This generation of players, they have done this," said City boss Pep Guardiola.
  <br>
  <br>
  City have been a shadow of the side that won four consecutive Premier League titles this season and Guardiola said prior to the game that even FA Cup glory would not save a miserable season.
  <br>
  <br>
  The English champions' collapse in the Premier League began at Bournemouth back in November with a 2-1 defeat that kicked off a run of six defeats in eight games.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Guardiola hailed the difference in attitude in his side between then and now.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We came here in November with the flip flops on against a team that if you don't compete, it is impossible," added Guardiola.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In football you have to run," he added. "People say about my teams 'how good they play' but no, it is how much we run, how much we fight and for many games this season it didn't happen." (AFP)

    Trump threatens Iran with bombings and tariffs

<img alt="In a telephone interview with NBC News, Trump said US and Iranian officials were talking but did not elaborate. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798156_2_20250331075407.jpg&q=90">

<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump on Sunday threatened Iran with bombings and secondary tariffs if Tehran did not come to an agreement with Washington over its nuclear programme.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a telephone interview with NBC News, Trump said US and Iranian officials were talking but did not elaborate.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If they don't make a deal, there will be bombing," Trump said. "But there's a chance that if they don't make a deal, that I will do secondary tariffs on them like I did four years ago."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's language represented a sharpening of his comment a few days earlier that if Tehran refused to negotiate a new nuclear agreement, "bad, bad things are going to happen to Iran."
  <br>
  <br>
  Western powers accuse Iran of having an clandestine agenda to develop nuclear weapons capability by enriching uranium to a high level of fissile purity, above what they say is justifiable for a civilian atomic energy programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tehran says its nuclear programme is wholly for civilian energy purposes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump in 2018 pulled the United States out of an agreement to relieve sanctions on Iran in return for curbs on its nuclear programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  Now, in his second term, he has said he is open to talks on a new deal that could reduce the risk of military escalation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump revealed in early March that he had sent a letter proposing such talks to Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tehran, deeply suspicious of the US administration after Trump's withdrawal from the original nuclear deal, has refused to negotiate directly with Washington.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Thursday, Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi told the official IRNA news agency that he had delivered a letter responding to Trump's outreach to Oman, which has served as an intermediary in the past. (Agencies)

    Mitchell magic as Cavs down Clippers to bag 60th win

<img alt="Donovan Mitchell scored 24 points in the Cavs' win over the Los Angeles Clippers. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798179_1_20250331075136.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Donovan Mitchell led from the front as the Cleveland Cavaliers bagged their 60th win of the NBA season with a 127-122 victory over the in-form Los Angeles Clippers.
 <br>
  <br>
  Cleveland talisman Mitchell finished with 24 points, 12 rebounds and seven assists in what Cavs coach Kenny Atkinson later described as his best performance of the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sunday's victory means Cleveland have reached 60 wins in a season for the first time since the 2009-2010 campaign, and for only the third time in franchise history.
  <br>
  <br>
  More significantly, the win leaves Cleveland four-and-a-half games clear of NBA champions Boston in the race for the number one seeding in the Eastern Conference playoffs with just seven regular season fixtures remaining.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cleveland coach Atkinson said reaching 60 wins was beyond his expectations at the start of the campaign following a 48-victory season in 2023-2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I didn't expect 60 wins," Atkinson said. "My internal goal was 'Can we improve from last year?' That was kind of where my mind was. But for this team to take it to another level and kind of shatter that says a lot. And we're not done – we can still add to that.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But we've got to celebrate this," he continued. "It's not the end goal, but we should take a deep breath and celebrate 60 wins. It's so hard to do in this league. I'm really happy for the guys today."
  <br>
  <br>
  Mitchell received offensive support from Jarrett Allen with 25 points, while Evan Mobley added 22 and Darius Garland 19.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Atkinson reserved special praise for Mitchell, who was immense at both ends of the court for Cleveland, with four steals in addition to his points tally.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He's at that kind of maturity and mental level where he can manipulate the game how he wants it," Atkinson said of the 28-year-old six-time NBA All-Star.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I would argue that this was probably his best all around game all year," he added. "He did everything tonight and showed great leadership."
  <br>
  <br>
  The defeat left the Clippers in eighth position in the Western Conference, where they are locked in a ferocious dog-fight with Golden State and Minnesota for an automatic ticket into the playoffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Clippers are on 42-32 – the same record as the seventh-placed Timberwolves – with the Warriors sixth on 42-31 heading into the final two weeks of the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  The top six teams in the Western Conference advance to the playoffs while teams ranked from seventh to 10th play a mini-tournament to determine the final two playoff slots. (AFP)

    Four large state-owned banks recapitalise

<img alt="The fundraising will boost the ability of the banks to bolster the real economy. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798177_1_20250331072356.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Four of the mainland's largest state-owned banks said on Sunday they plan to raise a combined 520 billion yuan (US$71.60 billion) in private placements from investors, including the Ministry of Finance (MOF), after Beijing pledged to help them support the economy.
 <br>
  <br>
  The fundraising, which aims to boost the banks' core tier-1 capital, comes after policymakers vowed earlier this month to recapitalise major state banks to the tune of 500 billion yuan to boost their ability to bolster the real economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bank of China said it aims to raise up to 165 billion yuan and China Construction Bank plans private placements of up to 105 billion yuan, filings released by the banks on Sunday said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bank of Communications said it will sell shares of as much as 120 billion yuan, and Postal Savings Bank of China will raise up to 130 billion yuan.
  <br>
  <br>
  The finance ministry, a major shareholder of the four banks, will be involved in all four capital raises, the filings showed. The ministry is set to become the controlling shareholder for Bank of Communications following the share issue, the bank said in its filing.
  <br>
  <br>
  The four banks said that capital replenishment from the MOF is a crucial move from the government to support their stable operations and development.
  <br>
  <br>
  Industry analysts said that the capital replenishment is a proactive measure that will strengthen the banks' capital foundations and optimise their capital structures.
  <br>
  <br>
  This move will enhance their operational resilience and risk management capabilities, enabling them to better serve the real economy and stabilise the financial system, according to analysts.
  <br>
  <br>
  China has set its economic growth target for this year at roughly 5 percent, unchanged from last year, as the government pledged more fiscal resources to fend off deflationary pressures and offset the impact from US tariffs. (Xinhua, Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Francesco Bagnaia won an eventful Grand Prix of the Americas to end crash-victim Marc Márquez's perfect start to the MotoGP season.
 <br>
  <br>
  Six-time elite class champion Márquez was set fair to make it six wins out of six in Texas after romping to victories in the sprints and main races in Thailand, Argentina and Saturday's sprint in Austin.
  <br>
  <br>
  But a crash on lap nine did it for the Spanish superstar, gifting victory to his Ducati factory teammate.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alex Márquez, on a Ducati satellite bike, took second for the sixth time to move one point clear of his older brother in the riders' standings.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fabio Di Giannantonio, on another Ducati satellite machine, came in third at the Circuit of the Americas.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bagnaia supplied Ducati with their 20th consecutive grand prix success, just two shy of Honda's historic benchmark of 22.
  <br>
  <br>
  There was chaos before lights out with riders on the grid, their bikes equipped with wet tyres, all set for the start.
  <br>
  <br>
  But then, with the changeable overcast conditions drying, pole-sitter Marc Márquez dramatically ran back to the pits to swop to a bike with slicks, triggering a domino effect as his grid rivals copied his example.
  <br>
  <br>
  As he had not sat on his bike Márquez did not break any rules, only causing mayhem, and a delayed start with a race reduced by one lap to 19 laps.
  <br>
  <br>
  There was one last twist to the pre-race drama, when Maverick Vinales, last year's winner, had to wheel his bike off the grid with an issue to start from the pits.
  <br>
  <br>
  Márquez got away to a flyer when they were eventually let go to lead from Alex Márquez with Bagnaia up from sixth to third.
  <br>
  <br>
  Márquez senior quickly stamped his authority on the race with more than a one second cushion over the chasing pack.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bagnaia moved up to second after eight laps, albeit over two seconds behind the rider who lists the Circuit of the Americas (COTA) as one of his favourite tracks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Then the race was turned on its head when Márquez crashed on lap nine, slithering off his bike after touching a kerb.
  <br>
  <br>
  He rejoined in 18th place with 10 laps remaining, only to call it a day a couple of laps later.
  <br>
  <br>
  One frustrated bystander at COTA was world champion Jorge Martin who has missed the opening three rounds after breaking his right hand and foot in pre-season testing crash in Malaysia.
  <br>
  <br>
  That has delayed his title defence and his debut for Aprilia. He moved to the team after being overlooked by Ducati for the factory ride that was offered to Márquez.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Spaniard faces a seemingly Herculean task though to defend his title when he resumes in Qatar next time out, lagging 87 points behind Alex Márquez on his belated seasonal bow, with Marc Márquez on 86, and Bagnaia third on 75 points. (AFP)

    Barcelona restore Liga lead in Girona romp

<img alt="Lewandowski scored twice as Barca remain unbeaten this year in 20 matches. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798174_1_20250331055012.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Robert Lewandowski bagged a brace as Barcelona eased to a 4-1 victory over Girona to move three points clear at the top of La Liga.
 <br>
  <br>
  After second-placed Real Madrid pulled level on points with them on Saturday by beating Leganes, Hansi Flick's side restored their advantage at the Olympic Stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lewandowski responded to Madrid striker Kylian Mbappe's double with one of his own to stay three goals ahead in the race for Spain's golden boot.
  <br>
  <br>
  Barcelona, unbeaten this year in 20 matches, took the lead through a Ladislav Krejci own goal near the end of the first half.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arnaut Danjuma pulled Girona level but Lewandowski netted twice and Ferran Torres finished off the rout.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We played with patience, we had a plan and if we play with that plan we can always score a lot of goals and win the game," veteran striker Lewandowski said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 36-year-old said he had the legs to keep playing for seasons to come.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I know a lot of people are talking abut my age but I want to play more years at the top level," said the Poland international. "I feel very good physically, I think looking at the stats there's no difference now to a few years ago."
  <br>
  <br>
  Girona beat Barcelona twice last season but have struggled to hit those heights again and sit 13th.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They were superior," admitted Girona coach Michel Sanchez. "There's a difference between the teams and that's the truth. Barcelona dream of titles every year."
  <br>
  <br>
  Flick rotated some of his usual suspects with the Copa del Rey semi-final clash against Atletico Madrid in mind.
  <br>
  <br>
  Barca were below their free-flowing best in the first half despite dominating, occasionally threatening through the dynamic running of teenage star Lamine Yamal and frantic energy of Fermin Lopez.
  <br>
  <br>
  Barcelona wanted a penalty when Fermin was brought down by Yaser Asprilla on the edge of the box and a free-kick was given.
  <br>
  <br>
  A VAR review showed the contact was inside the area but the referee decided Lopez fouled Asprilla as they came together, much to Barcelona's chagrin.
  <br>
  <br>
  Paulo Gazzaniga produced a sensational save with his fingertips to push out a Ronald Araujo header but Barca found a way through before half-time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yamal's dangerous free-kick aimed at Eric Garcia was deflected into his own net by Krejci at the near post.
  <br>
  <br>
  Girona had produced very little of note in the first half but were back level eight minutes into the second through Danjuma.
  <br>
  <br>
  Daley Blind played the Dutch striker through and he beat Wojciech Szczesny with a clinical low finish. However, Barcelona were swiftly back in front as La Liga's top goalscorer Lewandowski notched his 24th of the campaign.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lopez nodded the ball across the six-yard box and Lewandowski contorted his body to reach it and flick it between Gazzaniga's legs.
  <br>
  <br>
  The forward secured Barcelona's victory with his 25th, slotting home after substitute Frenkie de Jong pushed forward into space and fed him.
  <br>
  <br>
  There was time for Torres to add a fourth after Gerard Martin found him and for the brilliant Yamal to bend a strike against the crossbar.
  <br>
  <br>
  This was remarkably the 20th time this season Flick's side have scored four goals or more from 45 games, with a potential treble in their sights.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is what I love about my team, they always want to score goals, it's always like that," Flick told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is the mentality and the attitude of the team and it's good, I think everyone loves it, you love it, the fans love it, the club loves it, and everyone is happy at the moment," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere, fourth-place Athletic Bilbao were held to a 0-0 draw at home by Osasuna, allowing Villarreal to cut the gap on them to six points after beating Getafe 2-1.
  <br>
  <br>
  Real Betis, sixth, won their sixth game in a row to stay on Villarreal's tail, beating rivals Sevilla 2-1 in a derby clash.
  <br>
  <br>
  Valencia's 1-0 win over Mallorca took them 15th, four points clear of the relegation zone. (AFP)

    Foreign aid, rescuers come to Myanmar's assistance

<img alt="This building in Mandalay is among those that collapsed in Friday's killer earthquake. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798150_1_20250330223525.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The toll from Myanmar's earthquake continued to rise on Sunday, as foreign rescue teams and aid rushed into the country where hospitals were overwhelmed and some communities scrambled to mount rescue efforts with limited resources.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 7.7-magnitude quake, one of Myanmar's strongest in a century, struck on Friday, leaving around 1,700 people dead, 3,400 injured and over 300 missing as of Sunday, the military government said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The junta chief, Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, warned that the number of fatalities could go up and his administration faced a challenging situation, state media reported, three days after he made a rare call for international assistance.
  <br>
  <br>
  India, China and Thailand are among Myanmar's neighbours that have sent relief materials and teams, along with aid and personnel from Malaysia, Singapore and Russia.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The destruction has been extensive, and humanitarian needs are growing by the hour," the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With temperatures rising and the monsoon season approaching in just weeks, there is an urgent need to stabilise affected communities before secondary crises emerge."
  <br>
  <br>
  The United States pledged US$2 million in aid "through Myanmar-based humanitarian assistance organisations" and said in a statement that an emergency response team from USAID, which is undergoing massive cuts under the Trump administration, is deploying to Myanmar.
  <br>
  <br>
  Critical infrastructure – including bridges, highways, airports and railways – across the country of 55 million lie damaged, slowing humanitarian efforts while the conflict that has battered the economy, displaced over 3.5 million people and debilitated the health system rages on.
  <br>
  <br>
  In some areas near the epicentre, residents said government assistance was scarce, leaving people to fend for themselves.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is necessary to restore the transportation routes as soon as possible," Min Aung Hlaing told officials on Saturday, according to state media. "It is necessary to fix the railways and also reopen the airports so that rescue operations would be more effective."
  <br>
  <br>
  The US Geological Service's predictive modelling estimated Myanmar's death toll could eventually top 10,000 and losses could exceed the country's annual economic output.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hospitals in parts of central and northwestern Myanmar, including the second-biggest city, Mandalay, and the capital Naypyitaw, were struggling to cope with an influx of injured people, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said late on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The quake also shook parts of neighbouring Thailand, bringing down an under-construction skyscraper and killing 18 people across the capital, according to Thai authorities.
  <br>
  <br>
  At least 76 people remained trapped under the debris of the collapsed Bangkok building, where rescue operations continued for a third day, using drones and sniffer dogs to hunt for survivors. (Reuters)

<img alt="The three-day Hong Kong Sevens concludes its first showcase at the brand new Kai Tak Stadium. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798148_1_20250330214352.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A fireworks display capped off a three-day rugby extravaganza at the Kai Tak Stadium on Sunday, bringing an end to the Hong Kong Sevens at its new home.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chief Executive John Lee, who was there with his wife, said he had a great time with tens of thousands of fans.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The first major tournament at the Kai Tak Stadium has successfully 'scored a try'," Lee wrote on social media.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Next, let's wait for more exciting sports and cultural activities to take place, giving full play to the venue's enchantment, while looking forward to future mega events one after the other."
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 38,000 spectators were on hand for the third and final day of the Sevens, according to organisers, with total attendance topping 110,000 visits over three days.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Transport Department said overall traffic conditions were mostly smooth after the event drew to a close.
  <br>
  <br>
  Spectators were advised to take the MTR by going to either Kai Tak or Sung Wong Toi station.
  <br>
  <br>
  There were also special bus routes, as well as a number of taxis to pick up passengers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, some fans complained on Sunday that they could not get food, with some stalls and vendors said to have run out of supply.
  <br>
  <br>
  During a tour of the venue in the afternoon, culture, sports and tourism minister Rosanna Law said she had told operators to enhance their food supply services.
  <br>
  <br>
  She also said the atmosphere and operations at the venue were very good in general.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Argentina on Sunday captured the Hong Kong Rugby Sevens for the first time, defeating France in a hard-fought men's final at the Kai Tak Stadium.
 <br>
  <br>
  Neither team managed to break through in a defensive-minded first half, which finished 0-0.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the second half, tries from Santiago Alvarez and Marcos Moneta in quick succession, and an ensuing conversion, put Argentina up 12-0.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gregoire Arfeuil of France scored a last-minute try but it was too little, too late.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 12-7 win gave Argentina their third straight title in the World Series, having also come out on top in Perth and Vancouver.
  <br>
  <br>
  They extended their lead atop the standings to 12 points ahead of Fiji on 88 points entering the Singapore Sevens next week.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chief Executive John Lee presented the winning trophy to Argentina.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alvarez, playing for his country for the 14th season, said it wasn't just about winning but also the connections he has built with his teammates.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Difficult to describe what we're feeling, what we did [as] a team," he told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The connection we have, really, really happy and proud of this team. I will always say thank you to this team because for me, it's all I have in my life."
  <br>
  <br>
  While there was a bigger contingent of French fans at the Kai Tak Stadium, their team were unable to repeat the magic when they put away two-time defending champions New Zealand in the quarterfinals on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The New Zealand women's team had better luck, defeating archrivals Australia in the final 26-19 for their third straight crown in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two sides went back and forth for much of the game, before Jorja Miller scored two tries for the Black Ferns in the second half to open up a 14-point margin.
  <br>
  <br>
  Australia's Mackenzie Davis scored late to add to two tries from teammate Maddison Levi, but their efforts came up short.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It means everything... this puts us in a good place for the world series title as well so, I'm really stoked about it," New Zealand captain Sarah Hirini said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Black Ferns now have 96 points in the World Series standings, eight more than Australia ahead of the trip to Singapore for the final stop on the Sevens calendar.

<div class="itemFullText">
 An SAR government rescue team is set to begin inspection work on the ground in earthquake-stricken Myanmar as they arrived in the country's capital Naypyidaw.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 51-member team, led by deputy chief fire officer Cheu Yu-kok, were greeted by diplomats from the Chinese Embassy in Myanmar.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a video posted on the Security Bureau's Facebook page, Cheu said his squad will work with other rescue teams to assess the situation and make further action plans.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chief Executive John Lee said earlier the SAR government has earmarked HK$30 million from the Disaster Relief Fund to help victims of the tremor.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, a number of international rescue organisations called for support for the quake victims.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kyi Minn, national director of World Vision International Myanmar, talked about the devastation in a video message on Facebook.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was quite a prolonged quake compared to the previous one, like nearly four to five minutes is shaking. So staff were quite nervous and could not contact anyone because all the phone lines were cut off," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also expressed concerns about the safety of children, particularly those separated from their parents.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong Red Cross, for its part, said it has allocated HK$200,000 in relief support.

 The head of the Hong Kong, China Rugby Association, James Farndon, on Sunday hailed the first-ever Sevens at the Kai Tak Stadium, calling the event a massive success for the SAR.
 <br>
  <br>
  Farndon stressed the importance of the upgraded fan experience at the new venue, following nearly half a century at the Hong Kong Stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's been an amazing experience for all involved," Farndon told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The main point I'd make is what the experience is like for the fans -- and from what I see, it's obviously a bigger house, bigger party. The fan experience has been fantastic."
  <br>
  <br>
  He also spoke about the popularity of the stadium's South Stand.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The South Stand's been rocking, and the entertainment has been fantastic too," he added. "If you look at the other aspects of the stadium we've been able to add in... it's just a lot more for the fans to experience, and I think they really enjoyed it."
  <br>
  <br>
  Farndon also highlighted the work to bring the showpiece tournament to Kai Tak, having gone through multiple stress tests in the run-up to the three-day sporting event.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's been a real journey for us, but a real positive one," Farndon explained. "We've had test events at various stages, which have been able to give experience to our event operations team -- to learn the back of house and how [the Sevens] is going to work for the players, coaches and the international teams coming in."
  <br>
  <br>
  Brett Robinson, the chairman of World Rugby, also spoke highly about new Kai Tak experience.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For those of us who had the chance to be around [the stadium], and also from an athlete's perspective, it's purpose-built for the game of Sevens," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You've got women that are singing songs, and athletes that are just really enjoying the experience and really feeling quite valued."

<div class="itemFullText">
 Culture, sports and tourism minister Rosanna Law said operators of Kai Tak Sports Park made improvements every day during the three-day Rugby Sevens tournament.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters on Sunday afternoon at Kai Tak, Law said the atmosphere and operations at the venue were very good in general.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I also had to wait in line for some time when buying a hamburger yesterday, so I told the venue operators to enhance their food supply services. The operators increased their supplies today, and I know that more staff were arranged to help out at vendors at the arena and youth sports ground," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Law added that more improvements can be made in terms of the variety of food available, and whether to allow more taxis there to help disperse visitors.
  <br>
  <br>
  She also called on fans to make use of the MTR and buses to leave the venue when the Sevens draw to a close.

    Cathay plane flyover marks old airport's centennial

<div class="itemFullText">
 A Cathay Pacific aircraft on Sunday flew near Kai Tak during the Hong Kong Sevens, an area where the city's former international airport began operations 100 years ago.
 <br>
  <br>
  The A350 operated by the flagship carrier took off for its tour over Hong Kong at around 4pm, flying over Victoria Harbour and passing the old Kai Tak Airport runway.
  <br>
  <br>
  The aircraft flew at an altitude of as low as 1,100ft.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some at the Kai Tak Stadium were able to see the plane through giant windows near the South Stand, while others viewed the flyover on a big screen.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stuart Morton, who's lived in Hong Kong for decades, said he felt nostalgic when he saw the plane.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I first came here in 1985 with the military. I landed at Kai Tak," he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It brings back memories of coming in over [Checkerboard Hill], turning around and then coming and landing at Kai Tak."
  <br>
  <br>
  Visitor Mavi Mbochay said the flyover served as a reminder of what the stadium used to be.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It just symbolises the history. It's important to connect the past and the future," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The flyover marked the centennial of the old airport.

 Both the SAR men's and women's teams won an invitational in style at the first Hong Kong Sevens at Kai Tak Stadium on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The local squads drew some of the loudest cheers from an electric home crowd, as the men's team successfully defended their Melrose Claymore title.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the final against the national team, Hong Kong, China conceded a try in the first half but quickly bounced back, racing to a 14-5 half-time lead.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SAR scored three more tries against China after the break to come away 35-5 winners.
  <br>
  <br>
  Max Denmark scored one of those second-half tries.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I just saw the ball in front of me and the try line's so close, so all I can think of was I've got to get over there," he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Scoring at home, in this stadium, hearing the crowd is the best feeling on the planet."
  <br>
  <br>
  The women's team took advantage of a Kazakhstan player being sent off in the first half to score a 45-5 victory in the final.
  <br>
  <br>
  Co-captain Natasha Olson-Thorne scored a try for the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When you're going through, there's a moment when you break through and you're like, am I in the clear? And you're like, yes, yes I am. And I could hear (teammate) Chong Ka-yan behind me going, you've got this, keep going," she told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So it's good to have that confidence from the team, to know that they back you, it's quite special."
  <br>
  <br>
  SAR co-captain Chloe Chan hailed the win, calling it a total team effort, adding that they now turn their focus to the National Games in November.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong, China women's squad improved from their runners-up finish a year ago.

 Rugby lovers from Hong Kong and beyond filled up the Kai Tak Stadium on Sunday to enjoy a final day of sport and partying at the Hong Kong Sevens.
 <br>
  <br>
  Now in its new home, the annual rugby showcase isn't just about the action on the pitch. The food and drinks, the raucous atmosphere and the people are also what attracted fans to the stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brian Hopkins, who supports Great Britain, said the Sevens is the perfect occasion to celebrate his 40th birthday.
  <br>

   "There's no better place to do it. It's a great atmosphere, great rugby, great stadium as well," he told RTHK. "We tried the food, we tried plenty of drinks... It's going to be a keg of Guinness against my name."
   <br>
   <br>
   For Donna Hopkins, the stadium was friendly to wheelchair users.
   <br>
   <br>
   "Down and around here, I could get to the food, the toilets were really accessible. I could see the pitch really well," she said.
   <br>

    <br>
    <br>
    "It's all about the people, connecting and enjoying a magnificent occasion and this magnificent venue," he said. "Everyone seems to come for the right reason - have a good time, meet people, enjoy, and leave the results on the field and celebrate together."

     Epeli Buliciri, also a Fiji fan, was adding this year's Hong Kong Sevens to his impressive resume.
     <br>
     <br>
     "This is my 122nd tournament. It's my 17th Hong Kong Sevens tournament," he said.
     <br>
     <br>
     "Hong Kong is always special for Fiji. Even sometimes when life gets down and all that, you can always rely on the Hong Kong Sevens and the Fiji team to get you back up there."
     <br>
     <br>
     His hat with a glistening pin collection was not the only one competing for attention at the stadium.

       Others drew inspiration from Freddy, an animated weatherman on local TV.
       <br>

       The group said they planned for their costume one month or two ago, and chose one relating to rainy conditions.

    'Hutchison deal won't stop family offices coming here'

<img alt="Christopher Hui says the SAR is an attractive destination for capital and family offices. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798116_1_20250330155453.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The controversy over CK Hutchison's plans to sell dozens of ports won't affect family offices' interest in investing in Hong Kong, financial services minister Christopher Hui said on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a TV programme, Hui said those attending the Wealth for Good in Hong Kong Summit last week did not raise concerns about the deal.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said 160 family offices from around the world indicated they will or are planning to set up shop in Hong Kong, of which a quarter are from Europe and the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So as you can see, I think there has been absolutely no impact. We continue to be an ideal destination for attracting capital and especially for family offices and other institutions to establish themselves here."
  <br>
  <br>
  Hui also said the government is planning to amend legislation to expand tax concessions for family office investments, covering loans, virtual assets and carbon credits.
  <br>
  <br>
  He expressed confidence that the number of family offices in Hong Kong would increase from 2,700 to over 3,000 in the short term.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sources said the US$23 billion port deal between CK Hutchison and a consortium led by American investment firm BlackRock, which includes strategic assets along the Panama Canal, won't be signed as expected this week.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing officials in charge of SAR affairs have reposted a number of commentaries at the Ta Kung Pao newspaper, criticising the proposed sale.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the latest piece reposted by the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office on Sunday, political and business leaders were quoted as saying that the impact of the proposed deal extends beyond commerce to national security.
  <br>
  <br>
  The article said various sectors in Hong Kong support the move by the State Administration for Market Regulation to examine the deal, adding it is critical for safeguarding fair competition and national interests.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also urged CK Hutchison to reconsider the deal, quoting a number of Hong Kong lawmakers as saying it's naive to view it as a business matter only, given the complex international environment.

<div class="itemFullText">
 France's emphatic run at the Hong Kong Sevens continued on Sunday as they scored a dramatic, nail-biting victory over Fiji to book a place in the final where they will battle Argentina.
 <br>
  <br>
  The French had knocked out two-time defending champions New Zealand in the quarterfinals the day before.
  <br>
  <br>
  Similar to that game, France fell behind against Fiji, but they quickly bounced back to take a 10-7 halftime lead.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two sides then went back-and-forth before the final play that went in favour of France.
  <br>
  <br>
  The referee called for video review over Matteo Garcia's try, eventually ruling it was successful.
  <br>
  <br>
  France won 24-17.
  <br>
  <br>
  Argentina booked the other berth in the final by defeating Australia 31-7, thanks in part to a hat-trick of tries from German Schulz.
  <br>
  <br>
  Neither France nor Argentina have won the title before.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the women's draw, New Zealand's quest for a third consecutive title is very much alive as they crushed Canada 41-0 in the semi-final.
  <br>
  <br>
  They'll meet rivals Australia in the title showdown.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jazmin Felix-Hotham scored two tries as New Zealand put the game out of reach in the first half, leading 26-0 at intermission.
  <br>
  <br>

<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan said "Super March" has attracted more than 3.4 million visitors to Hong Kong, a 12 percent increase from a year ago.
 <br>
  <br>
  As of Friday, non-mainland arrivals this month reached 960,000, accounting for almost 30 percent of the total.
  <br>
  <br>
  Writing on his weekly blog, Chan also said hotel occupancy at popular areas was near 90 percent, while the retail sector also said the increased foot traffic helped their business.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong has hosted more than 10 major events this month, including snooker's World Grand Prix, the Rugby Sevens and the Art Basel art fair.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan wrote on his blog that when he spoke to visitors and exhibitors at the Art Basel, he expressed hope that more people will do business in Hong Kong apart from enjoying art.
  <br>
  <br>
  The financial secretary also said the new Kai Tak Sports Arena has provided a larger venue and finer facilities for events such as the Rugby Sevens.
  <br>
  <br>
  Attendance at the Sevens is expected to top 140,000 from Friday to Sunday, and all hospitality boxes have been sold out.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Many business representatives attending financial events in Hong Kong this week told me that they look forward to watching matches and participating in other cultural events to experience the vibrancy of the city, in addition to having business meetings," he wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan also said the administration will continue to promote its mega-events economy to attract more high-end business travellers to the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that the government will encourage and support businesses to develop more special products and services, to make Hong Kong a prosperous and enjoyable place.

 Police Commissioner Raymond Siu on Sunday said the force's efforts to raise its image among young people were bearing fruit.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a Commercial Radio programme, Siu said the police have been spreading the message that the force is acting for the benefit of young people.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We asked a university to conduct public opinion research last year and the results are encouraging. It surveyed young people aged 18 to 29 on their views towards the police force and the force's ratings have increased by almost 38 percent. This shows that our efforts over the past few years have not been wasted," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said that the force had faced unprecedented challenges during the 2019 social unrest but that officers had remained united while under great pressure.
  <br>
  <br>
  Siu also said frontline staff had contributed greatly to the city moving from chaos to order.
  <br>
  <br>
  Siu will step down from his post on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I hope the force will continue to work hard and tell citizens clearly what kind of a team we are. I think the Hong Kong Police Force is the most efficient, empathetic and passionate in the world when it comes to police work," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Siu said he would miss working for the force.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee says the SAR government has earmarked HK$30 million from the Disaster Relief Fund to help victims of the severe earthquake that struck central Myanmar on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a Facebook post on Saturday evening, Lee said the government was in close contact with rescue groups to provide swift relief assistance to affected communities.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Disaster Relief Fund Advisory Committee will promptly process related funding applications from organisations," he wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CE added that officials are coordinating with Myanmar's Consul-General in Hong Kong to collect and deliver necessary relief supplies.
  <br>
  <br>
  A 51-member SAR rescue team, including personnel from various departments and two search dogs, arrived in Yangon on Sunday morning.
  <br>
  <br>
  The team, carrying nine tonnes of relief supplies, will drive for 10 hours to the affected area.
  <br>
  <br>
  The number of dead in Myanmar and Thailand stood at nearly 1,700, while thousands were hurt.
  <br>
  <br>
  About 200 people were unaccounted for in both countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among those injured were 13 Chinese nationals in Myanmar, according to the Chinese Embassy in Myanmar.
  <br>
  <br>
  The embassy also said as of Sunday morning, it had received and handled hundreds of requests for help from Chinese citizens and assisted dozens of people in finding their missing relatives and friends.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, rescuers from Myanmar and Yunnan province joined hands in plucking to safety an elderly man who had been trapped for nearly 40 hours under the rubble in the capital, Naypyitaw.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was the first survivor rescued by the 37-member Chinese team that arrived at the quake-hit area on Saturday. (Additional reporting by Xinhua)

    Sabalenka beats Pegula to take Miami Open

<img alt="The title was the Belarusian's first at Miami. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798090_1_20250330101920.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 World number one Aryna Sabalenka powered her way to the Miami Open title on Saturday, beating American Jessica Pegula 7-5 6-2 in the WTA 1000 event at Hard Rock Stadium.
 <br>
  <br>
  The title was the Belarusian's first at Miami and her second of the season following her January triumph in Brisbane.
  <br>
  <br>
  Having lost the final at Indian Wells to Russian 17-year-old Mirra Andreeva earlier this month, Sabalenka was determined not to fall at the last hurdle again.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm super happy to have this trophy, I was able to play my best tennis in the final," said Sabalenka, who paid tribute to Pegula's performance after repeating her win over her from last year's US Open final.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both players struggled to hold their serve in the first set, which saw seven breaks of serve, with Pegula causing Sabalenka some trouble when she brought her up to the net.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the momentum shifted when Pegula was serving to stay in the set at 6-5 down and Sabalenka turned it on, producing a delicate forehand drop and then a superb down the line winner to take the set.
  <br>
  <br>
  Once she recovered from being broken on her first service game of the second set, it was easier going for Sabalenka, whose bid for a third straight Australian Open title was thwarted in the Melbourne final by Madison Keys earlier this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sabalenka broke twice to go 3-1 up and never looked in danger from that point on as she wrapped up the win in one hour 27 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think I was able to completely forget about (it being) the final, about the outside things and I was just so focused on the game," said Sabalenka.
  <br>
  <br>
  In her last 14 matches against top 10 players, Sabalenka has won 12 and she credited her ability in the clutch moments for her record.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is all about those key moments of the match, about playing aggressive and staying with the game plan, going for shots without being afraid of losing the point," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was the third time that Pegula has faced Sabalenka in a final and she has lost on all three occasions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I consider myself one of the world's best hard-court players, but she's probably the best," Pegula conceded after the match.
  <br>
  <br>
  "She just keeps ... raising her level in key moments of the match when she needs to, and I feel like that was the big difference today and the last few times I have played her," she added
  <br>
  <br>
  But Pegula, the world number four, said she was pleased to again have been a serious contender in a tournament.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Happy to be in another big 1000 final and having consistent results and keep going deep in tournaments. The reason we play is to put ourselves in good chances to win these events. I was able to do that the last couple weeks," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 26-year-old Sabalenka has now won eight WTA 1000 titles and 19 titles on the WTA Tour overall - 17 of which have come on hard courts including all three of her Grand Slam singles titles -- the 2023 Australian Open, the 2024 Australian Open and the 2024 US Open.
  <br>
  <br>
  She looks a calmer, more focused, presence on court than in her earlier seasons when she was capable of bouts of rage when the going got tough.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think before, every time I would lose my serve, one game, I could just completely lose the match because I would still be thinking about that first game," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sabalenka said that her struggles in the past with her serve had allowed her to develop a stronger all-round game and more positive mentality.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When I was struggling with my serve I had to push myself on the return and had to play with something else. So now, every time I am losing (serve) I know that I have weapons, that I can return well and that I can break back," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think that challenge really helped me to be more focused and not get too crazy on court after losing a game on my serve," she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The men's final on Sunday will feature Novak Djokovic up against Czech 19-year-old Jakub Mensik with the Serb looking for his 100th professional title. (AFP)

    Protesters target Tesla in anti-Musk campaign

<img alt="Protesters hold up signs outside a Tesla dealership in Michigan. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798089_1_20250330101458.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Demonstrators descended on Tesla dealerships across the United States and in Europe and Canada on Saturday to protest company chief Elon Musk, who has amassed extraordinary power as a top advisor to US President Donald Trump.
 <br>
  <br>
  Waving signs with messages like "Musk is stealing our money" and "Reclaim our country," the protests largely took place peacefully following fiery episodes of vandalism on Teslas in recent weeks that US officials have denounced as "terrorism."
  <br>
  <br>
  Hundreds rallied Saturday outside the Tesla dealership in New York's Manhattan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some blasted Musk, the world's richest man, while others demanded the shuttering of his so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which is dramatically slashing the federal government.
  <br>
  <br>
  Amy Neifeld, a 70-year-old psychologist who had not joined a protest since marching against the Vietnam War in the 1970s, accused Musk of leading the country toward fascism.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm Jewish, so I grew up with a great awareness of fascism," she told AFP. "And it has just gotten uglier and uglier" since Trump returned to the White House.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He acts like he's the vice president," said New York protester Eva Mueller of musk. "He's dismantling, actively, our government, he's dismantling our democracy."
  <br>
  <br>
  The protest was organized by the environmental activist group Planet Over Profit, which argues "stopping Musk will help save lives and protect our democracy."
  <br>
  <br>
  In Washington's posh Georgetown neighbourhood, some 150 people gathered in a festive mood on an unseasonably warm day, dancing and cheering as passing cars honked.
  <br>
  <br>
  Protests also took place in Florida, Massachusetts and California, as well as in in European cities such as London, Berlin and Paris.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Canada's Vancouver, where around one hundred people protested at a Tesla dealership, one person in a dinosaur costume held a placard that said, "You thought the Nazis were extinct? Don't buy a Swasticar."
  <br>
  <br>
  A small group of Americans held signs outside a Tesla dealership in the French capital, including one that read "Send Musk to Mars now."
  <br>
  <br>
  Musk and Trump "are destroying our democracy, not obeying the basic rules of our country, and firing people at agencies that do very important work," said Raf, 59, a Paris protester who did not wish to give his last name.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked for reaction to the protests, Tesla did not immediately respond.
  <br>
  <br>
  Acts of vandalism against Tesla vehicles, dealerships and other facilities have spread for weeks, in protest both against Musk's ruthless job-cutting work, and what has been seen as his unwelcome interference in politics.
  <br>
  <br>
  US Attorney General Pam Bondi has denounced the attacks on Tesla as "domestic terrorism." (AFP)

    Mexico brings in junk food ban

<img alt="A man walks past a sign that refers to the labelling of products, in the subway of Mexico City. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798081_1_20250330075336.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A government-sponsored junk food ban in schools across Mexico took effect on Saturday, officials said, as the country tries to tackle one of the world’s worst obesity and diabetes epidemics.
 <br>
  <br>
  The health guidelines, first published last fall , take a direct shot at salty and sweet processed products that have become a staple for generations of Mexican schoolchildren, such as sugary fruit drinks, packaged chips, artificial pork rinds and soy-encased, chili-flavoured peanuts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Announcing the ban had become law, Mexico's Education Ministry posted on X: “Farewell, junk food!” And it encouraged parents to support the government's crusade by cooking healthy meals for their kids.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mexico's ambitious attempt to remake its food culture and reprogramme the next generation of consumers is being watched closely around the world as governments struggle to turn the tide on a global obesity epidemic .
  <br>
  <br>
  In the United States, for instance, the Trump administration’s health secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. , has vowed to upend the nation's food system and “ Make America Healthy Again " by targeting ultra-processed foods to curb surging obesity and disease.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under Mexico's new order, schools must phase out any food and beverage displaying even one black warning logo marking it as high in salt, sugar, calories and fat. Mexico implemented that compulsory front-of-package labelling system in 2020 .
  <br>
  <br>
  Enforced from Monday morning, the start of the school week, the junk food ban also requires schools to serve more nutritious alternatives to junk food, like bean tacos, and offer plain drinking water.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It is much better to eat a bean taco than a bag of potato chips,” said Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum , who has championed the effort.

  Mexico’s children consume more junk food than anywhere else in Latin America, according to Unicef, which classifies the nation’s childhood obesity epidemic as an emergency. Sugary drinks and highly processed foods account for 40 percent of the total calories that children consume in a day, the agency reports.
  <br>
  <br>
  One-third of Mexican children are already considered overweight or obese, according to government statistics.
  <br>
  <br>
  School administrators found in violation of the order face stiff fines, ranging from US$545 to US$5,450.
  <br>
  <br>
  But enforcement poses a challenge in a country where previous junk food bans have struggled to gain traction and monitoring has been lax across Mexico’s 255,000 schools, many of which lack water fountains and even reliable internet and electricity.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also wasn't immediately clear how the government would forbid the sale of junk food on sidewalks outside school campuses, where street vendors typically hawk candy, chips, nachos and ice cream to kids during recess and after the school day ends. (AP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Japanese restaurant chain Sukiya will temporarily shut nearly all of its roughly 2,000 branches after a rat was found in a miso soup and a bug was found in another meal, the company said on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Sukiya, famous for its beef bowls, apologised in a statement saying a bug contamination at one of its Tokyo restaurants on Friday, two months after the rat incident at another branch.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Sukiya has decided to temporarily close all restaurants, with the exception of some stores in shopping centres, from March 31 to April 4 in order to take measures against pests and vermin," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The fast-food company has about 1,970 stores across Japan.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Nikkei business daily reported that its stores in shopping centres will also be closed as soon as arrangements are made with the facilities.
  <br>
  <br>
  Food recalls are rare in Japan, a country with famously high sanitation standards, but food poisoning and recall incidents occasionally make headlines.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last year, more than 100,000 packets of sliced bread were recalled after parts of a rat were discovered inside two bags. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Ending a 70-year wait for a domestic trophy deserves an official party.
 <br>
  <br>
  Newcastle will get one on Saturday when the team holds an open-top bus parade to celebrate their English League Cup title.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 150,000 fans are expected to join the celebration. The parade route runs from St James’ Park, through the city centre and ends at the Town Moor, an open space where a stage has been erected for an hour-long event that will include comments from players and a trophy lift.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Saudi-backed team beat Liverpool 2-1 nearly two weeks ago at Wembley Stadium for their first major domestic trophy since the FA Cup in 1955. The club also won the now-defunct Inter-Cities Fairs Cup – a European competition – in 1969.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bus was scheduled to set off from the stadium at 4:30 pm local time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Newcastle manager Eddie Howe has been nominated for a municipal honour called the "Freedom of the City." Club legends who have received the recognition include Alan Shearer, Bobby Robson and Shaka Hislop. (AP)

 Fans soaked up the raucous atmosphere at the new Kai Tak Stadium where the Hong Kong Sevens are being held for the first time.
 <br>
  <br>
  Applause and cheers filled the air as day two of the tournament got underway, with many fans praising the party-like mood at the new stadium.

   <br>
   One Australian spectator, Dan – who has been to many previous editions of the Sevens in Causeway Bay's Hong Kong Stadium – said he really likes the new venue.
   <br>
   <br>
   "It feels like the old stadium's atmosphere, just in a much more upgraded arena. It's a great new stadium."
   <br>
   <br>
   He said that besides Australia, he has thrown his support behind the Hong Kong, China squad in the Melrose Claymores competition – after both the men's and women's sides won big in both their respective matches earlier in the day.
   <br>
   <br>
   "[The SAR squad] is always my next best team," he said. "The atmosphere when they play is amazing. I can't wait to see the stadium packed out, it's gonna be a great time."
   <br>

    <br>
    Another fan, from the United Kingdom, shared similar views on the new arena.
    <br>
    <br>
    "I think it's absolutely fantastic," he told RTHK. "Not only is [the stadium] bigger, you've got all those fancy light shows and the tech and everything. All the amenities and everything is so much better – absolutely amazing atmosphere."
    <br>
    <br>
    The stadium's South Stand – where many fans are known to gather in large numbers at the Sevens each year – reached maximum capacity just after 1pm.

     <br>
     "There's space, you can walk around and meet all your friends and your mates. It's unreal."
     <br>
     <br>
     Meanwhile, rugby players said the roar of the crowd was electrifying.
     <br>
     <br>
     "We were so excited to be on the pitch. The crowds were very enthusiastic, cheering us on." Jiang Yutong, who plays for the national women's squad, told RTHK.
     <br>
     <br>
     "It feels so good."

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korean firefighters deployed helicopters on Saturday as the country's biggest wildfires on record that ravaged wide areas of its southeast reignited in one of the region's cities, an official said.
 <br>
  <br>
  More than a dozen fires have been fanned by high winds and dry conditions, killing 30 people and injuring dozens more in southeastern regions, an interior ministry official said on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fires were whipped up again early on Saturday in Andong, a city in the worst-hit North Gyeongsang province, forcing authorities to deploy eight helicopters to the area, said an official from the Korea Forest Service.
  <br>
  <br>
  It came a day after the main fire in the province, where 26 of the 30 victims have died, was extinguished.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It seems that the remaining embers have flared up a bit," said the official.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We plan to deploy more helicopters to the area in Andong."
  <br>
  <br>
  The fires there began on Saturday last week and rolled on for days.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 2,900 homes in the region have been completely destroyed, according to the latest figures.
  <br>
  <br>
  An official said this week that more than 35,000 hectares (86,500 acres) of forest have been burned.
  <br>
  <br>
  The fire also destroyed several historic sites, including the Gounsa temple complex in the southeastern city of Uiseong, which is believed to have been originally built in the 7th century.
  <br>
  <br>
  The extent of the damage makes it South Korea's largest-ever wildfire.
  <br>
  <br>
  Later on Saturday, an official from the North Gyeongsang provincial government said helicopters were still being deployed in Andong areas to extinguish mostly small flames and smoke.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Given the size of the area, it may take some time to complete all operations and fully extinguish the fires," said Do Gyu-myeong .
  <br>
  <br>
  Most of the victims in the region were elderly, according to the Korea Forest Service.
  <br>
  <br>
  Those killed include a pilot in his 70s whose helicopter crashed on Wednesday while he was trying to contain a fire.
  <br>
  <br>
  The flames have been fanned by high winds and ultra-dry conditions, with the area experiencing below-average rains for months after South Korea had its hottest year on record in 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  The interior ministry said the wildfires were accidentally started by a grave visitor and "sparks from a brush cutter."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee Hye-young, a 65-year-old resident of Andong, said she still remains traumatised by the experience.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was really scary to see the sparks flying around all at once," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "While living in North Gyeongsang, I never thought that such a large disaster would strike us." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police Commissioner Raymond Siu revealed on Saturday that the force has arrested 157 people in relation to the space oil drug.
 <br>
  <br>
  He pointed out that 37 of the arrestees were aged below 21, and 16 of them were students.
  <br>
  <br>
  The figure was recorded between February 14 – when etomidate, the drug's main ingredient was classified as a dangerous drug – and Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Siu told reporters that police have stepped up enforcement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Apart from stepping up street patrols, we also have a lot of intelligence-led operations," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Among the 120 cases, the arrests for 70 of the cases were carried out on the streets, and another 50 were made in non-public places."
  <br>
  <br>
  He emphasised that all stakeholders, including school principals and teachers, as well as social workers, play a crucial role in tackling the space oil drug issue.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Tim Hardaway Jr scored 32 points to lead Detroit to a 133-122 victory over the Eastern Conference-leading Cleveland Cavaliers on Friday, a triumph that assured the Pistons of their first winning NBA season since 2016.
 <br>
  <br>
  Hardaway connected on seven of 11 from three-point range on the way to his season-high, leading seven Pistons players to score in double figures.
  <br>
  <br>
  That included Ausar Thompson with 18 points and 10 rebounds and Dennis Schroder with 17 points and 10 assists as Detroit improved to 42-32 – tripling their win total from last season.
  <br>
  <br>
  They had to do it without Cade Cunningham, who missed a third straight game with a bruised calf, and Tobias Harris, who was a late scratch with Achilles tendon trouble.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Pistons withstood a 38-point performance from Cleveland's Donovan Mitchell, who helped the Cavs erase a 21-point deficit to close within two with 3:31 to play.
  <br>
  <br>
  Detroit responded with a 12-1 run to seal the win, which most importantly pushed their lead for fifth place in the East to one and a half games over the Milwaukee Bucks, who fell 116-107 to the New York Knicks.
  <br>
  <br>
  OG Anunoby scored 20 of his 31 points in the fourth quarter for the Knicks, who handed the Bucks a third straight defeat despite 30 points, nine rebounds and seven assists from Giannis Antetokounmpo – who returned after missing one game with a foot sprain.
  <br>
  <br>
  Golden State superstar Stephen Curry scored 23 points in his return from a two-game absence with a pelvic contusion, lifting the Warriors to a 111-95 victory over the Pelicans in New Orleans.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Warriors got off to a sluggish start against the struggling Pelicans, who were without Zion Williamson and CJ McCollum.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Curry scored 13 points in the second quarter to help the Warriors keep it close despite woeful shooting from three-point range.
  <br>
  <br>
  Warriors coach Steve Kerr said he thought Curry "looked great" and his team as a whole looked better as the game went on.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I didn't love the passing in the first half, but we took care of the ball better in the second half," Kerr said. "All in all a positive outcome, a positive effort on a night where we're clearly trying to get our rhythm back as a group."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Warriors picked things up on both ends of the floor in the second half. Jimmy Butler added 18 points and 10 rebounds for Golden State, who remained seventh in the West and battling to avoid the play-in tournament.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Los Angeles Clippers remained in sixth – the final spot for direct entry to the playoffs – after a 132-100 victory over the Nets in Brooklyn.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Clippers and Warriors have the same 42-31 record, the Clippers holding the head-to-head record tiebreaker.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Minnesota Timberwolves are just half a game back in eighth after a 124-109 victory over the Phoenix Suns.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kawhi Leonard scored 31 points to lead the Clippers, connecting on five of six three-point attempts and 10 of 14 overall.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added six rebounds, four steals and a pair of blocks, and Ivica Zubac added 21 points on perfect nine-for-nine shooting as the Clippers notched their 10th win in their last 12 games.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Denver Nuggets, fuelled by 27 points and 14 rebounds from NBA Most Valuable Player Nikola Jokic, cruised past the Utah Jazz 129-93.
  <br>
  <br>
  Denver led from start to finish, Jokic and the rest of their starters sitting out the fourth quarter of the rout. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Constitutional and Mainland Affairs Erick Tsang said on Saturday the government will step up its promotion on national security education next month, to achieve patriotism everywhere.
 <br>
  <br>
  His remarks came as the SAR prepares to mark National Security Education Day on April 15.
  <br>
  <br>
  In an interview with a local newspaper, Tsang pointed out that the Constitutional and Mainland Affairs Bureau will coordinate with relevant departments to promote national security at various levels.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister pointed out that since the Working Group on Patriotic Education was set up last year, it has strengthened national history and culture, as well as national affairs education on different fronts to widely promote the spirit of patriotism.
  <br>
  <br>
  Looking ahead, the group will adopt short-, medium- and long-term goals and measures, Tsang said, adding that his bureau will continue to attach great importance and enhance national security education.

<img alt="Members of the Fire Services Department, along with the Security Bureau and the Hospital Authority are part of the SAR's 51-strong rescue team.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Saturday said Hong Kong will send a search and rescue team to Myanmar, after a magnitude 7.7 earthquake struck the country.
 <br>
  <br>
  The massive quake which struck central Myanmar on Friday, also affected neighbouring Thailand, with the death toll passing 1,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee, along with Secretary for Security Chris Tang sent the rescue team off at the airport in the afternoon.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CE said the team is made up of professionals from multiple departments.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This rescue team has 51 members, including the team leader, who is a deputy chief fire officer. Other members come from the Security Bureau, the Fire Services and Immigration Departments and the Hospital Authority. There are also two doctors and two nurses,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier in a Facebook post, the CE expressed condolences to the victims on behalf of all Hongkongers and the government.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tang, for his part, said the rescue team would first fly to Yangon and then make a ten-hour drive to reach central Myanmar.
  <br>
  <br>
  “After arriving, the team will get in touch with the local commander in charge of the rescue operation. Then they will assess to situation and determine which areas and aspects of work the team can help with,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tang added the administration has so far received enquiries from 55 Hongkongers as of 5pm, but none of them required assistance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, a Hongkonger currently in Bangkok, which was also hit by the devastating earthquake on Friday, said he would not cancel his travel plans.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mr Siu said he was shopping with his wife when he felt the tremor, and the shaking had made people around panic and rush outside for safety.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It has been a day since the earthquake, and there haven't been many aftershocks. Unless something significant happens, I don't plan to change my itinerary,” he told RTHK on Saturday morning.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another tourist who flew to Hong Kong from Bangkok on Saturday morning said that normalcy was being restored in the Thai capital after the quake.
  <br>
  <br>
  “[Transport] is back. Everything is fine today, It’s better than yesterday. But I am still sad about the earthquake. I was working on the 25th floor. I felt the earthquake, [I was] so shocked,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Immigration Department said it would continue to monitor the situation and work with Chinese Embassies in Thailand and Myanmar.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, local travel agency, WWPKG, said it will cancel all tour groups to Thailand in April. It said about 150 affected customers can either choose to switch to a different tour or receive a full refund.

    Some people need to seek alternatives to A&amp;E, Lo says

<img alt="Health chief Lo Chung-mau hopes the public can turn to other choices than A&E when the new fees take effect next year. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797998_1_20250329122451.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Secretary for Health Lo Chung-mau says he hopes some people can find alternatives to accident and emergency wards at public hospitals at all times when new fees take effect.
 <br>
  <br>
  From next year, non-critical and non-emergency patients - or those who are classified as category three to five patients - will have to pay HK$400 when they visit A&E, up from the current flat rate of HK$180.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities hope higher fees for non-critical and non-emergency patients will deter them, so urgent cases can receive prompt care.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lo said some patients abused A&E services, such as heading there to get a sick leave certificate.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Apart from the low charges, A&E are open 24 hours a day, 365 days a-year. It's very convenient, and people don't need to make a booking in advance. You only need to go straight to the wards, which is very convenient. This is necessary for those who are critically ill or need resuscitation," he told a Commercial Radio show.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I said a small group of people abused the system, but some people really misused it... I believe the public need to change this mindset."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lo pointed out that if A&E doctors - who were specially trained to save critically ill patients - had to take care of patients with mild illnesses, that would be a waste of resources.
  <br>
  <br>
  Patients with minor problems should head to their family doctors instead, the health chief said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lo also told an RTHK radio programme that almost half of the semi- and non-urgent - or category four and five patients - showed up at A&E between 8am and 4pm.
  <br>
  <br>
  During this period, there are definitely other choices than A&E, he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lo emphasised that the revamp was not aimed at helping the government tackle its budget deficit.
  <br>
  <br>
  We are only aiming to better safeguard patients and reduce wastage, he added.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Both the men’s and women’s squads for the SAR on Saturday kept their winning streak alive on day two of the Hong Kong Sevens, which also saw an end to New Zealand's campaign to win a third-straight title.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong China men’s squad beat Japan 43-21 in the Melrose Claymores competition.
  <br>
  <br>
  The team’s captain, James Christie – who came up big in the second half – said team effort played a big role in their victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  “You know it’s all about scoring tries and we all got people who could finish them off, you know, but it’s nice to come on on the end of a nice team try, and that’s what makes us good,” Christie told RTHK after the match.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also described the atmosphere at the new stadium, which has a retractable roof, as “crazy”.
  <br>
  <br>
  “With the roof open, it’s still as loud, so it’s pretty crazy, especially some of [the people] at the South Stand [who have been here] since 8am I think…Thank you all for coming out, means the world to us.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier, the SAR women’s squad easily saw off their Thai opponents 47-0, with the crowd “absolutely pumping from start to finish," Pete Laverick, RTHK's sports correspondent who watched the match at Kai Tak Stadium, said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both squads have secured a spot in the Melrose tournament’s finals which will be held on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the main Sevens tournament, there has been a major upset in the men's Cup quarterfinals, where France beat defending champions New Zealand by 21-14, denying the Kiwis' attempt to win a third consecutive title in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  France – who had trailed New Zealand by 14 points before coming from behind to take the win – will now take on Fiji, with Australia facing Argentina in the semifinals on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  And on the women's side, it will be Canada versus New Zealand, while Australia take on France in Sunday's semifinals.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The death toll from the massive earthquake in Myanmar has passed 1,600, the ruling junta there said on Saturday, with more than 3,400 injured.
 <br>
  <br>
  A statement from the junta's information team said 1,644 people are known to have died in Friday's shallow 7.7-magnitude quake, with 3,408 injured.
  <br>
  <br>
  President Xi Jinping has extended condolences to Myanmar's leader, and a rescue team from Yunnan Province – that borders Myanmar – arrived on Saturday morning at Yangon in Myanmar to provide assistance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xinhua news agency said the only highway linking Myanmar's Yangon in the south and central Naypyidaw and Mandalay was severely damaged.
  <br>
  <br>
  The shallow 7.7-magnitude quake struck northwest of the city of Sagaing in central Myanmar in the early afternoon on Friday, followed minutes later by a 6.7-magnitude aftershock.
  <br>
  <br>
  The quake destroyed buildings, downed bridges, and buckled roads across swathes of Myanmar, with severe damage reported in the second-biggest city, Mandalay.
  <br>
  <br>
  Around 10 more deaths have so far been confirmed in Bangkok, where rescuers laboured through the night searching for workers trapped when a 30-storey skyscraper under construction collapsed, reduced in seconds to a pile of rubble and twisted metal by the force of the shaking.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was the biggest quake to hit Myanmar in over a century, according to US geologists, and the tremors were powerful enough to severely damage buildings across Bangkok, hundreds of kilometres away from the epicentre.
  <br>
  <br>
  Up to 100 workers were still unaccounted for at the building, close to the Chatuchak weekend market that is a magnet for tourists. (Agencies)

    'Longer grace period doesn't mean landlords can relax'

<img alt="The administration has introduced a countdown period to penalise landlords who enter new tenancy contracts for units that haven’t been certified.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Housing Winnie Ho on Saturday said she hoped landlords of subdivided flats would take action to upgrade them, even though they now had a longer grace period to comply with new criteria.
 <br>
  <br>
  Under the Housing Bureau's latest proposal for a regulatory framework to manage the city’s subdivided units, landlords will be given a 36-month grace period to make necessary improvements so they can be certified as Basic Housing Units.
  <br>
  <br>
  The grace period was previously proposed as 12 - or up to 24 months - after a 12-month registration period.
  <br>
  <br>
  The administration has also introduced a countdown period, starting six months before the end of the grace period.
  <br>
  <br>
  During the countdown period, landlords who enter new tenancy contracts for units that haven’t been certified may face a maximum fine of HK$300,000 and be jailed for up to three years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho told a Commercial Radio programme that she hoped landlords wouldn't leave their renovations until the last minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Just like when we were in university and the lecturer gave us two extra weeks to finish our coursework, some students would just go watch a movie, thinking they had plenty of time. We want to avoid that with landlords. Even though the grace period is extended, we need to introduce some kind of enforcement to ensure they stay on track and don’t get too relaxed,” said Ho.
  <br>
  <br>
  Landlords also have to hire a certified professional to assess their units in order to obtain the Basic Housing Unit recognition, which will be valid for five years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho noted that the list of certified professionals has been expanded to include some 8,000 engineers, which now also feature specialists under the disciplines of fire and building services.
  <br>
  <br>
  A fee is payable to the government for the certification process and the housing minister said the charge would be around a few thousand dollars, although the exact amount has yet to be finalised.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government’s revised Basic Housing Units legislation will be discussed in Legco's housing panel on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the first group of 50 light public housing tenants moved into their flats in Yuen Long on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho said about 50 to 100 tenants would move in every day and the plan is to get all 2,156 tenants for the Yau Pok Road project to move in by the end of May.

<div class="itemFullText">
 An original animatronic model of the iconic alien created for Steven Spielberg's classic 1982 film "ET the Extra-Terrestrial" is for sale at Sotheby's and is estimated to fetch as much as US$900,000.
 <br>
  <br>
  Created by Oscar-winning special effects artist Carlo Rambaldi, the model is one of three used in the film and is specifically the one featured in the closet scene when ET is hiding among loads of stuffed animals.
  <br>
  <br>
  The model - which stands 91.4 centimetres tall, according to Sotheby's listing - is from the personal collection of Rambaldi, an animatronics pioneer who died in 2012.
  <br>
  <br>
  The starting bid is US$500,000 in the online sale, which closes on April 3. The estimated price is from US$600,000 to US$900,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This model embodies the artistry of an era before CGI took hold, a nostalgic and iconic piece of Hollywood history as captivating as the stories themselves," said Cassandra Hatton, a Sotheby's vice president.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ET model was able to perform 150 different movements, such as frowning or stretching his neck.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rambaldi collaborated on other blockbuster sci-fi films including Spielberg's "Close Encounters of the Third Kind" (1977), Ridley Scott's "Alien" (1979) and John Guillermin's "King Kong" (1976).
  <br>
  <br>
  The auction includes other objects from the Italian artist's collection, including two of the model sandworms used in David Lynch's "Dune." (AFP)

    Trump, Carney hail 'extremely productive' call

<img alt="During the call, Carney told Trump his government would impose retaliatory tariffs on American goods from April 2. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797975_1_20250329071156.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump said he had an "extremely productive" first call Friday with Canada's new Prime Minister Mark Carney, after soaring tensions over tariffs and Trump's wish to annex his northern neighbour.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump added that the two planned to meet soon after Canada's April 28 general election in which Carney - who took office two weeks ago - has made standing up to the US president the focus of his campaign.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I just finished speaking with Prime Minister Mark Carney, of Canada. It was an extremely productive call, we agree on many things," Trump said on his Truth Social network.
  <br>
  <br>
  Typically, a new Canadian leader makes a phone call with the US president an immediate priority, but this was Trump and Carney's first contact since the Canadian was sworn in on March 14.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carney's office said the pair had a "very constructive conversation" and agreed to begin "comprehensive negotiations about a new economic and security relationship immediately following the election."
  <br>
  <br>
  It added, however, that Carney told Trump his government would impose retaliatory tariffs on American goods from April 2, when sweeping US levies are set to come into place.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're not going to back down, we're going to respond with force," Carney said at an afternoon press conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  "What is clear is that the relationship between Canada and the United States has changed. And we're not the one's who changed," he added, confirming that Canada needed to look to Europe "to strengthen ties with reliable partners."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Over the coming weeks, months and years, we must fundamentally reimagine our economy."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's glowing post was still a dramatic change in tone from recent rhetoric between Washington and Ottawa, who are Nato allies and long-standing economic partners.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US president has sparked fury in Canada by repeatedly insisting it should become the 51st US state and by slapping or threatening tariffs on the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  His post on Friday was notable for its diplomacy, as Trump gave Carney his official title of prime minister and made no reference to his annexation drive. (AFP)

    Wall Street tumbles over economy, inflation fears

<img alt="All three major indices closed sharply lower, with the Dow tumbling 1.7 percent, the S&P 500 losing 2 percent and Nasdaq diving 2.7 percent. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797974_1_20250329070631.jpg&q=75">

<div class="itemFullText">
 Stock markets plunged Friday as a closely watched US inflation reading heated up amid intensifying concerns over fallout from US President Donald Trump's incoming wave of tariffs.
 <br>
  <br>
  Shares in automakers fell further as they brace for 25 percent US tariffs due to kick in next week along with a raft of "reciprocal" surcharges tailored to different countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  The market mood has soured over fears that Trump's plans will trigger tit-for-tat measures that would rekindle inflation, which could put the brakes on interest rate cuts and spark a recession.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Investors remain nervous over the economic repercussions from President Trump's tariff threats, just days before he unleashes his 'reciprocal tariffs'" on April 2, said David Morrison, senior market analyst at financial services provider Trade Nation.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Europe, London just about held the line, closing barely off in the week's final session. But Paris, Frankfurt and Milan all slid around one percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Wall Street, all three major indexes closed sharply lower, with the Dow tumbling 1.7 percent, the S&P 500 losing 2.0 percent and Nasdaq diving 2.7 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The slide came after official data showed the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, remained unchanged last month at 2.5 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  But another key figure, core inflation, which strips out volatile food and energy costs, rose more than expected at 2.8 percent in February on an annual basis, up from the month before.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Europe, automakers Volkswagen, Renault and Stellantis, whose brands include Jeep, Peugeot and Fiat, fared particularly badly. Shares in General Motors and Ford also slumped on Wall Street. (AFP)

    Vance accuses Denmark of underinvesting in Greenland

<img alt="US Vice President JD Vance demanded Denmark change its approach as President Trump pushes to take over the Danish territory. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797969_1_20250329062730.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US Vice President JD Vance accused Denmark on Friday of not having done enough to protect Greenland when he visited the resource-rich Danish territory coveted by US President Donald Trump.
 <br>
  <br>
  Vance made his comment during a trip to the Pituffik Space Base in northwestern Greenland, a visit viewed by Copenhagen and Nuuk as a provocation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our message to Denmark is basic: You have not done a good job by the people of Greenland," Vance told a press conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump argues that the United States needs the vast Arctic island for national and international security and has refused to rule out the use of force to secure it.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are not talking about peace for the United States. We are talking about world peace. We are talking about international security," Trump claimed to reporters at the White House on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked about the potential use of force, Vance stressed that the US administration did not think it was "ever going to be necessary."
  <br>
  <br>
  Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen hit back at Vance in a statement to Danish media.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For many years, we have stood by the Americans in very difficult situations," she said, referring to Danish combat deployments alongside American troops in Iraq and Afghanistan.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Vice President's reference to Denmark is not accurate," she said, expressing her readiness to "cooperate day and night with the Americans" on Arctic security.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vance was accompanied by his wife, Usha; National Security Advisor Mike Waltz; Energy Secretary Chris Wright; Utah Senator Mike Lee; and former Homeland Security Advisor Julia Nesheiwat, who is Waltz's wife.
  <br>
  <br>
  A majority of Greenlanders oppose US annexation, according to a January poll.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's desire to take over the ice-covered territory, which is seeking independence from Denmark, has been categorically rejected by Greenlanders, their politicians and Danish officials.
  <br>
  <br>
  While all of Greenland's political parties favour independence, none of them support the idea of becoming part of the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  A new broad four-party coalition government was announced in Greenland just hours before the US delegation's arrival, following elections earlier this month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Incoming prime minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen said the territory needed unity at this time.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is critical that we put aside our disagreements and differences... because only in this way will we be able to cope with the heavy pressure we are exposed to from outside," he said when he unveiled his government.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nielsen said that by visiting Greenland when there was no government in office there, the US administration was "not showing respect to an ally". (AFP)

 Police have arrested three more suspects linked to a January 22 murder and wounding case in Yuen Long.
 <br>
  <br>
  A 20-year-old and a 42-year-old were charged with murder and wounding with intent, while a 23-year-old faces charges in suspicion of assisting offenders.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development Algernon Yau on Friday said the SAR government is taking forward a series of initiatives to protect intellectual property rights to help develop the city into a regional IP trading centre.
 <br>
  <br>
  He was speaking after visiting a company in Beijing that had developed toys with proprietary intellectual property that had found success in both domestic and overseas markets.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yau noted that the effective protection and efficient transaction of IP is crucial to promoting the development of cultural and creative industries as well as technological innovation.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister also met with representatives of the China Alcoholic Drinks Association to promote opportunities for wine merchants in Hong Kong following the deduction in liquor duty announced in last October’s Policy Address, which had resulted in increases in both the quantity and value of liquor imported into the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yau said Hong Kong could serve as a key hub for trading and distribution of high-end liquor, including Chinese baijiu, and Mainland wine merchants are encouraged to use Hong Kong as a platform for Chinese baijiu to go global.

    CK Hutchison ports deal 'won't be signed next week'

<img alt="A source with close links to CK Hutchison suggests that the conglomerate will not sign a deal for the sale of its ports next week.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A controversial ports deal between CK Hutchison and a consortium led by US investment firm BlackRock won’t be signed as expected next week – according to a source with close links to the Hong Kong conglomerate.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong-based firm owned by tycoon Li Ka-shing announced earlier this month that it had entered into a in-principle agreement to sell 45 ports from 23 countries – including two ports near the Panama Canal – in a US$23 billion deal.
  <br>
  <br>
  A filing to the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing stated that the negotiations would last 145 days, with reports suggesting both sides were planning to sign "definitive documents" on April 2.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the source on Friday revealed that the signing will not happen next week, saying, “Everyone knows why.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the State Administration for Market Regulation's anti-monopoly branch told the Ta Kung Wen Wei Media Group that it will conduct a review of the deal in accordance with the law to protect fair competition and safeguard the public interest.
  <br>
  <br>
  A local deputy to the National People’s Congress and chairman of the Federation of Trade Unions, Stanley Ng, said anything irregular that’s discovered in the review should be halted immediately.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ng further stressed that influential businessmen here must have a sense of national security and consider matters from the perspective of the nation.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office and the central government’s liaison office here have both repeatedly reposted articles from Ta Kung Pao criticising the deal.
