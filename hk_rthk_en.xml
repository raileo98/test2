<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Carlos Alcaraz clinched his first indoor title on Sunday, overpowering a spirited effort by Australia's Alex de Minaur to win the Rotterdam Open 6-4, 3-6, 6-2.
 <br>
  <br>
  World number three Alcaraz had too much weight of shot off both flanks for his opponent, who retrieved valiantly but lacked the weapons to topple the top seed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alcaraz was first to seize the initiative, breaking De Minaur's serve in the third game, helped by a double-fault and some ferocious groundstrokes.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the Australian, ranked eight in the world, struck back, breaking to love in the seventh game to bring the set back on serve at 4-4.
  <br>
  <br>
  An ill-judged drop shot at 0-30 down in the next game put the pressure back on De Minaur and Alcaraz produced a powerful backhand pass to give himself a chance to serve out the set.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Spaniard secured the set at the first time of asking, De Minaur netting a forehand return and giving himself an uphill battle to get back into the match.
  <br>
  <br>
  The second set saw a shift in momentum as De Minaur managed an early break of his own and raced into a 3-0 lead.
  <br>
  <br>
  De Minaur squandered two chances at a second break but clung on to his serve to give himself an opportunity to close out the set.
  <br>
  <br>
  He levelled up the match at 1-1, as Alcaraz dumped a backhand into the net, having smashed two wild forehands long out of court earlier in the game.
  <br>
  <br>
  The decisive set went with serve until the sixth game when Alcaraz got his nose in front, breaking the Australian's serve with a drop shot that De Minaur pushed wide.
  <br>
  <br>
  De Minaur served to stay in the match at 5-2 down but hit a catastrophic double-fault to give Alcaraz two match points.
  <br>
  <br>
  He then pushed a tired-looking backhand into the net to give Alcaraz victory and a 17th tour title, the Spaniard roaring "vamos" as the crowd rose to its feet.
  <br>
  <br>
  For De Minaur, it was a case of deja vu, as he lost in the final last year as well to world number one Jannik Sinner. (AFP)

    Netanyahu says Israel to follow up on Trump Gaza plan

<img alt="Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was speaking on Fox News. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790931_1_20250209211442.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has hailed US President Donald Trump's widely criticised plan to move Palestinians out of the war-battered Gaza Strip, saying Israel is willing to "do the job".
 <br>
  <br>
  In a Fox News interview aired late on Saturday as the premier was wrapping up a visit to Washington, Netanyahu defended Trump's proposal, which has sparked concern and condemnation across the Middle East and the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think that President Trump's proposal is the first fresh idea in years, and it has the potential to change everything in Gaza," Netanyahu said, adding that it represents a "correct approach" to the future of the Palestinian territory.
  <br>
  <br>
  "All Trump is saying, 'I want to open the gate and give them an option to relocate temporarily while we rebuild the place physically'," Netanyahu said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump "never said he wants American troops to do the job. Guess what? We'll do the job," Netanyahu declared.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel seized the Gaza Strip in 1967 and maintained a military presence in the territory until 2005, when it pulled out settlers and its troops.
  <br>
  <br>
  It subsequently imposed a crippling blockade on the Hamas-ruled territory and placed it under siege after the war began in October 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel and armed groups in Gaza have fought several wars in recent years, but the latest -- sparked by the unprecedented 2023 Hamas attack on Israel -- has been the deadliest and most destructive.
  <br>
  <br>
  Netanyahu said Trump's plan was a departure from the "same old, same old, same old -- we leave, Gaza becomes again occupied by these terrorists who use it as a base to attack Israel... It doesn't go anywhere."
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think we should pursue it," he added, cautioning that "the real issue" was finding a country that would agree to take in displaced Gazans.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Israeli leader also said that relocated Palestinians would have to "disavow terrorism" to be allowed to return to Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  For Palestinians, any attempts to force them out of Gaza would evoke dark memories of what the Arab world calls the "Nakba", or catastrophe -- the mass displacement of Palestinians during Israel's creation in 1948.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Everybody describes Gaza as the biggest open-air prison in the world," Netanyahu said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Get the population out, allow them to leave. Not forcible eviction, not ethnic cleansing -- getting people out of what all these countries and all these do-gooders say is an open-air prison. Why are you keeping them in prison?" (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Health chief Lo Chung-mau said the government aims to table anti-smoking legislation at the Legislative Council in April.
 <br>
  <br>
  Authorities want to further reduce the number of smokers in the SAR and cut down on tobacco products, by banning e-cigarettes and flavoured tobacco.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a TVB programme, the secretary for health said the measures would be implemented in phases, while also stressing the need to crack down on cigarette smuggling.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The first will be introducing duty-paid labels, and the second would be heavier fines towards illicit cigarettes. After this, we will move onto other issues," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Another problem we are concerned about is e-cigarettes. Hong Kong has implemented an import ban in April 2022. Theoretically, no one should be able to buy them. Those who are still having e-cigarettes either have a lot in hand or bought them through illegal channels."
  <br>
  <br>
  On the proposed ban on flavoured tobacco, which Lo said is used by 40 percent of smokers, the health minister said the government will first seek to outlaw non-mint flavoured tobacco.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lo said in future, anyone entering Hong Kong can bring with them 19 flavoured cigarette sticks for personal use without paying tax, and up to 20 packs with tax.
  <br>
  <br>
  He made it clear smoking led to strong economic losses. "A lot of examples and data tell us when our health is affected by smoking, the economic loss is huge. An HKU study says the economic loss in Hong Kong per year, including medical expenses and loss in manpower due to smoking, reaches more than HK$8 billion."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lo also said the government's anti-tobacco policies hope to protect public health without hindering economic development.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong runners made great strides in the annual Hong Kong Marathon on Sunday morning despite the chilly weather, while the event was also marred by a number of disqualifications.
 <br>
  <br>
  SAR runner Christy Yiu claimed victory in the women's half-marathon, crossing the finish line at Victoria Park in 1 hour, 15 minutes and 9 seconds.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said her performance was within expectations, crediting the weather conditions for making the race smoother than she had anticipated.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think the weather was really good. The humidity was only about 40 percent. The temperature was about 10 to 12 degrees, so it was nice and cool. When I got on the course, I found that it wasn't that windy (even though) it was windy at night," Yiu said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was pretty good. I didn't need to use my raincoat. The track changed a bit, but was still good for running. There were fewer places with strong winds."
  <br>
  <br>
  In the men's half-marathon, Vincent Lam from Hong Kong, who originally came in third, was awarded the title after the top two finishers – He Yingbing and Sun Xiaoyang of China – were disqualified.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I was faster by a minute when compared to my results from last year. I am also satisfied with myself. I have laid a very good foundation in the past year. I always had good communication with my coach. The weather was very good. Although the Observatory said it was a bit cold, it was not that hard to run," Lam said.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the 10km race for women, Candy Tsang from Hong Kong defended her title with a time of 35 minutes and 16 seconds.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the men's event, SAR triathlete Wong Tsz-to became runner-up after Lan Jiehuai of China, who had finished second, was disqualified. China's Liu Aiyan won the race.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dennis Ng, executive director of Hong Kong, China Association of Athletics Affiliates, said after the event that three male runners were disqualified.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Especially for the prize winners, we will verify their identities after the race. Officials found that the bibs they were wearing did not belong to that runner, so after we reported to the referees as well as other key officials, the organisers confirmed that the results were disqualified," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kenya dominated the podium in the men's marathon, with Bethwell Kipkemboi taking gold in 2 hours, 11 minutes and 13 seconds, while compatriots Kennedy Kipyeko and Seroi Anderson coming second and third.
  <br>
  <br>
  Belarusian runner Volha Mazuronak won the women's marathon in 2 hours and 27 minutes, followed by Ethiopia's Emebet Niguse and Tadelech Bekele.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among the runners on Sunday was Hong Kong movie icon Chow Yun-fat, who completed the half marathon in about 2 hours and 22 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chow said the atmosphere was fantastic, and he aims for even better results next year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I hope I can finish under 2 hours when I turn 80!" he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  About 74,000 runners signed up this year, including more than 15,000 international athletes from 101 countries and regions.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Local designers and creators could reach new horizons by taking advantage of the city's connectivity with the mainland and the rest of the world, Financial Secretary Paul Chan said on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The finance chief also noted that a number of designers in Hong Kong have become industry leaders amid the rise of the "goods economy" – a market centred on products tied to the universe of anime, comics and games.
  <br>
  <br>
  In his weekly blog post, Chan said several designer toys made by Hong Kong creators have been hugely popular in the region, with the cultural products bringing in value worth hundreds of millions of dollars.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong's designers and creators have a broad vision, and they understand the culture and the needs of the mainland, the Asian and even the international markets," he wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Taking advantage of Hong Kong's connectivity to the huge markets on the mainland and the world, as long as they create IP products that are unique, personalised and resonate with the public, they will have a chance to reach new horizons."
  <br>
  <br>
  The cultural and creative industries are crucial to the SAR's social and economic development and are an important component of "Brand Hong Kong", Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added branding the city is not only about offering products and services, but also providing unique experiences that demonstrate diversity and promote cultural exchanges.

 One person has been found dead and 28 others remained missing, a day after a landslide hit Sichuan Province.
 <br>
  <br>
  It occurred at 11.50am on Saturday in Jinping Village, which is located in Junlian County in the city of Yibin.
  <br>
  <br>
  As of midnight, the landslide had buried 10 residential houses and a production building.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two people, one seriously and one slightly wounded, have been rescued and were receiving treatment at a hospital in Junlian.
  <br>
  <br>
  Due to continuous rainfall and geological conditions, the high-position landslide has transformed into debris flows, which, according to a preliminary assessment, have resulted in an accumulation of debris stretching approximately 1.2 kilometres and having a total volume of over 100,000 cubic metres.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 200 people have been evacuated to safety, and 155 have been resettled at a temporary shelter in a school in Junlian.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sichuan has mobilised 949 personnel from the military, armed police, firefighting, emergency response, transportation, medical, telecommunication, and other forces to carry out or assist the rescue efforts. (Xinhua)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China's consumer price index (CPI), a main gauge of inflation, accelerated to its fastest in five months, government data showed on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  According to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), the CPI was up 0.5 percent year on year last month, up from the 0.1 percent increase in December.
  <br>
  <br>
  NBS statistician Dong Lijuan said the increase in January was due largely to the influence of the Spring Festival holiday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The core CPI, which excludes food and energy prices, rose 0.6 percent from a year ago in January, up from the 0.4 percent increase in December.
  <br>
  <br>
  On a monthly basis, the CPI expanded 0.7 percent in January.
  <br>
  <br>
  Analysts said consumer spending over the holiday was mixed. While people flocked to movie theatres and spent more on shopping, catering and domestic travel, per capita spending during the holiday grew by only 1.2 percent from a year earlier, versus a 9.4 percent rise in 2024, analysts at ANZ estimated.
  <br>
  <br>
  The NBS data also showed the country's producer price index (PPI), which measures costs for goods at the factory gate, went down 2.3 percent year on year in January, matching the drop the month before.
  <br>
  <br>
  On a month-on-month basis, the PPI dropped 0.2 percent. (Xinhua/Reuters)

    'Special corridor to help lure talent to HK'

 Hong Kong's sole delegate to the nation's top legislature, Starry Lee, on Sunday said she is planning to propose ways to attract highly-skilled professionals to the SAR and expand a visa scheme during the annual plenary meetings in Beijing next month.
 <br>
  <br>
  One of the focuses is to further promote Hong Kong as an international hub for high-calibre talent and help them with accommodation, Lee said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We would like to suggest to have a special corridor, just like the stock market connect. If similar arrangements can be established for property usage or property-related expenditure, I think it can facilitate Hong Kong to serve and attract more talent," the National People's Congress Standing Committee member said after a radio programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Of course, our attraction should not focus on the mainland. We should attract talent globally."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee will be one of the SAR delegates attending the National People's Congress and Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference meetings, also known as the Two Sessions, in the capital in March.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another idea she wants to raise in Beijing is the expansion of the multi-entry visa scheme for Shenzhen residents, to cover more cities in the Greater Bay Area with Guangzhou being the priority.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee also spoke about the challenges facing Hong Kong amid the current geopolitical situation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Now the situation is complex and complicated. The Hong Kong government should work closely with the central government on the one hand," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "On the other hand, we should maintain our international contact with different parts of the world, so as to continue to bring more talent, resources and technology through Hong Kong to our country."

    Lebanon forms first new government in over 2 years

<img alt="The new Prime Minister Nawaf Salam has vowed to reform Lebanon’s judiciary and battered economy. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790854_1_20250209024624.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lebanon’s new prime minister on Saturday formed the country’s first full-fledged government since 2022.
 <br>
  <br>
  President Joseph Aoun announced in a statement that he had accepted the resignation of the former caretaker government and signed a decree forming the new government with new Prime Minister Nawaf Salam.
  <br>
  <br>
  Salam, a diplomat and former president of the International Court of Justice, vowed to “restore confidence between citizens and the state, between Lebanon and its Arab surroundings, and between Lebanon and the international community” and to implement reforms needed to bring the country out of an extended economic crisis.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Reform is the only path to a true salvation,” he said in a speech on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also promised to follow up on the implementation of a ceasefire agreement that ended the most recent war between Israel and the Lebanese militant group and political party Hezbollah in late November and to ensure that Israeli forces “withdraw from Lebanese territory until the last inch.”
  <br>
  <br>
  He pledged to ensure reconstruction in areas that suffered destruction during the war.
  <br>
  <br>
  Salam’s cabinet of 24 ministers, split evenly between Christian and Muslim sects, was formed less than a month after he was appointed and comes at a time when Lebanon is scrambling to rebuild its battered southern region and maintain security along its borders.
  <br>
  <br>
  Though Hezbollah did not endorse Salam as prime minister, the group did engage in negotiations with the new prime minister over the Shiite Muslim seats in government, as per Lebanon’s power-sharing system.
  <br>
  <br>
  That was despite comments by US envoy Morgan Ortagus, who said in a speech in Beirut Friday that Washington had “set clear red lines from the United States” and that Hezbollah would not be “a part of the government.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The comments drew backlash from many in Lebanon who saw them as meddling in internal Lebanese affairs. (AP)

    Brighton send Chelsea crashing out of FA Cup

<img alt="Brighton's Bart Verbruggen and Adam Webster celebrate after the match. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790874_1_20250209102106.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Brighton's Kaoru Mitoma sealed a 2-1 win in the fourth-round of the FA Cup to dash Chelsea's hopes, while Kevin De Bruyne spared Manchester City's blushes in their 2-1 victory at third-tier Leyton Orient on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chelsea haven't won a domestic trophy since lifting the FA Cup in 2018 and their wait will go on for another season after they blew the lead at the Amex Stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  Enzo Maresca's side were gifted the lead in the fifth minute when Brighton keeper Bart Verbruggen fumbled Cole Palmer's cross into his own net.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was a horrendous mistake but Chelsea failed to press home their advantage.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thrashed 7-0 at Nottingham Forest in the Premier League last weekend, Brighton bounced back impressively from the second worst defeat in the club's 123-year history.
  <br>
  <br>
  They equalised in the 12th minute as Joel Veltman's cross reached Georginio Rutter, who found space between Chelsea defenders Trevoh Chalobah and Tosin Adarabioyo to flick a header into the far corner.
  <br>
  <br>
  And Brighton completed their fightback in the 57th minute when Mitoma clipped a deft finish past Chelsea keeper Robert Sanchez despite the visitors' claim for handball.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think the handball is quite clear. Without VAR it's complicated," Maresca said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The second half the only shots they had we conceded a goal from. We had a few chances at 2-1. But you have to take the consequence of the result."
  <br>
  <br>
  At Brisbane Road, Manchester City were rocked when Jamie Donley's long-range effort came back off the bar and rebounded in off City goalkeeper Stefan Ortega to give Orient an early lead.
  <br>
  <br>
  The English champions finally drew level after 56 minutes when Uzbekistan defender Abdukodir Khusanov deflected in Rico Lewis's shot for his first goal since signing for City from Lens in the January transfer window.
  <br>
  <br>
  City boss Pep Guardiola had to turn to his bench more than he would have liked just four days before a mammoth Champions League play-off round first leg against Real Madrid.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the introduction of De Bruyne made the difference as the Belgian midfielder scored 11 minutes from time.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was a typical FA Cup game, that is why this competition is unbelievable. For the fans, how the crowd support and we knew they are strong," said Guardiola, who saw deadline day signing Nico Gonzalez hobble off injured in the first half of his debut.
  <br>
  <br>
  Newcastle came from behind to win 3-2 against Birmingham at St Andrew's.
  <br>
  <br>
  Birmingham led after 42 seconds through Ethan Laird's deflected strike.
  <br>
  <br>
  A quickfire double from Joe Willock and Callum Wilson turned the tie in Newcastle's favour, but Tomoki Iwata's blistering strike levelled before half-time for the League One leaders.
  <br>
  <br>
  Newcastle, though, rounded off a fine week after reaching the League Cup final on Wednesday as Willock restored their lead on 82 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bottom of the Premier League and seemingly destined for relegation, Southampton got no respite in the FA Cup as Burnley won 1-0 at St Mary's.
  <br>
  <br>
  Scott Parker's team went in front after 77 minutes when Marcus Edwards scored from close range on his debut after signing on loan from Sporting Lisbon.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is almost 600 minutes since Championship promotion chasers Burnley last conceded a goal, with 10 clean sheets in their last 11 games.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We were unlucky to lose to a scrappy goal. We did lots of good things and created lots of opportunities," Southampton boss Ivan Juric said.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the last FA Cup tie at Goodison Park, Everton, who are moving to a new stadium next season, were beaten 2-0 by Bournemouth thanks to goals from Antoine Semenyo and Dan Jebbison.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rodrigo Muniz scored twice as Fulham won 2-1 at League One Wigan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ipswich, second bottom of the Premier League, swept to a 4-1 win against Frank Lampard's Coventry.
  <br>
  <br>
  Millwall reached the fifth round for the first time since 2018-19 thanks to Femi Azeez's double in a 2-0 win at Championship leaders Leeds. (AFP)

    US judge blocks Musk's team from Treasury data

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A US judge issued an emergency order early on Saturday blocking Elon Musk's government reform team from accessing personal and financial data stored at the Treasury Department, court documents showed.
 <br>
  <br>
  US District Judge Paul A Engelmayer's order restricts giving access to Treasury Department payment systems and other data to "all political appointees, special government employees, and government employees detailed from an agency outside the Treasury Department."
  <br>
  <br>
  The temporary restrictive order, which remains in effect until a February 14 hearing, also says any such person who has accessed data from the Treasury Department's records since Donald Trump was inaugurated as president on January 20 must "immediately destroy any and all copies of material downloaded."
  <br>
  <br>
  Musk, the world's richest person, is leading Trump's federal cost-cutting efforts under the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (Doge).
  <br>
  <br>
  The case was brought against Trump, the Department of the Treasury and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Friday by attorneys general from 19 states.
  <br>
  <br>
  The attorneys general alleged the administration violated the law by expanding access to sensitive Treasury Department data to staff from Musk's Doge.
  <br>
  <br>
  Engelmayer's order said the states that sued would "face irreparable harm in the absence of injunctive relief."
  <br>
  <br>
  "That is both because of the risk that the new policy presents of the disclosure of sensitive and confidential information and the heightened risk that the systems in question will be more vulnerable than before to hacking," he wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  Musk ran into controversy last week with reports he and his team were accessing sensitive data stored at the Treasury Department.
  <br>
  <br>
  An internal assessment from the Treasury called the Doge team's access to federal payment systems "the single biggest insider threat the Bureau of the Fiscal Service has ever faced," US media reported. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Three Baltic states on Saturday cut ties with Russia's power grid to join the European Union's network, the culmination of a years-long process that gained urgency with Moscow's war in Ukraine.
 <br>
  <br>
  Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania – all former Soviet republics now in the European Union and Nato – had wanted to block Russia's ability to geopolitically blackmail them via the electricity system.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have removed any theoretical possibility of Russia using energy (grid) control as a weapon," Lithuania's Energy Minister Zygimantas Vaiciunas said on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas – Estonia's former prime minister – had on Friday hailed the grid switch as "a victory for freedom and European unity."
  <br>
  <br>
  Vaiciunas said the Baltic states had completed the disconnection process at 9:09 local time (0709 GMT) on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have been waiting for this moment for a long time," he told reporters, after speaking with his Estonian and Latvian counterparts.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The energy system of the Baltic states is finally in our own hands. We are in control," he added of the "historic" moment.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the Baltics were now operating in so-called "isolated mode" before they integrate with the European grid on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Official celebrations are planned across the Baltics, and authorities were on guard for any potential cyber-attacks linked to the grid switch.
  <br>
  <br>
  Latvia will physically cut a power line to Russia later on Saturday and European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen is to attend a ceremony with Baltic leaders in Vilnius on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Baltics have long prepared to integrate with the European grid but faced technological and financial issues.
  <br>
  <br>
  The switch became more urgent after Russia started its war in Ukraine in 2022, spooking the Baltic states into thinking they could be targeted.
  <br>
  <br>
  They stopped purchasing Russian gas and electricity after the war began, but their power grids remained connected to Russia and Belarus, controlled by Moscow.
  <br>
  <br>
  This left them dependent on Moscow for a stable electricity flow, which is crucial for factories and facilities requiring a reliable power supply. (AFP)

    Hamas frees three Israeli hostages in fifth Gaza swap

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hamas released three Israeli hostages on Saturday, the fifth group freed under a fragile Gaza ceasefire, with Israel condemning their "cruel" handover and worrying physical appearance.
 <br>
  <br>
  With Israel expected to release 183 prisoners in exchange, witnesses in the occupied West Bank saw a bus carrying freed Palestinians leave an Israeli jail and later arrive in the city of Ramallah.
  <br>
  <br>
  The fifth exchange since the truce took effect last month comes as negotiations are set to begin on a more permanent end to the war.
  <br>
  <br>
  It came after President Donald Trump floated a proposal for the United States to take over the Gaza Strip and clear out its inhabitants, sparking global outrage.
  <br>
  <br>
  Or Levy, Ohad Ben Ami and Eli Sharabi, who were all seized by militants during Hamas's October 7, 2023 attack that sparked the 15-month war, "crossed the border into Israeli territory," the Israeli military said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jubilant crowds in Israel's commercial hub Tel Aviv cheered as they watched live footage of the three hostages, flanked by masked gunmen, brought on stage in Deir el-Balah before being handed over to the International Committee of the Red Cross.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the joy of their release was quickly overtaken by concern for their condition, with all three appearing thin and pale.
  <br>
  <br>
  The choreographed handover included forced statements from the three on stage, in which they stated support for finalising the next phases of the Israel-Hamas truce.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The disturbing images... serve as yet another stark and painful evidence that leaves no room for doubt – there is no time to waste for the hostages! We must get them all out," said the Hostages and Missing Families Forum campaign group.
  <br>
  <br>
  The office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, whose dejected-looking image appeared on a banner at the Deir el-Balah handover site, said that the images out of Gaza were "shocking."
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel's President Isaac Herzog denounced the treatment of the hostages who were paraded on stage, calling it "a crime against humanity."
  <br>
  <br>
  "The whole world must look directly at Ohad, Or, and Eli – returning after 491 days of hell, starved, emaciated and pained – being exploited in a cynical and cruel spectacle by vile murderers," Herzog said on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sharabi, 52, was at his home in Kibbutz Beeri with his British-born wife and their two daughters when militants stormed it.
  <br>
  <br>
  The armed men shot their dog, before locking the family in their safe room and setting it on fire. The bodies of his wife and two daughters were later identified.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ben Ami, who has dual Israeli-German citizenship, turned 56 in captivity. He was abducted from his home in Beeri along with his wife, who was released during the war's first truce in November 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  Levy was abducted from the Nova music festival, where gunmen murdered his wife.
  <br>
  <br>
  Former hostage Yarden Bibas, who was freed last week by Hamas militants in Gaza, on Friday urged Netanyahu to help bring back his wife and two children from the Palestinian territory.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Prime Minister Netanyahu, I'm now addressing you with my own words... bring my family back, bring my friends back, bring everyone home," Bibas said in his first public message following his release.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamas previously said his wife Shiri and his two sons Ariel and Kfir – the youngest hostages – were dead, but Israel has not confirmed their deaths.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hostage and Missing Families Forum urged the Israeli government on Friday to stick with the Gaza truce, even as Trump's comments sparked backlash across the Middle East and beyond.
  <br>
  <br>
  "An entire nation demands to see the hostages return home," the Israeli campaign group said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Now is the time to ensure the agreement is completed – until the very last one," it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Palestinian militants have so far freed 21 hostages in exchange for hundreds of mostly Palestinian prisoners released from Israeli jails.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ceasefire, mediated by Qatar, Egypt and the United States, aims to secure the release of 11 more hostages during the first 42-day phase of the agreement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Negotiations on the second stage of the ceasefire were set to begin on Monday, but there have been no details on the status of the talks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Netanyahu's office said that after Saturday's swap, an Israeli delegation will head to Doha for further talks.
  <br>
  <br>
  The second phase aims to secure the release of more hostages and pave the way for a permanent end to the war.
  <br>
  <br>
  During their October 2023 attack, militants took 251 hostages to Gaza. Seventy-three remain in captivity, including 34 whom the Israeli military says are dead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel's retaliation has killed at least 47,583 people in Gaza, the majority civilians, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry. The United Nations considers the figures reliable. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A key Indian opposition leader and the former chief minister of the capital province Delhi lost his seat in local elections on Saturday, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu nationalist party tipped for victory.
 <br>
  <br>
  Arvind Kejriwal lost his seat to Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), according to election commission results, reflecting expected wider losses by his Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), which has governed the sprawling megacity of more than 30 million people for most of the past decade.
  <br>
  <br>
  Modi's BJP is in government in the national parliament, but has not controlled the local legislature in the capital New Delhi since 1998.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chanting BJP supporters danced in joy outside its New Delhi headquarters as vote results from the election on Wednesday were counted, waving flags and posters of Modi.
  <br>
  <br>
  Counting continues -- with the AAP and BJP level on nine declared seats -- but the election commission say Modi's party is leading in more than two-thirds of the 70-seat assembly.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our victory is a sign of the people's faith in Prime Minister Modi's vision of progress," interior minister and BJP stalwart Amit Shah said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Delhi mandate shows that people can't be misled with lies every time."
  <br>
  <br>
  Kejriwal, who rode to power as an anti-corruption crusader a decade ago, spent several months behind bars last year on accusations his party took kickbacks in exchange for liquor licences, along with several fellow party leaders.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kejriwal has denied wrongdoing and characterised the charges as a political witch hunt by Modi's government.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was one of the key pillars of an opposition block formed ahead of India's general elections last year, when the BJP suffered significant losses despite holding on to power. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 With the recent flurry of tariffs and policy announcements by US President Donald Trump, there's been increasing discourse in Hong Kong over economic responses and adaptation, including in the upcoming budget.
 <br>
  <br>
  Executive councillor Chan Kin-por on Saturday urged the public to see the reasoning behind the government's need to prune spending and pare its fiscal deficit.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a Commercial Radio programme, Chan, who is also an insurance sector lawmaker, said that when Financial Secretary Paul Chan hands down his budget on February 26, he has to show that he's in control of government expenditure.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The financial secretary is under great pressure this time around. If he fails to control expenditure, it may affect Hong Kong’s credit rating. The situation is grim. I hope Hong Kong people can understand that there's no choice but to cut spending,” Chan Kin-por said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the government can consider cutting staff-related expenditures, while spending on welfare, such as Comprehensive Social Security Assistance and benefits for the elderly, can remain at this stage.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked about how geopolitics and tariffs would affect Hong Kong's economy, Chan Kin-por said there would be a negative impact, but he believes there will be appropriate response measures from both the central and SAR governments.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on the same programme, the chairman of the Hong Kong Shippers' Council, Willy Lin, said he supports the SAR government's decision to file a complaint to World Trade Organization over Washington imposing an additional 10 percent tariff on Hong Kong products.

 Roughly 1.4 million tourists came to Hong Kong during the eight-day mainland Spring Festival golden week, including 1.2 million visitors from the mainland, according to the executive director of the Travel Industry Council.
 <br>
  <br>
  Fanny Yeung told an RTHK programme on Saturday that of the total, about 79,000 people visited in tour groups - 83 percent of which stayed overnight.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeung was optimistic with the fact that 15 percent of those from tour groups had stayed two or three nights in the SAR - an uptick from last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Although the number of inbound tourists dropped, they stayed here for longer and we are happy to see this phenomenon,” Yeung said.
  <br>
  <br>
  But she said the city needs more tour guides who can speak foreign languages other than Chinese and English.

  <br>
  Yeung said some travel agencies were unable to host group tours from countries like Thailand, as they could not find guides who speak Thai.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on the same programme, tourism sector lawmaker Perry Yiu said the hotel occupancy rate reached about 90 percent during the golden week, and room rates dropped about 10 percent compared to last year.

    'Remains to be seen when flu season will peak'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 It remains uncertain when the flu season is likely to peak, according to the Director of Health.
 <br>
  <br>
  Dr Ronald Lam told reporters on Saturday after a Commercial Radio programme that the H1 influenza A virus is now the dominant strain - as detected in over 90 percent of the specimen.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The flu season has (arrived) since January this year, and we are seeing the rise in flu activity, and also right now the flu activity remains at a high level. But we cannot confirm how and when the flu activity will reach its peak," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The schools are going to resume classes after the holidays, so there's still possibility that there will be further transmission of flu in the community."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lam revealed that there were 137 death cases among adults, and over 75 percent of them were not vaccinated.
  <br>
  <br>
  Apart from appealing to the public to get their flu jabs, he also called on those planning to travel abroad to reschedule their trips if they feel unwell.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They have to learn more about the situation about the destinations, like whether or not the place they're going to is experiencing a big flu season," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And also for those who have chronic illness... diabetes, hypertension, kidney diseases and so forth, they should seek medical consultation first to get timely advice regarding what they should be aware of and what medications they should bring along with them."
  <br>
  <br>
  While some members of the public undergo self-testing for flu using rapid antigen kits, Lam noted they should check if the kits are listed by the government.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also urged the public to only take flu medication after consulting a physician, as they often comes with side effects.

    Trump pauses de minimis repeal on Chinese imports

<img alt="President Trump's ban had created disruptions for customs inspectors, postal and delivery services and online retailers. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790798_1_20250208113211.jpg&q=50">

<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump paused his administration's repeal of duty-free treatment of low-cost packages from China on Friday, giving the Commerce Department time to make the order workable, after the rapid change created disruptions for customs inspectors, postal and delivery services and online retailers.
 <br>
  <br>
  The eventual cancellation of de minimis means the more than 1 billion small-value e-commerce packages arriving annually in the United States with goods coming directly from China must switch to an entry process that requires additional information and duties, adding time and cost.
  <br>
  <br>
  The stop and restart of the United States Postal Service acceptance of those packages this week set off a swarm of disruptions that backed up Customs clearance for packages, even those that had paid duties, at New York City's John F Kennedy International Airport.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Well that was a fun Tuesday through Friday, if you work in global e-commerce," said Derek Lossing, CEO of e-commerce and global supply chain firm Cirrus Global Advisors.
  <br>
  <br>
  The initial change, implemented with just over 48 hours' notice, caused the USPS to temporarily stop accepting packages from China earlier this week.
  <br>
  <br>
  Popular online retailers including Shein, Temu and Amazon.com's new Haul service send packages directly from Chinese factories to US shoppers and use de minimis to keep prices low.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Trump administration's revision to the order was signed on Wednesday and published on Friday, a White House spokesperson said.
  <br>
  <br>
  De minimis, a legal term referring to matters of little importance, refers to the US waiver of standard customs procedures and tariffs on items worth less than US$800 that are shipped to individuals from foreign countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Temu and Shein combined ship around 9,000 metric tons of cargo worldwide every day, or approximately 88 full Boeing 777 freighters, said Niall van de Wouw, chief air freight officer at freight pricing platform Xeneta.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You cannot suddenly put up the shutters to this volume of air freight, so it is no surprise there has been a delay to the executive order on de minimis." (Reuters)

    Maguire lifts Man Utd over Leicester in FA Cup

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Harry Maguire headed a last-gasp winner as FA Cup holders Manchester United came from behind to beat Leicester 2-1 on Friday, denying Ruud van Nistelrooy a fairytale return to Old Trafford.
 <br>
  <br>
  Bobby De Cordova-Reid put the Premier League strugglers ahead late in the first half of the fourth-round tie against a pallid United, who have lost their fear factor at home.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the introduction of Alejandro Garnacho at half-time gave United a different dimension and fellow substitute Joshua Zirkzee levelled midway through the second period.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ruben Amorim's team pushed for a winner and it finally came when former Leicester defender Maguire headed in a Bruno Fernandes' free-kick deep into stoppage time.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Portuguese manager, who is struggling to implement his ideas at Old Trafford three months into his reign, said it was a "poor performance" from his side.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We didn't have any energy in the beginning, especially in the first half," he told ITV. "Then in the second half we played a little bit better, with a little more speed, winning second balls.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Then we managed to turn things around so it was a good result but not a good performance.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The coach is the first responsible. When one team doesn't perform, doesn't improve, it is the coach but we are here to do things and to see the game, to study the game and try to improve."
  <br>
  <br>
  United scored eight goals in two games against Leicester earlier in the campaign during Van Nistelrooy's brief spell as interim boss at Old Trafford following the sacking of Erik ten Hag.
  <br>
  <br>
  But this time their former star striker was in the opposition dugout.
  <br>
  <br>
  United, who beat Manchester City in the final at Wembley last May, were short of confidence after five defeats in their past seven matches at home in all competitions. (AFP)

    'Small AI chip firms can benefit from DeepSeek tide'
   </title>

<img alt="Analysts say DeepSeek will boost the global proliferation of smaller AI chip firms. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790790_1_20250208102758.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The global recognition of Chinese AI star, DeepSeek, is expected to serve as a catalyst for small AI chip companies to massively scale up around the world.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Hangzhou-based startup rattled Silicon Valley last month with the launch of its low-cost, but powerful AI model, which wiped out around half a trillion US dollars in chip leader Nvidia's market cap because it was built without using cutting edge chips, due to American export restrictions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on RTHK's Trending China programme, Esther Wong, founder of 3C AGI Partners, noted that DeepSeek's breakthrough came as the global AI cycle transitioned from "training" to "inferencing".
  <br>
  <br>
  Inference refers to the act of applying AI to make predictions or decisions based on the processing of new information and data in real time, instead of training the AI model to learn patterns, relationships or features.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's equivalent to Generative AI, more focused on AI's real applications where AI can serve users differently in a tailored way," Wong explained.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[So if] inferencing is going to be used by some seven billion people in the world. You can imagine the explosion of demand is going to be so much that in the words of Jensen Huang, the inferencing demand is literally one billion times bigger than the training demand."
  <br>
  <br>
  "[But] If we do not change how AI is being manufactured now, the world will run out of power very, very soon," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong, who previously worked as managing director at Chinese AI leader SenseTime, noted the new opportunities following DeepSeek's rise as the firm's open-source model would help other small AI chip firms to challenge the current market landscape that is dominated by big players such as Nvidia, with investors eyeing alternatives to their chips.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The moment DeepSeek emerged, it can actually help the proliferation of all those basic chips, i.e. chips apart from Nvidia, that are also very good for inferencing purposes. And that applies for both domestic chips in China or chips produced by startups in the West," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The veteran banker and investor also stressed that despite the narratives that AI breakthroughs could be achieved with smaller computing power and lower investments, demand for such power as well as funds would only increase.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The inferencing demand is one billion times bigger than the training demand, and by making inferencing so cheap and accessible [due to DeepSeek's model being open-sourced], we actually need a lot more computing powers so that more people can afford inferencing," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are seeing that the Large Language Models [LLMs] are quickly being commoditised, so it's difficult to make money out of it because the marginal cost of producing intelligence is close to zero. But that is very good for the application layers where a lot of usage can be proliferated as they can be commercialised."

    US adds 143K jobs in Jan, unemployment rate down

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The United States added fewer jobs than expected in January; although hiring remained healthy, government data showed on Friday, marking resilience in the labour market heading into President Donald Trump's new term.
 <br>
  <br>
  Total employment rose by 143,000 jobs last month, according to the Labor Department, significantly lower than the revised 307,000 figure in December.
  <br>
  <br>
  The January number was also below an analyst consensus estimate of 155,000, according to Briefing.com.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the jobless rate edged down to 4.0 percent from 4.1 percent, beating analyst expectations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wage growth was better than analysts expected, accelerating to 0.5 percent, the report showed.
  <br>
  <br>
  The data added to signs that the US economy remained in excellent shape heading into Trump's second term, which began on January 20, analysts noted.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kevin Hassett, director of the White House National Economic Council, took aim at downward revisions to last year's figures in the latest update, telling media that the Trump administration has "a lot of work to do."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Taken together, December and January payroll figures paint a strong picture of the economy," added Carl Weinberg and Mary Chen of High Frequency Economics.
  <br>
  <br>
  They said they expect that with these figures, the US central bank would not be in a rush to cut interest rates.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sectors like health care, retail trade, and social assistance saw job gains, the Labour Department said, while employment declined in industries like mining, alongside oil and gas.
  <br>
  <br>
  Economists warned that businesses may reconsider further hiring due to heightened tariff risks and Trump's plans to slow immigration. (AFP)

    Trump says to announce 'reciprocal' tariffs next week

<img alt="Donald Trump made tariffs a key platform of his presidential campaign. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790769_1_20250208043942.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump said on Friday he plans to announce reciprocal tariffs on many countries next week, a major escalation of his trade war.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump made the announcement during a meeting with visiting Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump did not identify which countries would be hit but suggested it would be a broad effort that could also help solve US budget problems.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said auto tariffs remained on the table amid reports that the White House was weighing potential exemptions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'll be announcing that, next week, reciprocal trade, so that we're treated evenly with other countries," Trump said. "We don't want any more, any less."
  <br>
  <br>
  The move would fulfil Trump's campaign promise to impose tariffs on American imports equal to rates that trading partners impose on American exports.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump told Republican lawmakers of his plans during budget discussions at the White House on Thursday, three sources familiar with the plan told Reuters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump and top aides have said they plan to use higher tariffs on foreign imports to help pay for extending Trump's 2017 tax cuts, which independent budget analysts say could add trillions of dollars to the US debt.
  <br>
  <br>
  Increased tariffs could offset some of that cost, though they have only accounted for about 2 percent of annual revenues in recent years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump announced tariffs of 25 percent on Canada and Mexico on Saturday but delayed them after a negative reaction from investors. The two largest US trading partners agreed to increase enforcement efforts at the border, a top Trump priority.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wall Street extended losses on Friday following the Reuters report of Trump's discussion with lawmakers.
  <br>
  <br>
  US consumer sentiment dropped to a seven-month low in February, and attitudes soured among Republicans as households took stock of what they believe will be a surge in inflation from Trump's tariffs. (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US and European shares fell Friday, with the latest US jobs report and higher inflation expectations capping the end of a volatile week marked by concerns over a trade war.
 <br>
  <br>
  Official data showed the United States added fewer jobs than expected in January while unemployment ticked down.
  <br>
  <br>
  The jobs data missed expectations, but Wall Street's three main indexes initially rose. They quickly fell into the red, however, after separate data showed US consumers now expect inflation to jump.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down one percent at 44,303.40, the S&P 500 also lost one percent to 6,025.99 and the Nasdaq Composite fell 1.4 percent to finish at 19,523.40.
  <br>
  <br>
  President Trump's remarks on unspecified "reciprocal tariffs" also appeared to reignite concerns.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said at a press conference with Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba that he was "probably meeting on that Monday or Tuesday," saying that this would be "opposed to a flat-fee tariff" approach.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Today's (jobs) data does not show a large enough divergence from expectations to shift what is expected to be the Fed's next rate move," said Jochen Stanzl, chief market analyst at CMC Markets.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Still the Fed is expected to cut the Fed Funds rate twice this year and today's data does not really give a hint into when the first cut will be," Stanzl said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Fed kept its rate unchanged last week, with chair Jerome Powell saying the central bank was in no "hurry" to adjust borrowing costs again.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Labor Department said total US employment rose by 143,000 jobs last month, which was significantly lower than the revised 307,000 figure in December.
  <br>
  <br>
  The January figure was also below an analyst consensus estimate of 155,000 according to Briefing.com.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We do not think that the labour market data shifts the dial for the Fed," said Kathleen Brooks, research director at XTB trading platform.
  <br>
  <br>
  But data released afterward subsequently showed US consumer sentiment fell to its lowest level in July, with survey respondents reporting feeling less confident and more concerned about inflation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Year-ahead inflation expectations rose to 4.3 percent, up a full percentage point from a month earlier.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Such a substantial one-month rise of one percentage point or more has occurred only five times in the past 14 years," noted Axel Rudolph, Senior Technical Analyst at online trading platform IG.
  <br>
  <br>
  The jump in inflation expectations follows a turbulent week for stock markets and currencies after Trump imposed tariffs on China.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US leader also warned that the European Union would face tariffs "pretty soon" while he delayed duties on Canada and Mexico at the 11th hour. (AFP)

    London's Grenfell Tower to be taken down after fire

<img alt='A UK public inquiry last year found the 72 deaths were "all avoidable." File photo: AFP' src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790752_1_20250207225504.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 London's Grenfell Tower – where 72 people died in 2017 in Britain's worst residential fire since World War II – is to be demolished, the UK government confirmed on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The move, which is expected to take two years, has angered some survivors and families of those killed in the massive inferno, which destroyed the 24-storey block in the west of Britain's capital.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Grenfell Tower will be carefully taken down to the ground," the government said in a statement, confirming what victims' groups said on Thursday they had been told.
  <br>
  <br>
  The work will start after the eighth anniversary of the blaze on June 14 and will be done carefully to ensure that materials can be included in any future memorial, the statement said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government said safety was the primary reason for the demolition.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It remains stable because of the measures put in place to protect it, but even with the installation of additional props, the condition of the building will continue to worsen over time," the statement said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Engineers also advise it is not practicable to retain many of the floors of the building in place as part of a memorial that must last in perpetuity."
  <br>
  <br>
  The fire started in a faulty freezer, spreading rapidly due to highly combustible cladding fixed to the building's exterior.
  <br>
  <br>
  A public inquiry last year found the 72 deaths were "all avoidable" and blamed the "systematic dishonesty" of building firms.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also revealed decades-long government and regulatory failures.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since the inquiry and report, victims' groups have criticised the government for failing to implement fire safety recommendations swiftly enough, including removing similar cladding from other buildings.
  <br>
  <br>
  Families have also condemned the delay in bringing criminal charges against those blamed for the disaster in the inquiry.
  <br>
  <br>
  The decision to demolish the building divided victim groups.
  <br>
  <br>
  Grenfell United, which represents some of the survivors and families, said on Thursday the decision was "disgraceful" and that victims were ignored by a short consultation.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, Grenfell Next of Kin said it was a "sensitive decision" that "came after a thorough engagement process" and was informed by "safety concerns" surrounding the structural integrity of the scaffolded remains of the building.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government insisted that deputy prime minister Angela Rayner, who also holds the housing brief, has offered the community several discussions online and in person.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is clear from conversations it remains a sacred site. It is also clear that there is not a consensus about what should happen to it," the government said in its statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Being able to see the tower every day helps some people continue to feel close to those they lost. For others, it is a painful reminder of what happened and is having a daily impact on some members of the community." (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping on Friday declared the 2025 Asian Winter Games officially open in Harbin, marking the second time the northeastern Chinese city has hosted the event.
 <br>
  <br>
  He was joined by First Lady Peng Liyuan, and the President of the International Olympic Committee, Thomas Bach, at the extravaganza in Heilongjiang province.
  <br>
  <br>
  The crowd at the Harbin International Conference, Exhibition and Sports Centre cheered loudly as Team Hong Kong, China were among 34 competing countries and regions introduced.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SAR's short track speed skater, Lam Ching-yan, and alpine skier, Adrian Yung, were the flag bearers.
  <br>
  <br>
  The city has sent 74 athletes to the Games, the most ever.
  <br>
  <br>
  Timothy Fok, vice president of the Olympic Council of Asia, said China had played a big part in the growth of winter sports in the continent.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A record number of over 1,200 athletes from a record number of 34 National Olympic Committees will be competing in Harbin, and this shows the remarkable development of winter sports in Asia," he said at the ceremony.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China has played a big part in this, not only by staging two previous Asian Winter Games in 1996 and 2007, but also the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing."
  <br>
  <br>
  But the loudest of cheers was reserved for the hosts, the last of the teams introduced, with China having the biggest team of 170 athletes at the Games.
  <br>
  <br>
  The national team's flag bearers were speed skater Ning Zhongyan and freeskier Liu Mengting.
  <br>
  <br>
  The guests and athletes were then treated to traditional Chinese performances at the ceremony.

    'Chinese e-commerce firms can prevail despite tariffs'

<img alt="E-commerce businesses such as Shein or Temu must adopt long-term shipping planning to offset the additional duties imposed by the US, analysts say. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790724_1_20250207185909.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chinese e-commerce companies would still be able to maintain healthy financial positions in the face of surging US tariffs - if they fine tune their business models with long-term planning, according to analysts.
 <br>
  <br>
  This came after the US on Monday revoked a long-standing de minimis rule that allowed packages worth less than US$800 to enter the country duty-free, as part of measures when US President Donald Trump signed the executive order to impose an extra 10 percent tariffs on Chinese goods.
  <br>
  <br>
  The changes, while slapping additional duties on Chinese e-commerce firms such as Temu and Shein, could still offer an opportunity for them, if they conduct shipping planning intelligently, according to Catherine Lim, a senior consumer analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Bear in mind that some of these [de minimis shipments] are very random parcels that did not require inventory planning about shipping, like what most export-oriented products do, particularly those above the US$800 threshold," Lim told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The biggest change I would say right now for these e-commerce sellers who are using the de minimis is that they need to adopt longer-term planning. They need to start restructuring themselves so much so that they will have enough goods ahead of time at Temu's or Shein's specified warehouses, while still being in a position to actually distribute to the local consumers, to meet the demand of the US shoppers," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That will offset the entire financial impact from the tariff hikes."
  <br>
  <br>
  One of the ways, she suggested, was for the mainland firms to shift away from aviation transport which is around 25 to 30 times more expensive than sea freight.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, Lim said she believes there still could be turnarounds in terms of the trade policies from the US, as supply chain management processes undertake new regulations while authorities from China and the US, as well as the rest of the world, take steps to address the new procedures.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are going to go through a rather volatile couple of months, but this is temporary," Lim said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Into the second half of the year, I am expecting, barring any unforeseen changes to trade policies that this will start to stabilise into the end of the year."

    HK to file complaint at WTO against US tariffs

<div class="itemFullText">
 The SAR government on Friday said it would file a complaint to the World Trade Organisation over the United States' decision to impose an additional 10 percent tariffs on Hong Kong products.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, a government spokesperson said the US measure was “grossly inconsistent” with WTO rules.
  <br>
  <br>
  The spokesperson added that Washington had ignored that the city is a separate customs territory as stated in Article 116 of the Basic Law, and recognised by the WTO.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The HKSAR Government will formally launch procedures in accordance with the WTO Dispute Settlement Mechanism against the US' unreasonable measures to defend our legitimate rights."
  <br>
  <br>
  The spokesperson also said the SAR supports the rules-based multilateral trading system.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SAR government urged the US to rectify its measures immediately.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Forecasters on Friday said that runners taking part in Sunday's Hong Kong Marathon could face the coldest day this winter.
 <br>
  <br>
  Some 74,000 runners are expected to take part in the race, with more than 15,000 of them coming from more than a hundred countries and regions.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Observatory said the temperature could dip to as low as nine degrees Celsius in the urban areas on Sunday, and even lower in the New Territories.
  <br>
  <br>
  Senior scientific officer, Hon Kai-kwong, said as strong winds were expected, runners could feel colder than what the mercury indicates, otherwise known as the wind chill effect.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Because northern winds for the day should be relatively strong, we expect the wind chill effect to be rather significant - especially in open areas and on high grounds," he told an RTHK programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  For his part, the Hospital Authority's chief manager, Dr Larry Lee, said because of the weather, runners shouldn't over exert themselves.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Before the start of the race, [runners] should keep their heads and hands warm, and they should stay hydrated," he said on the same programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And because of the strain on their bodies, from an event like this, runners should make sure that they spend enough time warming up. If they find they can't go on, runners should rest."
  <br>
  <br>
  Top local runner Virginia Lo said the cold weather should help athletes achieve good times.
  <br>
  <br>
  She called on participants to wear raincoats and running sleeves to keep warm.
  <br>
  <br>
  Former world marathon champion Rose Chelimo is among the world's finest joining the competition and she'll be making her Hong Kong debut this weekend.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 35-year-old Kenyan-born Bahraini won gold at the World Championships in London eight years ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I've been preparing for long, since last year. It needs a lot of discipline and dedication from yourself, not following your coach or anybody," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ethiopia-born runner Gashau Ayale, who represents Israel, will also be making his Hong Kong debut, and thinks the local course is a challenging one.

 China on Friday said it "regrets" Panama's decision to withdraw from the Belt and Road Initiative, after the Latin American nation ended its participation in the project in a concession to Washington.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Beijing regrets Panama's decision," Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian said, urging Panama to "consider the broader bilateral relationship and the long-term interests of both nations" and "resist external interference".
  <br>
  <br>
  Lin added that China firmly opposes the United States' actions to smear and sabotage Belt and Road cooperation through pressure and coercion. (Xinhua/AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The International Criminal Court (ICC) on Friday called on its member states to stand up against sanctions imposed by US President Donald Trump, saying the move was an attempt to “harm its independent and impartial judicial work.”
 <br>
  <br>
  The White House issued the executive order on Thursday in response to what it called “illegitimate and baseless actions targeting America and our close ally Israel."
  <br>
  <br>
  It was referring to the arrest warrant the ICC issued last year for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over alleged war crimes in Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hague-based court said it “condemns” the move.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The Court stands firmly by its personnel and pledges to continue providing justice and hope to millions of innocent victims of atrocities across the world,” the court said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We call on our 125 States Parties, civil society and all nations of the world to stand united for justice and fundamental human rights,” it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel on Friday praised Trump for imposing sanctions on the ICC, calling the court's actions against Israel "immoral" and illegitimate.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump on Thursday authorised economic and travel sanctions targeting people who work on ICC investigations of US citizens or American allies such as Israel, repeating the action he took during his first term.
  <br>
  <br>
  The move coincided with a visit to Washington by Israel's Prime Minister Benajmin Netanyahu, who - along with his former defence minister and a leader of Palestinian militant group Hamas - is wanted by the ICC over the war in the Gaza Strip.
  <br>
  <br>
  The sanctions include freezing any US assets of those designated and barring them and their families from visiting the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 125-member ICC is a permanent court that can prosecute individuals for war crimes, crimes against humanity, genocide and the crime of aggression against the territory of member states or by their nationals.
  <br>
  <br>
  The United States, China, Russia and Israel are not members.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump signed the executive order after US Senate Democrats last week blocked a Republican-led effort to pass legislation setting up a sanctions regime targeting the war crimes court. (Agencies)

 President Xi Jinping on Friday said the 9th Asian Winter Games embodies Asia’s shared aspirations for peace, prosperity and friendship.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a welcome banquet ahead of the Games’ opening in Harbin, he urged Asia to hold fast to the common dream of peace, respond to security challenges and contribute to building an equal and orderly multipolar world, Xinhua news agency reported.

  <br>
  Xi urged the region to seek common progress and inject impetus into economic globalisation.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also pledged that the Winter Asian Games held in the northeastern city will put on a spectacular sports gala which will be distinctly Chinese and uniquely Asian.
  <br>
  <br>

    'HK businesses won't be hugely affected by US tariffs'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Chinese General Chamber of Commerce on Friday said Hong Kong's businesses would not be hugely affected by the additional tariffs imposed by the United States.
 <br>
  <br>
  The US announced an extra 10 percent duties on Chinese imports that also covers goods from the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  The chamber's chairman Jonathan Choi said the issue is in the spotlight, but he is not worried about the impact on Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The total percentage of trade between Hong Kong and the US is not very big. Therefore, actually it's not very much affected, but the way they do it is quite unfair to us," he spoke to reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Choi said Hong Kong businesses are flexible and have started to explore new markets, such as in Asean and Middle East countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added the government is facing a deficit, and he hopes the financial secretary's budget - due to be announced later this month - could introduce measures to increase revenue and minimise spending.
  <br>
  <br>
  Choi said unprecedented global changes created more challenges to Hong Kong's economy, but support measures by the central government acted as a "guiding light" for the business community.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the Chinese Manufacturers’ Association said it expects growth in the SAR’s merchandise trade exports to slow down because of the additional tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Its president, Wingco Lo, said he agreed with the SAR government's decision to file a complaint at the World Trade Organisation over the US move.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lo expressed confidence regarding Hong Kong’s economy this year, saying he expects GDP growth of between 2.5 and 3 percent.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Iran on Friday condemned as "illegal" and "unjustified" new financial sanctions by the United States that target a network accused of shipping hundreds of millions of dollars worth of Iranian crude oil to China.
 <br>
  <br>
  "The decision of the new US government to exert pressure on the Iranian nation by preventing Iran's legal trade with its economic partners is an illegitimate, illegal and violative measure," foreign ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baqaei said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US move was "categorically unjustified and contrary to international rules", Baqaei added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US Department of the Treasury on Thursday announced financial sanctions against an international network "facilitating the shipment of millions of barrels of Iranian crude oil worth hundreds of millions of dollars" to China.
  <br>
  <br>
  The oil was shipped on behalf of Iran's Armed Forces General Staff and a sanctioned front company called Sepehr Energy Jahan Nama Pars, the treasury department wrote in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The sanctions came after US President Donald Trump reinstated his "maximum pressure" policy against Iran over allegations the country is seeking to develop nuclear weapons.
  <br>
  <br>
  Iran has slammed the reinstatement of the policy -- similar to one Trump levied against Tehran during his first term as president -- saying pursuing it would end in "failure".
  <br>
  <br>
  Under the tough policy of sanctions during Trump's first term, which ended in 2021, Washington withdrew from a landmark nuclear deal that had imposed curbs on Iran's nuclear programme in return for sanctions relief.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tehran adhered to the deal -- known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action -- until a year after Washington pulled out, but then began rolling back its commitments.
  <br>
  <br>
  Efforts to revive the 2015 deal have since faltered.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump on Wednesday called for a "verified nuclear peace agreement" with Iran, adding that it "cannot have a Nuclear Weapon".
  <br>
  <br>
  Iran insists its nuclear programme is solely for peaceful purposes and denies any intention to develop atomic weapons. (AFP)

    No need to up criminal record checks on teachers: govt

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong authorities don't need to carry out annual criminal record checks on teachers despite a rise in cases of misconduct, Education Secretary Christine Choi said on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lawmakers were told there were 304 professional misconduct cases involving teachers last year, three times the number in 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  Seventy-one teachers were struck off last year, 38 got reprimand letters and 149 received written warnings.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some of the more serious cases involved child abuse, theft, and teachers having inappropriate relationships or improper physical contact with students.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Education Bureau currently checks the criminal records of all registered teachers every three years.
  <br>
  <br>
  But several legislators on the Legco education panel said they were worried this is insufficient, and checks should be made every year.
  <br>
  <br>
  In response, Choi said the rise in misconduct cases last year was actually a result of the bureau acting upon issues flagged up by criminal record checks.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said the administration has a zero-tolerance approach regarding teachers who don't meet ethical or moral standards, but more frequent checks aren't necessary.
  <br>
  <br>
  “If a teacher commits a crime while employed, we get the record immediately, so there's no need to wait three years. The checks conducted every three years are for those not currently working in schools who commit crimes that might not be reported,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the idea of requiring teachers to apply to renew their licence every 10 years, Choi said the bureau is always open-minded about ways to uphold professionalism.

    MTR to get minimum HK$1m fine for East Rail disruption

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The MTR Corporation will be fined at least HK$1 million over disruption to East Rail Line services that lasted for more than seven hours on Wednesday, the government says.
 <br>
  <br>
  The money will be spent on rebates for passengers.
  <br>
  <br>
  An engineer's train broke down near Tai Wo Station and remained on the tracks during the morning rush hour and up until lunchtime. Officials said intervals between trains were as long as 24 minutes at some stations during the disruption.
  <br>
  <br>
  “According to the preliminary information submitted by the MTR, this incident triggered the service performance rebate mechanism. This means the MTR will need to set aside at least HK$1 million as rebates for passengers,” Deputy Secretary for Transport and Logistics Kirk Yip told lawmakers on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yip said the government has asked for a report into the incident within a month and wants to know what caused the train to break down and what improvement measures MTR officials come up with in case of similar issues in future.
  <br>
  <br>
  The MTR's Managing Director for Hong Kong Transport Services, Jeny Yeung, told legislators the company will learn from the incident and will look at how repairs can be carried out quicker if such a situation happens again.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Special measures brought in before Christmas to deal with increased demand for A&E services will remain in place for now given the number of people turning up for treatment, the Hospital Authority said on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Staff levels, bed capacity and laboratory testing services for flu and other viruses have been stepped up during the winter period.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chief Manager Dr Larry Lee told RTHK that medical wards are operating at above 100 percent capacity and paediatric wards have also seen an increase in patients.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The number of patients has risen significantly. There are around 5,500 patients at accident and emergency units per day and around 1,100 patients are admitted to the general wards each day," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It seems that this pressure will continue, mainly because of the cold weather, and because of the public coming back from overseas travel and students returning to school."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee said that in the past two weeks, 158 people were put in intensive care units or died due to influenza A, adding that this was a similar number to last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said nine children suffered serious complications from their flu infections, and urged parents to get their children vaccinated.
  <br>
  <br>
  The observatory has warned that temperatures could drop to nine degrees Celsius in urban areas on Sunday which it says could be a record low this winter.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The SAR’s speed skater Sidney Chu said his team is fully ready for the Asian Winter Games which will kick off in Harbin on Friday night.
 <br>
  <br>
  The city is sending more than 70 athletes to participate in the Games this year, the largest number ever.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 25-year-old speed skater was the flag bearer for the Hong Kong, China team at the Beijing Winter Olympics in 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chu said he will participate in eight races in speed skating and short-track speed skating this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We arrived and trained in Harbin five days ahead of the start of competition. That gives us enough time to get used to the temperature and the ice surface at the venue," he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Although the ice is harder than what we are used to, we have adjusted our techniques, and the way we move and our equipment. I hope we can perform well."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chu and his teammates will also participate in the men's 5,000m relay and the mixed team 2,000m short-track speed skating relay.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is the first time for SAR athletes to participate in relay races of short-track speed skating at large-scale competitions. This is a critical moment for us. I'm happy to see my team's growth and development," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The athlete said he won the support of mainland audiences at the 2022 Games, and he hopes that he will not disappoint his supporters in Harbin.

<img alt="Amazon is on track to invest more than US$100 billion on cloud computing and artificial intelligence in 2025. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790640_1_20250207094326.jpg&q=90">

<div class="itemFullText">
 E-commerce giant Amazon reported strong earnings on Thursday but, like its big tech peers Microsoft and Google, saw its stock price fall on concerns over high AI investment costs.
 <br>
  <br>
  The mounting expenses of data-intensive artificial intelligence and its infrastructure have cast a shadow over this earnings season, with only Facebook owner Meta winning Wall Street's approval.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meta's stock surged 18 percent in January as investors endorsed its AI strategy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Amazon's AWS cloud division, along with rivals Microsoft and Google, are investing heavily in AI data centres while meaningful returns remain uncertain.
  <br>
  <br>
  Amazon CEO Andy Jassy defended the spending, saying the company was on track to spend US$100 billion on capital expenditure in 2025, with the "vast majority" on AI.
  <br>
  <br>
  The emergence of China's lower-cost DeepSeek model has raised questions about such massive spending.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite US government efforts to maintain AI dominance through export controls on advanced chips, DeepSeek has achieved comparable results using authorised, less sophisticated Nvidia semiconductors.
  <br>
  <br>
  Microsoft, leading the generative AI revolution through its OpenAI partnership, plans to invest about US$80 billion in AI this fiscal year.
  <br>
  <br>
  And while it has rapidly deployed AI features under its Gemini brand, Google's Cloud revenue missed expectations, despite growing 30 percent to US$12 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Google also announced plans for US$75 billion in capital expenditures for 2025, surprising analysts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Amazon on Thursday reported its fourth-quarter net income doubled to US$20 billion, with net sales rising 10 per cent to US$187.8 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  AWS remained profitable with sales growing 19 percent to US$28.8 billion, though slightly below market expectations.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, Amazon's shares dropped more than five per cent in after-hours trading, mirroring reactions to Microsoft and Google's results - strong profits overshadowed by concerns about AI spending.
  <br>
  <br>
  Amazon's forecast of five to nine per cent growth for the first quarter of 2025, with sales between US$151 billion and US$155.5 billion, also fell short of expectations and weighed on the stock price. (AFP)

    Fentanyl fatality rate 'higher in Canada than US'

<img alt="Edmonton, in Canada, holds an Overdose Awareness Day. File photo (AFP)" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790650_1_20250207093916.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Fentanyl is killing more people per capita in Canada than in the United States, Ottawa's public safety minister said on Thursday, calling the two nations "connected" in combating the opioid crisis.
 <br>
  <br>
  US President Donald Trump has accused Canada of not doing enough to counter the flow of fentanyl across their shared border, and cited the issue as justification for his threatened import tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's government has committed to addressing those concerns, while maintaining that less than one percent of fentanyl in the United States comes from Canada.
  <br>
  <br>
  "On per capita population, we're losing more Canadians than Americans are losing Americans," Public Safety Minister David McGuinty told reporters on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are connected with this crisis."
  <br>
  <br>
  According to US estimates, an average of 205 Americans have died each day of opioid overdoses in recent years, mostly from fentanyl.
  <br>
  <br>
  Canada has seen 21 deaths per day, according to the latest data, but its population is about 12 times smaller than that of its southern neighbour.
  <br>
  <br>
  McGuinty's remarks came after he met with senior federal police and border agency officials "to operationalise" a US$900 million border security plan launched in response to Trump's tariffs threat.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 25 percent tariffs - which Trump has also said were necessary to force action to stem migrant crossings - were scheduled to take effect on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the president granted Canada a 30-day reprieve to allow for further talks.
  <br>
  <br>
  As part of the last-minute deal to put off the tariffs, the prime minister agreed to name a point person to lead the fight against fentanyl. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hongkong Post says it will continue to turn away postal items containing goods to the United States, even as the US Postal Service ditched its earlier suspension of inbound parcels from mainland China and the SAR.
 <br>
  <br>
  The announcement comes two days after Hongkong Post was told by its US counterpart not to dispatch packages containing goods, "unless a 'formal entry' has been completely and accurately filed with the United States Customs and Border Protection in accordance with the United States law".
  <br>
  <br>
  A government spokesman said in a statement early on Friday morning that Hongkong Post is now communicating with USPS to clarify certain matters, including the imposition of additional duty.
  <br>
  <br>
  The spokesman reiterated the government's strong disapproval to charge additional duty for Hong Kong products, and urged Washington to rectify its wrongdoing to "avoid causing confusion and inconvenience to the public owing to its constantly changing policies".

<img alt="A protester holds a sign referencing Elon Musk, who is heading President Trump's drive to shrink the federal government, outside New York's City Hall. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790638_1_20250207084628.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A judge on Thursday paused a scheme masterminded by billionaire Elon Musk to slash the size of the US government by encouraging federal workers to quit through a mass buyout.
 <br>
  <br>
  The federal judge in Massachusetts ordered a temporary injunction on the plan's deadline - midnight Thursday - given by Musk for the country's more than two million government employees. The offer was to quit with eight months' pay or risk being fired in future culls.
  <br>
  <br>
  The deadline is now extended to Monday, when US District Judge George O'Toole will hold a hearing on the merits of the case brought by labour unions, US media reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  Musk, the world's richest person and President Donald Trump's biggest donor, is in charge of a free-ranging entity called the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).
  <br>
  <br>
  According to White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, more than 40,000 staff have so far accepted the buyout deal - a relatively small number.
  <br>
  <br>
  Unions representing some 800,000 civil servants and Democratic members of Congress are resisting the scheme and have challenged the legality of threats to fire civil servants.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the broader budget cutting campaign has already severely disrupted departments and agencies that for decades have run everything from education to national intelligence.
  <br>
  <br>
  USAID, the government's agency for distributing aid around the world, has been crippled, with foreign-based staff ordered home.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has also repeatedly said he wants to shut down the Department of Education. The inducements to resign have further been extended to the CIA.
  <br>
  <br>
  Leavitt told reporters that federal workers should "accept the very generous offer" of a deferred resignation.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said "competent" replacements would be found for those who "want to rip the American people off."
  <br>
  <br>
  Among the controversies swirling around the Musk plan is how much access the South African-born tycoon is getting to secret government data, including the Treasury's entire payment system.
  <br>
  <br>
  Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Bloomberg TV on Thursday that there was "a lot of misinformation" and that access to such data was only given to two Treasury employees who are working with Musk.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bessent said those employees had "read-only" access, meaning they couldn't change the data. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The former interpreter to Shohei Ohtani, who admitted stealing almost US$17 million from the Japanese baseball star to pay off illegal gambling debts, was sentenced to 57 months in prison.
 <br>
  <br>
  Ippei Mizuhara was also ordered to pay restitution of more than US$18.1 million in his sentencing in federal court in Santa Ana, California.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mizuhara pleaded guilty in June to one count of bank fraud and one count of filing a false tax return.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bank fraud charge alone could have carried a prison sentence of up to 30 years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mizuhara was ordered to surrender to authorities on March 24. After his prison sentence, he will be subject to three years of supervised release.
  <br>
  <br>
  The sentencing by US District Judge John Holcomb caps a scandal that rocked Major League Baseball at the beginning of the 2024 season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ohtani, whose pitching and hitting skills have drawn comparisons to Babe Ruth, had signed the richest contract in North American sports history to join the Los Angeles Dodgers last December, a deal worth US$700 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mizuhara, who had worked with Ohtani while he was with the Los Angeles Angels, came with him to the Dodgers, but the team fired him last April following accusations of theft.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mizuhara initially said Ohtani had loaned him money to repay gambling debts.
  <br>
  <br>
  But investigators found that he had stolen the money, with prosecutors saying Mizuhara siphoned millions from Ohtani to finance an "insatiable appetite" for illegal sports gambling.
  <br>
  <br>
  After an initial April court appearance, Mizuhara's lawyer said his client wished to apologize to "Ohtani, the Dodgers and Major League Baseball" and "take responsibility" for his actions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prosecutors stressed throughout the case that Ohtani was an innocent victim of Mizuhara's deception and there was no evidence to suggest the Dodgers star was aware of or involved in illegal gambling. (AFP)

<img alt="Liverpool captain Virgil van Dijk (L) after scoring his side's fourth goal. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790630_1_20250207071434.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Liverpool overturned a first leg deficit to reach the League Cup final with a 4-0 win and ramp up the pressure on Tottenham boss Ange Postecoglou.
 <br>
  <br>
  Cody Gakpo, Mohamed Salah, Dominik Szoboszlai and Virgil van Dijk were on target for the Reds, who will face Newcastle at Wembley on March 16 for the first silverware of the English season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool remain on course for a quadruple in a dream debut season for Arne Slot.
  <br>
  <br>
  They enjoy a six-point lead at the top of the Premier League, have cruised into the last 16 of the Champions League and visit Championship strugglers Plymouth in the FA cup fourth round on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think we had some big nights here already but yeah to reach a final should always be special, and that is what it is," said Slot. "In Holland we only have one cup competition and that final is played at the end of the season, so it is new experience but a nice one to have."
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Spurs' trophy drought on the other hand goes on. Tottenham last lifted silverware in 2008 and Postecoglou now has one less opportunity to fulfil his promise of winning a trophy in his second season.
  <br>
  <br>
  There is speculation the Australian could be shown the door if another goes awry away to Aston Villa in the FA Cup at the weekend with Spurs languishing 14th in the Premier League.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We had a great opportunity and unfortunately we didn't grab it," said Postecoglou. "There's still plenty to play for us this year. We have a huge game with Villa on Sunday."
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite having more glamorous titles to win, Slot showed his desire to make the League Cup his first trophy as Liverpool boss by naming his strongest available team bar the usual rotation in goal for cup competitions as Caoimhin Kelleher replaced Alisson Becker.
  <br>
  <br>
  New signing Kevin Danso was forced straight in to Tottenham's injury-ravaged defence, while Mathys Tel also made an early debut off the bench after Richarlison hobbled off injured.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool had scored four in each of the previous two meetings between the sides at Anfield and repeated that feat to make light of their 1-0 first leg defeat in north London last month.
  <br>
  <br>
  The home side had taken the first quarter to find their stride but the pressure built after Szoboszlai ran offside before sweeping home Salah's pass.
  <br>
  <br>
  From the Egyptian's next delivery into the box, Spurs did not escape as Gakpo drilled in first time to move clear as the top scorer in this season's competition with five goals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Antonin Kinsky kept Salah waiting for his goal with a fine save moments later, but at the other end of the field Richarlison lay prone to leave Postecoglou's team further depleted.
  <br>
  <br>
  Already without record signing Dominic Solanke, Brennan Johnson, James Maddison, Timo Werner and Wilson Odobert in attacking areas, Tottenham never looked capable of mounting the threat they needed to survive the Liverpool onslaught.
  <br>
  <br>
  The decisive blow came five minutes into the second half when Kinsky rushed off his line but was beaten to the ball by Darwin Nunez and caught the Uruguayan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Salah ruthlessly dispatched the resulting penalty into the top corner for his 26th goal of the season. Gakpo and Ryan Gravenberch fired off the post as Liverpool put their foot down to kill the tie off.
  <br>
  <br>
  The killer third goal came 15 minutes from time when Connor Bradley, who excelled in the absence of the injured Trent Alexander-Arnold, played in Szoboszlai to slot home.
  <br>
  <br>
  Van Dijk then exposed Spurs' struggles defending set-pieces by heading in the fourth from a corner to rub salt in the visitors' wounds.
  <br>
  <br>
  Newcastle are eying an end to their own 56-year wait for a major trophy after an impressive 4-0 humbling of Arsenal on aggregate in the other semi-final.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the Magpies have the unenviable task of stopping Slot's juggernaut if they are to do so. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq ended higher, while the Dow closed lower after a choppy trading session on Thursday, as investors studied earnings reports while awaiting Amazon's results after the bell and a key jobs report on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Drugmaker Eli Lilly rose after the company forecast annual profit largely above estimates, while fashion house Tapestry jumped on an annual sales and profit forecast increase.
  <br>
  <br>
  Philip Morris International advanced after the cigarette maker posted better-than-expected quarterly results and forecast 2025 profit above estimates.
  <br>
  <br>
  Amazon.com ticked up ahead of its quarterly earnings report. Investors will look for updates on its artificial intelligence investments, after Chinese startup DeepSeek's cheaper AI model sharpened investor scrutiny of US tech giants' massive spending on the technology.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Today, the main focus is corporate earnings. Tariffs are in the background," said Zachary Hill, head of portfolio management at Horizon Investments.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Amazon will be the sixth of the Magnificent Seven to report. The AI theme has been under quite a lot of volatility over the last few weeks with the DeepSeek news ... We’re watching tonight for any thoughts that (Amazon) has to say around that," Hill said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Honeywell fell after the industrial and aerospace giant said it would split into three independently listed companies and forecast downbeat sales and profit for 2025.
  <br>
  <br>
  The S&P 500 gained 22.09 points, or 0.4 percent, to 6,083.57, the Nasdaq Composite gained 99.66 points, or 0.5 percent, to 19,791.99. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 125.65 points, or 0.3 percent to 44,747.63.
  <br>
  <br>
  Markets saw a dismal start to the week when President Trump announced sweeping trade tariffs over the weekend, before suspending the levies on goods from Mexico and Canada on Monday for a month.
  <br>
  <br>
  The January nonfarm payrolls report is due later on Friday, a crucial metric in gauging the state of the labor market and the Federal Reserve's rate path.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ocean Park has apologised for its "lack of sensitivity" and taken down a panda-themed watch, after the product sparked a public outcry over the use of alligator skin.
 <br>
  <br>
  The park had teamed up with a local tourbillon brand to introduce a watch, which featured the six giant pandas. The strap of the watch was said to be made with alligator leather.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Thursday, the park expressed deep regret over the lack of sensitivity of the team in promoting a product that "does not meet the core values of conservation".
  <br>
  <br>
  "The product has not been purchased by any consumers, and has been immediately removed from the shelves. We are discussing with our authorised partners on procuring other materials to make the watch straps," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ocean Park vowed to review its design, production and procurement guidelines while strengthening staff training to ensure its operations are consistent with the core values of conservation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Posts on social media and the store's website about the watch have been removed.
  <br>
  <br>
  The park had previously called on the public to refrain from purchasing and using crocodile products.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also named a crocodile as an animal ambassador for visitors to learn about preserving local biodiversity.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Panama's President Jose Raul Mulino on Thursday rejected the United States' claim that it negotiated free passage for government vessels through the Panama Canal as an "absolute falsehood."
 <br>
  <br>
  The Panama Canal Authority, which runs the waterway linking the Caribbean Sea with the Pacific Ocean, has also rejected the claim by the US State Department that US government vessels would go through for free.
  <br>
  <br>
  The canal authority, an autonomous agency overseen by the Panamanian government, said it had not made any changes to charge fees or rights to cross the canal, adding its statement was directly in response to the US claims.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US State Department had said earlier that Panama's government had agreed to no longer charge crossing fees for US government vessels, in a move that would save America millions of dollars a year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With total responsibility, the Panama Canal Authority, as it has indicated, is willing to establish dialogue with relevant US officials regarding the transit of wartime vessels from said country," the canal authority responded.
  <br>
  <br>
  Panama has became a focal point of the Trump administration as the president has accused the Central American country of charging excessive rates to use its trade passage, one of the busiest in the world. (Reuters)

    January sets 'surprising' heat record: EU monitor

<img alt="The world warmed to yet another monthly heat record in January according to the European climate service Copernicus. File photo: AFP ." src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790589_1_20250206214334.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Last month was the hottest January on record, Europe's climate monitor said on Thursday, despite expectations that cooler La Nina conditions might quell a streak of record-breaking global temperatures.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Copernicus Climate Change Service said January was 1.75 degrees Celsius hotter than pre-industrial times, extending a persistent run of historic highs over 2023 and 2024, as human-caused greenhouse gas emissions heat the planet.
  <br>
  <br>
  Climate scientists had expected this exceptional spell to subside after a warming El Nino event peaked in January 2024 and conditions gradually shifted to a cooling La Nina phase.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the heat has lingered at record or near-record levels ever since, sparking debate among scientists about what other factors could be driving warming to the top end of expectations.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is what makes it a bit of a surprise... you're not seeing this cooling effect, or temporary brake at least, on the global temperature that we were expecting to see," Julien Nicolas, a climate scientist from Copernicus, told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  La Nina is expected to be weak and Copernicus said prevailing temperatures in parts of the equatorial Pacific Ocean suggested "a slowing or stalling of the move towards" the cooling phenomenon.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nicolas said it could disappear completely by March.
  <br>
  <br>
  Scientists warn that every fraction of a degree of warming increases the intensity and frequency of extreme weather events like heatwaves, heavy rainfall and droughts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last month, Copernicus said that global temperatures averaged across 2023 and 2024 had exceeded 1.5 degrees Celsius for the first time.
  <br>
  <br>
  This did not constitute a permanent breach of the long-term 1.5C warming target under the Paris climate accord -- but was a clear sign that the limit was being tested.
  <br>
  <br>
  Copernicus said Arctic sea ice in January hit a monthly record low, virtually tied with 2018.
  <br>
  <br>
  Analysis from the United States this week put it at the second-lowest in that dataset.
  <br>
  <br>
  Overall, 2025 is not expected to follow 2023 and 2024 into the history books: scientists predict it will rank as the third hottest year yet.
  <br>
  <br>
  Copernicus said it would be closely monitoring ocean temperatures throughout 2025 for hints about how the climate might behave.
  <br>
  <br>
  Oceans are a vital climate regulator and carbon sink, and cooler waters can absorb greater amounts of heat from the atmosphere, helping to lower air temperatures.
  <br>
  <br>
  They also store 90 percent of the excess heat trapped by humanity's release of greenhouse gases.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This heat is bound to resurface periodically," said Nicolas.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think that's also one of the questions -- is this what has been happening over the past couple of years?" (AFP)

    'Chinese products still competitive after tariff hike'

<img alt="The Hong Kong General Chamber of Small and Medium Business said products from the mainland and Hong Kong might still be competitive after the tariff hike.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The deputy head of a local chamber for small to medium-sized firms on Thursday said companies from mainland China and Hong Kong focused on e-commerce may still have profit margins, despite higher US tariffs.
 <br>
  <br>
  US authorities began charging an extra 10 percent levy on top of existing tariffs, and cancelled a tax exemption for parcels with a retail value of US$800 or less.
  <br>
  <br>
  A vice president of the Hong Kong General Chamber of Small and Medium Business, Stanley Lee, said while the tariff rise might have come abruptly, some products can still be competitive in the US market.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For example, in traditional retail, it costs US$20 to buy an item. It's US$15 for them to buy on [American] online platforms, but it's US$10 on [Chinese] e-platforms before the rise," he explained to RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So even with [25 to 35 percent extra tariffs], it's still cheaper to buy [Chinese products] than the traditional way."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee, who also heads the chamber's e-commerce policy committee, said his own firm was relatively unaffected by the new US policies, as his products are stored in warehouses on American soil and they clear customs regularly.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said he expects some mainland e-commerce firms to do the same if they no longer find the parcel-mailing strategy profitable.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee added that companies mostly expected the trade spat to intensify, and have therefore turned to different markets in search for potential customers.

    Britain's Grenfell Tower to be demolished

<div class="itemFullText">
 London's Grenfell Tower, which was engulfed in flames more than seven years ago in a disaster that killed 72 people, will be demolished, bereaved families and survivors said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The fire ripped through the 23-storey social housing block in one of London's richest areas during the early hours of June 14, 2017.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was Britain's deadliest blaze in a residential building since World War II.
  <br>
  <br>
  Grenfell Next of Kin (GNK), which represents the relatives of nearly half of those who died, said Britain's deputy prime minister, Angela Rayner, announced her decision to a room of families and survivors in a meeting on Wednesday evening.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to the group, the demolition of the tower, which remains standing but covered in protective wrap, will only start after the eighth anniversary of the tragedy in June this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Engineers advising the government said the structure of the tower would worsen over time, and the building or part of it that was significantly damaged should be carefully taken down.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Do we wish the whole tower could stand forever? Yes. Is that an option? Not from a structural point of view," GNK said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Grenfell United said the voices of bereaved families and survivors were not heard or considered by Rayner during what they described as a short four-week consultation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Ignoring the voices of bereaved on the future of our loved ones' gravesite is disgraceful and unforgivable," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The department of housing, communities and local government did not immediately reply to a request for comment, but the decision was confirmed by Joe Powell, the member of parliament for Kensington, the area where the tower is located.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said on X that the decision had not been taken lightly: "Grenfell Tower will always be in our hearts as a community."
  <br>
  <br>
  A public inquiry into the fire, which published its final report last year, blamed the disaster on failings by the government, construction industry and, most of all, the firms involved in fitting the exterior with flammable cladding.
  <br>
  <br>
  Several survivors and families have said the inquiry has delayed any criminal proceedings.
  <br>
  <br>
  A commission looking at a future memorial on the site of the disaster said in its 2023 report that if the tower came down it should be "dismantled with care and respect".
  <br>
  <br>
  A final design for the memorial is expected by spring 2026, and construction could begin that year. (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An eight-vehicle pile-up on the West Kowloon Corridor in Cheung Sha Wan on Thursday afternoon has left at least three people injured.
 <br>
  <br>
  Police received reports at around 5pm of the collision involving six private cars, a taxi and a small truck heading west towards Mei Foo.
  <br>
  <br>
  Online footage from the scene showed the taxi wedged between some of the vehicles, suffering severe damage to the rear, while at least one of the private cars had a shattered windshield.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officers said drivers of three of the vehicles were sent to hospital. One was taken to Queen Elizabeth Hospital while the other two were rushed to Caritas Medical Centre.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Transport Department said some lanes of the West Kowloon Corridor near Hing Wah Street were closed due to the incident, and advised drivers to consider alternative options.

<div class="itemFullText">
 CEO of the West Kowloon Cultural District Authority (WKCDA) Betty Fung on Thursday said the arts hub's operating deficit for the current fiscal year is expected to be HK$1 billion, similar to that of the previous year.
 <br>
  <br>
  At a press event, Fung said the number of visitors to the district last year was lower than expected, and revenue from ticket sales and museum merchandise fell 20 percent year-on-year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The hub's catering businesses also brought in lower revenues than expected, she said, adding that the authority will continuing operating on loans for the time being.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fung pledged that the WKCDA will continue to strictly manage its expenditure, while rolling out more exhibitions to attract visitors.
  <br>
  <br>
  Those planned for this year include an exhibition of more than 60 works of Spanish artist Pablo Picasso at the M+ museum between March and July, and a special exhibition featuring Chinese cuisine and related artworks at the Hong Kong Palace Museum between March and June.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Palace Museum will also hold the city's largest exhibition of ancient Egyptian treasures for decades, with some 250 objects loaned from several influential museums.
  <br>
  <br>
  The cash-scrapped authority aims to submit a development application to the Town Planning Board in the coming weeks for building housing blocks on a plot in the area spanning 20,000 square metres.
