<img alt="HSBC said pre-tax profits rose six percent to $32.3 billion in 2024 as the bank undergoes a structural overhaul. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1792282_1_20250219150836.jpg&q=65">

<div class="itemFullText">
 HSBC posted an annual profit on Wednesday that beat estimates, helped by increased revenue in its wealth and markets businesses.
 <br>
  <br>
  It reported profit before tax for 2024 of US$32.3 billion, a rise of around six percent, as income withstood the impact of falling interest rates.
  <br>
  <br>
  That compared with US$30.3 billion a year earlier and the US$31.7 billion average of analyst estimates compiled by the bank.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Asia-focused lender also announced a new US$2 billion share buyback which it plans to complete before next earnings.
  <br>
  <br>
  The figures come against the backdrop of CEO Georges Elhedery embarking on costly restructuring just as the business outlook is muddied by divergence in central bank interest rate policies, with the euro zone having room to cut rates, the US holding steady and Japan expected to raise.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elhedery, who took the helm in September last year, has been taking steps to boost returns and tighten the London-headquartered bank's focus on Asia, where it earns the bulk of its profit.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bank said it aimed to generate about US$300 million of cost reductions in 2025, with a commitment to an annualised reduction of US$1.5 billion in cost base expected by the end of 2026.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have renewed vigour in finding the efficiencies that will optimise our resource allocation, be that geographical, business line or balance sheet," Elhedery said in the bank's earnings statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This will enhance the way we actively and dynamically manage costs and capital, and target investments." (Agencies)

    Taxi trade calls off strike, apologises to public

<img alt="Wong Yu-ting, centre, apologised to the public, saying the government needs to be given a chance to rectify the current situation. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1792269_1_20250219140103.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The taxi industry has called off a strike next month to push for a crackdown on illegal ride-hailing services, after meeting with transport officials on Wednesday morning.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong Tele-call Taxi Association had earlier threatened five days of industrial action from March 5, saying their business was seriously hurt by their unlicensed rivals.
  <br>
  <br>
  The association's chairman, Wong Yu-ting, apologised after the meeting for causing "unease" to the public.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added authorities should be given time to take enforcement action, so a strike was no longer necessary.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Wong maintained the government should take action against ride-hailing service providers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The number of arrestees (ride-hailing drivers) is actually not the top priority. Most importantly, they should take immediate action to prosecute the drivers, so as to deter others from doing so," Wong told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ryan Wong, chairman of the Hong Kong Taxi Council, described the meeting as positive and constructive.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the government would submit a legislative proposal within this year to regulate ride hailing platforms.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The ride-hailing platforms must ensure all the vehicles hailed from their platforms must have legal licence," Wong said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also hoped the government would require ride-hailing service providers to attend professional training beforehand, and have their vehicles undergo inspections annually.
  <br>
  <br>
  Transport Commissioner Angela Lee said the government was looking at next steps.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The government is now studying with the Department of Justice on fine-tuning existing laws to optimise the enforcement process," she added.

<img alt="Peter Lam will begin his term on April 1. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1792261_3_20250219142136.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government has reappointed Peter Lam as the chairman of the Hong Kong Tourism Board (HKTB) for a three-year term.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lam, who succeeds Pang Yiu-kai, will begin his term on April 1.
  <br>
  <br>
  The businessman also served as the board's chairman between 2013 and 2019, before passing the reins to Pang.
  <br>
  <br>
  Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism Rosanna Law said in a statement that Lam's diverse experience in business management and public services makes him the best candidate for the role.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I am confident that under Dr Lam's leadership, the board will advance further while promoting Hong Kong worldwide and showcasing its charms, so that visitors will indulge in pleasure when staying in Hong Kong, thinking about Hong Kong, and returning time and again," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lam also currently serves as the chairman of the Hong Kong Trade Development Council, a position that will soon be handed over to former commerce chief Frederick Ma.
  <br>
  <br>
  Law expressed gratitude to Pang for his leadership in navigating the numerous challenges posed by the Covid pandemic and for spearheading the recovery of Hong Kong's tourism industry.
  <br>
  <br>
  The HKTB added that under Pang's leadership, Hong Kong welcomed nearly 45 million visitors in 2024, solidifying its status as a premier destination for meetings, incentives, conferences and exhibitions tourism, cruises and overall tourism, while serving as a crucial gateway for the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Greater Bay Area.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pang said it has been a privilege to serve the community over the past six years.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I am very grateful to the government, the travel trade, my fellow HKTB members and the team for the support they have given me throughout the years," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I will continue to work closely with HKTB team to promote ‘Hong Kong Super March’ and fully support the work of HKTB going forward. I wish HKTB and Dr Lam every success.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The government has also appointed Jeffrey Lam, Nikki Ng and Melissa Pang as new members of the board.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The government has appointed former commerce chief Frederick Ma as the new chairman of the Hong Kong Trade Development Council, succeeding Peter Lam.
 <br>
  <br>
  Ma's two-year term will run from June 1, 2025 to May 31, 2027.
  <br>
  <br>
  Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development Algernon Yau said in a statement that Ma’s extensive experience in public service and the commercial sector makes him well-suited for the role.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I am confident that he will lead the HKTDC to make every effort in assisting enterprises to embrace the challenges arising from the ever changing global trading landscape and actively tap new markets and business opportunities, with a view to further promoting Hong Kong's development as an international trade centre," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yau also thanked Lam for his contributions during his tenure.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Under his chairmanship, the HKTDC has successfully promoted Hong Kong as a two way global investment and business hub and assisted Hong Kong companies in further exploring the business opportunities in the mainland and overseas brought by the nation's dual circulation strategy, with outstanding achievements particularly in promoting Hong Kong in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Greater Bay Area and emerging markets under the Belt and Road Initiative," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ma currently serves as the non-executive chairman of the FWD Group and is a member of the Chief Executive’s Council of Advisers.

    'Ne Zha 2' to hit HK cinemas on Saturday

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Record-breaking blockbuster "Ne Zha 2" is set for general release in Hong Kong on Saturday, as it dethroned Disney's "Inside Out 2" and became the highest grossing animated film of all time -- based on domestic ticketing data.
 <br>
  <br>
  It premiered in the city on Tuesday night, after it garnered significant attention in the SAR over the past month, which saw the animated movie break records for the number of distributors and daily screenings for a mainland film in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are honoured to bring this world-class phenomenon-level animation to Hong Kong and Macao, allowing viewers to experience the charm of Ne Zha in the theatres", said a representative of Emperor Motion Pictures, which is a co-distributor of the film.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, some local fans went to Shenzhen to see the animation, ahead of its SAR release.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I've seen online comments about the animated film, saying it is a good and touching movie with an excellent storyline that's enlightening for viewers," said a Hongkonger who viewed the movie across the border.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I specifically watched the first movie in Hong Kong and came today to watch its sequel here in Shenzhen, as it hasn't been screened in Hong Kong. I want to see what makes this animation so successful in attracting many adults and to learn about the latest development of Chinese animation."
  <br>
  <br>
  A sequel to the 2019 hit "Ne Zha 1", "Ne Zha 2" has already packed out cinemas in China, where it claimed the title of the nation's biggest box-office hit since its release last month.
  <br>
  <br>
  State media, citing ticketing platform, Maoyan, said on Tuesday the fantasy epic had raked in over 12.32 billion yuan (about US$1.72 billion), which surpassed "Inside Out 2" that took US$1.7 billion following its release last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Ne Zha 2" tells the tale of a rebellious young deity who uses his powers to battle formidable foes after his village is destroyed.
  <br>
  <br>
  The film was released overseas this month, sparking hopes that it would garner similar acclaim abroad.
  <br>
  <br>
  The original "Ne Zha" became what was then China's highest-grossing animated film, after it was released in 2019.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Musician A$AP Rocky was found not guilty of two counts of felony assault at the conclusion of a trial in Los Angeles on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The musician, whose real name is Rakim Mayers, has two children with the singer Rihanna. He would've faced more than two decades in prison if he had been convicted of the alleged attack on a former friend in Hollywood in 2021.
  <br>
  <br>
  During the weeks-long trial, prosecutors said Mayers had shot a nine-millimetre semi-automatic weapon during a confrontation with Terell Ephron, also known as A$AP Relli, on November 6, 2021, in the heart of Hollywood, grazing Ephron's hand.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mayers, 36, had insisted he had been carrying only a harmless prop gun.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Los Angeles courtroom, full of fans of the hip-hop performer and his singing superstar partner, exploded into screaming glee as Rocky and Rihanna embraced and sobbed at the not guilty verdict from jurors.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Thank y’all for saving my life," he told the jurors as they left the Los Angeles courtroom.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rihanna cried and hugged the defence lawyers, as did Rocky.
  <br>
  <br>
  She attended the trial sporadically and brought the couple’s two sons – two-year-old RZA Athelston Mayers and one-year-old Riot Rose Mayers – for some of the closing arguments.
  <br>
  <br>
  The verdict came at the height of Rocky’s fame, if not the pinnacle of his music career.
  <br>
  <br>
  The three-time Grammy nominee, fashion mogul and actor has a banner year in the works, and can now look to it without the threat of prison hanging over him.
  <br>
  <br>
  He is scheduled to headline the Rolling Loud music festival in March; he is one of the celebrity co-chairs of fashion’s biggest night, the Met Gala, in May; and he stars with Denzel Washington in director Spike Lee’s film “Highest 2 Lowest,” set for release in early summer. (Agencies)

    More community pharmacies to be set up: Lo Chung-mau

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Health Lo Chung-mau said on Wednesday the government plans to establish up to five community pharmacies in each district, so patients can more easily get their medicine.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on RTHK’s Overview Policy programme, Lo said through the Hospital Authority’s centralised procurement, patients and private doctors can get cheaper medicine for chronic and episodic illnesses at community pharmacies.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said community pharmacies will also help to reduce drug wastage as patients need not take home several months’ worth of medication.
  <br>
  <br>
  “With community pharmacies, citizens will not need to get months of medication at one time. They can get one month of medication after visiting the doctor,” Lo said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “They also don't need to have a monthly follow-up appointment to get the same medicine. Instead, they can go to a community pharmacy to fill a prescription,” he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The health minister also expressed the hope that citizens would consult their own family doctors first for minor illnesses or chronic diseases. He added residents can select a general practitioner in their neighbourhood from a list of eligible doctors provided at District Health Centres (DHC).
  <br>
  <br>
  Currently, there are seven DHCs in the city, located in Kwai Tsing, Sham Shui Po, Southern District, Tsuen Wan, Tuen Mun, Wong Tai Sin and Yuen Long.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lo also said the government has subsidised family doctors in the community to provide screening services for diabetes and hypertension for eligible citizens.

<img alt="An HR expert says Hong Kong firms need to offer attractive pay to lure Islamic finance professionals to the SAR. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1792212_1_20250219084656.jpg&q=45">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A human resources expert on Wednesday said the latest government move to expand Hong Kong's Talent List is the right one, and will help plug holes in the SAR's workforce.
 <br>
  <br>
  On Tuesday, officials announced that aircraft maintenance engineers, accountants and financial professionals with Islamic market experience will be among nine professions added to the list from March 1.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Obviously, Hong Kong has a very serious shortage of these talents," Roy Ying, the co-chair of the advocacy and policy research committee at the Hong Kong Institute of Human Resource Management, told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted that aircraft engineering and maintenance firms such as Haeco has had to go overseas to recruit engineers all the time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ying also said the government has been proactive in addressing the needs of employers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I also think that the government is actively listening to the industries because these new jobs, they don't just land on the Talent List. It's a collaboration between the government and the industries.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Obviously the government sees a serious shortage and that's why these [jobs] are added to the Talent List."
  <br>
  <br>
  On bringing in more Islamic finance professionals to the SAR, he said Hong Kong firms not only have to offer attractive pay in order to compete with market leaders Malaysia and Saudi Arabia, but the territory also has to be become more Muslim friendly.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In terms of halal restaurants, we only have about 132 in Hong Kong... and most organisations don't have prayer rooms, so we have to make our city a little more embracing to attract these people," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We don't just want them to come, we want them to also bring their families... we have to get people who want to call Hong Kong home."

<img alt="Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky slammed his nation's exclusion from the Riyadh gathering. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1792190_1_20250219035354.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Russia and the United States agreed on Tuesday to establish teams to negotiate a path to ending the war in Ukraine after talks that drew a strong rebuke from Kyiv over its exclusion.
 <br>
  <br>
  Washington noted European nations would have to have a seat at the negotiating table "at some point", following the first high-level official Washington-Moscow talks since the 2022 war in Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some European leaders, alarmed by President Donald Trump's overhaul of US policy on Russia, fear Washington will make serious concessions to Moscow and re-write the continent's security arrangement in a Cold War-style deal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky slammed his nation's exclusion from the Riyadh gathering, which lasted for more than four hours.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said that any talks aimed at ending the war should be "fair" and involve European countries, including Turkey - which offered to host negotiations.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This will only be feeding Putin's appetite," a Ukrainian senior official requesting anonymity said, referring to the launch of talks without Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov agreed to "appoint respective high-level teams to begin working on a path to ending the conflict in Ukraine as soon as possible", the State Department said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Washington added the sides had also agreed to "establish a consultation mechanism" to address "irritants" to Russia and America's relationship, noting the sides would lay the groundwork for future cooperation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yuri Ushakov, President Vladimir Putin's foreign policy aide, confirmed the negotiating teams' appointment but said it was "difficult" to discuss a date for a potential Trump-Putin meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking from his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, Trump brushed aside Ukraine's concern about being left out of the meeting and suggested he could meet President Putin shortly.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said he was now more confident of a deal to end the Ukraine war after the talks.
  <br>
  <br>
  The meeting marks a major diplomatic coup for Moscow, which had been isolated for three years under the previous US administration of president Joe Biden. (AFP)

    Bayern score late, see off Celtic in Champions League

<img alt="Bayern Munich's Alphonso Davies celebrates his goal against Celtic. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1792203_1_20250219071515.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Bayern Munich secured their place in the last 16 of the Champions League with a 94th minute strike by Alphonso Davies to secure a 1-1 draw on the night and a 3-2 aggregate win.
 <br>
  <br>
  Bayern will face either their fellow German rivals Bayer Leverkusen or Spanish giants Atletico Madrid in the last 16.
  <br>
  <br>
  Celtic had led 1-0 since the 63rd minute and the Scottish side had been on the verge of taking the German giants to extra time and pulling off their first ever win in Germany.
  <br>
  <br>
  But with Harry Kane off injured and time running out, Davies stepped up as Bayern's saviour, tapping in after Celtic keeper Kasper Schmeichel had kept out Leon Goretzka's header.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bayern went into this game 2-1 up from last week's first leg at Celtic Park and seeking to stretch their unbeaten run to seven games in all competitions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bayern dominated possession in the first half but Celtic were more dangerous with at least three clear cut chances to score before the break.
  <br>
  <br>
  Former Bayern Munich second-team player, Nicolas Kuehn beat Manuel Neuer but Raphael Guerreiro cleared off the line.
  <br>
  <br>
  Moments later, Alistair Johnston flashed a dangerous ball across the Bayern goal. With Neuer stranded the ball flew just beyond Daizen Maeda.
  <br>
  <br>
  Then Maeda missed a golden opportunity to put Celtic ahead. When Dayot Upamecano was forced into a stray pass, Kuehn led the surge forward and fed Maeda, who blazed over with Kuehn and Jota in support.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bayern dominated the ball on a freezing night but suffered with a lack of quality in attack.
  <br>
  <br>
  Serge Gnabry was wasteful while Kane sometimes cut an isolated figure, starved of service. The England captain's best chance saw him rattling the bar with a snapshot after Josip Stanisic picked him out from the right.
  <br>
  <br>
  That would be Kane's final action. The striker was withdrawn at half time, feeling the effects of an injury picked up against Bayer Leverkusen on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bayern upped the pressure after the break and fashioned a clear chance when Goretzka went clean through. Schmeichel, however, made a crucial stop to keep Celtic in the game.
  <br>
  <br>
  Soon after, Celtic were in front. Maeda seized on a loose pass by Josip Stanisic and helped it on toward Kuehn. Min-Jae Kim reached the ball first but could not clear and Kuehn was able to take a touch and find the bottom corner.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was a goal that shocked the Allianz Arena and threatened Bayern's record of 20 European home games unbeaten. Celtic were delivering on coach Brendan Rodgers' pre-match battle cry to show bravery.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bayern sought an equaliser but Vincent Kompany's side were reduced to long-range shots, with Schmeichel pulling off saves from Joshua Kimmich, Michael Olise and substitute Leroy Sane.
  <br>
  <br>
  Celtic were moments away from inflicting Bayern's first defeat by a Scottish team and taking the tie into extra-time but the game had a sting in the tail. Olise delivered a pinpoint cross that was met by Goretzka.
  <br>
  <br>
  Schmeichel saved but Davies scrambled the rebound home off his shin to send Bayern through to the last 16. (AFP)

    China condemns US 'tariff shocks' at WTO

<img alt="Li Chenggang, China's Ambassador to the WTO, warns against what he says is US unilateralism disrupting the rules-based multilateral trading system. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1792198_1_20250219060325.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The sweeping tariffs threatened or imposed by US President Donald Trump risk triggering inflation, market distortions, and even a global recession, China said on Tuesday at the World Trade Organization.
 <br>
  <br>
  After returning to office on January 20, Trump slapped China, the world's second-biggest economy, with an additional 10 percent levy on products entering the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  And Trump signed executive orders last week imposing new 25 percent tariffs on steel and aluminium, due to come into effect on March 12.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The world faces a series of tariff shocks," said Li Chenggang, China's ambassador to the WTO, at the first meeting of the year of the global trade body's decision-making General Council.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The US has imposed or threatened tariffs on its trading partners, including China, unilaterally and arbitrarily, blatantly violating WTO rules. China firmly opposes such measures.
  <br>
  <br>
  "These tariff shocks heighten economic uncertainty, disrupt global trade, and risk domestic inflation, market distortion, or even global recession."
  <br>
  <br>
  Li went on to say that US unilateralism threatened to upend the rules-based multilateral trading system.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The stakes are high for all members, big or small," said Li.
  <br>
  <br>
  Imposing punitive tariffs on countries with high trade surpluses with the United States has been at the heart of Trump's economic policy.
  <br>
  <br>
  He paused 25 percent levies against Canada and Mexico for a month after both countries vowed to step up measures to counter flows of the drug fentanyl and the crossing of undocumented migrants into the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Trump went ahead with tariffs on China, which imposed retaliatory tariffs targeting US coal and liquified natural gas.
  <br>
  <br>
  A Geneva-based trade official said Washington in return voiced concerns that China was operating a non-market economic system and habitually breached WTO rules.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The US highlighted the issues stemming from China's lack of transparency and its disregard for WTO oversight," the official said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The US also pointed out that the WTO's current inability to address China's market-distorting policies, such as unfair subsidies, significantly diminishes the organisation's effectiveness." (AFP)

    Berrettini ends Djokovic comeback at Qatar Open

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Novak Djokovic's comeback came to a crashing halt as he lost 7-6 (7/4), 6-2 to Matteo Berrettini in the second round of the Qatar Open.
 <br>
  <br>
  Djokovic, who was seeded third and received a first-round bye, was playing his first match since limping out of his Australian Open semi-final in January.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the Serb said that while he was not 100 per cent, fitness was not the issue.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I was outplayed by just a better player today," he said. "Yes, I wasn't at my desired level, and it could be that I'm still not moving the way I want to move, but I played without pain, so there is no excuse in that."
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think he played a masterclass match to be honest, tactically, and served very well, so just a very deserved win from his side," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was only Berrettini's second win this year, and his first over a player in the top 10 since 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was also the Italian's first ever win over Djokovic. Their previous encounters included victories for the Serb in the Wimbledon final and Roland Garros quarterfinals, both in 2021.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Something I've been looking to do for a long time. I've played against him in the most important tournaments on tour," the 28-year-old Italian said on court after the victory. "I wish I could have won one of those matches."
  <br>
  <br>
  Berrettini has struggled with injuries over the last 18 months but won three tournaments after returning to court last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Really happy with my performance," he said. "Really happy because I enjoyed my time out there, which is the most important thing."
  <br>
  <br>
  The first set went with serve but Berrettini took two points off Djokovic's serve to win the tiebreak. The Italian then broke to love in the second game of the second set.
  <br>
  <br>
  Djokovic had broken Berrettini 27 times in their four previous encounters but the Italian was comfortable on serve until the final game before finally winning on his second match point.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A champion like Novak is always ready to come back," Berrettini said. "You don't have to think about match point. You have to think about the next point."
  <br>
  <br>
  Djokovic said that Andy Murray had agreed to continue as his coach "indefinitely" but said that he did not plan to overhaul his style.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I am trying to improve my game, like everybody else. But my game is not going to change now drastically," Djokovic said. "My game is what it is, the core is going to be the same."
  <br>
  <br>
  "There are more injuries. Things are not the same as 10 years ago, 15 years ago. I still try to take care of my body on a daily basis, and it's more challenging now, no doubt. I still try to do my very best, given the circumstances."
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Alex de Minaur celebrated his birthday by beating Russian Roman Safiullin 6-1, 7-5, even though the Australian did not enjoy the weather.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They're tough days, these ones," said De Minaur. "It's cold, it's windy, you probably don't want to get out of bed. But once you step on court, you have to do everything you can to win."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Whether it's ugly or pretty tennis, you just put the ball in the court, and that's what I did today," he continued.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere, world number six Daniil Medvedev eliminated compatriot and defending champion Karen Khachanov 4-6, 7-5, 6-3.
  <br>
  <br>
  Medvedev has not won a tournament since the Rome Masters in spring 2023. He was knocked out in the second round of this year's Australian Open by teenage American Learner Tien.
  <br>
  <br>
  A third Russian former champion, Andrey Rublev, the fifth seed, beat Alexander Bublik 6-3, 6-4. (AFP)

<img alt='According to a court filing on Monday by the director of the Office of Administration, Musk "is an employee of the White House." Photo: AFP' src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1792176_1_20250218223453.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Elon Musk is not an official employee of the Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) and has "no formal authority to make government decisions," according to a White House court filing.
 <br>
  <br>
  The world's richest man is widely seen as the de-facto head of Doge, created by President Donald Trump, which has sought to drastically reduce US government spending including with thousands of job cuts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump had announced in November that "the Great Elon Musk... will lead the Department of Government Efficiency ('DOGE')."
  <br>
  <br>
  According to the filing on Monday by Joshua Fisher, director of the Office of Administration, Musk "is an employee of the White House... as a non-career Special Government Employee" and a "Senior Advisor to the President."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Like other senior White House advisors, Mr Musk has no actual or formal authority to make government decisions himself. Mr Musk can only advise the President and communicate the President's directives," Fisher said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The US Doge Service is a component of the Executive Office of the President. The US Doge Service Temporary Organisation is within the US Doge Service. Both are separate from the White House Office," he said in the filing.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Mr Musk is an employee of the White House Office. He is not an employee of the US Doge Service or US Doge Service Temporary Organisation. Mr Musk is not the Temporary Administrator," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fisher's filing was made in a case brought against Musk by 14 US states, including New Mexico.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a joint interview with Musk due to be broadcast on Fox News later on Tuesday, Trump took aim at critics saying that the Tesla founder was the one running the White House.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think nobody in history has ever gotten more bad publicity than me... But you know what I have learned Elon? That people are smart, they get it," Trump said in an excerpt of the interview.
  <br>
  <br>
  Musk added: "Yeah they do actually." (AFP)

 An extraordinary Arab League meeting on Gaza, initially set for next week, has been postponed to March 4, host Egypt said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Egyptian foreign ministry said the new date was agreed with Arab League members as part of "substantive and logistical preparations" for the summit.
  <br>
  <br>
  The meeting was called in response to US President Donald Trump's proposal to take over the war-battered Gaza Strip and move its Palestinian inhabitants elsewhere, including to Egypt and Jordan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Saudi Arabia is set to host the leaders of Egypt, Jordan, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates on Friday to present their own plan for Gaza's reconstruction while ensuring that Palestinians remain on their land.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's Gaza plan has sparked outcry across the Arab world, prompting a rare show of unity among Arab nations to block it. (AFP)

    HK's population grows by 6,400

<img alt="Hong Kong's population stood at 7.534 million at the end of 2024, representing an increase of 0.1 percent year on year. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1792151_2_20250218225030.jpg&q=70">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's population expanded for the third consecutive year, albeit at a slower pace, to 7.534 million last year, an uptick of 6,400.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 0.1 percent growth paled in comparison to the 0.7 percent increase in 2023, and one percent in 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the 36,700 births last year were outstripped by 51,400 deaths.
  <br>
  <br>
  That was offset by a net positive movement of 21,000 SAR residents, which included 40,000 arrivals through one-way permits. Around 18,900 people migrated elsewhere.
  <br>
  <br>
  A government spokesperson said that various talent attraction measures and labour importation schemes helped boost the city's population growth.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Professor Paul Yip from the University of Hong Kong's Department of Social Work and Social Administration struck a cautious tone.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said that the natural decrease of over 14,000 people remained a concern, alongside the city's ageing population.
  <br>
  <br>
  "What we can see is that the ageing situation remains a very important issue and it will get worse in the coming years," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yip does not expect the trend to reverse any time soon, despite a 10 percent jump in the birth rate last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In 2024, that was the dragon year. It is a year that tends to have a higher birth rate than before. But I think when we look at the historical figures, all the years after the dragon years, I think the birth rates reduced accordingly," he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  The population expert urged the government to focus on improving people’s health and wellbeing, while encouraging enterprises to adopt technology to make work less labour intensive.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Snooker legends Judd Trump and Ronnie O'Sullivan said they are very excited to play in their first tournament in Hong Kong since becoming SAR residents.
 <br>
  <br>
  The World Snooker Grand Prix 2025 will be held in the Kai Tak Arena on March 8 and 9.
  <br>
  <br>
  World number one Trump is set to face Gary Wilson of England, while O'Sullivan will take on Si Jiahui from China.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both Trump and O'Sullivan obtained their Hong Kong residency through the Quality Migrant Admission Scheme last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For me, it is more motivating to come back here because I feel like now that I'm here, and I feel like the people in Hong Kong can really get behind me and have someone to really support," Trump said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think when you have somebody that is trying to represent Hong Kong, which I am now. I think the people can kind of see that. I hope that comes off in the way that I'm able to carry myself and give everybody full respect. I hope to make Hong Kong proud and be the first winner of this tournament."
  <br>
  <br>
  O'Sullivan, a seven-time World champion, said he is ready and looks forward to play in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vincent Law, chairman of the Billiard Sports Council of Hong Kong China, said efforts are underway to make sure the event is being held successfully at the brand new venue.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We also hope the spectators will understand if something don't go right on the first day, we guarantee that we will try to our best to fix problems to make sure the tournament will run smoothly."
  <br>
  <br>
  Exhibition matches will also take place during the two-day event.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong's top player, Marco Fu, will face off the legendary "Whirlwind" Jimmy White on March 8.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SAR's Ng On-yee, meanwhile, takes on world number 1 Mink Nutcharut from Thailand the following day.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's unemployment rate remained at 3.1 percent in the November-January period, unchanged from the previous three-month figure.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Census and Statistics Department said 3,716,600 were in work in the latest period, a fall of 2,300 from October-December.
  <br>
  <br>
  The labour force, meanwhile, decreased by around 5,700 to 3,826,700.
  <br>
  <br>
  Around 110,100 people were looking for a job, down about 3,500 from the previous three-month period.
  <br>
  <br>
  The underemployment rate also remained unchanged in the three months from November, at 1.1 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Secretary for Labour and Welfare Chris Sun said Hong Kong's jobless rate remains low.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added in a statement that "the labour market should remain largely stable in the near term, though uncertainties in the global economy would continue to pose challenges to some businesses."

    Lawmakers back annual minimum wage reviews

<img alt="Hong Kong's statutory minimum wage will increase from HK$40 to HK$42.1 per hour. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1792143_1_20250218174210.jpg&q=60">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lawmakers welcomed the shift from biennial to annual minimum wage reviews, saying this would enhance the quality of life of grassroots workers.
 <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong's statutory minimum wage will increase from HK$40 to HK$42.1 an hour, following a 5.25 percent recommendation from the Minimum Wage Commission.
  <br>
  <br>
  This new rate is set to take effect on May 1, pending lawmakers' approval, and will be reviewed annually instead of biennially.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lam Chun-sing, chairman of the Legislative Council's manpower panel, said reviewing wages annually allows minimum wage workers to better pace their earnings with inflation each year.
  <br>
  <br>
  He told RTHK that the government's freeze on minimum wage levels during the pandemic led to four years without salary increases for grassroots workers despite inflation, severely affecting their ability to maintain their purchasing power and living standards.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lam hopes future adjustments to the minimum wage would give greater weight to economic growth, so that workers could benefit more substantially from gains in the economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We hope that later ... after three or five years we can review the formula to see whether we can increase the proportion of the calculation of growth of the GDP so that if there's a large increase in GDP, then we can also have a large increase in minimum wage levels so that the grassroots worker can share the fruits of economic development," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, lawmaker Kwok Wai-keung, of the Federation of Trade Unions, said they would continue to communicate with the government to see whether a review could be conducted within five to 10 years after this reform was completed.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added the increase was unlikely to have a major impact on the labour market, as only about 20,000 of the 3.6 million workers in the SAR earn the minimum wage.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The number of grassroots workers is small and their roles are concentrated in cleaning and security. We have heard that many companies in these industries already pay wages above the minimum wage, meaning that this adjustment will not affect those already earning more than the minimum," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Thus, we believe it will not have a major impact on the economy or competitiveness."

    Islamic finance among new additions to Talent List

<img alt="From March 1, the Talent List will cover 60 professions. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1792146_1_20250218174805.jpg&q=70">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Aircraft maintenance engineers, accountants and financial professionals with Islamic market experience will be among nine professions added to Hong Kong's Talent List from March 1.
 <br>
  <br>
  The government also wants new blood with a background in commodities trading, as well as systems architects, patent professionals, ship surveyors, professionals in green shipping, and legal knowledge engineers in the legal and dispute resolution sector.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a closed-door media briefing on Tuesday, the Labour and Welfare Bureau said that by expanding the number of jobs on the list to 60, the government is hoping to find talented people who can add significant value to the economy in areas where there are staff shortages and where it is not practical to train up locals.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the other hand, it said requests from industries to add further roles to the list, including pilots and language therapists, have been rejected because there are sufficient training opportunities for local people to take up such jobs.
  <br>
  <br>
  People in professions on the list get a smoother immigration process when applying to work in Hong Kong through various talent schemes, officials say.
  <br>
  <br>
  The last expansion of the Talent List was in May 2023, when the number of professions rose from 13 to 51.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bureau said between May 2023 and the end of last year it received 1,123 applications for work visas involving jobs on the list.

 China hopes that all parties and stakeholders can participate in the peace talks to solve the Ukraine crisis, the Foreign Ministry said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Foreign Ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun said Beijing welcomes all peace efforts over Ukraine, including the talks between the United States and Russia, ahead of a meeting between diplomats from the two countries in Saudi Arabia.
  <br>
  <br>
  US President Donald Trump is pushing for a swift resolution to the three-year conflict in Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Kyiv was not invited to the discussions in Riyadh, while European leaders were gathering in Paris for emergency talks on how to respond to the radical pivot by the new US administration.
  <br>
  <br>
  Guo said: "We hope that all parties can work together to resolve the root causes of the Ukraine crisis, find a balanced, effective and sustainable security structure and achieve long-term peace and stability in Europe." (Agencies)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Senior officials from Russia and the US met in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday to begin talks on improving ties and negotiating an end to the war in Ukraine.
 <br>
  <br>
  Delegations led by US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov met at the Diriyah Palace in Riyadh.
  <br>
  <br>
  The meeting marks another pivotal step by the Trump administration to reverse Washington's policy on isolating Russia and is meant to pave the way for a meeting between US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump earlier this month upended US policy toward Ukraine and Russia by saying he and Putin had agreed to begin negotiations on ending the war.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ukrainian officials aren’t taking part in the meeting, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Monday his country wouldn't accept the outcome if Kyiv didn't take part.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rubio was accompanied by US national security adviser Mike Waltz and Special Envoy Steve Witkoff, while Lavrov sat next to the Kremlin's foreign affairs adviser, Yuri Ushakov.

  <br>
  Saudi Foreign Minister Faisal bin Farhan and national security adviser Musaed al Alban joined Rubio, Lavrov and others for the start of the meeting but were expected to leave early in the talks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ushakov said on Monday the talks would be “purely bilateral” and would not include Ukrainian officials.
  <br>
  <br>
  The talks mark a significant expansion of US-Russian contacts nearly three years into a war that has seen ties fall to the lowest level in decades.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lavrov and then-US Secretary of State Antony Blinken talked briefly on the sidelines of a G-20 meeting in India nearly two years ago, and in the fall of 2022, US and Russian spymasters met in Turkey amid Washington’s concerns that Moscow could resort to nuclear weapons amid battlefield setbacks.
  <br>
  <br>
  The recent US diplomatic blitz on the war has sent Kyiv and key allies scrambling to ensure a seat at the table amid concerns that Washington and Moscow could press ahead with a deal that will not be favourable to them.
  <br>
  <br>
  France called an emergency meeting of European Union countries and the UK on Monday to decide how to respond.
  <br>

    Rise in cigarette smuggling in 2024: customs

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Cigarette smuggling accounted for around 68 percent of the total number of cases the Customs and Excise Department worked on last year, according to customs officers.
 <br>
  <br>
  The department handled more than 31,000 cases in 2024, which was a 63 percent increase from 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said cigarette smuggling increased 80 percent last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Customs commissioner Chan Tsz-tat on Tuesday said the numbers were due to the increased tobacco tax over the past two years.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The duty rates of cigarettes has increased from HK$1.9 to HK$3.3 per stick over the past two years. Inevitably, this would add the incentive to smugglers as well as incoming passengers to bring in excessive duty-free cigarettes," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added the department had cracked 40 large-scale cigarette smuggling cases in 2024, similar to 2023, but the number of cigarettes seized dropped 33 percent to around 600 million sticks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said the drop was due to syndicates decreasing the number of cigarettes being smuggled out at any one time and using differenct smuggling methods in order to reduce losses if smuggled products were seized.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, customs officers seized 6.3 tonnes of drugs and arrested 366 people last year in connection with these seizures.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among them, 19 cases involved the import of space oil drugs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Customs said it has stepped up its actions following the classification of etomidate, the key ingredient of the space oil drug, as a dangerous drug last Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have strengthened our enforcement covering the whole supply chain, including import and export, distribution and retail, and to crack down on their supply," Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The department has also enhanced intelligence analysis and risk management so as to ensure precise cargo and passenger selections. Etomidate has been added to the database of our Raman spectrometers to enhance detection on the front line," he added.

    Ngong Ping 360 sees record revenue in 2024

<div class="itemFullText">
 Ngong Ping 360 on Tuesday said it will work on attracting more long-haul tourists, as its visitor numbers last year surpassed pre-pandemic levels.
 <br>
  <br>
  The company said it received record-breaking cable car revenue of over HK$413 million last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said the facility welcomed more than 1.5 million guests in 2024, showing a 10 percent growth when compared with pre-pandemic levels.
  <br>
  <br>
  About 40 percent of the visitors were from short-haul markets, followed by mainland tourists, local people, and visitors from long-haul markets.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to the press, managing director James Tung said the company will do its best to attract more visitors, especially those from long-haul markets.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We are actually talking to some online travel agencies, trying to target those free and independent travellers - FIT - who may not necessarily follow a tour itinerary pattern, but they can get access to our tickets very easily,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “So we are even targeting potentially backpackers from the US, from Australia, from Europe as well.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Last month, the Airport Authority unveiled the Airport City development blueprint, aiming to create a new landmark for Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tung said the cable car facility has an advantage of being close to Chek Lap Kok.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We’ve been talking to different operators, different stakeholders who are involved in the project, to see what we can do moving forward… how we can actually get the tickets to the hands of the travellers,“ he said.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong is set to raise the statutory minimum wage from the current HK$40 to HK$42.1 per hour.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a statement issued on Tuesday, the government said the Executive Council has adopted the recommendation of the Minimum Wage Commission (MWC) on raising the minimum wage level by 5.25 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said it will publish the Minimum Wage Ordinance (Amendment of Schedule 3) Notice 2025 in the Gazette on Friday, and table it in the Legislative Council on February 26.
  <br>
  <br>
  If Legco gives it the green light, the new minimum wage rate will take effect on May 1.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The recommendation … is in line with the policy objectives … to maintain an appropriate balance between forestalling excessively low wages and minimising the loss of low-paid jobs, while giving due regard to sustaining Hong Kong's economic growth and competitiveness,” labour and welfare secretary Chris Sun said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Australia's central bank cut interest rates on Tuesday for the first time since the depths of the 2020 pandemic, saying progress had been made on inflation though it was still cautious about the outlook.
 <br>
  <br>
  Wrapping up its February policy meeting, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) cut its cash rate by 25 basis points to 4.10 percent, ending more than a year of steady policy.
  <br>
  <br>
  It offered little guidance on whether it would ease again at the next board meeting in April.
  <br>
  <br>
  Markets had wagered heavily on a quarter-point cut after core inflation surprised on the downside in the fourth quarter at 3.2 percent and looked certain to re-enter the RBA's 2-3 percent target band this quarter. (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday said the opening of Kai Tak Sports Park will mark a significant milestone in Hong Kong's sporting and cultural landscape.
 <br>
  <br>
  An opening ceremony will begin at 6.30pm on March 1, with a joint broadcast at 9.30pm across four free TV channels, rather than being shown live.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked about the broadcast arrangements, Lee said he believes the production company has tried its best.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have to make sure that members of the public will be able to view the event for free through the TV channels so that we can share the happiness with everyone," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The production company will seek partners to help deal with all the challenges that they are going to face. In this regard I believe the production company has been working very hard. They're going to find the best solution within such a short period of time."
  <br>
  <br>
  The park's opening is part of what is being billed as Hong Kong's "Super March", alongside Art Basel, ComplexCon, and the World Grand Prix snooker tournament.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee said the mega events scheduled for the first half of this year are expected to attract 840,000 tourists and generate HK$3.3 billion in spending.

 Hong Kong stocks soared past 23,000 in Tuesday morning trade, as investors cheered a meeting between President Xi Jinping and business leaders in Beijing the day before.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Hang Seng Index had opened higher, rising 0.21 percent at 22,664, before eclipsing the 23,000-mark for the first time in more than four months.
  <br>
  <br>
  By midday, the index put on 464 points, or more than 2 percent, at 23,080.

  <br>
  Tech shares also did well, standing near three-year highs.
  <br>
  <br>

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday urged the taxi industry to avoid "drastic action" such as strikes, warning such moves would harm the public interest and could be hijacked by people with bad motives.
 <br>
  <br>
  His comments came after the Hong Kong Tele-call Taxi Association threatened a five-day strike from March 5 unless officials take immediate action against illegal ride-hailing services.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters before the weekly Executive Council meeting, Lee said strikes would not be good for society.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Any drastic action is not going to solve the problem. Drastic action may also hurt the interests of normal citizens in the course of their daily going about of their lives. It is not going to receive public support," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CE noted that many taxi drivers have said they wouldn't support strike action.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Transport Advisory Committee will meet representatives from both the taxi industry and ride-hailing platforms on Wednesday to discuss the issue.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee said on Tuesday that he's all for his ministers reaching out to the community and explaining their work, including to the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office.
 <br>
  <br>
  The head of the office, Xia Baolong, made a three-day visit to the Greater Bay Area earlier this month and met with some of the SAR's ministers, when Lee was in Harbin attending the Asian Winter Games.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking before the weekly Executive Council meeting, the CE said Xia is a busy leader, and that he and the top mainland official maintain good communication.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I also support my ministers in doing their work in their own right... I support them in explaining issues to different people and reporting their work to the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, especially in explaining their specific portfolio to Director Xia personally.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This precisely reflects my demands for different ministers to do their own part, taking charge of their responsibilities in resolving problems.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And at the same time, there's synergy among the team, united as one, complementing one another in handling problems."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee said he wanted to once again thank Xia for pointing the way forward for Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office said Xia exchanged views with a number of SAR government officials on how Hong Kong will speed up reform and better integrate into the Greater Bay Area's development. During his trip, he visited the Hetao Innovation and Technology Cooperation Zone, as well as Qianhai and Yantian.

 Protesters against US President Donald Trump and his policies braved frigid temperatures in parts of  America on Monday, shouting “No kings on Presidents Day” in East Coast cities and attempting to enter the Arizona Statehouse to oppose a bill that would bolster fast-changing federal immigration enforcement.
 <br>
  <br>
  In Florida and California, local media outlets reported on hundreds of protesters carrying out “Not my Presidents Day” protests.
  <br>
  <br>
  The “No Kings" theme was orchestrated by the 50501 Movement, and marked the second set of protests criss-crossing the nation in less than two weeks.
  <br>
  <br>
  A similar nationwide event on February 5 drew participants in dozens of cities.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both sets of rallies denounced Trump and billionaire adviser Elon Musk, the leader of Trump’s new Department of Government Efficiency, an outside-government organisation designed to slash federal spending.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nearly 1,000 people marched in the snow from the Statehouse in Boston to City Hall, chanting “Elon Musk has got to go” and other slogans.
  <br>
  <br>
  The temperature was below freezing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Boston protesters, some dressed in Revolutionary War-style clothing, carried signs saying such things as “This is a Coup” and “Cowards Bow to Trump, Patriots Stand Up.” One sign had a depiction of Uncle Sam saying “I Want You to Resist.”
  <br>
  <br>
  “I thought it was important to be here on Presidents Day to demonstrate for what America stands for,” said Emily Manning, 55, a Boston engineer who came to the rally with her two teenage sons.
  <br>
  <br>
  “American values are not the values of the plutocracy or the limited few rich people.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Organisers of Monday’s protests, which were focused on state capitals and major cities including Washington, DC; Orlando, Florida; and Seattle, said they were targeting “anti-democratic and illegal actions of the Trump administration and its plutocratic allies.”
  <br>
  <br>
  One sign at the rally that attracted hundreds in the nation's capital said, “Deport Musk Dethrone Trump.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The rallies followed a series of Trump executive orders and came just days after layoffs across federal agencies as part of an effort to reduce the government workforce. (AP)

    Argentina's president denies role in 'cryptogate' scam

<img alt="Authorities are investigating Argentina's President Javier Milei for his promotion of a cryptocurrency which crashed within hours of its launch last week. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1792070_1_20250218105528.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Argentine President Javier Milei on Monday denied promoting a cryptocurrency that crashed last week, losing investors billions of dollars and prompting a flood of complaints, as prosecutors reportedly prepare an investigation into the scandal.
 <br>
  <br>
  "I did not promote it, I spread it," Milei told broadcaster TN, adding that it "is a problem between private parties because the State does not play a role here."
  <br>
  <br>
  "I acted in good faith," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Argentina's federal prosecutor's office will examine whether Milei engaged in fraud or criminal association or was in breach of his duties when he praised the $LIBRA cryptocurrency on social media Friday evening, according to news reports.
  <br>
  <br>
  The currency's value soared then crashed, and Milei deleted his blessing hours later, saying he had made a mistake.
  <br>
  <br>
  Argentine economists, crypto specialists and opposition political figures criticised the self-declared "anarcho-capitalist" president, an economist by training, and said the digital asset could be a fraud or a Ponzi scheme.
  <br>
  <br>
  Industry observers said the operation was likely a "rug pull" -- a scam where developers unveil a crypto token, attract investors, then quickly cash out.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rights NGO Observatory for the Right to the City, one of several complainants, alleges Milei formed part of a "criminal organisation that organised a fraud with the $LIBRA cryptocurrency that simultaneously affected more than 40,000 people with losses of more than US$4 billion."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Kobeissi Letter, a publication that provides analysis on global capital markets, said on X Friday that within minutes of its launch, "multiple large holders began liquidating MILLIONS of USD worth of $LIBRA."
  <br>
  <br>
  "This included gains of +US$4 million or more as $LIBRA rose to US$4.6 billion in market (capitalisation)," it reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Monday, Milei said he had "nothing to hide" from an investigation.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said that those who carried out the transactions, including "a lot of bots," were people who "knew very well what the risk was."
  <br>
  <br>
  Nevertheless, former president and opposition figure Cristina Kirchner called Milei a "crypto-scammer" and opposition parliamentarians announced they would institute impeachment proceedings against him.
  <br>
  <br>
  Any such proceedings would be highly unlikely to succeed, however, as they would require a two-thirds majority in the lower house.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other parties are seeking the creation of a special parliamentary commission to question Milei. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government says it strongly condemns unfounded malicious attacks online, after a court issued an order to confiscate the alleged crime proceeds of self-exiled national security suspect, Ted Hui.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Court of First Instance issued the confiscation order on Monday upon application by the Department of Justice.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement overnight, a government spokesman accused Hui of committing numerous crimes, including conspiring with foreign politicians in 2020 to forge documents and deceive the court, in order to jump bail and abscond overseas.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Before and after Hui Chi-fung absconded from Hong Kong, he transferred nearly $2.5 million Hong Kong dollars in personal assets as gifts to his mother and wife," the spokesman said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government spokesman said such a gift made within six years from the date of prosecution may be regarded as the defendant's property, and confiscated under the law.
  <br>
  <br>
  The statement said it was common practice to confiscate crime proceeds, and denied that private property could be 'confiscated at any time' or 'arbitrarily', as such orders must comply with strict conditions.
  <br>
  <br>
  These include that the court must be satisfied the absconded defendant could have been convicted of the offence and whether they benefited from the offence.

    Djokovic calls for revamp of tennis anti-doping system

<img alt="Djokovic speaks to reporters ahead of the ATP Qatar ExxonMobil Open 2025 men's tournament. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1792046_1_20250218080329.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Novak Djokovic has urged tennis authorities to overhaul the sport's anti-doping system, pointing to "inconsistencies" in cases involving top stars Jannik Sinner and Iga Swiatek and those of lower-ranked players.
 <br>
  <br>
  World number one Sinner agreed to a three-month ban on Saturday, admitting "partial responsibility" for mistakes by his team which led to him twice testing positive for traces of clostebol in March last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sinner was facing a potential ban of two years after the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) against his initial exoneration by the International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA), announced in August.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a surprising move, WADA withdrew its appeal and came to an agreement with Sinner to accept a three-month ban.
  <br>
  <br>
  In another high-profile case last year, five-time Grand Slam champion Swiatek accepted a one-month ban after testing positive for the banned heart drug trimetazidine.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There's a majority of the players that I've talked to in the locker room, not just in the last few days, but also last few months, that are not happy with the way this whole process has been handled," said Djokovic.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A majority of the players don't feel that it's fair. A majority of the players feel like there is favouritism happening. It seems like, it appears that you can almost affect the outcome if you are a top player, if you have access to the top lawyers."
  <br>
  <br>
  In contrast, the recently retired Simona Halep, a former world number one, was handed a four-year ban by the ITIA in 2022 after testing positive for the blood-boosting drug roxadustat.
  <br>
  <br>
  She argued it was the result of a tainted supplement and successfully appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, which reduced her suspension to nine months.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Simona Halep and Tara Moore and some other players that are maybe less known that have been struggling to resolve their cases for years, or have gotten the ban for years," said Djokovic. "There is so much inconsistencies between the cases."
  <br>
  <br>
  Djokovic, who is returning to action this week at the Qatar Open for the first time since retiring injured from last month's Australian Open semi-finals, believes a change is needed.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Right now it's a ripe time for us to really address the system, because the system and the structure obviously doesn't work for anti-doping, it's obvious," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I hope that in the next period of the near future that the governing bodies are going to come together, of our tours and the tennis ecosystem, and try to find a more effective way to deal with these processes," he added. "It's inconsistent, and it appears to be very unfair."
  <br>
  <br>
  "If you are going to treat every case individually or independently, which is what's happening, then there's no consistency, then there is no transparency, and some cases are transparent, some are not," he continued.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The problem is that right now there is a lack of trust generally from the tennis players, both male and female, towards WADA and ITIA, and the whole process." (AFP)

    Plane flips upside down in Toronto crash, 18 injured

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A Delta Air Lines jet with 80 people onboard crash-landed on Monday at Toronto's main airport, officials said, flipping upside down and leaving at least 18 people injured but causing no deaths.
 <br>
  <br>
  Endeavor Air Flight 4819 with 76 passengers and four crew was landing in the afternoon in Canada's largest metropolis, having flown from Minneapolis in the US state of Minnesota, the airline said.
  <br>
  <br>
  No explanation of the cause of the accident, or how the plane ended up flipped with its wings clipped, has been provided.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's very early on. It's really important that we do not speculate. What we can say is the runway was dry and there were no crosswind conditions," said Todd Aitken, the airport's fire chief.
  <br>
  <br>
  He confirmed that 18 people had been injured in the accident, with no fatalities.
  <br>
  <br>
  All of the wounded, including those with minor injuries, were taken to area hospitals either by ambulance or helicopter, said the paramedic services' Lawrence Saindon.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dramatic images on local broadcasts and shared on social media showed people stumbling away from the upside down CRJ-900 plane, shielding their faces from strong gusts of wind and blowing snow.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fire crews appeared to douse the aircraft with water as smoke wafted from the fuselage and as passengers were still exiting the plane.
  <br>
  <br>
  RTHK's North America correspondent Simon Marks said it had been snowing at the airport.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The images in which through the snow that was enveloping the airport, you could just make out the visual of a CRJ-900 regional jet that had crash at the airport and somehow ended up…literally upside down on the runway."
  <br>
  <br>
  Toronto airport authority chief executive Deborah Flint told a news conference the incident did not involve any other planes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Emergency crews were "heroic" in their response, she said, "reaching the site within minutes and quickly evacuating the passengers."
  <br>
  <br>
  Some of them "have already been reunited with their friends and their families," she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The airport suspended all flights after the incident, before resuming them at around 5:00pm EST, more than two hours later. It said passengers should expect long delays.

<img alt="Housing minister Winnie Ho, second left, says she expects the projects to receive an overwhelming response, especially the one in Kai Tak.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Housing Bureau on Monday announced a new phase of light public flats, and people can begin moving in from the fourth quarter of this year.
 <br>
  <br>
  The second phase covers four projects in Kai Tak, Kwun Tong, Tuen Mun and Sheung Shui, generating 5,060 units with monthly rents between HK$860 and HK$3,270.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eligible people can submit their applications from February 24.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to the press, housing minister Winnie Ho said she expects the projects to receive an overwhelming response, especially the one in Kai Tak adjacent to the MTR station
  <br>
  <br>
  "Light public housing projects can effectively help residents in need. The locations of the second phase projects are very appealing," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have about 5,000 units this time, and together with the 4,400 units announced in the first phase, we have introduced almost 10,000 flats. That is one-third of the total number."
  <br>
  <br>
  DAB lawmaker Vincent Cheng, who's the deputy chairman of the Legco housing panel, said while the projects would help reduce the waiting time for public housing, the focus should still be on building more public flats.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Light public housing is not for the long term. Some of the residents also have to move again after they [are allocated with] a public housing flat," he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hopefully, even though the waiting time will be shortened, we hope that the government can keep providing more public housing in the future."
  <br>
  <br>
  The government aims to build a total of about 30,000 light public flats by 2028 under the scheme aimed at filling the short-term gap of public housing supply.
  <br>
  <br>
  Regarding the projects announced in the first phase last year, Ho said people would start moving into the units in Yuen Long and Ngau Tau Kok from March and June respectively.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The so-called "update" to the Taiwan fact sheet displayed on the US State Department website is another example of Washington using the Taiwan question to contain China, and China urges the US to immediately correct its mistakes, Foreign Ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun said on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The US State Department removed a line on its website stating that it does not support "Taiwan independence".
  <br>
  <br>
  Guo reiterated that there is only one China and Taiwan is part of China, and the government of the People's Republic of China is the only legal government representing the whole of China.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that it is a prevailing international consensus and basic norm governing international relations, and also a solemn commitment the US has made in the three China-US joint communiqués.
  <br>
  <br>
  Guo stressed that the revision made by the US State Department gravely backpedalled on its position on Taiwan-related issues, and has sent a severely wrong signal to "Taiwan independence" separatist forces.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We urge the US to immediately correct its wrongdoings, abide by the one-China principle and three China-US joint communiqués," Guo said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Zhu Fenglian, a spokeswoman of the Taiwan Affairs Office, urged the US to handle the Taiwan question with the "greatest prudence" and stop sending any wrong signals that condone or abet "Taiwan independence" separatist forces.
  <br>
  <br>
  The revision was a "severe regression" regarding the US stance on the Taiwan question, she added. (Xinhua)

 Europe's security is at a turning point, EU chief Ursula von der Leyen said on Monday, as she arrived in Paris for an emergency meeting to address Washington's shock policy shift on the war in Ukraine.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Europe's security is at a turning point. Yes, it is about Ukraine - but it is also about us. We need an urgency mindset. We need a surge in defence. And we need both of them now," she said on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  Leaders from key European powers gathered in France to strategise after US President Donald Trump blindsided allies by launching efforts with Russia to end the war in Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Paris talks come as Washington said Secretary of State Marco Rubio, National Security Advisor Mike Waltz and Special Envoy Steve Witkoff would on Tuesday meet with a Russian delegation including Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov in Riyadh ahead of a future meeting between Trump and Putin in the Saudi capital.
  <br>
  <br>
  European Council chief Antonio Costa, who was also participating, said the meeting was "the beginning of a process, that will continue with the involvement of all the partners committed to peace and security in Europe."
  <br>
  <br>
  "The European Union and its Member States will play a central role in this process," he wrote on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  Europe is scrambling to come up with plans to ensure any peace deal in Ukraine is lasting, with Britain saying it would be willing to deploy peacekeepers if necessary.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Paris meeting was to bring together the heads of government of Britain, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland and Spain, as well as the heads of the European Council, the European Commission and Nato. (AFP)

 Hong Kong universities have seen a surge in non-local students, after the government doubled the enrolment ceiling for them to 40 percent.
 <br>
  <br>
  So, how are these students adjusting to life here? And what efforts are being made to help them feel at home?
  <br>
  <br>
  RTHK spoke to the warden and some students at St. John's College -- University of Hong Kong’s oldest residential hall -- to find out more.

    Baby's heart thrives after cross-boundary transplant

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Health authorities said the heart of a baby who received a successful cross-boundary organ donation is functioning well, with little post-operative bleeding.
 <br>
  <br>
  Eight month-old Whitney underwent a heart transplant on Sunday and is now in intensive care.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have at least a dozen of these monitoring lines attached to Whitney. We have minute-by-minute monitoring for at least a dozen of these parameters, and this is coupled with another list of interval monitoring like echocardiograms to look at the heart function, and radiographers to look at the chest conditions," said Dr Nicholson Yam, the head surgeon of the operation from the Hong Kong Children's Hospital.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have a team of dedicated nurses to look at the surgical wound condition, the bleeding conditions from the tubes that we place after surgery, and this will continue at least for the coming weeks."
  <br>
  <br>
  Yam said this was the baby's third open-heart surgery, presenting challenges such as removing the previously implanted biventricular assist device and minimising ischemia time -- the period during which tissue, such as a heart, is deprived of blood supply.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A lot of work has been done before to make sure the logistics [are] as smooth as possible, all the transportation, all the cross-boundary action, and then the transport to the Children's Hospital is as fast as possible, as smooth as possible," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As for Whitney's surgery, the main challenge was it was the third time the chest was opened, so she had two previous chest openings for heart surgery. We have expected quite a bit of scarring tissue inside the chest and that will make the heart removal procedure technically more challenging."
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Simon Tang, director of cluster services at the Hospital Authority, said close communication with mainland authorities -- specifically strengthened collaboration with the centre for the China Organ Transplant Response System -- was essential for ensuring a smooth cross-boundary organ transplant.
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted the first successful cross-boundary organ donation was in 2022 with a then four-month-old baby girl.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We established the communication channels and we also established the essential pathway. So in case if we have suitable grafts in mainland China, but there is no suitable recipients in mainland China, then this graft, we will see if it can be matched to a potential recipient in Hong Kong," Tang said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The key step is we need good preparations and so in these two years we have already set up various guidelines and protocols, so that we can ensure ... things can go smooth."
  <br>
  <br>
  Mr Cheung, Whitney's father, expressed his gratitude to the medical team, relevant departments and the donor's family for saving his daughter's life, calling the procedure a miracle.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chinese AI app DeepSeek will not be available to download in South Korea pending a review of its handling of user data, authorities in Seoul said Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  DeepSeek's R1 chatbot stunned investors and industry insiders with its ability to match the functions of its Western competitors at a fraction of the cost.
  <br>
  <br>
  But a number of countries have questioned DeepSeek's storage of user data.
  <br>
  <br>
  Seoul's Personal Information Protection Commission said DeepSeek would no longer be available for download until a review of its personal data collection practices was carried out.
  <br>
  <br>
  DeepSeek has "acknowledged that considerations for domestic privacy laws were somewhat lacking", the data protection agency said.
  <br>
  <br>
  It assessed that bringing the app into line with local privacy laws "would inevitably take a significant amount of time", the agency added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "To prevent further concerns from spreading, the commission recommended that DeepSeek temporarily suspend its service while making the necessary improvements," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  DeepSeek has "accepted" that proposal, it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Industry experts have said the Hangzhou-based firm has embraced a more accessible, opensource approach towards AI development, fostering collaboration and experimentation that could lead to faster breakthroughs.
  <br>
  <br>
  They also said the firm has unveiled large language models challenging the dominate tools developing by its US rivals, but at a lower cost. (AFP & agencies)

    'Improve transparency for bring your own cup schemes'

<img alt="The council found that tea shops tend to provide more information about BYOC schemes than other types of beverage stores. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1791983_1_20250217171151.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Consumer Council has urged beverage shops to enhance their training for staff on bring-your-own-cup (BYOC) policies, adding there was a lack of transparency about such schemes.
 <br>
  <br>
  Additionally, it also saw cases where paper cups were used to make drinks even when customers brought their own cups, which failed to reduce waste.
  <br>
  <br>
  The consumer watchdog on Monday said it had sent staff undercover to conduct BYOC trials at 20 beverage shops.
  <br>
  <br>
  BYOC refers to schemes by drink shops, ranging from coffee shops to hand-shaken beverage shops, which encourage customers to bring their own cups instead of using plastic or paper ones in order to save waste.
  <br>
  <br>
  Often, this is accompanied by incentives such as a five dollar discount.
  <br>
  <br>
  Consumer Council CEO Gilly Wong said one problem was shops' inability to properly provide relevant information.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If you just simply say small, tall, may be standard, normal or similar words to describe the size of your drinks, but unfortunately you haven't provided exact size... then it's very hard for people to follow," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  She added that often customers do not know such a scheme exists since it is not consistently displayed, appearing in small letters at the bottom of the poster.
  <br>
  <br>
  Moreover, problems also arise when staff are not be properly trained, leading to misunderstandings.
  <br>
  <br>
  "From our findings, there are a couple of times that the shop staff didn't know such offer [existed] and said they didn't have the offer, or missed the discount."
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong suggested that merchants look into the details of their workflow to ensure the minimisation of waste and to better display their schemes.

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping on Monday called for efforts to promote the healthy and high-quality development of China's private sector.
 <br>
  <br>
  He made the remarks when attending a symposium on private enterprises.
  <br>
  <br>
  President Xi said the private sector enjoys broad prospects and great potential on the new journey in the new era, and it is a prime time for private enterprises and entrepreneurs to give full play to their capabilities.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also called for efforts to reach consensus and firming up confidence, to promote the healthy and high-quality development of the private sector.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We hope that all private enterprises and private entrepreneurs will have the ambition to serve the country, strive for development, operate in accordance with the law and promote common prosperity, so as to make new and greater contributions to promoting Chinese-style modernisation," Xi said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that policies regarding the private sector would not change.
  <br>
  <br>
  The president delivered the speech after listening to representatives of private companies at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Premier Li Qiang and Vice Premier Ding Xuexiang were among those attending the symposium, which was presided over by Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference chairman Wang Huning.
  <br>
  <br>
  Reuters reported on Friday, citing sources, that Xi planned to chair a symposium to boost private sector sentiment, a meeting which would be attended by the country's business leaders, including Alibaba co-founder Jack Ma.
  <br>
  <br>
  The symposium would be aimed at boosting private-sector sentiment, and Xi was expected to encourage company chiefs to expand their businesses domestically and internationally.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi first chaired a high-profile symposium for the private sector in 2018. At the time, he pledged tax cuts and a level playing field while reaffirming that private firms would have access to financial backing.
  <br>
  <br>
  The symposium also comes as DeepSeek's AI platform has triggered investor speculation about its potential to buoy China's broader tech sector, leading to calls for an upward repricing of Chinese assets. (Xinhua & agencies)

<img alt="Singapore's Workers' Party Chief Pritam Singh walks outside the State Courts in Singapore. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1791965_1_20250217140348.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Singapore's opposition leader was fined on Monday for lying to parliament while helping a fellow party member cover up a false witness account, but narrowly avoided being barred from contesting upcoming national elections.
 <br>
  <br>
  Pritam Singh, 48, secretary-general of the Workers' Party, was found guilty on two counts of lying to a parliamentary committee probing a fellow MP.
  <br>
  <br>
  The conviction comes as the Southeast Asian nation's political opposition seeks to challenge the dominance of the ruling People's Action Party (PAP) in elections expected within months.
  <br>
  <br>
  The PAP has ruled Singapore since 1959.
  <br>
  <br>
  District court judge Luke Tan said that contrary to what he told the committee, Singh had not done enough to get rookie MP Raeesah Khan to admit to her lie in parliament.
  <br>
  <br>
  The judge also gave credence to Khan's testimony that Singh had told her during a meeting to "take the lie to the grave."
  <br>
  <br>
  Singh told reporters outside court that based on "advice I have and that I've been given, I will be running for the general elections."
  <br>
  <br>
  "I have been advised that the law is quite clear," he said, adding he understood the elections department would release a statement later.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's not going to be an easy election... we'll have to fight hard, and that's what we will do."
  <br>
  <br>
  Singh, who said he would appeal the court's decision, was fined Sg$7,000 for each charge.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The path of choosing opposition politics is not for the faint hearted," Singh said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under the constitution, a person fined a minimum of Sg$10,000 (US$7,400) or jailed for at least one year, is disqualified from running for election or holding a parliamentary seat for five years.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He will not be disqualified as the threshold of $10,000 fine per charge is not crossed. You can't stack up the fines," Eugene Tan, who teaches constitutional law at Singapore Management University, told reporters. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Consumer Council on Monday said around 75 percent of nappy cream samples it tested contained fragrances or chemicals that can cause irritation or allergic reactions.
 <br>
  <br>
  The watchdog tested 16 nappy creams priced from HK$52 to HK$218.
  <br>
  <br>
  Most of them claimed to be suitable for use on infants, with three types also suitable for adults or the elderly who need to wear adult diapers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Seven samples contained fragrances.
  <br>
  <br>
  Most of them had one or two types of fragrant substances, but Weleda baby's sample had six types.
  <br>
  <br>
  Essential oils or plant extracts were found in four samples, including the aromatic compound terpenes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The European medicines regulatory body has warned that terpenes can cause adverse neurologic effects such as twitches in babies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two samples, a diaper rash cream from Baby Sebamed, and QV baby’s nappy cream, contain preservatives restricted in the United States and France.
  <br>
  <br>
  The council said those ingredients may worsen diaper rashes or cause allergenic reactions like dermatitis.
  <br>
  <br>
  “If nappy creams contain ingredients of concern, they are more likely to irritate the skin, pose allergy risks or may even cause adverse neurologic effects,” said chairman of the council’s committee on research and testing Chung Chi-yung.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Infants, having thinner skin and a higher body surface area-to-body weight ratio, are particularly susceptible to allergic reactions,” he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The council urged manufacturers to improve their labelling by listing all ingredients clearly, including their concentrations.
  <br>
  <br>
  They should also pay attention to the latest international regulations to improve product formulations.
  <br>
  <br>
  The watchdog also hoped local regulatory bodies would establish regulations on the safety and labelling of nappy creams.

    Over 5,000 people flock to Ocean Park for panda twins

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 More than 5,000 people flocked to Ocean Park for the panda twins' debut, its chairman revealed on Monday, saying the figures fell within expectations.
 <br>
  <br>
  Paulo Pong said that dozens of people arrived at the park gates at 6am, four hours before the start of public viewings.
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted entry to facility was smooth as several drills had been conducted earlier.
  <br>
  <br>
  The turnout marked a daily record high at the Giant Panda Adventure exhibition zone, Pong said, with a majority of them being locals.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This included annual pass holders, who are devoted fans of pandas. There were also visitors from around the world and the mainland, including Chengdu. Many people from foreign countries, like Southeast Asia, or even Europe and America, came to see the pandas," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Some of the tourists actually didn't know about the twins when they arrived at Ocean Park, but when they heard they could visit the cubs, they also queued to meet them."
  <br>
  <br>
  Public viewing of the twins, whom Ying Ying gave birth to last August, is for five hours daily – from 10am to 3pm.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Pong said visiting hours could be extended.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When they're more adapted to meeting the public, or even when they can be in the same exhibition zone with Ying Ying, then we can gradually extend the duration."
  <br>
  <br>
  He said Ocean Park received hundreds of applications for the HK$1,500 VIP session to meet the cubs for 30 minutes before the park opens each day.
  <br>
  <br>
  The first session will be held on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pong emphasised that income generated from the special tour would be used for its conservation fund after deducting expenses.

    Team Shaq wins NBA All-Star revamp as James sits out

<img alt="Team Shaq’s OGs celebrate after winning the 2025 NBA All-Star match in San Francisco. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1791953_1_20250217121940.jpg&q=70">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Shaq's OGs won the first All-Star mini-tournament in NBA history, getting 15 points from Tatum and 12 from Stephen Curry to beat Chuck's Global Stars 41-25 in the final.
 <br>
  <br>
  It was over early, as the Global Stars started the title game 0 for 10 from the field, 0 for 6 from 3-point range and fell into a quick 11-0 hole.
  <br>
  <br>
  Victor Wembanyama – the first-time All-Star who vowed that he would play hard, and did – led the Global Stars with 11 points in the final.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was the debut of the All-Star mini-tournament format – four teams, three games, with only 40 points needed to end each contest.
  <br>
  <br>
  The league went to the tournament format of untimed, short games with hopes that asking All-Stars to play fewer minutes would lead to better competition.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last year’s game in Indianapolis had a 211-186 final score, setting a slew of records but prompting the league to take action after years of urging players to take the exhibition a bit more seriously.
  <br>
  <br>
  The first two-shot foul of the night came early in the title game, with Nikola Jokic missing both shots.
  <br>
  <br>
  Team Shaq's win came on the heels of Los Angeles Lakers star LeBron James' annoucement of his withdrawal from the game prior to tip-off, citing a nagging ankle and foot injury.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You will not see anything from me tonight," James, 40, said. "Unfortunately I will not be in uniform tonight."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Still dealing with ankle and foot discomfort, so I will not be playing tonight, unfortunately," he added. "You know I hate that. But I'm looking forward to seeing the format." (AP/AFP)

    UK ready to send troops to Ukraine: Starmer

<img alt="British Prime Minister Keir Starmer says the UK could send troops to Ukraine as part of a peacekeeping force. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1791944_1_20250217111813.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said he was ready to send UK troops to Ukraine as part of any postwar peacekeeping force as he tried to show the US that European nations should have a role in the talks on ending the conflict.
 <br>
  <br>
  Starmer said he had not taken the decision to consider putting British servicemen and women "in harm's way" lightly, but securing a lasting peace in Ukraine was essential to deter further aggression.
  <br>
  <br>
  US Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Sunday said Ukraine and Europe would be part of any "real negotiations" to end Moscow's war, signalling that US talks with Russia this week were a chance to see how serious Putin is about peace.
  <br>
  <br>
  The end of Russia's war with Ukraine "when it comes, cannot merely become a temporary pause before Putin attacks again," Starmer wrote in the Daily Telegraph newspaper.
  <br>
  <br>
  Starmer's comments were the first time he has explicitly said he is considering deploying British peacekeepers to Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  He has previously said that Britain was willing to help play a part in any peace deal that is negotiated.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the article, Starmer said he was prepared to contribute to security guarantees to Ukraine by "putting our own troops on the ground if necessary".
  <br>
  <br>
  "I do not say that lightly," he wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I feel very deeply the responsibility that comes with potentially putting British servicemen and women in harm's way."
  <br>
  <br>
  Starmer is expected to join German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk, Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and other European leaders in Paris on Monday after French President Emmanuel Macron convened talks on Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  US President Donald Trump stunned European allies in Nato and Ukraine last week when he announced he had held a call with Putin without consulting them and would start a peace process.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's Ukraine envoy, Keith Kellogg, then suggested Ukraine and other European leaders would have no place at peace negotiations.
  <br>
  <br>
  US and Russian officials are expected to meet in Saudi Arabia in the coming days to start talks aimed at ending Russia's nearly three-year war in Ukraine. (Reuters)

    'Conclave' and 'Brutalist' share Bafta honours

<img alt='The cast and crew of "Conclave" pose for a picture after the movie won the Best Film award at the 2025 Bafta awards. Photo: Reuters' src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1791943_1_20250217110853.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Papal thriller "Conclave" and immigrant epic "The Brutalist" on Sunday tied for top honours at Britain's Bafta awards with each film picking up four coveted gongs.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Conclave", directed by German-born Edward Berger, won the Bafta for the best film with its tale of the intrigue and horse-trading behind the scenes during the election of a new pope.
  <br>
  <br>
  Accepting the award, Berger recalled the journey to make the film took seven years, paying tribute to British screenplay writer Peter Straughan's "wonderful script" and lead actor Ralph Fiennes.
  <br>
  <br>
  US filmmaker Brady Corbet took the Bafta for best director for "The Brutalist", while leading man Adrien Brody scooped up the best actor gong for his portrayal of a Hungarian Holocaust survivor and architect who emigrates to the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brody told a winners press conference that the film was "an opportunity for me to honour my own ancestral struggles".
  <br>
  <br>
  In "a film that speaks to tremendous cruelty and despicable behaviour in our past... we see elements existing today that can guide us and remind us of that," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Veteran British actor Fiennes, who played a cardinal in "Conclave", once again saw his hopes of winning a Bafta gong dashed, losing out to Brody in the race for the honour.
  <br>
  <br>
  Scandal-hit "Emilia Perez", a surreal musical about a Mexican druglord who transitions to a woman, had been heavily favoured at the beginning of the year. But it ended the evening with just two Baftas, including one for Zoe Saldana for best supporting actress.
  <br>
  <br>
  Until last month, French director Jacques Audiard's movie had been expected to be a frontrunner having won 11 nominations.
  <br>
  <br>
  But old racist and Islamophobic tweets by lead actor Karla Sofia Gascon surfaced at the end of January, shaking up the race just before the London ceremony and the Oscars on March 2.
  <br>
  <br>
  A surprise of the night was the Bafta for best actress which went to 25-year-old Mikey Madison for her portrayal of a sex worker in the black comedy "Anora" about an erotic dancer's whirlwind romance gone wrong.
  <br>
  <br>
  Madison, who beat out frontrunner Demi Moore, told reporters she wanted to dedicate the award to "the sex worker community, I see you, you deserve respect and human dignity". (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 India's capital New Delhi was jolted awake on Monday by powerful tremors from a magnitude 4.0 earthquake, with its epicentre on the edge of the sprawling megacity an hour before dawn.
 <br>
  <br>
  There were no immediate reports of major damage, but terrified residents rushed outside as buildings shook.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US Geological Survey said the quake struck at a shallow depth of 10 kilometres.
  <br>
  <br>
  Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi urged people to follow "safety precautions" and stay alert to "possible aftershocks".
  <br>
  <br>
  "Tremors were felt in Delhi and nearby areas. Urging everyone to stay calm and follow safety precautions, staying alert for possible aftershocks. Authorities are keeping a close watch on the situation," Modi said in a post on social media platform X.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police issued an emergency number to call for help, saying: "We hope you all are safe, Delhi."
  <br>
  <br>
  Northern India lies on a major geological faultline where the Indian tectonic plate pushes up into the Eurasian plate, forming the Himalayas, and earthquakes are a regular occurrence. (AFP)

<img alt="Honourees of the Outstanding Asian American Women Who Dared gala say the event comes at a crucial time, as US President Donald Trump aggressively moves to stamp out diversity, equity and inclusiveness. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1791931_1_20250217101545.jpg&q=40">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A special event in the United States has been shining a spotlight on the achievements of Asian American women, in areas ranging from academics to sports.
 <br>
  <br>
  The awards gala for the Outstanding Asian American Women Who Dared – held in the heart of California’s Silicon Valley on February 13 – recognised 12 people, who said the event comes at a crucial time, especially with US President Donald Trump aggressively moving to stamp out traces of diversity, equity and inclusiveness.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We’re entering a very special era in history, and it just makes us have to really step in and step up and work harder,” honouree Liu Xin – the founder of the Enlight Foundation, which focuses on education equality and helping youth engage in developing climate solutions – said.
  <br>
  <br>
  A presenter at the show, Fiona Ma, is the first Asian American Woman to be elected treasurer of California.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It’s been very difficult for me being an Asian woman moving up the ranks and politics. And, you know, tonight is about recognising other trailblazers and people who are really making a mark.”
  <br>
  <br>
  And one of those making a mark is Sue Xu, the managing partner of venture capital firm Amino Capital.
  <br>
  <br>
  She has contributed to the success of at least 45 companies with a total value of more than US$100 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  She has also addressed the United Nations about the role of artificial intelligence in combatting human trafficking and promoting the welfare of women.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I feel like, woman's voice hasn’t been heard. Especially nowadays, when you're talking about DeepSeek, talking about AI. And then I feel like a lot of times woman is victims of AI. And then, you know, South Korea, they just passed that out, criminalising possession for, you know, deep-fake pornography. I feel like as a woman, if we lead with responsibility, we have a chance,” Xu said.
  <br>
  <br>
  While many of the honourees stem from the world of business and technology, artists were celebrated too.
  <br>
  <br>
  Honouree Chen Jiebing is one of the foremost erhu virtuosos in the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Shanghai native has been nominated for a Grammy and recently had the honour of Nasa using her music to celebrate its 60th anniversary.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I want the world to see and hear the unique vocal expressions of this instrument and it’s versatility to incorporate with other Western styles of music such as jazz, and even American Blue Grass country style music.
  <br>
  <br>
  Like all the honourees, Chen has daring goals. Hers is to someday elevate the erhu to be as widely recognised worldwide as the violin.

<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump said on Sunday that he could meet "very soon" with Vladimir Putin, adding he believes his Russian counterpart genuinely wants to stop fighting in Ukraine.
 <br>
  <br>
  "No time set, but it could be very soon," Trump told reporters, hours after Secretary of State Marco Rubio sought to play down expectations of upcoming high-level talks in Riyadh on ending the war.
  <br>
  <br>
  With Rubio set to lead a high-level American delegation at the discussions with Russian officials in Saudi Arabia's capital in the coming days, a flurry of diplomacy was taking place as the Ukraine war nears its third anniversary.

  <br>
  Trump, addressing reporters after a flight on Air Force One, said his team had been speaking "long and hard" with Russian officials, including his Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff whom the president said met with Putin for about three hours recently.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think he wants to stop fighting," Trump said of Putin.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked whether he believes Putin wants to seize the entirety of Ukraine, Trump said: "That was my question to him.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If he's going to go on... that would have caused me a big problem," Trump added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think he wants to end it, and they want to end it fast. Both of them," he said, adding "Zelensky wants to end it too."
  <br>
  <br>
  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky meanwhile said Sunday he believed Russia was preparing to "wage war" against a weakened NATO should Trump dilute US support for the alliance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump appeared to dismiss Zelensky's remarks, telling reporters he was "not even a little bit" concerned about the Ukrainian leader's messaging.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rubio is set to lead a high-level US team to Riyadh, but it remains unclear whether there will be any Ukrainian participation. Rubio said he wasn't even sure who Moscow was sending. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu presented a united front on Sunday against their common enemies, threatening to "open the gates of hell" on Hamas and "finish the job" against Iran.
 <br>
  <br>
  The pledges came during a joint address to reporters in Jerusalem, where Rubio began his first Middle East trip as Secretary of State in President Donald Trump's new administration.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hamas cannot continue as a military or a government force... they must be eliminated," Rubio said of the Palestinian Islamist group.
  <br>
  <br>
  The comment came a day after Hamas freed three Israeli hostages in exchange for 369 Palestinian prisoners, the sixth such swap under the ceasefire deal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel and Hamas have traded accusations of ceasefire violations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Adding to strain on the deal, Trump has made a widely-condemned proposal to take control of Gaza and relocate its more than two million residents.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thanking Rubio for "unequivocal backing" for Israel's policy in Gaza, Netanyahu added that Israel and the United States are determined to thwart Iran's nuclear ambitions and its "aggression" in the Middle East.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Israel and America stand shoulder to shoulder in countering the threat of Iran," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We agreed that the ayatollahs must not have nuclear weapons and also agreed that Iran's aggression in the region must be rolled back."
  <br>
  <br>
  Israeli-Iranian enmity stretches back decades through a history of clandestine wars and attacks by land, sea, air and cyberspace.
  <br>
  <br>

<img alt="Brazil's Joao Fonseca celebrates with the trophy after winning the ATP 250 Argentina Open. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1791911_1_20250217070810.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Brazilian teenager Joao Fonseca became the 10th youngest champion in ATP Tour history when he swept past home hope Francisco Cerundolo in the final of the Argentina Open.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 18-year-old, ranked 99 in the world and playing in his first tour-level final, came through 6-4, 7-6 (7/1) against his 28th-ranked opponent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fonseca twice unsuccessfully served for the match but regrouped to claim victory in the tie-break in a frenzied atmosphere in Buenos Aires.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 2024 ATP NextGen champion is the youngest male player from South America to win a tour title while his victory will also see him rise to 68 when the new rankings are released on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Unbelievable week, even in Argentina there are some Brazilians cheering for me," Fonseca said on court.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That's just amazing. Every Brazilian, everyone from their country wants this support from your own country. For me, this moment that I'm living is just unbelievable," he added. "Of course I want to be number one, of course I want to win Slams, titles, but my dream is just to play tennis, and I'm living it."
  <br>
  <br>
  Cerundolo, seeking his fourth career title, was broken in the seventh game of the first set and fought off Fonseca when the teenager served for the trophy at 5-4 and 6-5 in the second.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the Brazilian impressively held his nerve in the tie-break and celebrated his triumph by collapsing in joy on the dusty, clay surface.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fonseca made his maiden final the hard way – in Friday's quarter-finals he saved two match points to defeat Mariano Navone in a match six minutes shy of three hours.
  <br>
  <br>
  In all, he defeated four Argentinian players on the road to the trophy.
  <br>
  <br>
  He had already announced himself on the scene in January when he came through qualifying at the Australian Open and defeated top 10 player Andrey Rublev in the first round. (AFP)

<img alt="Whitney is now under close monitoring and the following 24 hours will be a critical period. File photo courtesy of Hong Kong Children's Hospital" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1791909_1_20250217062943.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Health authorities said on Monday that thanks to a cross-border organ donation, an eight-month-old girl underwent a successful heart transplant on Sunday night.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, Secretary for Health, Lo Chung-mau, noted that it was the second such case of cross-boundary organ donation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "After a then four-month-old baby girl, Tsz-hei, successfully received a heart donation from the mainland in December 2022 to extend her life, Hong Kong and the mainland established a close communication channel and procedures for cross-boundary organ transplant co-operation based on that successful experience," said Professor Lo.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said more than 100 personnel from 18 mainland authorities worked together and raced against time to ensure the safe and smooth transportation of the organ across multiple locations.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Health Bureau and the Hospital Authority said the heart transplant was successfully completed for baby, Whitney, at the Hong Kong Children's Hospital.
  <br>
  <br>
  Consultant in-charge of the Cardiothoracic Surgery of HKCH, Dr Nicholson Yam - who was in charge of the transplant - said the operation lasted approximately 6.5 hours. The statement said Whitney was now under close monitoring in the Intensive Care Unit and the following 24 hours would be a critical period.
  <br>
  <br>
  Whitney's parents expressed their gratitude to the medical teams and to the different regional authorities in finding a suitable heart, as well as thanking the donor's family for their difficult and selfless decision, giving Whitney the chance for a new life.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Director of Cluster Services of the HA, Dr Simon Tang, said all efforts had been made through different networks to identify a suitable heart for Whitney amid the difficulties involved.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Since there was no suitable recipient in the mainland, the mainland decided to send the donor heart to Hong Kong for transplanting to Whitney upon confirmation by experts from the two places that the heart was suitable for Whitney's transplantation," Dr Tang added.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Liverpool moved seven points clear at the top of the Premier League as Luis Díaz ended his goal drought to spark a tense 2-1 win against struggling Wolves.
 <br>
  <br>
  Arne Slot's side got back on track after an unexpectedly poor week thanks to Díaz's first goal in 2025 and yet another Mohamed Salah strike.
  <br>
  <br>
  Díaz opened the scoring early in the first half at Anfield as the Colombian forward finally scored for the 13th time this term after 10 games without a goal.
  <br>
  <br>
  While Díaz has struggled to find the net, Salah is in red-hot form and his penalty before the interval took the Egypt star to 28 goals in all competitions this season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Matheus Cunha netted in the second half for fourth-bottom Wolves, but although Liverpool looked tired in a disjointed, nervous, climax, they held on for a valuable victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool had gone two games without a win – an embarrassing FA Cup fourth round loss at second tier Plymouth last weekend and the stormy 2-2 draw at Everton on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal's 2-0 win at Leicester on Saturday had applied a little more pressure on Liverpool.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Reds responded to Arsenal's challenge as they moved a step closer to a record-equalling 20th English title.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool, who last won the Premier League in 2020, will be within touching distance of the crown if they take maximum points from trips to Aston Villa and Manchester City before hosting Newcastle over the course of the next 10 days.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool boss Slot was in the dug-out despite being charged with abusive behaviour after angrily approaching referee Michael Oliver on the pitch following the Merseyside derby.
  <br>
  <br>
  Slot was furious that James Tarkowski's stoppage-time equaliser was not disallowed because of a possible push by Toffees striker Beto on Reds defender Ibrahima Konate.
  <br>
  <br>
  Slot had urged Liverpool to use their "anger" from the painful end to the Everton game as fuel to get back on track against Wolves.
  <br>
  <br>
  They didn't have to wait long to light the fuse as Díaz bagged his first league goal at Anfield since September.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Tottenham won the battle of the Premier League's underachievers 1-0 to inflict another dismal result on Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim.
  <br>
  <br>
  James Maddison scored the only goal on 13 minutes as Spurs moved above United in the table into 12th thanks to a third win over the Red Devils this season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Victory eased the pressure on under-fire Tottenham boss Ange Postecoglou after exiting both domestic cup competitions this month to go with their lowly league position.
  <br>
  <br>
  United now find themselves down in 15th, but do enjoy a 12-point cushion over the bottom three.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The place in the table is my worry, I am not worried about me," said Amorim, who has won just four of 14 Premier League games since taking charge in November.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I hate to lose. That feeling is the worst. The rest I am not thinking about," he added. "I understand my situation, my job, I am confident in my work and I just want to win games."
  <br>
  <br>
  Tottenham's first home league win since November came amid a spirit of revolt among their support.
  <br>
  <br>
  Before kick-off and after the match Spurs fans again vented their frustration towards owners ENIC and chairman Daniel Levy.
  <br>
  <br>
  A huge banner read "24 years, 16 managers, 1 trophy – time for change" as a sizeable contingent of the home crowd joined a protest calling for Levy to go.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the mood for Postecoglou was lifted even before kick-off as he was able to welcome back a host of first-team regulars who have been sidelined by injury. (AFP)

 Over 50,000 civil servants and members of the public took part in a stress test at the Kai Tak Sports Park on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The aim was to assess the park's readiness ahead of its official opening at the beginning of next month.
  <br>
  <br>
  The exercise also looked into the performance of the Easy Leave platform. It uses artificial intelligence to analyse real-time data on crowd density and the time needed for people to follow an exit route.
