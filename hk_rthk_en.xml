<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping headed to Peru on Wednesday, bound for a meeting of Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) organisation leaders overshadowed by fears of renewed global trade tensions under US President-elect Donald Trump.
 <br>
  <br>
  Xi will join leaders from the United States and other Asia-Pacific nations in the Peruvian capital Lima for the Apec gathering, after which he will go to Brazil for a G20 summit.
  <br>
  <br>
  While in Peru, Xi will also inaugurate South America's first Chinese-funded port, in Chancay, around 80 kilometres north of Lima.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Chancay port will also serve Chile, Colombia and Ecuador, among other South American countries, allowing them to skirt ports in Mexico and the United States for trade with Asia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Starting on Wednesday, Lima will receive government ministers and business leaders of Apec member countries, which also include Russia, Japan, South Korea, Indonesia, Chile and Australia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ministerial meetings will take place on Thursday, followed by talks at the level of heads of state the following two days. (AFP)

    Trump names Musk to 'efficiency' post

<img alt="Donald Trump has picked tech tycoon Elon Musk to cut down on government waste and improve efficiency. File photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1778826_1_20241113124113.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President-elect Donald Trump announced on Tuesday that the world's richest man, Elon Musk, will lead a new government efficiency group tasked with cutting federal waste, as the Republican added a series of seasoned figures and hardliners to his incoming administration.
 <br>
  <br>
  Musk became a key ally to Trump during his campaign, reportedly spending over US$100 million to help the former president and repeatedly boosting Trump's candidacy on X, the social media platform he owns.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said Musk and another stalwart ally, businessman Vivek Ramaswamy, would lead a "Department of Government Efficiency ('DOGE')" a tongue-in-cheek reference to an internet meme and cryptocurrency.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Together, these two wonderful Americans will pave the way for my Administration to dismantle Government Bureaucracy, slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures, and restructure Federal Agencies," Trump said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the department "will provide advice and guidance from outside of Government," a move that could allow Musk to avoid disclosing his financial holdings.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a post on X, Musk said the department's actions will be published online "for maximum transparency" and will include a "leaderboard for most insanely dumb spending of your tax dollars."
  <br>
  <br>
  "This will be both extremely tragic and extremely entertaining," Musk wrote. (AFP)

    National Games test events to begin this month

<img alt="Yeung Tak-keung says test events for the National Games will be held in the coming months. Photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1778815_1_20241113110236.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Test events for next year's National Games will get underway in Hong Kong this month, a government official said on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong will co-host the Games for the first time next November, alongside Guangdong and Macau.
  <br>
  <br>
  The eight competitive events to take place in the SAR are fencing, track cycling, rugby sevens, golf, triathlon, beach volleyball, men's handball and men's under-22 basketball.
  <br>
  <br>
  Additionally, Hong Kong will help organise cross-border events, including a marathon and road cycling competition.
  <br>
  <br>
  In an exclusive interview with RTHK, the head of the National Games Coordination Office, Yeung Tak-keung, said each competitive event must have a trial  six to 12 months beforehand.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For example, a test event will be held at Fanling golf course this month. Since many major tournaments have taken place there before, we’re quite familiar with the venue. However, we need to consider whether there are any differences in requirements between the Hong Kong Open and other large tournaments compared to the National Games. We’ll focus on any adjustments that need to be made during the November test event," Yeung said.
  <br>
  <br>
  A test event for the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau road cycling race will be held on November 24, although Yeung said most trials will take place between January and May next year, including handball and fencing at Kai Tak Sports Park, beach volleyball at Victoria Park and the triathlon along the Central promenade.
  <br>
  <br>
  The former sports commissioner said officials will work with counterparts in Guangdong and Macau on back-up plans in case of extreme weather conditions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The outdoor competitions will likely face a bigger impact from bad weather. For example, the triathlon involves swimming, cycling, and running, so if the weather is poor, we may need an alternative date. Also, the cross-border road bicycle race is lengthy and passes through some windy spots, so we need to think about these weather conditions and have back-up options ready," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  In terms of the accommodation arrangements for the thousands of athletes and journalists expected to come to the SAR, Yeung said due to the Games' "simple" concept, there will not be an athletes' village.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he stressed there will be enough hotel rooms for everyone.
  <br>
  <br>
  Over 32,000 people from Hong Kong have signed up to be volunteers at the Games, far beyond the original target of 10,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeung said he was surprised by the response and noted that those selected through interviews will receive training next year and will be assigned different roles, including at competition venues, hotels and border crossings.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping's special representative at the United Nations climate summit has called for a strengthening of early warning systems and enhancing climate adaptation capacity.
 <br>
  <br>
  Vice Premier Ding Xuexiang was addressing a high-level meeting held by China on Tuesday, during COP29 in Baku, Azerbaijan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ding said China attached great importance to international cooperation on meteorological early warnings and that President Xi had made specific requirements on this issue.
  <br>
  <br>
  During the meeting, Ding proposed three points, including standardising climate risk assessments, building a global early warning network by sharing technology and enhancing interconnectivity, and establishing a climate adaptation partnership.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said China would develop a South-South cooperation flagship project for early warning in response to climate change, and support developing countries with meteorological observation equipment, early warning systems, and training.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere at the summit, scientists said global carbon dioxide emissions, including those from burning fossil fuels, would hit a record high this year, pulling the world further off course from averting more destructive climate extremes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Global Carbon Budget report, published during the climate summit, said global CO2 emissions are set to total 41.6 billion metric tons in 2024, up from 40.6 billion tons last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The report forecast that emissions in China would marginally increase by 0.2 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The report's authors said China's emissions from oil use have likely peaked, as electric vehicles gain market share. (Agencies)

    T3 to be issued 2.40pm as Toraji is expected to weaken

<img alt="The Observatory says Toraji is expected to be closest to Hong Kong on Thursday morning. Image courtesy: HKO" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1778806_2_20241113102954.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Observatory (HKO) says it will issue a T3 storm signal at 2.40pm on Wednesday, and will have to wait and see whether a higher storm signal is needed later as tropical storm Toraji shows signs of weakening as it approaches Hong Kong
 <br>
  <br>
  As of 1pm, the storm was around 260 kilometres southeast of Hong Kong and is expected to pass some 200 kilometres to the south of the territory on Thursday morning.
  <br>
  <br>
  Senior Scientific Officer Lee Shuk-ming from the Observatory, says whether or not a higher storm signal is needed depends on Toraji's intensity.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Right now, Toraji has adopted a west-northwesterly track. It will gradually edge closer to places with a cooler sea temperature. This will also cause its intensity to weaken," she told a radio programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  "On the other hand, we expect Toraji's vertical wind-shear to strengthen, which at the same time might cause Toraji to weaken when it edges closer to Hong Kong."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Observatory said the outer rain bands of the storm are affecting the coast of Guangdong, and local winds are expected to strengthen gradually on Wednesday afternoon, as the effects of the approaching combine with the northeast monsoon.
  <br>
  <br>
  It advised people to stay away from the shoreline as seas are rough with swells.

    Judge delays ruling in Trump's hush money case

<img alt="Donald Trump was found guilty in May of of falsifying business records to conceal money paid to silence adult film star Stormy Daniels. File photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1778799_2_20241113102116.jpg&q=45">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lawyers for incoming US president Donald Trump have asked a New York judge to throw out convictions relating to hush money payments made to an adult film star. He was due to be sentenced in New York this month.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Department of Justice has already dropped two outstanding criminal investigations into the former president, one relating to his alleged efforts to subvert the outcome of the last election and the other regarding his alleged mishandling of classified documents.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the criminal case in New York, where Trump has already been convicted of fraud in connection with the payments made to Stormy Daniels, is outside the purview of the federal government.
  <br>
  <br>
  New York commuters on Tuesday morning were split over whether sentencing in the case should be scrapped.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I don’t think anybody should be above the law. I mean, I don’t care who you are," one man said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another male commuter disagreed, saying, “the financial crime case is a joke. Regardless of who the President is, they need to have some immunity to do their jobs."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump was not in office when he made the payments to Stormy Daniels. But his lawyers are arguing that because he is poised to return to the Oval Office, any sentencing in the case could create an impediment to his ability to carry out his duties.
  <br>
  <br>
  This comes as the US Senate's Democratic majority moves to confirm as many new federal judges nominated by President Biden as possible to avoid leaving vacancies that Trump could fill after taking office on January 20.
  <br>
  <br>
  With Republicans set to take control of the chamber on January 3, the Senate on Tuesday voted in favour of former prosecutor April Perry becoming a district court judge in Illinois.
  <br>
  <br>
  Biden has announced another 30 judicial nominees who are awaiting Senate confirmation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump made 234 judicial appointments during his first four years in office, the second most of any president in a single term, and moved the judiciary rightward - including building a 6-3 conservative majority on the US Supreme Court with three appointees.
  <br>
  <br>
  Biden has appointed a host of liberal judges, including Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson. (Additional reporting by Reuters)

    Sinner downs Fritz to close in on ATP Finals last four

<img alt="Sinner after winning his group stage match against Taylor Fritz in the ATP Finals. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1778789_1_20241113084313.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Jannik Sinner hit the accelerator at the end of each set as he cruised past Taylor Fritz 6-4, 6-4 on Tuesday to close in on a semi-final spot at the ATP Finals in Turin.
 <br>
  <br>
  In September, Sinner had to overcome raucous home support to win his last meeting with the American as he claimed victory in the final of the US Open, also in straight sets. This time, the Turin crowd was nosily behind the Italian.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The crowd is helping me a lot," said Sinner on the court.
  <br>
  <br>
  The hard-hitting Fritz, ranked number five, put pressure on Sinner's serve early in the first set. The American had the first break point of the match in the 14-minute seventh game, but could not take his chance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sinner responded at once, but wasted three break points in the next game before breaking to 15 in the 10th game to take the set.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I was struggling to return his serve but I am happy with how I handled the situation," said Sinner.
  <br>
  <br>
  The second set also went with serve until the 10th game when Fritz double-faulted on Sinner's first match point.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was a very tough match," said Sinner. "We got to know each other very well in a Grand Slam final, we knew exactly what to expect today it was very aggressive as I was prepared for."
  <br>
  <br>
  Victory put Sinner top of the Ilie Nastase group with just Daniil Medvedev to face. The home favourite could still be eliminated with a straight-sets loss.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fritz faces Alex de Minaur who has lost both his matches so far.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the afternoon match, former champion Medvedev brushed aside Finals debutant De Minaur 6-2, 6-4 to bounce back from an opening defeat and boost his hopes of making the knock-out phase.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Russian, who lost his first group-stage match to Fritz, overpowered De Minaur to push his Australian opponent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Medvedev, who lifted the title in 2020, did not face a single break point and broke De Minaur's serve three times.
  <br>
  <br>
  The fourth seed will next face Sinner on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I decided not to care about it in a good way," Medvedev said. "If I lose, the season is over, if I win I have another chance on Thursday – I'll try and do the same the next match, so I don't care."
  <br>
  <br>
  Both players battled to holds in their opening service games, but Medvedev broke for a 2-1 lead and never looked back.
  <br>
  <br>
  He struck 16 winners in the first set and then lost just two points behind his serve in the second.
  <br>
  <br>
  A break in the ninth game of the second set proved decisive and he closed out victory with another comfortable hold. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Formula 1's race director Niels Wittich has left his role with immediate effect, the FIA said on Tuesday, in a surprise move.
 <br>
  <br>
  The German, who replaced Michael Masi in 2022, will be replaced for the Las Vegas Grand Prix on November 23 by Rui Marques, who was recently the race director for Formula 2 and 3.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The FIA can confirm that Niels Wittich has stepped down from his position as F1 Race Director to pursue new opportunities," the FIA said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is extremely rare for an F1 race director to be changed mid-season, but the FIA did not elaborate on the reasons for his departure.
  <br>
  <br>
  Masi was removed as Formula One race director after his controversial management of the season-ending 2021 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, where Max Verstappen pipped Lewis Hamilton to the title.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is not clear if Wittich is the latest victim of a disagreement with FIA president Mohammed Ben Sulayem.
  <br>
  <br>
  A number of staff in senior FIA roles have resigned this year. (AFP)

<img alt="Barcelona players celebrate scoring their second goal against St. Poelten. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1778786_1_20241113082111.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A five-goal blitz in the space of 12 minutes sent Barcelona on their way to a 7-0 romp over St. Poelten in the Uefa Women's Champions League on Tuesday, while Manchester City stayed top of Group D with a win.
 <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal beat Juventus 4-0 in Italy but remain second in Group C after Bayern Munich extended their 100 percent record with a 3-0 victory over Valerenga.
  <br>
  <br>
  For Barcelona, Ewa Pajor, Francisca Nazareth, Aitana Bonmati, Keira Walsh and Claudia Pina all scored between the 32nd and 45th minutes, before Pina and Caroline Graham Hansen added goals in the second half.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite scoring 16 goals and conceding none in their last two European outings, holders Barca sit second in Group D after they lost their opening fixture at Manchester City.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Objective met – yes, absolutely," Barca coach Pere Romeu said after his side's second emphatic victory in three games.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Even when we couldn't score in the first half an hour, we were getting in behind them. And I knew once we got the first goal, more would follow."
  <br>
  <br>
  Austria's St Poelten stay bottom of the group with three losses from three.
  <br>
  <br>
  The floodgates opened at the Johan Cruyff Stadium shortly after the half-hour when Pajor slid onto full-back Ona Batlle's cross at the near post and directed the ball into the far corner.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stand-in captain Marta Torrejon nearly doubled the score soon after she rose highest from a set-piece, but her looping header clipped the top of the crossbar.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fresh from picking up her second Ballon d'Or last month, Aitana Bonmati nearly caught Carina Schlueter out with a chip but the goalkeeper just managed to claw out the ball.
  <br>
  <br>
  Barca were all over the Austrians. When Bonmati got in behind the defence on the right, her cross was parried to Nazareth who made no mistake on 38 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bonmati opened her account in the Champions League this season two minutes later, before Walsh fizzed home a side-footed strike from outside the box in the 42nd minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the stroke of half-time, Pina flitted in at the back post to guide home an outside-of-the-foot volley as Barca ran riot.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Spanish forward then completed her brace from 12 yards seven minutes after the interval following a foul on the rampaging Batlle.
  <br>
  <br>
  Substitute Graham added a seventh in the 87th minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  Man City stayed three points ahead of Barca after second-half goals by Laura Brown and Aoba Fujino overcame Sweden's Hammarby 2-0. (AFP)

    FA launches investigation into referee Coote

<img alt="Referee David Coote during the Premier League football match between Liverpool and Brighton. File photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1778784_1_20241113081326.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Football Association is investigating after a video was posted on social media appearing to show Premier League referee David Coote making derogatory comments about Liverpool and their former manager Jurgen Klopp.
 <br>
  <br>
  Referees body Professional Game Match Officials Ltd announced on Monday that Coote, 42, had been suspended pending a full investigation.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Football Association is also looking at Coote's comments. It is understood part of its investigation will centre on whether Coote's reference to Klopp's nationality constitutes an aggravated breach of its misconduct rules.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are aware of the matter, and we are investigating it," an FA spokesman said on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to the clip, Coote, who refereed Liverpool's 2-0 win against Aston Villa on Saturday, said Klopp was "arrogant" and used offensive language.
  <br>
  <br>
  Retired referee Mike Dean, now a TV pundit, believes the incident will have a damaging effect on officials throughout English football.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As referees you can't put yourself in that position no matter what you do," the 56-year-old said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You can say things away from camera, you can talk amongst your friends and things and colleagues," he added. "But you can't let somebody video this and then hope that it's never going to come out."
  <br>
  <br>
  The video appears to refer to a match that Coote officiated between Liverpool and Burnley in July 2020, which finished 1-1. Liverpool had already been crowned champions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Klopp criticised Coote after the match, saying the referee had been too lenient in his treatment of Burnley challenges.
  <br>
  <br>
  Klopp left Liverpool at the end of last season after nearly nine years in charge at Anfield.
  <br>
  <br>
  The German was also critical of Coote over an incident in a match against Arsenal last season in which Gunners midfielder Martin Odegaard's hand made contact with the ball.
  <br>
  <br>
  Coote, as VAR, did not advise on-field official Chris Kavanagh to review the incident.
  <br>
  <br>
  Coote was also the VAR in the Merseyside derby at Goodison Park in October 2020 when Toffees goalkeeper Jordan Pickford inflicted a season-ending injury on Liverpool defender Virgil van Dijk.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pickford was not sent off for the challenge and did not face retrospective action because, under FA rules, that can only happen if an incident was not seen either at the time or when it was reviewed by VAR. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Peru is keen to deepen its strategic partnership with China when it hosts President Xi Jinping for the Apec summit in Lima this week, while the Peruvian Chinese community says they are highly regarded by the locals because of their law-abiding and hardworking nature.
 <br>
  <br>
  China is already Peru’s largest trading partner, accounting for 53 percent of all exports from the South American nation last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Figures from the Trade Development Council in Hong Kong show that trade between the two nations exceeded US$20 billion in the first half of this year, nearly reaching the full-year total of 2019.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ties between China and Peru can be traced back to the 19th century, when the first batch of Chinese workers arrived at the shores of the South American nation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vicente Loo moved from Hong Kong to Peru in 1979, when he was just 20.
  <br>
  <br>
  He is now the president of Sociedad Central de Beneficencia China – which roughly translates as the Chinese Benevolent Society.
  <br>
  <br>
  The group was founded in 1886 by a Qing dynasty official, and is steeped in history.
  <br>
  <br>
  Loo said the earliest Chinese immigrants worked as hard labour, after slavery was outlawed.
  <br>
  <br>
  But they gradually raised their social status, and now the Chinese are highly regarded in Peru.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We have our ancestors to thank for this. They have always been model citizens. In the eyes of Peruvians, Chinese people are hardworking, honest and clever,” he told RTHK in an interview.
  <br>
  <br>
  “That’s how locals see us, and that’s why Chinese Peruvians are able to achieve in different sectors such as business, and politics.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Today it is estimated that about 10 percent of the Peruvian population has Chinese origins.
  <br>
  <br>
  The society, which has lent a helping hand to countless immigrants over the years, is moving with the times by switching its focus to promoting – and preserving – Chinese culture.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We have a lion dance troupe with more than 200 teenagers. Half of them are Peruvians and the other half are Chinese. Their performances are very well received by the locals – you’ll see us in festivals, events and opening ceremonies. Apart from promoting Chinese culture, the troupe also galvanises the Chinese community here and foster exchanges with Peruvians,” Loo explained.
  <br>
  <br>
  The society has been recognised by the Chinese embassy in Peru for its work.
  <br>
  <br>
  It has been invited to take part in Beijing’s foreign aid programme, dishing out emergency funds to Chinese citizens who encounter unexpected situations or accidents.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a tour of the society’s headquarters in Chinatown, Loo showed RTHK group photos featuring Xi, when he last visited Peru in 2016.
  <br>
  <br>
  Next to it was another photo with former president Hu Jintao, taken in 2008.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mr Loo can look forward to a third group photo, when he and other Chinese Peruvian representatives greet the president again, later this week.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US stocks finished the day in the red on Tuesday, as traders looked to consolidate some of their gains since Donald Trump's victory in the November 5 US presidential election.
 <br>
  <br>
  "We got a significant run," said Art Hogan from B Riley Wealth Management. "After a run like that in such a short period of time, it's not surprising for markets to take a breather."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones fell 0.9 percent to 43,910, while the S&P 500 slipped 0.3 percent to 5,983.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Nasdaq rounded out the fall among major indices on Wall Street, closing down 0.1 percent at 19,281.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among individual stocks, Tesla fell 6.1 percent as traders looked to make the most of a recent surge in the electric vehicle-maker's share price after Trump's victory, which was strongly supported by Tesla chief executive Elon Musk.
  <br>
  <br>
  The biotech firm Amgen also shed value on Tuesday after an analyst published a research note raising questions about an experimental anti-obesity drug.
  <br>
  <br>
  As well as digesting last week's election result, and what it means for the markets, traders are also looking ahead to a number of data releases this week, including fresh consumer inflation data to be published on Wednesday. (AFP)

    Researchers: Bright lights could deter shark attacks

<img alt="The study, published in the journal Current Biology, was conducted in the waters of South Africa's Mossel Bay, a popular great white feeding ground.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Covering your surfboard in bright lights sounds like an open invitation to great white sharks, but research released on Tuesday by Australian scientists found it might actually stave off attacks.
 <br>
  <br>
  Biologist Laura Ryan said the predator often attacked its prey from underneath, occasionally mistaking a surfer's silhouette for the outline of a seal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ryan and her fellow researchers showed that seal-shaped boards decked with bright horizontal lights were less likely to be attacked by great white sharks.
  <br>
  <br>
  This appeared to be because the lights distorted the silhouette on the ocean's surface, making it appear less appetising.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There is this longstanding fear of white sharks and part of that fear is that we don't understand them that well," said Ryan, from Australia's Macquarie University.
  <br>
  <br>
  The study, published in the journal Current Biology, was conducted in the waters of South Africa's Mossel Bay, a popular great white feeding ground.
  <br>
  <br>
  Seal-shaped decoys were strung with different configurations of LED lights and towed behind a boat to see which attracted the most attention.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brighter lights were better at deterring sharks, the research found, while vertical lights were less effective than horizontal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ryan said the results were better than expected and is now in the process of building prototypes for use on the underside of kayaks and surfboards.
  <br>
  <br>
  Australia has some of the world's most comprehensive shark management measures, including monitoring drones, shark nets and a tagging system that alerts authorities when a shark is near a crowded beach.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ryan said her research could allow less invasive mitigation methods to be used.
  <br>
  <br>
  More research was needed to see if bull and tiger sharks - which have different predatory behaviour - responded to the lights in a similar way, the authors said.
  <br>
  <br>
  There have been more than 1,200 shark incidents in Australia since 1791, of which 255 resulted in death, official data shows.
  <br>
  <br>
  Great white sharks were responsible for 94 of those deaths. (AFP)

 China's largest e-commerce company Alibaba Group said it recorded "robust growth" in sales and a "record number" of shoppers over this year's Singles' Day sales period, a weeks-long event that ended at midnight on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The firm did not release total sales revenue for the period but said 45 brands - including Apple, Haier, Midea and Xiaomi - each surpassed 1 billion yuan in gross merchandising value (GMV), a commonly used measurement for online sales.
  <br>
  <br>
  JD.com, China's second biggest e-commerce company, did not disclose information about sales but reported a more than 20 percent year-over-year increase in shoppers over the event.
  <br>
  <br>
  Data provider Syntun estimated that sales across major e-commerce platforms rose 26.6 percent to 1.44 trillion yuan over the Singles Day event, which was 10 days longer than last year's.
  <br>
  <br>
  Originally a 24-hour online shopping event held on November 11 each year in China, the Singles' Day festival - a nod to the digits in the date - has expanded into weeks of promotions across the country's major e-commerce platforms and in brick-and-mortar stores. This year's festival, which kicked off on October 14, is the longest edition yet.
  <br>
  <br>
  This year, larger ticket household appliances performed better than last year, benefiting from a national 150 billion yuan trade-in subsidy scheme announced in July to help boost consumption.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to JD.com, fast-growing home and appliance categories included energy-efficient air conditioners, robot vacuum cleaners and smart toilets.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another consumer sector seeing unexpected growth was collectible toys and hobbies, a category that includes anime, comic and gaming-related goods popular with young people in China.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to figures from Alibaba, designer and collectible toy brands including MiHoYo, Pop Mart, Paperpresented and Jellycat surpassed 100 million yuan in GMV. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The leader of the world's Anglican communion, Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby, announced on Tuesday he was resigning following a damning report that concluded the Church of England covered up a serial abuse case.
 <br>
  <br>
  Welby had faced days of growing pressure to quit after the independent probe found Welby "could and should" have formally reported decades of abuse by a Church-linked lawyer to authorities in 2013.
  <br>
  <br>
  A petition demanding his resignation, launched in the wake of the report's revelations, has garnered nearly 14,000 signatures while leading clergy, including some bishops, were increasingly urging him to quit.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is very clear that I must take personal and institutional responsibility for the long and re-traumatising period between 2013 and 2024," Welby said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I hope this decision makes clear how seriously the Church of England understands the need for change and our profound commitment to creating a safer church.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As I step down I do so in sorrow with all victims and survivors of abuse."
  <br>
  <br>
  The independent Makin Review concluded that John Smyth, a lawyer who organised evangelical summer camps in the 1970s and 1980s, was responsible for "prolific, brutal and horrific" abuse of as many as 130 boys and young men.
  <br>
  <br>
  It found the Church of England - the mother church of Anglicanism - covered up the "traumatic physical, sexual, psychological and spiritual attacks", which occurred in Britain, Zimbabwe and South Africa over several decades.
  <br>
  <br>
  Smyth, who lived in Africa from 1984, died aged 75 in South Africa in 2018 while under investigation by British police. He never faced any criminal charges.
  <br>
  <br>
  Appointed the Church of England's highest-ranking cleric in 2013, Welby has apologised for what occurred but previously insisted he would not resign because he did not know about the wrongdoing before then. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Everyone is encouraged to become a hero of goodwill as Operation Santa Claus 2024 kicked off on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Co-organised by RTHK Radio 3 and the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the annual charity campaign has been holding fundraising projects for over 35 years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at the launch ceremony, acting director of broadcasting Christine Wai said the campaign has raised HK$383 million to support more than 350 projects over the years.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As we are about to launch into the main fundraising period of Operation Centre Claus for the 37th time, this is a chance to get together and share our common purpose and appreciate the value of this seasonal fixture which has become so much a part of our life," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Over the next few weeks, we'll be telling our listeners, readers and viewers what's going on and all about the fundraising activities, the creativity and imagination, and of course the fund."
  <br>
  <br>
  The theme for this year's campaign is "Everyday Heroes", and SCMP general counsel and company secretary Paul Wong urged people to take this theme to heart.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Through Operation Santa Claus, we are all brought in together with one another", he said. "We have a chance to help those who are in need and to support our neighbours, so let's be generous, and let's all be the everyday heroes of other people's lives."
  <br>
  <br>
  The funds raised this year will be shared among 11 beneficiaries that serve and support children and youth, the elderly, the environment and those with physical and mental disabilities.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong wheelchair badminton star Daniel Chan and singer Jay Fung are the ambassadors of this year's campaign.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan, who brought home a silver medal at the Paris Paralympics, said people told him he gave the city hope.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I became one of the Hong Kong heroes... Everyone can be a hero, but only with our help. Please give all our help to them, and let them have a chance to be our heroes," he said.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Authorities in the southern Chinese city of Zhuhai on Tuesday said 35 people were killed and another 43 were injured when a car ploughed into people exercising around a sports centre.
 <br>
  <br>
  A suspect has been taken into custody, and President Xi Jinping has urged all-out efforts to treat the injured.
  <br>
  <br>
  Local police said that a "serious and vicious attack" occurred at Zhuhai Sports Centre on Monday evening.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police said a man drove an SUV through the gate and forced his way into the sports centre.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 62-year-old suspect was subdued as he tried to flee the scene.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officers added that they found him cutting himself with a knife, before they stopped him and sent him to hospital, where he is currently in a coma after self-inflicted injuries to his neck and other parts of his body.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police also said preliminary investigations suggested that the actions of the driver "stemmed from his dissatisfaction with the property division outcome of his divorce".
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi gave instructions on the case and demanded that the perpetrator be severely punished according to the law.
  <br>
  <br>
  The president also urged authorities to do more to ensure safety and protect people's lives and social stability. (Xinhua/AFP)

    'Systemic issues affect construction safety'
   </title>

<img alt="" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1778728_1_20241112183834.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A workers' rights representative on Tuesday said systemic issues in the construction industry were to blame for a drop in workplace safety.
 <br>
  <br>
  Siu Sin-man from the Association for the Rights of Industrial Accident Victims told a press conference that more than 100 workers, 11 of them from the construction industry, have died on the job since the start of the year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last week, three workers lost their lives within a span of five days while another died on Tuesday after falling into the sea near Stonecutters Island.
  <br>
  <br>
  Siu cited a 7.5-hour mandatory safety training course currently in place – commonly known as the Green Card – and said it failed to provide new workers with adequate safety knowledge and awareness.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The government should increase the length of Green Card courses, and a certain training hours must be completed before they renew any speciality licences," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Siu also said the "lowest bid wins" principle and a low weight of safety scores in the overall bidding process led to insufficient resources to help ensure safety.
  <br>
  <br>
  To help raise public awareness at an early age, she called on the government to introduce construction safety education in primary schools.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho Wing-ip, an electrical and building services engineer, noted that the fatality rate for construction workers had dropped to 0.093 per 1,000 workers in 2016, but has since risen annually, reaching 0.178 last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  “As an engineer, I would conclude that the external factors must have deteriorated. The external factors include the tendering system, monitoring system, supervision system, audit system, mentality of workers, all these, I think they are deteriorating," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Personally I think we have room for improvement, especially touching on the penalty in the construction laws in relation to the safe working environment."
  <br>
  <br>
  Currently, all capital works with contracts over HK$30 million are required to implement the Smart Site Safety System, which includes features like centralised management platforms, monitoring devices for workers and electric locks for dangerous areas.
  <br>
  <br>
  Besides the safety features, Ho said a key focus should be on educating stakeholders about safety.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Sports Institute (HKSI) and the Hong Kong Academy of Medicine (HKAM) signed a Memorandum of Understanding on Tuesday to promote sports medicine and sports science, in the hope of enhancing better support systems for elite athletes.
 <br>
  <br>
  HKAM president Gilberto Leung said the Medical Council doesn't recognise sports medicine as a specialisation, so the SAR needs to catch up through developing training programmes in this area.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Hong Kong Academy of Medicine has a very good track record and we have rich experience in designing training for specialists, whereas the Hong Kong Sports Institute has a lot of experience with actually dealing with patients or athletes with injuries and how to handle their psychology, their nutritional needs, and also injury prevention," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We want to put the two together, our statutory status, in providing training for doctors and also the experience that the Sports Institute has, and hopefully with that, we can design some really effective and impactful programmes, and on top of that, we would like to explore how to do research because if you have good research, you can improve service and the care to the athletes as well."
  <br>
  <br>
  HKSI chairman Tang King-shing said the future cooperation between the two bodies will focus on providing medical training programmes, organising seminars and workshops to better understand sports medicine trends and technology advancements, and strengthening professional exchanges and experience sharing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two-time Olympic gold medallist Edgar Cheung and the SAR's "Flying Fish" Siobhan Haughey were among athletes attending the signing event to share the importance of sports medicine for elite athletes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I go to [the Sports Medicine Centre at HKSI] for physiotherapy pretty frequently because having fenced for so long, it's no surprise that many athletes have injuries. Even if we don't have injuries, preventative care is important for protecting our bodies, so that we can perform our best at the highest level," Cheung said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I see my nutritionist every week and we draw blood to collect my body's data, like white and red blood cell count, iron content and other data. Based on that information, we can see whether my body is healthy and in a normal state," Haughey said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If some numbers are not within the normal range or are out of range, my nutritionist will then suggest what I should eat so that I can supplement the missing nutrients."

    HKO to consider issuing T3 on Wednesday afternoon

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Observatory (HKO) says it will consider issuing a T3 on Wednesday afternoon as Severe Tropical Storm Toraji continues to move towards Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  The forecaster said it expects Toraji will skirt around 200 kilometres to the south of the territory on Thursday morning.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Depending on the intensity of Toraji at that time, the distance of its associated gale winds from the Pearl River Estuary, and the change in local wind conditions, the observatory will assess the need of issuing higher tropical cyclone warning signals," said Senior Scientific Officer Lee Shuk-ming.
  <br>
  <br>
  The existing T1 will remain in force until at least midday on Wednesday as Toraji is expected to maintain quite some distance from the SAR for the time being.
  <br>
  <br>
  Winds are expected to strengthen on Wednesday, the HKO said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The observatory also warned people to stay away from the shoreline and to avoid water sports.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Tuesday expressed confidence that Hong Kong's exchange traded-fund (ETF) market will continue to grow and reinforce the SAR's status as an international financial centre.
 <br>
  <br>
  At a ceremony marking the 25th anniversary of the Tracker Fund, Chan said the city has established itself as a leading ETF hub, offering a wide range of products and attracting many issuers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Created during the Asian financial crisis, the Tracker Fund has grown five-fold from an initial size of over HK$33 billion to become Hong Kong's largest ETF with a market cap of over HK$150 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Over the past 25 years, along with Hong Kong and our capital market, the Tracker Fund has demonstrated incredible resilience in navigating multiple challenges," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It has earned the trust of local, mainland and international investors seeking exposure to Hang Seng Index's constituent stock. It offers investors a simple way to invest in a diversified portfolio of Hong Kong stocks, mitigating the risks of excessive concentration in a very cost-effective manner."
  <br>
  <br>
  The finance chief added that the fund's global footprint is expanding, including listings on the Thai stock exchange and a new ETF on the Saudi stock exchange.

 Former National People's Congress Standing Committee member Tam Yiu-chung on Tuesday called for stronger communication between the SAR government and the city’s business community, saying officials could do more to support local enterprises.
 <br>
  <br>
  Tam, who's now vice-president of the think tank Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macau Studies, said that a key message that Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office Director Xia Baolong gave to local business leaders during a meeting last Friday, was for officials and businesses to work together to solve problems.
  <br>
  <br>
  On an RTHK programme, the veteran politician said the government could have done better in working hand-in-hand with businesspeople.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For example, when the government is granting permits, can the relevant government departments carry out approvals more proactively, and not delay them for an unnecessarily long time?" Tam queried.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that the authorities should also understand that nowadays it is difficult to do business and the government should cooperate with the sector whenever it can to boost confidence.
  <br>
  <br>
  President of the Chinese Manufacturers' Association Wingco Lo was among those attended the meeting with Xia.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said Xia noted that the logistics sector is one of Hong Kong's advantages.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Xia also mentioned that Hong Kong cannot go it alone. It has to work with the Greater Bay Area to form a port cluster, and cooperate with ports on the mainland to expand its transportation and logistics industry," Lo said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Agnes Chan, who chairs the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce, said there had been a "productive discussion" in Shenzhen on how the business community can leverage its expertise to help with the city's economic growth.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We must enhance our status as a premier maritime and aviation hub, as well as a vital land gateway to the mainland," she said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The chamber said apart from offering suggestions to the government, it will also organise overseas events to promote the SAR.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The top Beijing official overseeing Hong Kong affairs has told business leaders to show their love for the SAR and take concrete action to promote the economy, Chief Executive John Lee said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Xia Baolong, the director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, held exchanges with 29 business and industrial representatives during a seminar in Shenzhen last week.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters ahead of a weekly Exco meeting, the CE said Xia's message to businesses is that they should contribute to the overall well-being of the Hong Kong "family."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Of course, enterprises can make their decisions. But the key point is how much you love this place and how much you think you should contribute," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Whether it's just a business decision or whether you want to be showing your love to the people who live with you every day, showing your love to the home, which is the home for your children."
  <br>
  <br>
  Xia also told attendees to "wake up to the challenges and all collectively strengthen our competitiveness" while at the same time acknowledging the complexity of the world, Lee said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked what kind of concrete action should be taken, Lee said entrepreneurs and investors could take forward projects in the Northern Metropolis, adding that the government is rolling out larger pieces of land for developers in the area.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CE added that officials will soon promulgate a new development blueprint on tourism which will cover various areas to upgrade and transform the industry.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The  Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC) on Tuesday said that national carrier Air China would be the launch customer for the company's C929 wide-body aircraft under development that is designed to compete with twin-aisle models from Airbus and Boeing.
 <br>
  <br>
  COMAC's deputy director of marketing, Liu Yan, made the announcement at China's biggest air show in Zhuhai.
  <br>
  <br>
  He did not disclose the number of aircraft Air China would purchase or planned delivery dates.
  <br>
  <br>
  COMAC has said the C929 would have 280 to 400 seats and a range of 12,000 kilometres, which is in the same category as Boeing's 787 Dreamliner.
  <br>
  <br>
  The C929 was renamed in 2023 from the CR929 after Russia left a China-Russia joint venture developing the aircraft.
  <br>
  <br>
  A report in April from the C929's fuselage manufacturer said it aimed to deliver the first fuselage section by September 2027.
  <br>
  <br>
  COMAC deputy general manager Tong Yu in May told a group of Hong Kong reporters in Shanghai that a C929 prototype would be seen in the near future and estimated the jet could "soon" take a test flight. (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Donovan Mitchell scored 36 points as the unbeaten Cleveland Cavaliers came from behind once more to preserve their 100 percent start to the season with a 119-113 victory over the Chicago Bulls on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Cavaliers, who overcame a 14-point deficit to beat Brooklyn on Saturday, were again forced to dig deep, battling back from nine points down in the third quarter for a road victory that takes them to 12-0 for the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mitchell led another fine all-round offensive performance from Cleveland, who have emerged as the surprise package of the season and are the only undefeated team in the league.
  <br>
  <br>
  Six Cleveland players finished in double figures, with point guard Darius Garland adding 17 points and Evan Mobley 15.
  <br>
  <br>
  Caris LeVert, Georges Niang and Ty Jerome all had 12 points each off the bench.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chicago meanwhile were left ruing their inability to take full advantage after pulling into an 85-76 lead with just over four minutes remaining in the third quarter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Instead, Cleveland came roaring back with a 9-0 run to tie the game and then pulled ahead to lead by three points heading into the fourth quarter, before closing out victory by outscoring Chicago 24-21 in the final frame.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zach LaVine led Chicago's scorers with 26 points, while Coby White and Nikola Vucevic had 20 points apiece. The Bulls fell to 4-7 with the loss.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We dug deep," Mitchell said after the win. "Honestly, the bench saved us. Starters were a little fatigued, and I guess teams are coming at us. But we persevered, and shoutout to the bench for that – it's a group effort."
  <br>
  <br>
  "For us to continue to be what we want to be, that's what it's going to take," he added. "It was a complete team win – every night it's somebody different. We're playing for each other, being selfless. We've got to keep it going." (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday called for mutual respect from the United States in its relationship with Hong Kong, saying bilateral trade is "beneficial" to both sides.
 <br>
  <br>
  He also said no country should interfere in the city's internal affairs, in response to a question before his weekly Executive Council meeting relating to potential policies to be introduced under US President-elect Donald Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  During Trump's first tenure in the White House, he signed an order to end preferential economic treatment for Hong Kong, while imposing sanctions on officials or former officials from the SAR and mainland China.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Any country or economy which wants to develop trade relations or normal relations with another economy, then mutual respect is important. There should be respect so that there will be non-interference with local affairs, internal affairs. And also, Hong Kong attaches great importance to the rule of law," Lee said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I would urge all economies or countries to adopt that principle to develop relations with Hong Kong."
  <br>
  <br>
  Washington has enjoyed significant economic benefits in Hong Kong with a trade surplus totalling US$270 billion over the past decade, Lee noted, adding that more than 1,200 American companies have set up operations in the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  "These figures demonstrate the close economic ties between Hong Kong and the US, as well as the vast business interests of US businesses in Hong Kong," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The chief executive added Hong Kong has all along supported multilateral trade while welcoming exchanges with different economies, including the US.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Sizeable delegations from many Asian countries and territories will be converging this week on the Peruvian city of Lima for this year’s Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit – including ones led by President Xi Jinping and Chief Executive John Lee.
 <br>
  <br>
  The influx of Asian visitors will be a bit of an anomaly for the South American country – since tourists from Asia normally make up just 3.4 percent of all international arrivals.
  <br>
  <br>
  It’s a figure that Peru – for which tourism is the third-biggest industry – wants to pump up.
  <br>
  <br>
  RTHK spoke to some Chinese migrants to the country who believe there’s growing interest among Asian travellers in making the long and expensive trip to the region.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alicia Tay moved to Peru in 1983 and now runs a travel agency in Lima specialising in MICE tourism – catering to business travellers attending  meetings, conferences and exhibitions.
  <br>
  <br>
  She noted a growing number of Chinese firms wishing to bring their employees to Peru and other parts of South America in recent years.
  <br>
  <br>
  “A lot of our customers have travelled extensively around the world, such as Europe and of course Asia. Even the United States and Canada, many have been to these places. But for South America, it is certainly a new destination for them,” Tay explained.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the other hand, she said many Peruvian holidaymakers are curious about Asia, and see mainland China and Hong Kong as places with cutting-edge technology. There are also businessmen who are looking for investment opportunities abroad.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I think the Peruvians consider China as a potential country [to invest in] industries and technologies. I think it’s a point of interest, they want to visit China,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Peruvian government has been going all out in recent years to lure tourists, telling them there’s much more to see than just the ancient Inca town of Machu Picchu.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is a lucrative business after all: holidaymakers who are willing to travel halfway across the world to Peru usually have deep pockets. That includes Hue, a visitor from Sydney, Australia.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I'm here for a 19-day South American tour to see Machu Picchu, Iguazu Falls, mainly for sightseeing,” she said, adding she was planning to spend nearly US$10,000 for the trip.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Do I think it's worth it? Look, I think it is. I mean, for me, experience is more valuable than goods, so that's where I splurge my money.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Shenzhen natives Rachel and her sister planned to spend even more.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It’s around US$30,000, because we have a plan to go to Antarctica, I think that costs a lot. It takes around 28 days,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Peru hopes that the Apec meetings, which is held in Lima for the third time since 2008, will further raise the nation’s profile and attract more visitors and even investment.

 Chief Executive John Lee plans to garner support for Hong Kong's accession to the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) during a high-level summit in Peru this week.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lee, who is leaving for Lima to attend the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation conference (Apec), also said on Tuesday that he is going to meet with other leaders to promote the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Whilst in Lima, I'm going to attend a number of events and activities, including internal meetings and other sessions. I will also be exchanging views with other economic leaders, so that I can tell the good stories of Hong Kong and explain our advantages to other countries. We can also enhance ties with other governments," Lee said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There are a number of entities in Apec which are members of RCEP. I will make use of this occasion to strive for early accession to RCEP."
  <br>
  <br>
  Visiting South America for the first time since taking office, Lee said there's room for further development between the SAR and the continent, on top of already established trade ties.

    Ohtani nominated for MVP after historic 2024 campaign

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Japanese superstar Shohei Ohtani was named among the nominees for Major League Baseball's National League Most Valuable Player award on Monday after a historic debut season with the Los Angeles Dodgers.
 <br>
  <br>
  Ohtani is bidding for back-to-back MVP honours after winning the award last season while playing for the Los Angeles Angels in the American League.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ohtani, who has already won two MVP awards in his career, is coming off a season which saw him become the first player in history to amass 50 home runs and 50 stolen bases in the same season.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 30-year-old slugger also helped the Dodgers claim a second World Series in five seasons in October.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ohtani faces competition from shortstop Francisco Lindor of the New York Mets and Arizona Diamondbacks second baseman Ketel Marte.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the American League meanwhile, New York Yankees teammates Aaron Judge and Juan Soto were nominated alongside Bobby Witt Jr. of the Kansas City Royals.
  <br>
  <br>
  The MVP awards, which are voted on by a ballot of the Baseball Writers Association of America (BBWA), will be announced on November 21.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, there was a surprise in the nominees announced for the National League manager of the year award, with the Dodgers' World Series-winning manager Dave Roberts failing to make the cut.
  <br>
  <br>
  Roberts was tipped to be among the favourites after guiding the Dodgers to an MLB-best 98 regular season wins, despite having a pitching staff decimated by injuries.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, Roberts missed out, with Carlos Mendoza of the New York Mets, the Milwaukee Brewers' Pat Murphy and the San Diego Padres' Mike Shildt named as the nominees. (AFP)

    Storm Toraji expected to come within 200km of HK

<img alt="The observatory says it may issue a T3 signal during the day on Wednesday, and possibly a higher signal on Thursday when Toraji is expected to pass within 200km of the city. Image courtesy of HKO" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1778637_1_20241112094607.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Observatory (HKO) will consider issuing the T3 storm signal on Wednesday as Severe Tropical Storm Toraji continues to make its way towards Hong Kong, with the system expected to come within 200 kilometres of the territory on Thursday morning.
 <br>
  <br>
  Forecasters say whether a higher warning signal will be needed then depends on Toraji’s intensity and the strength of the winds here.
  <br>
  <br>
  For Tuesday, Toraji is expected to remain too far away to bring any major impact to the city, and the observatory says the Standby Signal No. 1 will remain in force for the entire day.
  <br>
  <br>
  But winds are expected to strengthen on Wednesday as Toraji approaches, coupled with the effects of the northeast monsoon, so the observatory will consider issuing the T3 warning during the day on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The observatory also warned people to stay away from the shoreline and to avoid water sports for the time being.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police said they've laid a holding charge of murder against three men, aged between 58 and 63, and the case will be mentioned at Tuen Mun Magistrates' Court on Tuesday morning.
 <br>
  <br>
  The three men were arrested on Sunday in connection with the death of a 34-year-old man in Castle Peak the same day.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police said a 59-year-old man who was arrested earlier in connection with the case has been released on bail, and is required to report back in early December.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Jannik Sinner spent his first rest day at the ATP Finals in Turin on Monday collecting the trophy for finishing the year ranked the number one tennis player in the world.
 <br>
  <br>
  Sinner entered the season-ending event already assured of becoming the first Italian to top the ATP end-of-year rankings.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's very special occasion to share that here in Italy," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I would like to thank you for the support around the world, to thank my team. Without the people who are close to me, who understand me as a person, who I am, it would be very difficult," Sinner added, calling himself "very lucky".
  <br>
  <br>
  Sinner's season has been dogged by controversy after he twice tested positive for traces of the steroid clostebol in March.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was initially cleared by the International Tennis Integrity Agency but at the end of September the World Anti-Doping Agency appealed, seeking a ban of up to two years.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Italian, who won his first match at finals on Sunday against Australian Alex De Minaur, succeeds Serbia's Novak Djokovic, who finished the year as world number one a record eight times.
  <br>
  <br>
  Boris Becker, who spent 221 days at number one in 1991 but never ended a year on top, attended the presentation.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said that while "there are certainly Carlos Alcaraz and others, Jannik is going to be world number one for a long time." (AFP)

    Spain's Alcaraz beaten by Ruud in ATP Finals opener

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Norway's Casper Ruud eased to a straight-sets victory over an out-of-sorts Carlos Alcaraz on Monday as the Spanish star's bid for a maiden ATP Finals title got off to a poor start.
 <br>
  <br>
  Ruud, 25, romped through the opening set before fighting back from 5-2 behind in the second to win 6-1, 7-5 in Turin.
  <br>
  <br>
  World number three Alcaraz, who won the French Open and Wimbledon titles earlier this year, made 34 unforced errors in an uncharacteristically errant display.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm tired. I'm tired mentally," said Alcaraz. "Obviously a lot of matches, really tight schedule, really demanding year with not too many days off, not too many periods for you could rest.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Some players deal with it better than others," he went on to say.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was Ruud's first victory over 21-year-old Alcaraz in their five career meetings.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I had two good times in Turin before – this part of the season has not been good for me but hopefully I've saved some wins for this week and I've started well," said 2022 runner-up Ruud, who had suffered seven defeats in eight matches coming into this tournament.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alcaraz struggled with sickness and adapting to the indoor surface.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A few days before coming here, I got sick at home," said the Spaniard. "I don't like to sound like I'm making excuses, but today I didn't feel well on court.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It doesn't matter the times I beat Casper," he added. " I have no experience playing on indoor courts – I have to be better on this part of the year that we play on indoor courts." (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President-elect Donald Trump is expected to name Florida Senator Marco Rubio as secretary of state, The New York Times reported on Monday night.
 <br>
  <br>
  It quoted three people as saying that the decision is not final, but that Trump appears to have settled on Rubio, a loyalist whom Trump passed over as his vice presidential running mate.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has moved quickly to staff his incoming administration, naming loyalists to several key posts within days of his election victory and signalling his desire to have some seated without a Senate confirmation process.
  <br>
  <br>
  The staffing picks are the subject of intense speculation and scrutiny, with Trump vowing that his second administration will oversee a radical shake-up of the federal government.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 78-year-old Republican tycoon said Sunday he would tap hardline immigration official Tom Homan as the country's "border czar," while US media reported the nod for UN ambassador as going to New York congresswoman Elise Stefanik, a vocal Trump ally.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stephen Miller, another fierce critic of illegal immigration who served in Trump's first administration, has been tapped for deputy chief of staff.
  <br>
  <br>
  The picks signal movement on a number of Trump's key campaign messages, with Homan's hardline immigration stance making him a loyal hand in carrying out the incoming president's deportation promises.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stefanik, who has voiced strong support for Israel, will represent the administration as the UN grapples with the ongoing wars in Gaza and Lebanon.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stefanik's nomination would need approval by the Senate, but Trump is hoping to bypass Congress by making appointments while the chamber is in recess.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another hardliner, Florida congressman Michael Waltz, is reportedly in line to take the crucial National Security Advisor role, according to The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump will not be inaugurated until January, and had previously made one cabinet-level appointment, naming his campaign manager Susie Wiles as his White House chief of staff, a position that does not require Senate confirmation. (AFP)

 Japan's Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba pledged to take tougher measures against misuse of political funds after he was re-elected by parliament on Monday following a major loss in the polls last month by his governing coalition.

  Ishiba’s Liberal Democratic Party and its junior partner Komeito together lost a majority in the 465-seat Lower House, the more powerful of Japan’s two-house parliament, in the October 27 election.
  <br>
  <br>
  The defeat was blamed on voter outrage over financial misconduct by his party.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We must remind ourselves of the basics that politics is for the people, as we tackle political and party reforms," Ishiba said. He said that in response to the poor election results, "We must be able to have empathy for the pain, sorrow and anger of the people.”
  <br>
  <br>
  A special parliamentary session convened on Monday to pick a new leader in a vote required within 30 days of a general election.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ishiba beat top opposition leader Yoshihiko Noda 221-160 in the first runoff in 30 years.
  <br>
  <br>
  In his second Cabinet in just over a month, Ishiba reappointed most of its previous members, including Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya, Defense Minister Gen Nakatani and Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi.
  <br>
  <br>
  He replaced three ministers who lost seats or were affected by the election results.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ishiba stressed the importance of pursuing the significant buildup of Japan's defence power.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said he plans to attend Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation and Group of 20 summits later this month to strengthen partnership with the Global South nations and the Asia-Pacific region. He said he will hold talks with US President Joe Biden, South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol and other leaders.
  <br>
  <br>
  His government is also reportedly arranging a possible meeting with President-elect Donald Trump. (AP)

    Man Utd players hungry to learn from Amorim: Casemiro

Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1778583_1_20241111213136.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Casemiro says Manchester United's players are hungry to learn from new manager Ruben Amorim, who is expected to arrive in Britain on Monday to start the task of reviving the struggling club.
 <br>
  <br>
  Ruud van Nistelrooy's four-match reign as interim United boss ended with a 3-0 Premier League victory against Leicester on Sunday - a third win in four matches since Erik ten Hag was sacked.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brazilian midfielder Casemiro is looking forward to working with the Dutchman's highly rated successor.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He is very true, very loyal," Casemiro said after the win against Leicester.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We cannot ignore how he has changed Sporting (Lisbon). We know that Sporting won many titles, changed the club with titles, with trophies.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He has already proved that he is a coach that has won a lot.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think there is going to be a good template that everyone wants to grow, everyone wants to learn. I think that is the way to first help us grow to be at the top of the table."
  <br>
  <br>
  Amorim, 39, will be unable to lead coaching sessions until his work permit is granted.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the Portuguese coach is allowed at United's Carrington training ground for meetings, and talks with Van Nistelrooy will be high on his agenda.
  <br>
  <br>
  The popular former striker returned to Old Trafford in July as one of Ten Hag's assistants on a deal until 2026 and has been open about his desire to stay.
  <br>
  <br>
  Amorim's first match will be a trip to Ipswich on November 24, meaning there will be little time to implement his ideas and expected 3-4-3 formation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Casemiro's form has improved after a shaky start to the season, which included an error-strewn performance in a 3-0 defeat by Liverpool. (AFP)

 Saudi Arabia's de facto ruler on Monday called on Israel to respect Iran's sovereignty and refrain from attacking Iranian soil, highlighting warming ties between the Middle East rivals.
 <br>
  <br>
  Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman told a summit of Arab and Muslim leaders that the international community should oblige Israel "to respect the sovereignty of the sisterly Islamic Republic of Iran and not to violate its lands".
  <br>
  <br>
  Opening the summit, he said the international community must "immediately halt the Israeli actions against our brothers in Palestine and Lebanon", condemning Israel's campaign in Gaza as "genocide".
  <br>
  <br>
  "(Saudi Arabia) affirms its support for the brothers in Palestine and Lebanon to overcome the disastrous humanitarian consequences of the ongoing Israeli aggression," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  A draft resolution for the summit stresses "firm support" for "national rights" for the Palestinian people, "foremost among which is their right to freedom and to an independent, sovereign state".
  <br>
  <br>
  Just hours earlier, newly appointed Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said it was not "realistic" to establish a Palestinian state, dismissing it as a "Hamas state".
  <br>
  <br>
  "I don't think this position is realistic today and we must be realistic," Saar said in response to a question during an appearance in Jerusalem.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Saudi foreign ministry announced plans for the summit in late October during a meeting, also in Riyadh, of a new "international alliance" to press for the establishment of a Palestinian state.
  <br>
  <br>
  It comes one year after a similar gathering in Riyadh of the Cairo-based Arab League and the Jeddah-based Organisation of Islamic Cooperation during which leaders condemned Israeli forces' actions in Gaza as "barbaric". (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Observatory said on Monday that the Standby Signal No 1, which took effect at 10.20pm, will remain in force until at least noon on Tuesday, as Tropical Cyclone Toraji moves closer to Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  The forecasters said they'll consider issuing the Strong Wind Signal No 3 between later Tuesday and early Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  They said according to the present forecast track, the storm may be relatively close to the Pearl River Estuary on Thursday, but may also weaken at the same time.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Whether a higher Tropical Cyclone Warning Signal will be issued depends on the distance between Toraji and the Pearl River Estuary at that time, its intensity and the change in local wind conditions," the observatory said in its storm warning.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Observatory said members of the public should be aware of stronger winds and stay away from the shoreline because of swells.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Monday brought one of the four suspects in a murder case in Tuen Mun to the scene of the crime as part of their investigation.
 <br>
  <br>
  The suspect, who was handcuffed and wearing a black hood, was taken to Yau Oi Estate Market under police supervision.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Sunday, officers arrested four men, aged between 58 and 64, in connection with the death of a 34-year-old man.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police allege the suspects beat up the victim outside the wet market.
  <br>
  <br>
  He later fell unconscious at home and was taken to hospital where he was pronounced dead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police said preliminary investigations suggested the suspects did not know the victim, and the case did not involve triad activities.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Real estate and Macau gaming tycoon Lui Che-woo has died at the age of 95, one of his listed firms announced on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Galaxy Entertainment Group said he passed away peacefully last Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[Lui's] vision, tremendous leadership and guidance were the foundations for the Group’s development and continued success," the group said in a filing to the stock exchange.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The board would like to express its deepest sorrow for the passing away of Lui and extends its deepest condolences to his family."
  <br>
  <br>
  The group said it will continue its operations in accordance to the strategies laid down by its board, adding that Lui's passing won't have any impact on how the group is run.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tycoon made his last public appearance in late September when a host of local celebrities joined him in a party celebrating his birthday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lui was also the chairman of the K. Wah Group, a multinational conglomerate he founded in the 1950s, focusing on construction materials and quarry mining.
  <br>
  <br>
  He later expanded his business into real estate investment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Besides various housing and hotel developments in Hong Kong, K. Wah also holds projects in major mainland cities such as Shanghai, Nanjing and Guangzhou, as well as Singapore and Malaysia.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2002, Lui ventured into Macau's gaming business, winning one of the gambling licences issued by the government.
  <br>
  <br>
  His group now owns six casinos there.
  <br>
  <br>
  Almost a decade ago, the businessman founded a prize under his own name, recognising people who have contributed to the world civilisation.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2012, Lui was awarded the Grand Bauhinia Medal, the city's top honour, for his contributions to Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  He had also been a member of the local Election Committee, as well as a member of the national advisory body, the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lui is survived by his wife and five children.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Ministry of Commerce on Monday announced it will impose temporary anti-dumping measures on certain brandy imports from the European Union (EU).
 <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, the ministry said the decision follows a preliminary investigation that found EU brandy producers were dumping certain products in China, threatening to cause substantial damage to the domestic industry.
  <br>
  <br>
  Importers of brandy originating in the EU must place deposits with Chinese customs based on dumping margins of between 30.6 percent and 39 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The measures apply to grape-based spirits in containers less than 200 litres.
  <br>
  <br>
  The measures follow a similar announcement made by the ministry on October 8.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was not immediately clear whether these measures – which will come into effect on Friday – were new or an extension of existing ones.
  <br>
  <br>
  France, Europe's leading producer of brandy, had described the measures announced last month as political after the EU imposed hefty tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles over unfair competition claims. (Xinhua/AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The COP29 talks opened on Monday with calls for global cooperation and fresh warnings about climate disasters, but proceedings quickly ground to a halt in a fight over the agenda.
 <br>
  <br>
  Donald Trump's re-election is already hanging over the talks in Baku where negotiators are meant to agree new funding for climate action in poorer countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  As they opened, UN climate chief Simon Stiell told countries: "Now is the time to show that global cooperation is not down for the count."
  <br>
  <br>
  And he warned rich countries struggling to agree a new funding target to "dispense with any idea that climate finance is charity."
  <br>
  <br>
  "An ambitious new climate finance goal is entirely in the self-interest of every nation, including the largest and wealthiest."
  <br>
  <br>
  But the official proceedings in the capital of oil- and gas-rich Azerbaijan stalled almost immediately.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They're not going to resume until they resolve... the agenda," said Alden Meyer, senior associate at climate change think tank E3G.
  <br>
  <br>
  The COP29 president "can't put negotiating teams to work" until they adopt it, he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Negotiators must increase a US$100 billion-a-year target to help developing nations prepare for worsening climate impacts and wean their economies off fossil fuels.
  <br>
  <br>
  How much will be on offer, who will pay, and who can access the funds are some of the major points of contention.
  <br>
  <br>
  Developing countries are pushing for trillions of dollars and insist money should be mostly grants rather than loans, but negotiators are tight-lipped over what final figure might emerge.
  <br>
  <br>
  COP29 President Mukhtar Babayev acknowledged the need was "in the trillions" but said a more "realistic goal" was somewhere in the hundreds of billions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "These negotiations are complex and difficult," the former executive of Azerbaijan's national oil company said at the opening of the summit.
  <br>
  <br>
  Developing countries warn that without adequate finance, they will struggle to offer ambitious updates to their climate goals, which countries are required to submit by early next year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The global North owes the global South a climate debt," said Tasneem Essop, executive director of Climate Action Network.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will not leave this COP if the ambition level on the finance... doesn't match the scale at which finance must be delivered."
  <br>
  <br>
  The small group of developed countries that currently contributes the money wants the donor pool expanded to include other rich nations and top emitters, including China and the Gulf states.
  <br>
  <br>
  That is firmly rejected by Beijing, with one Chinese official warning on Sunday during a closed-door session that the talks should not aim to "re-negotiate" existing agreements.
  <br>
  <br>
  Just a handful of leaders from the Group of 20, whose countries account for nearly 80 percent of global emissions, are attending. US President Joe Biden is staying away.
  <br>
  <br>
  Afghanistan will however be sending a delegation for the first time since the Taliban took power. They are expected to have observer status.
  <br>
  <br>
  Diplomats have insisted that the absences, and Trump's win, will not detract from the serious work at hand.
  <br>
  <br>
  The talks come with fresh warnings that the world is far off track to meet the goals of the Paris agreement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The UN said Monday that 2024 is on track to break new temperature records, and the Paris climate agreement's goals were now "in great peril".
  <br>
  <br>
  The period from 2015 to 2024 will also be the warmest decade ever recorded, the UN's World Meteorological Organization said in a new report.
  <br>
  <br>
  The climate deal commits to keep warming below 2 degrees Celsius compared to pre-industrial levels, preferably below 1.5C.
  <br>
  <br>
  If the world tops that level this year, it would not be an immediate breach of the Paris deal, which measures temperatures over decades.
  <br>
  <br>
  But it suggests much greater climate action is needed. (AFP)

    'Trump's victory won't diminish Sino-US tensions'

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Standing Committee member Henry Tang on Monday said Donald Trump's victory in the American presidential election will not diminish Sino-US tensions.
 <br>
  <br>
  "I believe the US-China tension will not change with the new president," Tang told reporters after attending a forum.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We always wish to cooperate and work with all the people in the world and live peacefully for the benefit of the people. But that’s not how a lot of Americans are thinking, and it is a cross-party interest. So I don’t think the tension will diminish.
  <br>
  <br>
  "On the other hand, I do think, I do hope that Trump will be more a US president as in being a businessman, meaning consider the interest of the people over the interest of who's threatening who."
  <br>
  <br>
  Tang said Hong Kong will face a "very challenging" situation due to tensions between China and the US. But the former chief secretary said the SAR has always survived in challenging situations and the city will overcome this time through the collective efforts of everyone in society.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Tang said he believes Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office director Xia Baolong hopes the local business sector will seek changes through reform and take concrete action.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xia told the SAR's business community during a closed-door meeting in Shenzhen last Friday that they are the "main force" in promoting the SAR's economic development.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tang said Hongkongers are always very patriotic and "very astute businessmen".
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will of course support the Central People's Government and we are always supporters of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office and Xia Baolong. So, I'm sure all of those who went [to the meeting] will take his advice to heart and consider their actions and how to demonstrate that they have actually put into concrete action their support for the government and for the economy."
  <br>
  <br>
  Tang said both government and business have to work together to boost economic development.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The observatory on Monday said the Standby Signal No 1 will be issued at 10.20pm as Tropical Cyclone Toraji moves towards Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  The storm has passed over the Philippine island of Luzon and will come within 800 kilometres of the SAR overnight, forecasters said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Toraji will move towards the vicinity of the western coast of Guangdong to the Pearl River Estuary in the next couple of days," the observatory said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Under the combined effect of Toraji and the northeast monsoon, winds over the region will gradually strengthen with squally showers."
  <br>
  <br>
  The observatory said it will consider issuing the Strong Wind Signal No 3 later on Tuesday or early Wednesday.

    Parliament re-elects Ishiba as Japan PM in runoff vote
   </title>

<img alt="" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1778547_1_20241111171608.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Japanese lawmakers voted on Monday for Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba to stay on as leader, after his scandal-tarnished coalition lost its parliamentary majority in a lower house election last month.
 <br>
  <br>
  Ishiba, who called the snap poll after taking office on October 1, must now run a fragile minority government.
  <br>
  <br>
  His Liberal Democratic Party and coalition partner Komeito won the biggest bloc of seats in the election but lost the majority held since 2012, leaving him beholden to small opposition parties to pass his policy agenda.
  <br>
  <br>
  Underlining that fragility, Monday's vote in parliament, broadcast on television, went to a runoff for the first time in 30 years, with no candidate able to muster majority support in the first round.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Ishiba eventually prevailed as expected, garnering 221 votes, well clear of his nearest challenger, ex-PM Yoshihiko Noda, the head of the main opposition Constitutional Democratic Party, but still short of a majority in the 465-seat lower house.
  <br>
  <br>
  Japan will hold elections next year for the less powerful upper house, where the ruling coalition's slim majority could also be at risk if Ishiba cannot revive public trust roiled by a scandal over unrecorded donations to lawmakers.
  <br>
  <br>
  His imminent challenge is compiling a supplementary budget for the fiscal year through March, under pressure from voters and opposition parties to raise spending on welfare and take steps to offset rising prices.
  <br>
  <br>
  For approval he needs the backing of at least one opposition party, which is most likely to be the Democratic Party for the People (DPP) headed by Yuichiro Tamaki.
  <br>
  <br>
  He has held co-operation talks with Ishiba, but DPP lawmakers on Friday did not vote for Ishiba to stay on as prime minister.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tamaki is also in a precarious position after admitting on Monday to an extramarital affair revealed in a tabloid magazine.
  <br>
  <br>
  With his premiership confirmed, Ishiba now has to prepare for a slate of international engagements, including a summit of the Group of 20 big economies in Brazil on November 18 and 19.
  <br>
  <br>
  He is also trying to arrange a stopover in the United States on the way to or from that gathering to meet Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some Japanese officials fear Trump might again hit Tokyo with protectionist trade measures and revive demands for it to pay more for the cost of stationing US forces there.
  <br>
  <br>
  These issues were largely smoothed over in Trump's first term, from 2017 to 2021, by the close ties between the president and Japan's then-premier, Shinzo Abe, a bond Ishiba seems keen to re-establish. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Monday said bringing more strategic enterprises to Hong Kong helps the government get closer to the vision of the city becoming an innovation and technology centre.
 <br>
  <br>
  The finance chief made the comment at a signing ceremony involving the government's Office for Attracting Strategic Enterprises (OASES) and 17 companies from sectors including life and health technology, artificial intelligence and data science, fintech, advance manufacturing and new energy.
  <br>
  <br>
  With the companies in attendance, along with about 50 that got on board earlier, billions of dollars of investment are expected in the coming years, Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Together with the first two batches of partners, more than HK$42 billion of investment will be made and over 17,000 jobs will be created in the coming few years. It is particularly heartening to note that about 90 percent of the new batch of enterprises are planning to set up their international or regional headquarters here in Hong Kong," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said almost all of the enterprises attracted earlier have commenced operations in Hong Kong, and nearly 70 percent have chosen to set up their offices at either the Science Park or Cyberport.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prophesee – a French company that builds vision sensors that mimic the way the human eye works – was one of the enterprises that recently signed a partnership with the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  CEO and co-founder Luca Verre said the company has offices in Shanghai, Japan and the US and was thrilled to grow its presence in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Because it's a unique hub for the company to address the largest market opportunity for the company, which is the Asia-Pacific market, in particular, the mainland China market," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Besides looking for market growth, Verre also said he's confident that the research capabilities of the city will help in developing the firm's technology.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's always extremely attractive to work with top researchers to push the boundaries of this technology... and actually it turned out that Hong Kong has an incredible ecosystem from that point of view because within a relatively small area, actually the top five universities of Hong Kong are today doing some research related directly or indirectly within neuromorphic technologies," he said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The chairman of the Hong Kong Alliance of Technology and Innovation, Dennis Lo, on Monday said the body's annual tech awards are paramount for the development of the local science and technology sector and supporting the local economy's transformation.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lo, who is a molecular biologist and the incoming head of Chinese University, was speaking as the alliance gave out five awards on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think these young people in innovation and technology are the future of the industry in Hong Kong. Their ability to innovate and passion for research are important in advancing the sector's development for the SAR, and even that for the country," Lo said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We hope this award can serve as a fuelling station in their marathon career in innovation and technology."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lo expressed hope that the awards will bring the scientists more resources and support.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chai Yang, associate dean of Polytechnic University's science faculty, won in the artificial intelligence and robotics category, while Ng Siew-chien, Chinese University's medical school assistant dean, took home the prize in life and health.
  <br>
  <br>
  Professor Chen Shih-chi from Chinese University's mechanical and automation engineering department won the prize in advanced manufacturing.
  <br>
  <br>
  The award for new materials and new energy went to City University chemistry professor Zhang Hua, while City University computer science scholar Wang Cong grabbed the fintech award.
  <br>
  <br>
  The winners also received HK$2 million each as part of their prizes.

    People urged to watch out for online investment fraud

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Monday urged people to think twice before turning to social media or web forums for financial advice after the force recorded around 3,500 cases of online investment fraud in the first nine months of the year.
 <br>
  <br>
  Officers said the losses reported reached HK$2.2 billion in total, although both the amount of money swindled and the number of cases dropped by around 20 percent compared to the same period in 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  Senior Inspector Wan Pik-yee said there is a rising trend of fraudsters pretending to be police officers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They opened some WhatsApp groups using our logo as their profile picture to persuade the victims to believe that they are really police officers and ask them to provide some bank account details to scam their money," Wan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Michelle Yeung, head of investor education and stakeholder engagements at the Investor and Financial Education Council said more people have been scammed this year after falling for fake adverts online.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Listening or looking into the advice that is given on social media, I don't think there's anything wrong. But when it comes to asking you to join a group or click on any links, that's when it's really a problem," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So with whatever information that we get from the social media or from online, it's always worth to look into alternative sources just to verify whether that information is for real."

 China's much-anticipated J-35A stealth aircraft is set to make its debut on Tuesday at the country's biggest civil and military air show - the 15th China International Aviation and Aerospace Exhibition.
 <br>
  <br>
  The stealth fighter jet made its first public appearance on Friday, with broadcaster CCTV saying the jet appeared over the Zhuhai Jinwan Airport and conducted its first field adaptation training.
  <br>
  <br>
  It will be the centrepiece of this week's Zhuhai air show, which also marks the 75th anniversary of the founding of the People's Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF).
  <br>
  <br>
  It will include a flying display. Another variant, the J-35, is designed for use with China's aircraft carriers.
  <br>
  <br>
  The J-35 and J-35A are designed and built by the Shenyang Aircraft Corporation, a unit of the state-owned Aviation Industry Corporation of China.
  <br>
  <br>
  The People's Daily news outlet said ahead of the air show that the J-35A "mainly carries out the task of seizing and maintaining air supremacy".
  <br>
  <br>
  Both J-35 variants are considerably smaller than China's other stealth aircraft, the land-based J-20 fighter. An estimated 200 J-20s are operational with the PLAAF.
  <br>
  <br>
  The J-35A is superficially similar to the Lockheed Martin F-35, whose shape - from fuselage to control surfaces - is designed to minimise how large it appears on radar.
  <br>
  <br>
  The six-day China International Aviation & Aerospace Exhibition takes place in Zhuhai from November 12-17. (Reuters)

 Chief Executive John Lee on Monday called on the business sector and entrepreneurs to actively contribute to Hong Kong's development.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a forum, the SAR leader said businesspeople should take action to build up their industries, not stand idly by.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The business sector and entrepreneurs in Hong Kong are both participants in and beneficiaries of Hong Kong's development. They should be contributors rather than bystanders. They shouldn't just be commentators," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In economic transitions, every industry in Hong Kong should start with themselves, taking actions to grasp opportunities for transformation, building Hong Kong with concrete actions, to develop and construct the future together."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee said his administration will transform the power of patriotism into concrete action to ensure long-term prosperity and stability.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also said the government will continue to tackle obstacles and be innovative, and will make use of Hong Kong's advantages.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee said the SAR has to expand its global network to tell good stories of Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CE said he hopes society and professional media practitioners will promote the region's advantages, achievements and opportunities to the world.

    Think tank suggests regular youth uniformed group day

<img alt="Youth I.D.E.A.S says a survey shows most young people think joining a uniformed group would be beneficial to their personal development.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A youth think tank on Monday called on the government to regularly hold a “youth uniformed group day” to raise awareness and break stereotypes about such groups.
 <br>
  <br>
  Youth I.D.E.A.S, under the Hong Kong Federation of Youth Groups, said it recently surveyed 1,001 people aged 12 to 26 and most respondents said they believe joining a uniformed group helps improve teamwork, discipline and a sense of responsibility.
  <br>
  <br>
  The survey also found that almost 55 percent of the respondents were current or former members of a uniformed group.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among those who had never joined a uniformed group, the main reasons cited were that they participated in other extracurricular activities, were worried about the time commitment or felt that it wasn’t required by their schools.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kelly Cheng from the think tank said many people have a limited understanding of uniformed groups.
  <br>
  <br>
  “So they may not encourage their children to join the uniformed groups, but we think it will be important to have different channels for youngsters to explore their potential. So one of our suggestions would be to have a regular uniformed group day so as to let the public know more of what exactly the uniformed groups can serve and can connect to a community,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cheng said a regular uniformed group day would also give young people a chance to serve the community and utilise their skills, such as teaching people about first aid and sharing health tips.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong has 19 community and government youth uniformed groups with about 280,000 members between them.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government said in its Youth Development Blueprint two years ago that it planned to get more young people to join such groups.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Windsurfer Mui Ma on Monday overcame Britain's two-time Olympic bronze medallist Emma Wilson to win the iQFOiL women's category at the Hong Kong Windsurfing Open Championships, as fellow Olympian Alex Cheng claimed the top spot in the men's races to cap off the five-day event.
 <br>
  <br>
  It was a welcome return to form for the Hong Kong pair, who made their Olympic debut in Paris in July.
  <br>
  <br>
  A dramatic ending to the women's event saw Ma, 26, secure a come-from-behind victory after edging Wilson in the 16th and final race of the competition.
  <br>
  <br>
  The pair finished the event tied with a final score of 18.
  <br>
  <br>
  An overall champion is determined based on the results of the day's final race, with Ma's heroics in the final round helping her seal the victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  Britain's Alice Read and India's Ishwariya Ganesh ranked second and third respectively.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the men's division, Cheng won 10 out of 16 matches to claim his second title since 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another Hong Kong athlete, Jason Au, edged out Korea's Kim Chan-yi by three points to take second place.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong team will be heading to the iQFOiL Asian Windsurfing Championships from November 19 to 25.

    'Step up training on use of cage lifts in emergencies'

<div class="itemFullText">
 A concern group for industrial accident victims on Monday stressed it is crucial to step up workers' training on the use of cage lifts in emergency situation.
 <br>
  <br>
  Siu Sin-man from the Association for the Rights of Industrial Accident Victims made the comment on an RTHK radio programme. This came as a worker lost his life after he was crushed by a cage lift at The Pavilia Farm construction site in Tai Wai on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Even experienced operators use different kinds of machines at different construction sites. When they're working at a new construction site, or when they have to use a new model of the equipment, they should receive training from scratch," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Apart from training workers in how to operate the equipment, I believe it's more important that they know how to stop the machine in emergencies."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee Kwong-sing, chairman of the Hong Kong Institute of Safety Practitioner's Education and Training Committee, said on the same programme it is rare for interlocking device at cage lifts to malfunction.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When we are carrying out safety checks at construction sites, we found out that for convenience, a lot of workers would jam up the safety lock. I've even seen some workers tamper with the control box, causing the safety installation to become useless."
  <br>
  <br>
  The incident was the third fatal industrial accident in five days.
  <br>
  <br>
  A man succumbed to his injuries after he fell from height at a construction site at the airport last Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 37-year-old victim is believed to be from the mainland.
  <br>
  <br>
  Siu pointed out that the industry has to strengthen communication with workers from the mainland, even if they have relevant experience before coming to Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's a totally different culture in Hong Kong - whether it's the mode of communication or jargon - they are very different. Training has to be stepped up in advance and ensure that mainland workers understand the instructions and are clear about the working procedures."

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Observatory said the Standby Signal No 1 will be issued between 8pm and midnight on Monday as a typhoon is about to enter within 800 kilometres of Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Observatory also said it will consider issuing the Strong Wind Signal No 3 between later Tuesday and early Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  At 1pm, Toraji was centred about 250 kilometres north of Manila and was forecast to move west-northwest at about 18 kilometres per hour across Luzon.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Toraji will move towards the vicinity of the western coast of Guangdong to the Pearl River Estuary in the next couple of days," the Observatory said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Forecasters added that the storm could be relatively close to the vicinity of the Pearl River Estuary on Thursday, but may also weaken at the same time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under the combined effect of the storm and the northeast monsoon, winds over the region will gradually strengthen with squally showers.
