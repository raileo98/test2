 Hong Kong stocks ended flat on Tuesday with the benchmark Hang Seng Index down 1 point to close at 23,782.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index rose 0.35 percent to end at 8,755, and the Hang Seng Tech Index rose 1.39 percent to end at 5,967.

  Overnight, the US stock market’s sell-off cut deeper as Wall Street questioned how much pain President Donald Trump will let the economy endure through tariffs and other policies in order to get what he wants. The S&P 500 dropped 2.7 percent to drag it close to 9 percent below its all-time high; the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 890 points, or 2.1 percent; while the Nasdaq composite skidded by 4 percent.

<img alt="The judiciary says people, including the media, must not record the Court of Final Appeal's online webcasts. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795261_1_20250311162436.jpg&q=70">

<div class="itemFullText">
 The judiciary said on Tuesday it will start webcasting some proceedings at Hong Kong's top court from April 1, as part of a pilot scheme.
 <br>
  <br>
  It said certain types of Court of Final Appeal hearings will not be part of the two-year scheme.
  <br>
  <br>
  These include cases involving national security, commercial confidentiality, children or the mentally disabled, as well as those deemed to be "highly politically charged" or "high-profile public order cases".
  <br>
  <br>
  "Open justice is a key to maintaining public confidence in the judicial system and upholding the rule of law," the judiciary said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Live broadcasting of judicial proceedings beyond court premises will enhance the transparency of court procedures and strengthen public confidence in the judicial process."
  <br>
  <br>
  People will be able to watch the livestreams on the top court's website, but they are not allowed to record them or use the footage for any purpose, it said, adding that the media is no exception to this rule.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hearings will be kept online for a month.
  <br>
  <br>
  The upcoming pilot scheme comes after the top court conducted four webcast test runs last year.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Social worker Jackie Chen was on Tuesday convicted of rioting in Wan Chai during the 2019 protests, following a retrial.
 <br>
  <br>
  She will be sentenced next month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chen was accused of taking part in a riot on August 31, 2019, when protestors set up roadblocks with debris in Wan Chai and clashed with police. In 2020, a District Court judge ruled that she had no case to answer. The Department of Justice then lodged an appeal, leading to the retrial.
  <br>
  <br>
  In her ruling, Deputy District Judge May Chung said Chen chose not to leave the scene even though she clearly knew that it had turned into a dangerous riot.
  <br>
  <br>
  The judge said the defendant kept shouting false accusations against the police while they were dispersing protesters, prompting others to stick around and continue confronting officers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chung said the only reasonable explanation is that Chen intended to participate in the riot and encourage other people to engage in actions that undermined social order.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chen had pleaded not guilty and said she was trying to mediate.
  <br>
  <br>
  She did not testify in the latest trial.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 48-year-old is now on remand, and the court has been adjourned until April 3 for mitigation and April 9 for sentencing.

    'No plans for a comprehensive tax-regime review'

<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Tuesday said the government does not plan to conduct a comprehensive review on the SAR's tax regime in the near term, despite calls to introduce new sources of revenue to tackle the city’s deficit.
 <br>
  <br>
  He was responding to questions at a luncheon held by the Hong Kong Coalition of Professional Services in Wan Chai, where he also elaborated on his budget proposals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said the government is very cautious in its approach to adjusting the tax system, as competition remains intense with neighbouring regions to woo global talent and investments.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We believe that at this point, the most important [task] for the society is to concentrate our energy on developing the economy, to fend off external risks, so we do not want to distract our minds at this time, to ignite other controversies due to discussions over the tax regime," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, the finance minister said he expects the government to make extra cash in the coming financial year if Hong Kong's stock market continues to climb in the coming months.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SAR’s stock market has experienced a revival since the start of the year, with the daily average turnover reaching over HK$290 billion during Tuesday's trading session, compared with the daily average of about HK$130 billion last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When I was calculating for the budget… I was assuming that the daily average stock turnover will be about HK$110 billion, but now we are talking about HK$200 billion," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Every HK$100 billion of turnover brings me about HK$130 million of stock stamp duty, so that's about 10 percent of the total. And if the daily average turnover is about HK$200 billion, that means we'll get an extra HK$130 million of revenue each day, and there are 250 [trading] days in a year, which will be a lot of money," he added.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The third annual session of the 14th National People’s Congress (NPC) concluded in Beijing on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  President Xi Jinping and other leaders attended the closing at the Great Hall of the People.
  <br>
  <br>
  But there was one notable absence: Zhao Leji, the NPC Standing Committee chairman, suffered a respiratory infection.
  <br>
  <br>
  His deputy, vice-chairman Li Hongzhong, took his place and presided over the ceremony.
  <br>
  <br>
  In his closing speech, Li declared the week-long session a success.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The meeting fully demonstrated democracy, and all work was conducted in strict accordance with the law. We identified our goals and tasks and also conveyed confidence and strength. It is a meeting about delivering real results through solid work, as well as forging unity,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Let us rally around the leadership of the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at the core, forge ahead with perseverance and diligence, and further contribute to the country’s modernisation with Chinese characteristics.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Nearly 2,900 NPC delegates in attendance passed seven draft resolutions, including one endorsing the annual government work report delivered by Premier Li Qiang last week.

<div class="itemFullText">
 China said on Tuesday it hoped a "just and lasting solution" can be found to the three-year war between Ukraine and Russia, ahead of talks that will involve Ukrainian and US officials in Saudi Arabia.
 <br>
  <br>
  "China supports all efforts that contribute to a peaceful resolution of the crisis," said Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning when asked about the talks at a regular news conference in Beijing.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We expect and hope that parties can reach a just and lasting solution that is acceptable to all sides," said Mao.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China is also willing to continue to work with the international community to play a constructive role for a political resolution of the crisis," she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The talks in Saudi Arabia will be the most senior since a disastrous White House visit last month when US President Donald Trump berated Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky for purported ingratitude.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zelensky has met with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman ahead of the talks between Ukrainian and US officials.
  <br>
  <br>
  During the meeting in Jeddah, the crown prince underscored the kingdom's support for international efforts to resolve Ukraine's crisis and achieving peace, the Saudi state news agency SPA reported early on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The United States, once Ukraine's main ally, has upended its policy on the conflict in its stated pursuit of a rapid end to the fighting, engaging directly with Moscow while stopping military assistance and intelligence sharing for Ukraine.

    Arab nations condemn Israel's Gaza electricity cut

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Jordan on Tuesday condemned Israel's decision to cut electricity supply to the war-battered Gaza Strip, calling in separate statements for the international community to take action.
 <br>
  <br>
  Israel announced on Sunday it was disconnecting the only power line to a water desalination plant in Gaza, in an effort to pressure Palestinian militant group Hamas into releasing hostages amid an apparent impasse in truce talks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Saudi Arabia's foreign ministry expressed "condemnation in the strongest terms of the Israeli occupation authorities' use of collective punishment against Palestinians in the Gaza Strip by cutting off electricity to the area".
  <br>
  <br>
  A Qatari foreign ministry statement said the Gulf state "strongly condemns the Israeli occupation's act of cutting electricity to the Gaza Strip, considering it a blatant violation of international humanitarian law".
  <br>
  <br>
  Jordanian foreign ministry spokesman Sufyan Qudah called the electricity cut "a clear continuation of the policy of starvation and siege imposed by Israel", about a week after Israeli authorities blocked the entry of aid into Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  The United Nations has warned of "dire consequences" for Gaza's population, while Britain said it was "deeply concerned" by the Israeli move.
  <br>
  <br>
  Saudi Arabia called on the international community to "take urgent actions immediately", while Qatar also urged "immediate action to provide the necessary protection for the Palestinian people".
  <br>
  <br>
  Jordan's Qudah called on the world "to assume its legal and moral responsibilities, and oblige Israel to continue with the ceasefire agreement... restore electricity to Gaza" and reopen border crossings for aid deliveries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israeli negotiators were expected to hold talks with mediators in Qatar, part of efforts to extend a fragile truce since January that has largely halted the war in Gaza, triggered by Hamas's attack on Israel on October 7, 2023. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A mainland man was jailed for three months on Tuesday, after pleading guilty to using fake academic qualifications to gain a spot in a Chinese University (CUHK) postgraduate programme.
 <br>
  <br>
  Bao Junyang, 30, admitted to obtaining services by deception at Shatin Court.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prosecutors dropped a separate charge of using a false statement to obtain an entry permit against the defendant.
  <br>
  <br>
  The court heard that Bao claimed to have graduated from New York University, and managed to gain admission to CUHK's Master of Business Administration programme around two years ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  Acting principle magistrate Cheang Kei-hong rejected the defence's plea for a community service order, saying it would be unrealistic.
  <br>
  <br>
  The magistrate gave one third of a discount for the jail sentence due to the guilty plea.

  Li Denghai, known as "the father of hybrid corn", attended the symposium on February 17 – which also included tech giants Alibaba, Huawei and Tencent, as well as emerging tech company DeepSeek – at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was the first meeting between Xi and private entrepreneurs in six years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Li quoted the president as saying China will unwaveringly encourage, support and guide the development of the non-public sector economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This has made us more confident and determined in developing private enterprises. It felt like a reassurance," he told RTHK in an exclusive interview on the sidelines of the "Two Sessions" in Beijing.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We learned that capable private companies can work on important national projects, and have a platform or opportunity to serve the country and show what we're capable of doing. We're excited that we can play a part in the country's development."
  <br>
  <br>
  When asked about challenges, the National People's Congress deputy said growing his seed business isn't easy because of strict rules for land use.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In terms of the overall development process, we need to have land and build facilities, which require government approval. This is still quite challenging, right? Currently, land control is quite strict," Li said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said manpower is another issue because fewer young people want to work in agriculture these days.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing will formulate the private economy promotion law to strengthen legal protections and policy support for private enterprises, as stated in the work report released by the National People's Congress Standing Committee.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chairman of Muyuan Foodstuff Qin Yinglin, who also attended the symposium last month, said the new law showed the country's determination to create a fairer business environment.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a written reply to RTHK, Qin said he hopes the government will continue to improve the legal environment, so private enterprises can dedicate themselves to developing their business.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wei Gejun, an adviser to the People's Bank of China, said the central bank is working with commercial banks to support private enterprises, such as making it easier for companies to get loans.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wei said private companies will continue to get loans at low interest rates for the next few years and have better access to different types of funding.

    Ex-Philippine president Duterte arrested in Manila

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Former Philippine president Rodrigo Duterte was arrested by police at Manila's international airport on Tuesday on the order of the International Criminal Court (ICC) in connection with a case of crime against humanity filed against him, the Philippine government said.
 <br>
  <br>
  The office of the Philippine president said Duterte was arrested after arriving from Hong Kong and police took him into custody on orders of the ICC, which has been investigating the mass killings that happened under the former president's deadly crackdown against illegal drugs.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ICC launched an investigation into drug killings under Duterte from November 1, 2011, when he was still mayor of Davao, to March 16, 2019, as possible crimes against humanity.
  <br>
  <br>
  Duterte withdrew the Philippines in 2019 from the Rome Statute in a move human rights activists say was aimed at escaping accountability over the killings.
  <br>
  <br>
  His administration moved to suspend the global court’s investigation in late 2021 by arguing that Philippine authorities were already looking into the same allegations, arguing the ICC – a court of last resort – did not have jurisdiction.
  <br>
  <br>
  Appeals judges at the ICC ruled in July 2023 the investigation could resume and rejected the Duterte administration’s objections.
  <br>
  <br>
  Based in The Hague, the Netherlands, the ICC can step in when countries are unwilling or unable to prosecute suspects in the most heinous international crimes, including genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity.
  <br>
  <br>
  President Ferdinand Marcos Jr, who succeeded Duterte in 2022 and became entangled in a bitter political dispute with the former president, has decided not to rejoin the global court.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the Marcos administration has said it would cooperate if the ICC asks international police to take Duterte into custody through a so-called Red Notice.
  <br>
  <br>
  China on Tuesday warned the ICC against "politicisation" and "double standards", after Duterte’s arrest.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China has noted the relevant information and is closely monitoring the development of the situation," Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning told a briefing in Beijing when asked about the arrest. (Agencies)

    'Restaurants may need to pay more to delivery firms'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A catering sector representative on Tuesday said he was concerned restaurants would need to pay higher fees for using delivery platforms in future.
 <br>
  <br>
  This came a day after online food delivery platform Deliveroo announced it would shut down its Hong Kong operations next month, leaving Foodpanda and mainland-based Keeta in the sector.
  <br>
  <br>
  Simon Wong, president of the Hong Kong Federation of Restaurants and Related Trades, said eateries might still get away with paying less for the moment, but that would probably not continue.
  <br>
  <br>
  “In the short term, I believe there will be intense competition between the two companies, Foodpanda and Keeta. But in the end when they find a balance where neither can defeat the other, then restaurants may have to accept that there will be fewer discounts,” he told an RTHK radio programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, a marketing professor from Hang Seng University said the delivery market in Hong Kong is saturated and the city could only accommodate two to three delivery platforms at most.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kenneth Kwong told the same programme that delivery platforms need to think of other forms of business opportunities.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The delivery platform operators should come up with new ideas, for example working more closely with restaurants, as well as expanding their business. Can they also deliver household items as well? I think this will open up more space for development in the market,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The scholar thinks Deliveroo made the decision to exit Hong Kong market purely on commercial considerations.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the operating costs for delivery platforms are quite high as they need to update their software and hardware on a regular basis.

    'Snooker hiccup not a problem for National Games'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A local deputy to the National People's Congress has stressed that Hong Kong is ready to co-host its first National Games in November, despite a recent hiccup at a major snooker tournament in Kai Tak.
 <br>
  <br>
  Herman Hu, a former vice-president of the Sports Federation and Olympic Committee of Hong Kong, China, told RTHK in an exclusive interview in Beijing that the organisers had "learned a lesson" after spectators were booted before the end of a match.
  <br>
  <br>
  The newly-opened Kai Tak Sports Park - the venue from where fans enjoying the World Snooker Grand Prix were ejected - is set to host a number of National Games competitions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm quite sure that [the Kai Tak Sports Park] is already ready," said Hu.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on the sidelines of the "Two Sessions" in the capital, he said organisers could learn from what happened during the snooker tournament.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That is not a big problem. I’m sure all the people concerned have ways to tackle that," Hu said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Over 13 days later this year, Hong Kong will host the nation's top athletes in cycling, fencing, rugby sevens, beach volleyball, golf, triathlon, men's handball and men's under-22 basketball.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hu urged officials to better promote these sports and educate the public on "how to appreciate" the competitions, such as organising district tournaments.
  <br>
  <br>
  Additionally, the SAR will help organise cross-border events, including a marathon and road cycling competition.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to Hu, there was room for further collaboration with counterparts across the border.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I personally had a conversation with the Guangdong province's sports bureau and they welcome us to go there anytime. And especially they have a lot more facilities and high-quality coaches, world-class athletes, that can work with our youngsters," Hu said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zhaoqing, one of nine municipalities which make up the Greater Bay Area along with Hong Kong and Macau, will kick-start test events in May.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a written response to RTHK, Zhaoqing mayor Xu Xiaoxiong said the authorities were fully pushing forward preparatory work "in a state similar to a 100-metre sprint".
  <br>
  <br>
  Xu also said the Games could attract 150,000 spectators and tourists to the city, bringing in hundreds of millions of yuan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities from Shantou, a coastal city in eastern Guangdong which will also get a piece of the action, saw the Games as an "important opportunity" to promote regional cooperation and enhance its influence.

    Carney vows 'quick' transition to new government

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Canada's incoming prime minister Mark Carney has promised a "smooth" and "quick" transition from Justin Trudeau after his convincing win in the ruling Liberal Party's leadership race.
 <br>
  <br>
  But speaking on,
  <a href="https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/news-programmes/this-episode.htm?cmsid=77" target="_blank">
   <u>
    <b>
     RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme
    </b>
   </u>
  </a>
  , Professor Al Reyes of the University of Hong Kong told Carol Musgrave that Carney's tough position on President Donald Trump meant that relations between the US and Canada would continue to be fraught.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He made very clear that the retaliatory tariffs that he imposed would remain until there is stability or at least some resolution to the current tariff war, so one can expect 'Trumpy times'... they've been already fraught under [Justin] Trudeau and these waning days, I think they will continue to be once [Mark] Carney takes over," Reyes said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The upcoming general election will be a major test for Carney, a former governor of the Bank of Canada and Bank of England, who has never served in parliament nor held any elected public office.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He does not have a seat in parliament. That's one reason why it would be more likely that a general election would be called very soon, because he has to get a seat in parliament... I think the key challenges for him, not just trying to figure out how to deal with the United States, but also what are the alternatives in terms of trade and investment if relations with the United States are so difficult."
  <br>
  <br>
  Reyes added that domestically, the cost of housing, eliminating the carbon tax and immigration would be key issues for Carney going forward.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The New Orleans Pelicans will become the first NBA team to play in Australia when they tip off in two pre-season games in October, organisers said.
 <br>
  <br>
  Both matches, against Melbourne United and Melbourne Phoenix, will be played at Melbourne Park, best known for hosting the Australian Open tennis Grand Slam.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The significance of this announcement for basketball in Australia and the NBL can't be overstated," Larry Kestelman, owner and director of Australia's National Basketball League, said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hosting an NBA team in Australia has been a long-held dream for everyone at the NBL and to see this initiative finally come to fruition after a 15-year journey shows that much can be accomplished when you 'dream big'."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Pelicans, who feature two-time NBA All-Star Zion Williamson and top point guard Dejounte Murray, will be in action on October 3 and 5.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is an exciting moment for our organisation and a testament to the growing global impact of the NBA," said Pelicans president Dennis Lauscha.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Bringing the Pelicans and NBA to Australia for the first time is a proud milestone, and we are thrilled to be part of this unique opportunity to engage with fans in Melbourne," he added. (AFP)

    Arrest of pro-Palestinian student sparks outrage

<img alt="A demonstrator is detained by police officers during a protest following the arrest by US immigration agents of Palestinian student protester Mahmoud Khalil, in New York City. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795219_1_20250311105218.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Protesters in New York and rights groups expressed outrage on Monday over the arrest of a leader of pro-Palestinian demonstrations at Columbia University, as President Donald Trump vowed further crackdowns.
 <br>
  <br>
  Mahmoud Khalil, a recent graduate and one of the most prominent faces of the university's high-profile protests, was arrested by US immigration officials over the weekend despite holding a permanent residency green card.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Department of Homeland Security, confirming Khalil's arrest on Sunday, claimed he had "led activities aligned to Hamas" and that the DHS action was taken "in coordination with the Department of State."
  <br>
  <br>
  "We know there are more students at Columbia and other Universities across the Country who have engaged in pro-terrorist, anti-Semitic, anti-American activity, and the Trump Administration will not tolerate it," the president wrote on Monday on his Truth Social platform.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is the first arrest of many to come," he pledged.
  <br>
  <br>
  The protests at Columbia, launched last year in opposition to Israel's devastating war in Gaza, brought widespread media attention as tensions mounted on campus and spread to other universities around the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump and other Republicans have broadly accused the protesters of supporting Hamas.
  <br>
  <br>
  While the Trump administration moves to quickly deport Khalil, who has reportedly been moved to the southern state of Louisiana, a federal judge on Monday ordered authorities to halt proceedings.
  <br>
  <br>
  The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) condemned Khalil's arrest, calling it "unprecedented, illegal, and un-American."
  <br>
  <br>
  "The government's actions are obviously intended to intimidate and chill speech on one side of a public debate," said Ben Wizner, director of the ACLU's Speech, Privacy and Technology Project, in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Monday afternoon, over 1,000 protesters gathered in New York to express their outrage at Khalil's arrest.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This was essentially a kidnapping," said 42-year-old Tobi, who declined to give her last name for fear of retaliation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It seems like a clear targeting of activists, which is a really, really dangerous precedent," she said. (AFP)

 Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index fell 508.63 points, or 2.14 percent, to open at 23,274.86 points on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The sell-off followed a sharp fall in US stocks overnight, with investors concerned that US President Donald Trump's tariff policy could tip the world's biggest economy into recession. The three main US indices lost between two and four percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tokyo's Nikkei-225 and Seoul's Kospi Index also fell by over two percent in early trading.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The UK coastguard ended the search for a missing crew member after a cargo ship ran into a US-military charted tanker carrying jet fuel in the North Sea on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  HM Coastguard rescued 36 crew members from the Stena Immaculate tanker and Solong container vessel, with one taken to hospital.
  <br>
  <br>
  "One crew member of the Solong remains unaccounted for. After an extensive search for the missing crew member sadly they have not been found and the search has ended," said Matthew Atkinson, Divisional Commander for HM Coastguard.
  <br>
  <br>
  Images showed a huge plume of thick, black smoke and flames rising from the scene about 16 kilometres off the east England coast, sparking concerns of "multiple toxic hazards".
  <br>
  <br>
  The Stena Immaculate tanker was "anchored off the North Sea coast near Hull...
  <br>
  [and] was struck by the container ship Solong", the Stena's US-based operators Crowley said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Stena was on a short-term US military charter with Military Sealift Command, according to Jillian Morris, the spokesperson for the command that operates civilian-crewed ships providing ocean transport for the US Defense Department.
  <br>
  <br>
  Crowley said the impact of the collision "ruptured" the tanker "containing A1-jet fuel" and triggered a fire, with fuel "reported released".
  <br>
  <br>
  It was carrying around 220,000 barrels of jet fuel while the Solong was carrying 15 containers of sodium cyanide, according to the Lloyd's List information service, but it is not known if any of the flammable compound had leaked.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two vessels were still on fire 12 hours after the collision, said the coastguard.
  <br>
  <br>
  A spokesperson for UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer called the situation "extremely concerning".
  <br>
  <br>
  All crew members aboard the Stena Immaculate were confirmed to be alive, a spokeswoman for the tanker's Swedish owner, Stena Bulk, told AFP.
  <br>
  <br>
  The alarm about the crash near the port city of Hull in East Yorkshire was raised at 0948 GMT.
  <br>
  <br>
  A coastguard helicopter, a plane, lifeboats from four towns and other nearby vessels were part of the large rescue operation, UK Coastguard said. (AFP)

<img alt="Data shows on a seasonally adjusted, month-on-month basis, spending dropped 4.5 percent in the last quarter of 2024. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795200_1_20250311085336.jpg&q=45">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Japan's economy expanded in the October-December quarter at a slower pace than initially reported, government data showed on Tuesday, weighed by weaker consumption but still likely supporting the case for further interest rate hikes.
 <br>
  <br>
  Gross domestic product expanded an annualised 2.2 percent in the three months to December, the Cabinet Office's revised data showed, slower than the 2.8 percent growth in the initial estimate and economists' median forecast.
  <br>
  <br>
  The revised numbers translate into a quarter-on-quarter expansion of 0.6 percent in price-adjusted terms, compared with a 0.7 percent growth issued on February 17.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Bank of Japan raised short-term interest rates in January to their highest in 17 years, and growth momentum in the world's fourth-largest economy will be among key factors determining how fast it continues to tighten policy.
  <br>
  <br>
  The capital expenditure component of GDP, a barometer of private demand-led strength, rose 0.6 percent in the fourth quarter, revised up from a 0.5 percent expansion in the initial estimate.
  <br>
  <br>
  Private consumption, which accounts for more than half of economic activity, was unchanged versus the preliminary reading of 0.1 percent uptick.
  <br>
  <br>
  External demand, or exports minus imports, contributed 0.7 of a percentage point to growth, unchanged from the preliminary reading. Domestic demand shaved 0.2 of a percentage point off.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separate data from the internal affairs ministry showed household spending rose 0.8 percent in January year-on-year.
  <br>
  <br>
  On a seasonally adjusted, month-on-month basis, spending dropped 4.5 percent, bigger than an estimated 1.9 percent decline. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 At least 25 people were killed in two separate bus crashes in Mexico on Monday, authorities said.
 <br>
  <br>
  In the country's north, 14 people died in a fiery collision between a tractor-trailer and a bus carrying passengers from the US state of Texas, civil protection authorities in Durango state said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Of the 24 people travelling in the bus, only 10 managed to get out alive, it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  In southern Mexico, a bus turned over along a highway in Oaxaca state, killing 11 people, authorities said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Twelve others were taken to the hospital with injuries, two of them in critical condition, the Oaxaca state government said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I extend my heartfelt condolences to the victims' families, to whom we will provide the necessary support and assistance during this difficult time," Oaxaca Governor Salomon Jara said on social media.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a interview on local radio on Monday afternoon, the state's interior minister, Jesus Romero, said the bus was carrying more than 40 people and was en route to the Isthmus of Tehuantepec in Mexico's south.
  <br>
  <br>
  Romero said it seemed that the passengers were heading home after attending a rally held on Sunday by President Claudia Sheinbaum in the capital Mexico City.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities will launch an investigation into the cause of the accident, which happened near the community of Santo Domingo Narro, it said. (Agencies)

    Musk claims X targeted in 'massive cyberattack'

<img alt="More than 40,000 users reported having no access to the platform, according to the tracking website Downdetector.com. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795191_1_20250311082846.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Elon Musk said his social media platform, X, has been targeted in a “massive cyberattack", hours after a series of outages on Monday left it unavailable to thousands of users.
 <br>
  <br>
  “We get attacked every day, but this was done with a lot of resources," Musk claimed in a post. "Either a large, coordinated group and/or a country is involved. Tracing..."
  <br>
  <br>
  Later on Monday, Musk said on Fox Business Network’s Kudlow that the attackers had “IP addresses originating in the Ukraine area" without going into detail on what this might mean.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cybersecurity experts quickly pointed out, however, that this doesn't necessarily mean that an attack originated in Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  Security researcher Kevin Beaumont said on Bluesky that Musk's claim is “missing a key fact - it was actually IPs from worldwide, not just Ukraine.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Specifically, he said it was a Mirai variant botnet, which is made of compromised cameras. He said while he is not sure who is behind the attack, it “Smells of APTs - advanced persistent teenagers.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Allan Liska of the cybersecurity firm Recorded Future, meanwhile, pointed out that even if “every IP address that hit Twitter today originated from Ukraine (doubtful), they were most likely compromised machines controlled by a botnet run by a third party that could be located anywhere in the world.”
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 40,000 users reported having no access to the platform, according to the tracking website Downdetector.com. By Monday afternoon, the reports had dropped to the low thousands.
  <br>
  <br>
  A sustained outage that lasted at least an hour began at noon, with the heaviest disruptions occurring along the US coasts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Downdetector.com said that 56 percent of problems were reported for the X app, while 33 percent were reported for the website.
  <br>
  <br>
  Musk bought the former Twitter in 2022 and also serves as the CEO of Tesla. (AP)

    Newcastle sink West Ham to boost top four bid

<img alt="Bruno Guimarães put Newcastle in front early in the second half. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795186_1_20250311070727.jpg&q=35">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Newcastle reignited their bid to qualify for the Champions League as Bruno Guimarães sealed a controversial 1-0 win at West Ham.
 <br>
  <br>
  Brazil midfielder Guimarães struck in the second half as West Ham's claims for a foul in the build-up were ignored.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eddie Howe's side are up to sixth place in the Premier League, level on points with fifth-placed Manchester City and two points behind fourth-placed Chelsea.
  <br>
  <br>
  A top four berth will guarantee Newcastle return to the Champions League after missing out this season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Even finishing fifth could be enough to ensure qualification for Europe's elite club competition depending on the results of the remaining English clubs in continental action.
  <br>
  <br>
  After losing three of their last four matches, the Magpies' restorative victory was perfectly timed ahead of their second League Cup final appearance in three seasons.
  <br>
  <br>
  Newcastle, beaten by Manchester United in the League Cup showpiece in 2023, face Premier League leaders Liverpool in the final at Wembley on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Tyneside club are aiming to win their first major trophy since the 1969 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup and their first domestic prize since the 1955 FA Cup.
  <br>
  <br>
  "One of our best wins of the season, not in terms of performance but desire and heart," Howe said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I felt we were in need of a win to go into the final with a real boost. It will do us the world of good," he added. "Also for our league table position today was vital."
  <br>
  <br>
  West Ham boss Graham Potter added: "We didn't do enough to win the game but we could have got something out of it."
  <br>
  <br>
  "The goal was disappointing, we felt there was a push on Kilman," he said. "It's two hands on the back. You can see from Isak's non celebration he thinks it's a push. Clear for us, but I'm not VAR." (AFP)

    Wall Street sells off on US recession fears

<img alt="The main three US indices fell between 2 percent and 4 percent. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795182_1_20250311061228.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks fell sharply on Monday as investors fretted that uncertainty over President Donald Trump's tariff policy could tip the world's biggest economy into a recession.
 <br>
  <br>
  The moves came after Trump refused to rule out the possibility of a 2025 recession, saying there would be "a period of transition, because what we're doing is very big -- we're bringing wealth back to America."
  <br>
  <br>
  Tech stocks led the slump, with the tech-focused Nasdaq Composite Index marking its largest one-day loss since 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Nasdaq plunged by 4.0 percent, bringing it to 17,468.32.
  <br>
  <br>
  The broad-based S&P 500 Index retreated 2.7 percent to 5,614.56 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average slid 2.1 percent to 41,911.71.
  <br>
  <br>
  Major tech names saw sharp losses, with Tesla shares diving 15.4 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Others among the so-called Magnificent Seven stocks -- which include Google parent Alphabet, Amazon, Meta and Nvidia -- also sank.
  <br>
  <br>
  While markets were previously bolstered by hopes of tax cuts and lighter regulation, Steve Sosnick of Interactive Brokers noted that sentiment has been bogged down by more immediate worries over tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since taking office in January, Trump has imposed sweeping tariffs on imports from Canada, Mexico and China -- even as he backed off some of the levies on his country's immediate neighbors.
  <br>
  <br>
  A new wave of tariffs threatens to hit this week, with steep levies of 25 percent on steel and aluminum due to take effect Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Ongoing confusion about tariffs and concerns that maybe the Doge cuts are excessive led to a drop in consumer sentiment, and are now leading to fears of a slowdown or higher inflation or both," Sosnick said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was referring to sweeping cuts to the federal government overseen by Trump's billionaire advisor Elon Musk and his so-called Department of Government Efficiency (Doge). (AFP)

    New Canada PM 'should be pragmatic in China policy'

<div class="itemFullText">
 China hopes that the incoming government in Canada will adopt a positive and pragmatic approach towards Beijing, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said on Monday after Mark Carney's victory in the leadership race for Canada's ruling party, paving the way for him to succeed Justin Trudeau as prime minister.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a regular press conference, Mao congratulated the former central banker on his win, while urging Canada to work with China to promote improvement and development of relations.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We expect Canada to adhere to an objective and rational understanding of China and pursue a positive and pragmatic policy towards China," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mao also said the two countries should develop relations based on mutual respect, equality and mutual benefit.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carney's victory came after Beijing announced tariffs on over US$2.6 billion worth of Canadian agricultural and food products on Saturday, in retaliation against levies Ottawa introduced in October.
  <br>
  <br>
  The levies, scheduled to take effect on March 20, match the 100 percent and 25 percent import duties Canada imposed on China-made electric vehicles and steel and aluminium products. (Xinhua/Reuters)

 The United States does not appear to want to make a deal with Brussels to avoid hefty tariffs against the EU, the bloc's trade chief said on Monday, days before US steel and aluminium levies kick in.
 <br>
  <br>
  "The US administration does not seem to be engaging to make a deal," said Maros Sefcovic, who travelled to Washington last month in the hopes of reaching an agreement to avert a trade war.
  <br>
  <br>
  President Donald Trump has taken aim squarely at the European Union, charging last month that the bloc was formed "to screw" the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Wednesday, Trump's 25-percent tariffs across steel and aluminium imports are due to take effect, affecting the EU as well as Canada, Mexico, Brazil, South Korea and other trading partners.
  <br>
  <br>
  The EU has said it will respond firmly if the levies come into force.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As the US is watching over their interest, so is the European Union. Therefore, we will always protect European businesses, workers and consumers from unjustified tariffs because we know that they expect no less from us," Sefcovic told reporters in Brussels.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the trade commissioner stressed that the EU remained open to dialogue.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We want to have a constructive and positive relationship with the United States of America. And therefore, I would highlight once again that our doors are open for constructive engagement," Sefcovic said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also insisted the "overall picture" showed EU-US trade relations were balanced and mutually beneficial.
  <br>
  <br>
  The United States is Europe's largest investor, and vice versa, with US$5.7 trillion worth of investment in each others' markets based on 2022 data, according to EU figures. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Israel is due to send a delegation to Qatar on Monday for a fresh round of talks on extending a fragile ceasefire in Gaza, after cutting off the electricity supply to the besieged enclave.
 <br>
  <br>
  The first phase of the deal expired at the beginning of March with no agreement on subsequent stages that should secure a lasting end to Israel's war in Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamas accused Israel of reneging on the ceasefire deal, saying in a statement on Monday Israel "refuses to commence the second phase, exposing its intentions of evasion and stalling".
  <br>
  <br>
  Media reports said a top official from the domestic security agency Shin Bet will lead Israel's delegation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel has halted aid deliveries to Gaza amid the deadlock, and on Sunday announced it was cutting off the territory's electricity supply.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will use all the tools at our disposal to bring back the hostages and ensure that Hamas is no longer in Gaza the day after" the war, Energy Minister Eli Cohen said as he ordered the power cut.
  <br>
  <br>
  The move echoed the early days of the war when Israel announced a "complete siege" on the Palestinian territory, severing the electricity supply which was only restored in mid-2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamas spokesman Abdul Latif al-Qanoua said Israel's move will impact its hostages still held in Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The decision to cut electricity is a failed option and poses a threat to its (Israeli) prisoners, who will only be freed through negotiations," Qanoua said in a statement on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Germany criticised Israel on Monday for its latest decisions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Foreign ministry spokeswoman Kathrin Deschauer said Gaza was "again threatened with a food shortage" and that cutting off electricity was "unacceptable and not compatible with (Israel's) obligations under international law". (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Russia said on Monday it was expelling two British "diplomats" on suspicion of carrying out espionage activities.
 <br>
  <br>
  Russia's FSB security service said "counterintelligence work had revealed an undeclared British intelligence presence under the cover of the national embassy".
  <br>
  <br>
  It said it was expelling the embassy's second secretary, whom it named as Alkesh Odedra, and the husband of the first secretary of the embassy's political department, identified as Michael Skinner.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both had "deliberately provided false information when obtaining a permit to enter our country, thus violating Russian legislation", the FSB said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Russian foreign ministry has revoked their accreditations and ordered them to leave Russia within two weeks, the FSB said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The UK blasted the move as unfounded.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is not the first time that Russia has made malicious and baseless accusations against our staff," a UK foreign ministry spokesperson said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Russia's foreign ministry also summoned an embassy representative in connection with the allegations, it said in a post on Telegram.
  <br>
  <br>
  Relations between Moscow and London have been strained by intelligence scandals throughout Russian President Vladimir Putin years in power. (AFP)

 Local shares sank on Monday on a mixed day for equity markets, amid escalating global trade tensions.

  The Hang Seng Index slipped 1.85 percent to 23,783.

  Investors are struggling to keep up with US President Donald Trump's trade policy tinkering, while his refusal to rule out a US recession this year further rattled confidence.

    Deficit not a big problem for HK: Wang Linggui

<div class="itemFullText">
 A deputy director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office on Monday said he does not believe the SAR's fiscal deficit is a major concern, citing the size of the city's economy.
 <br>
  <br>
  Wang Linggui, who's also a member of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), felt Hong Kong remains in a strong position despite an estimated deficit of HK$87.2 billion in the fiscal year ending March 31.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong's economic situation is not weak among developed economies in the world. Its economic growth exceeded two percent last year," he told reporters in Beijing.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A deficit of [around] HK$100 billion shouldn't be a big deal for an economy of Hong Kong's size."
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang noted the central government rolled out preferential policies for Hong Kong last year, adding more will come in the future.
  <br>
  <br>
  For instance, he said a multi-entry visa scheme will continue to expand to make it easier for mainland residents to visit the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he urged Hong Kong residents to be prepared for a rise in arrivals, including the need to draw up crowd control measures.

    Deliveroo to exit HK, sack 200 staff

<img alt="Deliveroo says its service platform will operate until April 7. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795116_1_20250310160730.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Online food delivery firm Deliveroo said on Monday it is exiting Hong Kong for financial reasons, after operating in the SAR for nine years.
 <br>
  <br>
  Its UK-based parent company said its service platform will run until April 7, and it will close Deliveroo's operations by selling some assets to rival foodpanda, and closing other assets.
  <br>
  <br>
  About 200 staff members will be laid off.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There are several dynamics specific to the Hong Kong market which led the Board to consider strategic options," Deliveroo said in a statement, without explaining what the dynamics were.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Given the Group's commitment to disciplined capital allocation, [we] determine that it would not serve shareholders' best interests to continue to operate in Hong Kong."
  <br>
  <br>
  The company's chief operating officer, Eric French, said the firm wants to thank all of its staff, consumers, riders and restaurant and grocery partners in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  Deliveroo said in its 2024 interim results that Hong Kong "was a laggard amongst our major markets", citing "a more difficult market and competitive environment".
  <br>
  <br>
  Its Hong Kong market share fell after the entry of mainland-based Keeta, a subsidiary of Meituan, in late 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  The company said on Monday that Hong Kong represented five percent of the group's gross transaction value in 2024, and had a five percentage point negative impact on international gross transaction value growth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, foodpanda's parent, Delivery Hero, announced it reached an agreement with Deliveroo, saying that some of the outgoing food courier's customers and riders will be directed to foodpanda.
  <br>
  <br>
  Delivery Hero had said in a trading update last month that it saw "strong customer growth" in the SAR in December. (Additional reporting by Reuters)

 Hong Kong will improve as long as everyone works together to tackle the fiscal deficit, a former deputy director of Beijing's liaison office in the SAR said on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Qiu Hong, who is also a member of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), said unity is important when it comes to improving the economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think the deficit is a challenge Hong Kong faces in its development progress. As long as everyone works together and makes a joint effort for Hong Kong's future, I believe the situation will definitely keep improving," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Qiu also expressed optimism about the city's future, noting that residents are actively taking part in national development and Hong Kong's growth.

    Govt welcomes HK$200m donation to support AI

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's finance and technology ministers on Monday welcomed a HK$200 million donation by property developers to support the city’s generative artificial intelligence development.
 <br>
  <br>
  The fund will be used to support the Hong Kong Generative AI Research and Development Centre (HKGAI), and to develop an app for the recently launched HKGAI V1, the SAR's first locally developed generative AI tool.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a press event during which the donation provided by the Ng Teng Fong Charitable Foundation and Sino Group was announced, Financial Secretary Paul Chan said Hong Kong must grasp opportunities brought by AI.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The donation will support the establishment of a service platform for the InnoHK Research Clusters to provide services for residents based on the locally-produced large [AI] model, HKGAI," he told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I look forward to the further development of the model, to extend the platform to cover more application scenarios, so that the services will be more diversified and benefit more local residents," Chan added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong launched the HKGAI V1 large model about two weeks ago. It powers a chatbot called HKChat which is capable of answering users' questions on topics ranging from the SAR's government structure to cinema schedules.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at the same event, the Secretary for Innovation, Technology and Industry, Sun Dong, added that the funds will help make the service platform more market-driven, and help the centre hire more staff.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When you try to run a service system to the general public, you must have enough resources to support this platform, including human power as well as computing power, I think this is the main purpose of this donation," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I also hope the new version, or the mobile version of the large language model of HKGAI will be able to serve Hong Kong people as soon as possible, hopefully in the next several months."
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, Sun dismissed concerns that the latest reduction in government spending announced in last month’s budget will affect research and innovation in technology.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said authorities will support those developments in a more targeted way.

 North Korea fired "multiple unidentified ballistic missiles" on Monday, South Korea's military said, the same day Seoul and Washington began a major annual joint military drill known as Freedom Shield.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Our military has detected at around 4.50am GMT multiple unidentified ballistic missiles fired from Hwanghae province," the Joint Chiefs of Staff said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our military will bolster surveillance and maintain a full readiness posture under close cooperation with the United States," the JCS added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The United States stations tens of thousands of US soldiers in South Korea, and the allies regularly stage joint drills, which they describe as defensive in nature.
  <br>
  <br>
  But such exercises infuriate Pyongyang, which regards them as rehearsals for invasion and routinely responds with weapons tests of its own.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier on Monday, the nuclear-armed North slammed the drills as a "provocative act", warning of the danger of sparking war with "an accidental single shot".
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is a dangerous provocative act of leading the acute situation on the Korean peninsula, which may spark off a physical conflict between the two sides by means of an accidental single shot," said Pyongyang's foreign ministry, according to the Korean Central News Agency.
  <br>
  <br>
  The joint US-South Korea "Freedom Shield 2025" exercise kicked off on Monday, and will involve "live, virtual, and field-based training", according to a US statement. (AFP)

 Four people were injured and one driver fled the scene following a three-vehicle collision in Shing Mun Tunnel early on Monday morning.
 <br>
  <br>
  Two private cars and a taxi collided while travelling towards Sha Tin at about 4am.
  <br>
  <br>
  An online photo showed the taxi had overturned, and significant damage to all three vehicles, including shattered windshields.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police said the 41-year-old female driver of one private car experienced neck pain, and her 27-year-old male passenger reported pain in the hand. Both were hospitalised.
  <br>
  <br>
  Also sent to hospital were the 53-year-old taxi driver – who had chest pain – and his 62-year-old passenger, who suffered abrasions to her head.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police said the driver of the other private car fled the scene.

 Businessman Irons Sze on Monday said Hong Kong's position as an international financial centre is attributed to China's reform and opening up and reinforced by the "One Country, Two Systems" principle.
 <br>
  <br>
  Sze, a Standing Committee member of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), said the SAR plays a vital role in the country's development.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As of the end of 2024, 1,478 mainland enterprises were listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, accounting for more than 80 percent of the total market value and 90 percent of daily transactions," he told reporters in Beijing.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the shipping front, Sze said Hong Kong's ports handled 13 million standard containers in 2024, with 40 percent of cargo coming from the mainland and 60 percent destined for the mainland.
  <br>
  <br>
  He concluded by saying that Hong Kong's future lies in its integration with the mainland, and the city would continue to contribute to the nation's development with its unique advantages.

 The annual session of the country's top advisory body has concluded in Beijing, with a senior state leader calling on members to focus on the "big picture" and deepen unity.
 <br>
  <br>
  President Xi Jinping and other officials attended the closing at the Great Hall of the People on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang Huning, the chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), said the meetings have achieved "fruitful results".
  <br>
  <br>
  He also called on everyone to pursue unity and democracy, as he outlined directives for delegates in his speech.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We must focus on deepening reform, advancing high-quality development, protecting and improving people's livelihood, and ensuring social stability, in carrying out our surveys and making suggestions and proposals," Wang said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We must serve the big picture and people's livelihood through high-quality consultation and suggestions, so as to deepen unity and solidarity."
  <br>
  <br>
  The annual session of the nation’s legislature – the National People's Congress – will close on Tuesday.

 An analyst on Monday agreed with Foreign Minister Wang Yi's statement at the "Two Sessions" last week that China ensured global stability.

  Zoon Ahmed Khan, a research fellow at the Centre for China and Globalisation in Beijing, said on

  , that the uncertainty from trade disputes between the world's major trading powers was creating instability, and that China was positioned to provide a steady hand.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The world needs more certainty, the world needs more cooperation, he [Wang Yi] also mentioned the importance of multilateralism and upholding the UN system which is something that resonates with the vast majority of the world," Khan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Sino-US trade tensions, Khan warned US President Donald Trump's tariffs could backfire on America.
  <br>
  <br>
  "These have not benefited the United States... he [Wang Yi] specifically mentioned that the US has to reflect, first of all, what has the impact of increased tariffs been on their own economy, on their own development."

  In a Fox News interview on Sunday, US President Donald Trump declined to predict whether his tariffs on China, Canada and Mexico would result in a US recession.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wall Street futures sank and the safe-haven yen and Swiss franc strengthened early on Monday as deflationary pressures in China added to growth worries.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the mainland, the benchmark Shanghai Composite Index was basically flat at the opening, rising 0.02 percent to 3,373.26 points. The Shenzhen Component Index also opened slightly higher, rising 0.18 percent to10,862.93 points. (with additional reporting from Xinhua and Reuters)

  <br>
  <br>
  "Apart from maintaining our existing niches of system, such as the legal system, the economic and financial system, we have to explore more opportunities in terms of tech and international relations," Leung said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is a unique role of Hong Kong and the message is very clear: we also have to maximise some of the uniqueness in One Country, Two Systems, such as becoming an international trade dispute centre, arbitration centre as well as the only bi-lingual system that practices common law."

    Freed scammers still trapped in Myanmar

<img alt="China repatriates its citizens freed from scam centres on to a chartered flight at Mae Sot International Airport on February 20, 2025. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795054_1_20250310092617.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The first major global effort to crack down on the fast-growing industry of scamming is turning into a growing humanitarian crisis.
 <br>
  <br>
  While a dramatic and highly-publicised operation by the Thai, Chinese and Myanmar authorities has led to the release of more than 7,000 people from online scam compounds in Myanmar, for many it is the beginning of another nightmare.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than a month after the crackdown began, thousands of people are still detained in Myanmar, kept in overcrowded and unhygienic conditions by the armed groups that arranged their release.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Associated Press obtained exclusive photos of people squatting in rows, stacked against each other, surgical masks covering some of their eyes and mouths.
  <br>
  <br>
  In clandestine calls, survivors say they fear for their lives as illness is rampant and conditions are unsafe.
  <br>
  <br>
  They sleep on floors in army camps or former scam compounds guarded by armed militia groups. In one army camp, 800 people are sharing 10 toilets, one survivor said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Getting home is dependent on the resources available by country.
  <br>
  <br>
  China sent a chartered flight to the tiny Mae Sot airport to pick up its citizens, but few other governments have matched that.
  <br>
  <br>
  There are roughly 130 Ethiopians waiting on a Thai military base, stuck for want of a US$600 plane ticket.
  <br>
  <br>
  Their plight has drawn concern from the US State Department and demands for their release from international human rights organisations, but Thai officials won't allow people to cross the border until their home countries arrange for them to leave immediately.
  <br>
  <br>
  There are a handful of advocacy groups operating at the border helping.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thailand is working with embassies to coordinate the release and handover of people, but said it can only handle up to 300 people per day, down from 500 initially.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gangs running illegal scams have trapped hundreds of thousands of people in locked compounds in Myanmar, Cambodia and other places in Southeast Asia.
  <br>
  <br>
  The victims say they were lured with promises of lucrative jobs, only to find themselves locked in buildings where they describe being forced to sit at computers up to 16 hours a day running scams. Refusing to work could bring beatings, starvation and electric shocks.
  <br>
  <br>
  As outrage grew in China following the kidnapping of a young actor, Beijing pressured authorities in Thailand and Myanmar to act.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Thai government cut off power and electricity, and government-aligned armed groups that control areas near Myanmar's border with Thailand released several thousand people from scam centres. But no bosses were arrested. (AP)

    7-Eleven explores sell-offs with Couche-Tard

<img alt="Seven & i operates some 85,000 convenience stores worldwide. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795045_1_20250310090227.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Japanese owner of 7-Eleven said on Monday it had agreed to jointly explore store sell-offs with Alimentation Couche-Tard (ACT) to address antitrust concerns ahead of a potential merger.
 <br>
  <br>
  It comes just days after Seven & i - which has wholly-owned 7-Eleven, the world's biggest convenience store brand, since 2005 - announced a raft of new measures to fend off a takeover from its Canadian rival.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Joint outreach by financial advisors to ACT and 7&i to potential buyers has begun," Seven & i said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Couche-Tard has agreed to jointly "map out the viability of a divestiture process by defining operational, management, and financial characteristics of the group of stores to be sold and identifying potential buyers", it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This would provide some insight into the prospects of success along terms that had a reasonable likelihood of satisfying US antitrust regulators," Seven & i said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We and our advisors believe we can now make progress towards determining whether a credible and actionable remedy and divestiture package can be achieved that would allow a realistic assessment of ACT's proposal."
  <br>
  <br>
  On Thursday, the Tokyo-based company announced a huge share buyback and an IPO of its US unit - the latest twist in a saga that began last year, when Seven & i rebuffed a takeover offer worth nearly US$40 billion from ACT.
  <br>
  <br>
  When Seven & i rejected the initial takeover offer from ACT in September, the company said it had "grossly" undervalued its business and could face regulatory hurdles.
  <br>
  <br>
  Such a takeover would be the biggest foreign buyout of a Japanese firm, merging the 7-Eleven, Circle K and other franchises to create a global convenience store behemoth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Seven & i, which operates some 85,000 convenience stores worldwide, also named Stephen Dacus as its first foreign CEO on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  ACT, which began with one store in Quebec in 1980, runs nearly 17,000 convenience store outlets worldwide, including Circle K. (AFP)

    Unsold homes dampens interest for new sites: tycoon

<div class="itemFullText">
 A property tycoon says he believes Hong Kong developers will take a "conservative" approach over acquiring new plots, noting such firms still had a lot of unsold units.
 <br>
  <br>
  In an exclusive interview with RTHK, David Chiu – who sits on the Standing Committee of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference – also said this year might see some unsuccessful government land tenders.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Far East Consortium chairman said given the ample supply in inventory, developers would not feel the need to purchase more sites, likening it to “taking a break from eating and clearing the system when one’s full".
  <br>
  <br>
  “I believe now the stock in hand by all the property developers collectively – stock that they want to sell – could be as high as 20,000 to 30,000 units,” he told RTHK on the sidelines of the Two Sessions in Beijing.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I think a lot of developers' minds today... with interest rates being so high... is how to reduce their gearing first.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The government has announced plans to put eight residential plots up for sale in the coming year, but not any commercial sites.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The good news is the government has stopped selling commercial land, which I think is sensible and smart. But we've still got close to 10 pieces of land they want to sell,” Chiu said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “My advice to the government... I would not be too aggressive.”
  <br>
  <br>
  While home prices in the SAR tumbled 7.1 percent in 2024, the businessman said the property market was not expected to weaken further.
  <br>
  <br>
  It would be “unlikely” for residential property prices to skyrocket, Chiu added.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The price should be stable. It's not going up because of two reasons. Number one, interest rates still remain high. Secondly, frankly, supply is still quite sufficient,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Chiu cautioned the commercial real estate market sentiment remained weak, with an oversupply of office buildings.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chiu, separately, is a proponent of taking part in the development of the Northern Metropolis, citing the cheaper costs and proximity to Shenzhen.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I believe the future growth of China… is the Greater Bay [Area]. One of the local motifs of the Greater Bay [Area] is Shenzhen,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We got the wisdom, we got the education, we got the capital market, but we haven’t gotten the people… We need China as a backup. So linking up [mainland Chinese] young people and Hong Kong’s young people on high-tech is going to be a fantastic marriage.”

    Trump declines to rule out 2025 US recession

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump declined on Sunday to rule out the possibility that the United States might enter a recession this year.
 <br>
  <br>
  "I hate to predict things like that," he told a Fox News interviewer when asked directly about a possible recession in 2025.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There is a period of transition, because what we're doing is very big - we're bringing wealth back to America," he said, adding, "It takes a little time."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, was more definitive when asked on Sunday about the possibility of a recession.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Absolutely not," he told NBC's "Meet the Press" when asked whether Americans should brace for a downturn.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's on-again, off-again tariff threats against Canada, Mexico, China and others have left the US financial markets in turmoil and consumers unsure what the year might bring.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stock markets just ended their worst week since the November election.
  <br>
  <br>
  Measures of consumer confidence are down, as shoppers - already battered by years of inflation - brace for the higher prices that tariffs can bring.
  <br>
  <br>
  And widespread government lay-offs being engineered by Trump's billionaire advisor Elon Musk add further concern.
  <br>
  <br>
  When asked later on Sunday to clarify his remarks on whether there could be a recession, Trump told reports on Air Force One "Who knows?"
  <br>
  <br>
  Overall, the signs are mixed.
  <br>
  <br>
  A widely-watched Atlanta Federal Reserve index now predicts a 2.4 percent contraction of real GDP growth in the year's first quarter, which would be the worst result since the height of the Covid-19 pandemic.
  <br>
  <br>
  Economists at Goldman Sachs, citing Trump's policies, have raised their odds of a recession over the next 12 months from 15 percent to 20 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  And Morgan Stanley predicted "softer growth this year" than earlier expected.
  <br>
  <br>
  Recessions are generally defined as two consecutive quarters of weak or negative GDP growth.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US was briefly in recession in early 2020 as the Covid pandemic spread. Millions of people lost jobs. (AFP)

<img alt="Three-time NBA MVP Nikola Jokic finished one assist shy of a triple-double in the defeat. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795042_2_20250310082123.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Shai Gilgeous-Alexander outdueled MVP rival Nikola Jokic with a 40-point performance as the Oklahoma City Thunder produced a late barrage to defeat the Denver Nuggets 127-103.
 <br>
  <br>
  A pulsating battle between the NBA Western Conference heavyweights was settled by a fourth quarter offensive onslaught from Oklahoma City, who outscored Denver 41-20 in the final frame to romp to victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gilgeous-Alexander – widely seen as the front-runner to succeed Jokic as the league's Most Valuable Player – was instrumental in the Thunder's strong finish.
  <br>
  <br>
  The gifted Canadian point guard once again came up big when it mattered, slamming the door on Denver after the Nuggets had got to within one point of OKC at the start of the fourth quarter after clawing their way back from an 11-point deficit in the third.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gilgeous-Alexander added nine points in the fourth quarter to complete his 11th 40-point of the season, putting the Thunder within touching distance of clinching their place in the postseason.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Thunder are now 53-11 at the top of the Western Conference after their seventh straight victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We were able to get stops down the stretch and then just execute," Gilgeous-Alexander said of the Thunder's fourth-quarter bombardment.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That's what it's going to come down to when teams are so good. It's never going to be pretty all the time but if you get stops and execute you'll give yourself a chance no matter who you play."
  <br>
  <br>
  Remarkably, Gilgeous-Alexander's 40-point game came despite him making just two of 11 three-point attempts.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the 26-year-old shrugged off his struggles from long range by attacking the rim to keep the points flowing for OKC.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That's where it all starts – easy baskets," Gilgeous-Alexander told ESPN. "That's my comfort zone. I didn't make as many shots as I wanted to, but we got a win so I don't care."
  <br>
  <br>
  Gilgeous-Alexander meanwhile shrugged off the hype surrounding his head-to-head with reigning MVP Jokic, the Serbian star who came into the game fresh from a historic triple double of 31 points, 21 rebounds and 22 assists in Friday's win over the Phoenix Suns.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I love MVPs, I love All-Stars, I love all the things that come with it but none of it matters if you don't win," Gilgeous-Alexander said. "That's where I hang my hat."
  <br>
  <br>
  Gilgeous-Alexander received scoring support from Jalen Williams with 26 points, while Chet Holmgren added 14.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jokic meanwhile finished with 24 points, 13 rebounds and nine assists, with Michael Porter Jr. also adding 24 points. (AFP)

    Mark Carney to succeed Trudeau as Canadian PM

<div class="itemFullText">
 Former central banker Mark Carney won the race to become leader of Canada's ruling Liberal Party and will succeed Justin Trudeau as prime minister, official results showed on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Carney will take over at a tumultuous time in Canada, which is in the midst of a trade war with longtime ally the United States and must hold a general election soon.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carney, 59, beat former Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland who came in second place in a contest in which just over 150,000 party members voted.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trudeau announced in January that he would step down after more than nine years in power as his approval rating plummeted, forcing the ruling Liberal Party to run a quick contest to replace him.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carney, a political novice, argued that he was best placed to revive the party and to oversee trade negotiations with US President Donald Trump, who is threatening additional tariffs that could cripple Canada's export-dependent economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carney was the front-runner, with the most endorsements from party members and the most money raised among the four Liberal candidates.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carney's win marks the first time an outsider with no real political background has become Canadian prime minister. He has said his experience as the first person to serve as the governor of two G7 central banks - Canada and England - meant he was the best candidate to deal with Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  During the campaign, Carney said he supported dollar-for-dollar retaliatory tariffs against the United States and a coordinated strategy to boost investment. He has repeatedly complained that Canada's growth under Trudeau was not good enough.
  <br>
  <br>
  The prospect of a fresh start for the Liberal Party under Carney, combined with Trump's tariffs and his repeated taunts to annex Canada as the 51st U.S. state, led to a remarkable revival of Liberal fortunes. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Rohit Sharma made a combative 76 to back up a potent spin bowling display as India beat New Zealand by four wickets to win a record third Champions Trophy title.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chasing 252 to win, India got off to a fast start through their captain's first half-century of the tournament before KL Rahul hit an unbeaten 34 to help seal victory with six balls to spare in the final in Dubai.
  <br>
  <br>
  India added to their trophies in 2002 and 2013 to go past Australia, who have two titles.
  <br>
  <br>
  The world number's one ODI team, India finished unbeaten in the eight-nation tournament played in Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is very nice," Rohit said. "We played some good cricket though the tournament. To have the result our way is a great feeling."
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's been amazing, we wanted to bounce back after a tough Australia tour. Lovely playing with a bunch of amazing youngsters," star batsman Virat Kohli said. "They're stepping up and taking India in the right direction."
  <br>
  <br>
  "When you leave, you want to leave in a better position. So many impactful knocks (Shubman) Gill, Shreyas (Iyer), Rahul have played. The team is in good hands," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both Kohli and Rohit had a lean run of form in India's 3-1 Test defeat in Australia earlier this year and the pair came into the tournament with speculation swirling over their ODI retirements.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a battle of spin on a sluggish Dubai pitch, New Zealand's bowlers put India in trouble at 203-5 with Rohit and Shreyas Iyer, who hit 48, back in the pavilion.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Rahul kept calm and along with Hardik Pandya (18) and Ravindra Jadeja, who hit the winning boundary, steered the team home to loud cheers from a largely Indian crowd in a sea of blue.
  <br>
  <br>
  India played all their matches at the Dubai International Stadium after they refused to tour hosts Pakistan due to political tensions. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Declan Rice's equaliser denied Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim a much-needed win but Arsenal's faltering Premier League title challenge suffered another damaging blow in a 1-1 draw at Old Trafford.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Gunners sit 15 points behind runaway leaders Liverpool, now with just one game in hand, with their focus beginning to turn to holding off the chasing pack for a place in next season's Champions League.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bruno Fernandes' stunning free-kick put United ahead in first-half stoppage time.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Red Devils, though, could not hold on for just a sixth Premier League win in 16 games under Amorim as Rice swept home on 74 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  United missed a string of late chances to win the game, with a point leaving them down in 14th.
  <br>
  <br>
  "How we conceded chances in certain moments was not acceptable," said Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta. "They have so much quality and they pick the right player and normally that would end in a goal."
  <br>
  <br>
  "We opened the gate to lose the game. There was no chance to lose the game and we opened it ourselves," he added. "I will defend my players all the time but in those moments we have to do better."
  <br>
  <br>
  United have had three permanent managers and an interim during Arteta's five years in charge of Arsenal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Amorim said he knows he will not get the time Arteta did to turn around a sinking ship at Old Trafford.
  <br>
  <br>
  The discontent among the home support could be seen around the stands with many taking part in a protest by wearing black over what they perceive as "the death" of their club.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This club will never die, that is clear," said Amorim. "You feel it in the streets. This is a big business and maybe all the fans in this league sometimes feel it is harder to go to the games and pay for tickets."
  <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal had failed to score in either of their previous two league games to realistically wave goodbye to their hopes of a first title in 21 years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite still missing the attacking quartet of Kai Havertz, Gabriel Jesus, Bukayo Saka and Gabriel Martinelli, the Gunners hit back in stunning fashion to thrash PSV Eindhoven 7-1 in the Champions League on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Infused with fresh confidence, Arsenal started on the front foot but again missed the focal point of a natural centre-forward.
  <br>
  <br>
  Midfielder Mikel Merino has been forced to deputise up front in recent weeks and fired wide from the edge of the area with an early opening.
  <br>
  <br>
  United have struggled for goals all season, but their skipper has remained a source of inspiration and Fernandes produced once more with a sumptuous free-kick just before half-time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Questions will be asked over Arsenal goalkeeper David Raya's starting position, but Fernandes still had to whip the ball over an imposing wall and back down into the visitors' net. (AFP)

 Neil Robertson from Australia won the 2025 World Snooker Grand Prix on Sunday, delivering a dominant performance by whitewashing Stuart Bingham from England by a score of 10-frames-to-nil.
 <br>
  <br>
  It was Robertson's second championship title at the World Grand Prix.
  <br>
  <br>
  The final began at 1 pm, with Bingham already down 8-0 by the end of the first session.
  <br>
  <br>
  One spectator, Awlam, shared that this was his first time watching a snooker match, and he was excited about the whole experience.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Yes! Nice! It’s actually very nice. I’ve been here every day except for one. The sports park is absolutely amazing,” he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The whole development, including the stadium, the arena, the malls, and everything around it, is really impressive. I am very happy to see this.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Another spectator, Mr Chan, remarked that it was a great experience to watch snooker at the Kai Tak Arena, where the atmosphere was fantastic.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It’s big and beautiful; it’s quite nice. And it’s close to the MTR station.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The match resumed at 7:30 pm, and Robertson continued his impressive performance, winning two straight games and defeating Bingham 10-0.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier in the day, an exhibition match took place between Hong Kong's top player, Ng On-yee, and world number one Mink Nutcharut, with Nutcharut winning 2-0.

<img alt="Many fans told RTHK the all-star player roster was a big draw for them. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795008_1_20250309201219.jpg&q=60">

<div class="itemFullText">
 Spectators were immersed in what felt like a party-like atmosphere on the third and final day of the LIV Golf Hong Kong tournament, as the second edition of the event wrapped up in Fanling on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Fans told RTHK that the large number of star players included in the LIV Golf draw – a field that included six-time major winner Phil Mickelson and 2024 US Open champion Bryson DeChambeau – helped bring more fans to the historic Hong Kong Golf Club course.
  <br>
  <br>
  A man surnamed Mok, who was at the Hong Kong Golf Open in Fanling last November, said it was a big step-up from last year's inaugural competition.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think in the past, you might get one or two top names," he said. "Obviously, most of the LIV Golf roster are top players who won multiple majors. And I think that in itself is very attractive."
  <br>
  <br>
  He also commended the accessibility for fans and families travelling to the tournament, which he said helped draw much larger crowds than he expected.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Promoting [the tournament] is one thing, but it also needs to be accessible," Mok explained. "There's an effort to make it participatory, rather than just putting up the names. The big events will sell themselves, but giving people the chance to access it in an equitable way would be great."
  <br>
  <br>
  Another fan from Argentina, surnamed Caceres, shared his experience as a first-time spectator at a major golf tournament in the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think people in Hong Kong love their sports and these kinds of events," said Caceres, who attended both the second and final day of the competition. "There's rugby, tennis, and now golf events – and every time I go, lots of people [are attending]."
  <br>
  <br>
  Many young fans came to support some of their favourite players.
  <br>
  <br>
  A local fan who was at last year's edition of the tournament, surnamed Nandwani, was at the event to see Australia's Cameron Smith in action.
  <br>
  <br>
  "People come in [from overseas] to watch this event. I think it's just a great thing to have... it's a great thing as a whole for the community to show up."

<div class="itemFullText">
 Sergio Garcia of Spain on Sunday carded a seven-under 63 to take home the LIV Golf Hong Kong tournament crown in Fanling, as the 45-year-old claimed his second career individual title on the men's golf tour.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Spaniard kickstarted his bid for a maiden victory in the SAR with an impressive early eagle on the par-5 third hole, before recording four consecutive birdies on the 8th to 11th holes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 35-time international tournament winner added a fifth birdie on the 16th to seal the three-shot victory in a thrilling final round.
  <br>
  <br>
  "My goal at the beginning of the day was to shoot five under," Garcia said after his individual win. "It was solid. I played very well, I gave myself a lot of chances throughout the whole day."
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'll admit I had a couple of bad swings, but I managed to get away with them and recover nicely," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Garcia edged out Dean Burmester of South Africa and American Phil Mickelson, who finished 15-under-par and 14-under-par respectively, to round out the podium.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the festivities for Garcia didn't stop there.
  <br>
  <br>
  Team Fireballs GC, led by Garcia, came out on top of the Team event – securing a double for the Spaniard.
  <br>
  <br>
  The team finished one stroke ahead of Stinger GC, who carded a 37-under-par.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was nice to see that not only was I doing well in leading the tournament, but also that my teammates were playing great," Garcia said of his team, which includes last year's LIV Golf Hong Kong champion Abraham Ancer.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They were keeping us there with a chance to win. Obviously, when you can pull off a double, it's a lot sweeter than if it's just one of them – so I'm very proud of them."
  <br>
  <br>
  Both the sports minister, Rosanna Law, who attended the event, and LIV Golf say they strongly intend to make the tournament an annual showcase in Hong Kong. Law said the sides are close to an agreement, but they're still working out the details.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tournament in Hong Kong was the third stop of the LIV Golf 2025 season, before it heads to Singapore from March 14 to 16.

    'Reduce waste by allowing water bottles into venues'

<img alt="A number of spectators were seen with bottled water next to their seats during Sunday's World Snooker Grand Prix final at Kai Tak Arena. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1794990_1_20250309170511.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A rule banning spectators from bringing water bottles into competition venues at Kai Tak Sports Park should be relaxed to reduce waste, a green group said, after noticing exemptions were given to certain guests.
 <br>
  <br>
  Greenpeace campaigner Leanne Tam told RTHK on Sunday that during the World Snooker Grand Prix at Kai Tak Arena, a VIP ticket holder was seen using their own bottle, an otherwise prohibited item for the general audience.
  <br>
  <br>
  She added that other spectators from the VIP section were even handed bottled water, generating unnecessary waste.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I do think that their security problem is the most important issue. When the Kai Tak Sports Park keep [repeating] that you cannot bring your own bottle and water bottle is not safe enough, but you can see that in the venue, the event organiser will freely distribute the plastic water bottle [with a] cap," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think actually there's no so-called safety issue in that situation because in the whole event, I can feel that it's so safe. It doesn't become dangerous when the VIP have their water bottle in their seats."
  <br>
  <br>
  Tam suggested that if water bottles are indeed considered a safety risk, the park should immediately introduce a reusable cup regime.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If...the organiser really wants to keep their balance between the safety and user experience and also the environmental protection issue, we suggest that they should have a reusable cup service to all the guests in the venue," she urged.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You can freely use it to fill water in your own cup and it's safe because it's without a cap, and it's purchased by the venue so it's under the safety regulations."
  <br>
  <br>
  The environmental campaigner added that the idea had been implemented before, including the Rugby Sevens at Hong Kong Stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  Similar venues overseas also provide a reusable option for attendees, she noted, and Kai Tak Sports Park should be able to follow suit.

 Seventeen large cruise ships will visit Hong Kong this month, according to Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism Rosanna Law.
 <br>
  <br>
  These include the newly built luxury cruises "Silver Nova" and "Queen Anne".
  <br>
  <br>
  This weekend, four cruise ships are visiting the SAR which the Hong Kong Tourism Board said will attract 5,400 tourists.
  <br>
  <br>
  Law said on social media that cruise guests will be arranged to join trips covering the Kai Tak Sports Park, among other locations.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said officials will utilise the Kai Tai Cruise Terminal and its surrounding infrastructure, as Hong Kong works towards developing its cruise-tourism sector.

    China's job market to be stable this year: official

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Beijing officials on Sunday said it is not easy to stabilise and expand the job market, but they expect there will be good outcomes with high-quality development.
 <br>
  <br>
  Premier Li Qiang had outlined goals for 2025 when he delivered his annual work report to the National People's Congress on Wednesday. They include a surveyed urban unemployment rate of about 5.5 percent, and over 12 million new urban jobs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a press briefing on people's livelihoods, the minister of human resources and social security, Wang Xiaoping, said the domestic economy had not fully recovered, while external factors may also affect employment.
  <br>
  <br>
  But she expects the overall labour market situation to be stable this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With solid progress in China's high-quality development, a large number of new technologies, new products and new scenarios have been applied on a large scale. The potential for diverse and differentiated consumption continues to be released," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The vitality of all types of business entities and innovation and entrepreneurship has been effectively stimulated. All these have laid a solid foundation for our efforts to stabilise and expand employment."
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang said authorities will refine employment policies, striking a balance between the application of new technologies and labour allocation to create new job opportunities.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the minister of housing and urban-rural development, Ni Hong, said the central government attaches great importance to the healthy development of the real estate market.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said market sentiment has improved following a raft of measures introduced by authorities, including interest rate cuts and tax reduction.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the first two months of the year, the housing market has stemmed the downturn and restored stability… We will work with relevant departments in both the short and long term, addressing root causes and make sure to stabilise the housing market," he said.

    'Improve doctors' training at new medical school'

<img alt="Two patients' groups unveil findings of their survey on Hong Kong's third medical school. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1794994_1_20250309165758.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Two patients' groups on Sunday gave their thoughts on the city's future medical school, hoping it would improve training for doctors and minimise the risk of mishaps.
 <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong has announced plans to build a third medical school, and the University of Science and Technology, City University and Polytechnic University have expressed their interest.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two patients' groups conducted a survey of 537 people in the past month, involving chronically ill patients or the disabled, as well as caregivers.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to the Patients' Alliance On Healthcare Reform and the Alliance for Patients' Mutual Help Organizations, the respondents emphasised the importance of better training for doctors, especially on the use of Chinese medicine and on handling patients with special needs such as those with autism.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Patients' Alliance On Healthcare Reform said because of a lack of centralised training, patients with different levels of autism often need to go from doctor to doctor, which is time-consuming and inconvenient.
  <br>
  <br>
  The group also said in light of a recent spate of medical incidents, the new medical school should increase research on technology to help prevent blunders in future.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to the study, the new medical school should also be closely connected with international medical institutions and complement Hong Kong's two existing medical schools.
  <br>
  <br>
  Local universities interested in running the new medical school are to submit their proposals by March 17, and a member of the Patients' Alliance On Healthcare Reform, Theresa Chu, urged the universities to take their findings into consideration.
  <br>
  <br>
  'We hope that our information and our analysis would be given just in time to highlight what are the expectations of the patients' groups and also the general community, with regard to what they're going to deliver in the future.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Maybe they will reassess, or adjust, or modify their approach, and this will likely (allow them to rethink) to present a more comprehensive picture to the assessment board,' Chu said.

    'Non-recurrent social welfare spending can be reduced'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Labour and Welfare Chris Sun said there's room for non-recurrent social welfare expenditure to go down.
 <br>
  <br>
  In the budget last month, the government said all departments need to cut spending by an accumulative 7 percent until the 2027-28 fiscal year, and the same applies to funding for some 170 social welfare organisations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking after attending a TVB programme on Sunday, Sun said more flexible and creative use of non-recurrent funding could be part of the solution.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I don't see room for further adjustment in terms of recurrent spending," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But as you all know, there is non-recurrent spending, such as the HK$20 billion quota approved by the Legco Finance Committee earmarked for buying space," he told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Say, we can buy units on higher floors that could be cheaper, so that facilities for youth and family purposes can move up there and free up space on the lower floors for elderly or children services."
  <br>
  <br>
  Sun stressed that officials have been helping the social welfare sector by, for example, using more technology and streamlining procedures to cut down on administrative work, so organisations can focus on providing services.

 Commuters who reserve a ride from a licensed taxi fleet will have the option of negotiating a fare with the driver and not pay by the meter, according to the transport chief.
 <br>
  <br>
  Mable Chan added there will be oversight to ensure fleet operators keep their rates to a reasonable level, while authorities will roll out specific measures to help them pick up passengers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a Commercial Radio programme on Sunday, Chan explained that people who flag down a fleet taxi on the street only have to pay the normal rate. For an urban cab, that means a base fare of HK$29 plus the incremental charge.
  <br>
  <br>
  But when they book a ride online or over the phone, both sides are allowed to negotiate a fixed fare similar to a "charter" arrangement, she added. Alternatively, passengers can still opt for the meter rate, plus a booking fee.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked if the fixed fare can be set below the meter rate, Chan called for "caution", but it is ultimately a business decision by the operators. She also stressed that regulatory supervision will be in place to ensure that fares remain reasonable and are not set excessively high.
  <br>
  <br>
  Additionally, Chan noted that the Transport Department has earmarked 13 dedicated pick-up points for fleet taxis. Nine of these spots are ready, and they can mostly be found at boundary control points, as well as the airport, the high-speed rail station and the Kai Tak Cruise Terminal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Regarding service quality, the transport minister noted that passengers who are not happy with the service can rate their drivers on the online ride-hailing platform. Fleet managers are required to monitor such feedback.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Technology will also be used with in-vehicle monitoring systems checking whether drivers are driving safely and whether there are any service problems," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  She also said that taxi fleets are encouraged to devise strategies and find ways to serve different needs in the market, such as passengers with disabilities and those with luggage.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Argentina's port city of Bahia Blanca has been "destroyed" after being pummelled by a year's worth of rain in a matter of hours, killing 13 and driving hundreds from their homes, authorities said Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Two young girls -- reportedly aged four and one -- were missing after possibly being swept away by floodwaters in the wake of Friday's storm.
  <br>
  <br>
  The deluge left hospital rooms underwater, turned neighbourhoods into islands and cut electricity to swaths of the city. National Security Minister Patricia Bullrich said Bahia Blanca was "destroyed."
  <br>
  <br>
  The death toll rose to 13 on Saturday, up from 10 on Friday, authorities said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The mayor's office said more casualties were possible in this city of 350,000 residents, located 600 kilometres southwest of the capital Buenos Aires.
  <br>
  <br>
  The missing girls "may have been carried away by the water," Bullrich told Radio Mitre.
  <br>
  <br>
  At least five of the victims died on flooded roadways, possibly after being trapped in their cars by fast-rising water.
  <br>
  <br>
  The downpour, which began Friday morning, dumped more than 400 millimetres (15.7 inches) of rain in the area in just eight hours, "practically what Bahia Blanca gets in an entire year," provincial security minister Javier Alonso said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is unprecedented," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tempers flared Saturday as Bullrich and Defence Minister Luis Petri tried to visit an affected neighbourhood, with residents complaining they should have visited the area the previous night, according to a video shared on social media.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some locals tried to drag Bullrich toward floodwaters, shouting "get wet!" and other abuse, before she was pulled away from the scrum by police and government officials.
  <br>
  <br>
  For environment official Andrea Dufourg, the extreme weather event "is a clear example of climate change."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Unfortunately this will continue to take place... we have no other option than to prepare cities, educate citizens, establish effective early warning systems," said Dufourg, who is director of environmental policy for the city of Ituzaingo outside Buenos Aires.
  <br>
  <br>
  The number of evacuees on Saturday stood at 850, down from a peak of 1,321, according to the mayor's office.
  <br>
  <br>
  The storm forced the evacuation of Jose Penna hospital, with news footage and video shared on social media showing nurses and other medical staff carrying babies to safety. They were later assisted by the army.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nearly 1.5 meters of muddy water gushed into doctor Eduardo Seminara's office.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Everything is ruined," he told local channel C5N, pointing to a pile of soggy chairs, cushions and books dumped on the sidewalk.
  <br>
  <br>
  But "I'm not complaining, we didn't lose any lives, our family is fine," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Local media showed images of flooded shops and reported overnight looting.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government has authorized emergency reconstruction aid of 10 billion pesos (US$9.2 million at the official exchange rate).
  <br>
  <br>
  The storm left much of the surrounding coastal area without power. At one point, city officials in Bahia Blanco suspended electricity due to the huge amount of water in the streets.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bahia Blanca has suffered past weather-related disasters, including a storm in December 2023 that claimed 13 lives. It caused houses to collapse and provoked widespread infrastructure damage.
  <br>
  <br>
  Heavy rains also fell Friday night in the resort town of Mar del Plata, with officials suspending evening activities and urging people to remain indoors.
  <br>
  <br>
  Buenos Aires was also hit by the storm but suffered no major damage. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan said on Sunday that Hong Kong must closely link its development with that of the country's, as the SAR actively integrates into the nation's growth.
 <br>
  <br>
  Writing on his weekly blog, Chan said as all eyes are on the "Two Sessions" meetings in Beijing, the SAR also needs to expedite work in three areas to align with China's development.
  <br>
  <br>
  One is to speed up the technological drive and innovation for economic growth, and another is to unleash more local consumption potential by creating new experiences in spending.
  <br>
  <br>
  The third, the minister said, is for Hong Kong to deepen international cooperation and exchanges.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan noted that on the mainland, digital-economic industries have grown to around 10 percent of GDP, with expansion in new industries and businesses.
  <br>
  <br>
  "From AI models, online games, the use of robots to animation movies, there are constant breakthroughs on the mainland in terms of science, technology and cultural industries," he wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Many new creative startups were born out of nowhere, and this is inspiring."
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister said Hong Kong needs to integrate the spirit of the "Two Sessions" into its social-economic development, so as to contribute more to the nation's rejuvenation.

 Each Legislative Council election should be better than the previous one, according to a senior Beijing official overseeing Hong Kong affairs, who also stressed the SAR needs “capable, responsible and accomplished” individuals to serve the city.
 <br>
  <br>
  Wang Linggui, deputy director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, said the city should add more talent not only in the political arena but also innovation and technology.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong is expected to hold its next polls for the legislature in December this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  “In the new stage of transitioning from stability to prosperity, Hong Kong needs people who are capable, responsible and accomplished, to seek the best for the general public of Hong Kong,” Wang told RTHK on Sunday on the sidelines of the “Two Sessions” in Beijing.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Each Legislative Council election should be better than the previous one. Just like the Olympic Games, there is never the best, only better. Being ‘good’ is a goal that should be constantly pursued.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang added that he believes Hong Kong authorities would consult different sectors, including local deputies to the National People’s Congress and the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference, on the upcoming polls.

 Hong Kong and Macau delegates to the country's top political advisory body said the two SARs should make good use of their advantages under the One Country, Two Systems principle.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a plenary meeting of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) on Sunday, Hong Kong delegate Tu Haiming said the One Country, Two Systems principle helps Hong Kong and Macau maintain their long-term prosperity and stability.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the first phase of its implementation has been completed, but some people still don't have a deep understanding about the principle.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Entering a new phase, the advantages of One Country, Two Systems should be realised through vitalisation and an increase in volume. We not only have to develop Hong Kong, contribute to the country and bring the country together, but also have to benefit the world,” Tu said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Through deepening the understanding of the One Country, Two Systems principle in the new phase, we have to further enhance the sense of responsibility and mission of Hong Kong society.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Macau CPPCC delegate Lao Nga-wong, meanwhile, said Macau is an example of the successful implementation of the One Country, Two Systems.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Macau should use its advantages in reinforcing connection with both the mainland and the world… and build the SAR into another international passage besides Hong Kong,” he said.
