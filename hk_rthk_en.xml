<div class="itemFullText">
 Russia warned on Saturday of severe environmental damage from a huge oil spill in the Black Sea caused when two tankers collided in a storm near Crimea, which declared a state of emergency.
 <br>
  <br>
  One tanker sank and another ran aground on December 15 in the Kerch Strait between Russia and the annexed Crimean peninsula.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thousands of volunteers have been mobilised for clean-up operations that have been criticised as insufficient by some Russian scientists.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tankers were carrying 9,200 tonnes of fuel oil, around 40 percent of which may have spilled into the sea, according to authorities.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The situation is truly critical," said Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, quoted by Russian press agencies.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is unfortunately impossible to calculate for the moment the extent of the environmental damage but specialists are working regularly on it," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Moscow-installed governor of Crimea, Sergei Aksionov, said on Telegram he had declared a state of emergency "because of the oil products spill in the Kerch Strait."
  <br>
  <br>
  Russia's transport ministry insisted on Saturday that "all polluted aquatic areas that have been identified have been cleaned" and "no recurring pollution has been detected."
  <br>
  <br>
  But Emergency Situations Minister Alexander Kurenkov was more cautious, saying: "The threat of a new fuel oil leak in the Black Sea from the tankers and spills on the coast persists."
  <br>
  <br>
  President Vladimir Putin earlier this month called the oil spill an "ecological disaster." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Air travellers in Britain faced further disruption on Saturday, as fog that has blanketed much of the country in recent days grounded flights and hampered landings and take-offs.
 <br>
  <br>
  London Gatwick airport was most affected, according to aircraft tracking website Flightradar24.
  <br>
  <br>
  Various airports saw disruption on Friday, including Manchester and the country's busiest hub, Heathrow.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As widespread fog continues to affect some UK airports today, temporary air traffic restrictions remain in place at locations with low visibility," the air traffic control authority NATS said.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said the restrictions were to maintain safety and that its teams were working closely with the airports and airlines to minimise disruption.
  <br>
  <br>
  In some areas, thick fog patches could reduce visibility down to just 100 metres, Britain's weather agency, the Met Office, said.
  <br>
  <br>
  A spokesperson for Gatwick Airport said the temporary air traffic restrictions in place due to fog causing poor visibility could lead to delays "throughout the day."
  <br>
  <br>
  The disruption comes at one of the busiest times of the year for air travel. (AFP)

<img alt="Jaylen Brown soars towards the basket in the second quarter. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1785301_1_20241228165720.jpg&q=30">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Jaylen Brown delivered a 44-point gem as the NBA champion Boston Celtics snapped a two-game losing streak with a 142-105 blowout of the Indiana Pacers on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Brown set the tone with 15 points in the first quarter, when the Celtics out-scored the Pacers 39-22 to take control.
  <br>
  <br>
  He finished with six of the Celtics' 23 three-pointers and came up with four steals, posting his highest scoring output since he scored 50 in a win over Orlando in January 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He was big-time," Celtics coach Joe Mazzulla said of Brown, who energised the TD Garden crowd with an array of thunderous dunks. "He has the ability to impact a team and an arena with his energy and his physicality.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When he gets into a certain zone he just gets locked in, and you kind of saw that on both ends of the floor."
  <br>
  <br>
  Jayson Tatum scored 22 points and pulled down 13 rebounds and Payton Pritchard added 18 points, eight rebounds and 10 assists off the bench for the Celtics, who shrugged off the absence of Kristaps Porzingis and Jrue Holiday to post their biggest points total of the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tyrese Haliburton scored 19 points and Bennedict Mathurin scored 18 for the Pacers, who were without injured Obi Toppin and Andrew Nembhard.
  <br>
  <br>
  The lopsided win over the team they vanquished in last season's Eastern Conference finals saw the Celtics avoid their first three-game skid of the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also kept them in touch with Eastern Conference leaders Cleveland, who improved their league-best record to 27-4 with a 149-135 victory over the Denver Nuggets.
  <br>
  <br>
  Donovan Mitchell scored 33 points to lead six Cavaliers players in double figures as Cleveland won their sixth straight – and their 10th in 11 games.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Cavs drilled 23 three-pointers and led by as many as 21, withstanding a triple-double of 27 points, 14 rebounds and 13 assists from Denver's NBA Most Valuable Player Nikola Jokic.
  <br>
  <br>
  It came down to the wire in Houston, where Minnesota's Anthony Edwards drilled a step-back three-pointer with 23.2 seconds remaining to lift the Timberwolves to a 113-112 victory over the Rockets.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fred VanVleet had a chance to win it for Houston, but missed a three-pointer with 1.8 seconds left.
  <br>
  <br>
  Julius Randle scored 27 points and Edwards finished with 24 for the Timberwolves, who trailed by 16 points, 106-90, with 4:57 left to play.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Made it happen!" Edwards said. "Got some stops, we made some big shots – made a big shot at the end right there."
  <br>
  <br>
  Alperen Sengun led the Rockets with 38 points and 12 rebounds. Amen Thompson added 20 points as all five Houston starters scored in double figures only to come up short at the end.
  <br>
  <br>
  The New York Knicks pushed their winning streak to six games with a convincing 108-85 victory over the Magic in Orlando.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jalen Brunson scored 26 points and handed out nine assists and Josh Hart added 23 points and 13 rebounds for the Knicks, who made just four of their 15 three-point attempts but converted 24 of their 34 free-throw attempts.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Magic, with top contributors Paolo Banchero, Franz Wagner and Moritz Wagner on the injured list, were led by 27 points from Jalen Suggs.
  <br>
  <br>
  San Antonio star Victor Wembanyama delivered 19 points and seven rebounds as the Spurs heated up in the second half to beat the Nets 96-87 in Brooklyn.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Spurs connected on just 11 of their 40 shot attempts in the first half and were tied 41-41 at half-time.
  <br>
  <br>
  They broke it open in the third quarter, connecting on 13 of their 18 shots. Wembanyama made four of his five attempts in the period, including three three-pointers, as the Spurs seized a 74-62 lead going into the fourth quarter. (AFP)

    Indian state funeral for former PM Manmohan Singh

<img alt="Soldiers accompany the coffin of India's late former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh through the streets of New Delhi. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1785299_1_20241228162108.jpg&q=55">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 India on Saturday accorded former premier Manmohan Singh, one of the architects of the country's economic liberalisation in the early 1990s, a state funeral with full military honours, complete with a gun salute.
 <br>
  <br>
  Singh, who held office from 2004 to 2014, died at the age of 92 on Thursday, after which seven days of state mourning were declared.
  <br>
  <br>
  The honours were led by President Draupadi Murmu with Prime Minister Narendra Modi in attendance, along with the country's top civilian and military officials. Bhutan's King Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck also attended the ceremony.
  <br>
  <br>
  Opposition leader Rahul Gandhi, who called the former prime minister his mentor and guide, joined Singh's family as they prayed before his cremation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier, mourners gathered to pay their respects to Singh. His coffin, draped in garlands of flowers, was flanked by a guard of honour and carried to his Congress Party headquarters in New Delhi.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was then taken through the capital to the cremation grounds, accompanied by guards of soldiers and accorded full state honours.
  <br>
  <br>
  Modi called Singh one of India's "most distinguished leaders."
  <br>
  <br>
  US President Joe Biden called Singh a "true statesman," saying that he "charted pathbreaking progress that will continue to strengthen our nations – and the world – for generations to come."
  <br>
  <br>
  The former prime minister was an understated technocrat who was hailed for overseeing an economic boom in his first term.
  <br>
  <br>
  Singh's second stint ended with a series of major corruption scandals, slowing growth and high inflation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Singh's unpopularity in his second term, and lacklustre leadership by Nehru-Gandhi scion Rahul Gandhi, the current opposition leader in the lower house, led to Modi's first landslide victory in 2014.
  <br>
  <br>
  Born in 1932 in the mud-house village of Gah in what is now Pakistan and was then British-ruled India, Singh studied economics to find a way to eradicate poverty in the vast nation.
  <br>
  <br>
  He won scholarships to attend both Cambridge, where he obtained a first in economics, and Oxford, where he completed his doctorate.
  <br>
  <br>
  Singh worked in a string of senior civil service posts, served as a central bank governor and also held various jobs with global agencies including the United Nations.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was tapped in 1991 by then Congress prime minister PV Narasimha Rao to serve as finance minister and reel India back from the worst financial crisis in its modern history.
  <br>
  <br>
  Though he had never held an elected post, he was declared the National Congress's candidate for the highest office in 2004.
  <br>
  <br>
  In his first term, Singh steered the economy through a period of nine percent growth, lending India the international clout it had long sought.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also sealed a landmark nuclear deal with the United States that he said would help India meet its growing energy needs.
  <br>
  <br>
  President Murmu said Singh would "always be remembered for his service to the nation, his unblemished political life and his utmost humility." (AFP)

    'Yoon authorised shooting during martial law bid'

<img alt='According to a prosecution indictment report, troops trying to enter the National Assembly on December 3 were told to get in quickly, "even if it means shooting." Photo: AFP' src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1785298_1_20241228161211.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korea's suspended president Yoon Suk Yeol authorised the military to fire their weapons if needed to enter parliament during his failed bid to impose martial law, according to a prosecutors' report.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 10-page summary from former defence minister Kim Yong-hyun's prosecution indictment report, which was provided to the media, also says Yoon vowed on December 3 to declare martial law three times if necessary.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon, who was stripped of his duties by the National Assembly this month, is under investigation for his short-lived attempt to scrap civilian rule, which plunged the country into political turmoil and led to his impeachment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon's lawyer Yoon Kab-keun dismissed the prosecutors' report, saying it was "a one-sided account that neither corresponds to objective circumstances nor common sense."
  <br>
  <br>
  As lawmakers rushed to parliament on December 3 to vote down Yoon's martial law declaration, heavily armed troops stormed the building, scaling fences, smashing windows and landing by helicopter.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to the prosecution indictment report, Yoon told the chief of the capital defence command, Lee Jin-woo, that military forces could shoot if necessary to enter the National Assembly.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Have you still not got in? What are you doing? Break down the door and drag them out, even if it means shooting," Yoon told Lee, according to the report.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon also allegedly told the head of the Defence Counterintelligence Command, General Kwak Jong-keun, to "quickly get inside" the National Assembly since the quorum for the martial law declaration to be lifted had not been met.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So quickly get inside the National Assembly and bring out the people inside the chamber, and break down the doors with an axe if necessary and drag everyone out," the report quotes Yoon as saying at the time.
  <br>
  <br>
  After lawmakers rushed inside parliament and voted 190-0 to nullify Yoon's declaration in the early hours of December 4, the report says Yoon told Lee, "Even if it's lifted, I can declare martial law a second or third time, so just keep going."
  <br>
  <br>
  The report also included screenshots of senior defence officials' messages from the day of the martial law declaration.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said there was evidence that Yoon had been discussing declaring martial law with senior military officials as early as March.
  <br>
  <br>
  The declaration followed a budget tussle between Yoon's party and the opposition.
  <br>
  <br>
  Days later, Yoon said in a speech that he apologised for the "anxiety and inconvenience" and promised that there would not be a second declaration of martial law.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ex-defence minister Kim was arrested this month over his role in the failed martial law bid.
  <br>
  <br>
  Opposition Democratic Party lawmaker Kang Sun-woo said in a statement on Saturday that "the prosecution has laid bare the undeniable ugly truth about Yoon Suk Yeol, the treasonous ringleader," adding that he must be "arrested immediately."
  <br>
  <br>
  South Korea's Constitutional Court held its first preliminary hearing on the validity of Yoon's impeachment on Friday, with the suspended president's legal team attending.
  <br>
  <br>
  The court will also decide the fate of Yoon's replacement, Han Duck-soo, who was impeached on Friday over his refusal to complete Yoon's impeachment process and bring him to justice. (AFP)

    Reddy's defiant maiden ton claws India back into Test

<img alt="Nitish Kumar Reddy celebrates after passing 100 on day three of the fourth Test against Australia. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1785295_1_20241228154625.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Nitish Kumar Reddy scored a defiant maiden century on Saturday as India fought back to reach 358-9 on a rain-hit third day of the fourth Test against Australia.
 <br>
  <br>
  Rising all-rounder Reddy was applauded off the Melbourne Cricket Ground on 105 not out after rain ended play for the day midway through the final session.
  <br>
  <br>
  Having provided much-needed stability to another shaky Indian batting effort, the 21-year-old will resume on Sunday alongside Mohammed Siraj, on two, with the first-innings deficit reduced to 116 runs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Australia's push for a much bigger advantage after scoring 474 was stymied by Reddy and spin-bowling all-rounder Washington Sundar, who scored 50 as the pair put on 127 for the eighth wicket.
  <br>
  <br>
  To the roar of a large contingent of Indian supporters among a record 83,073 third-day crowd at the MCG, Reddy lofted Scott Boland over mid-on to reach three figures just before play was halted.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was an innings memorable for resolute defence, mixed with classical strokeplay.
  <br>
  <br>
  Reddy faced 176 balls, hitting 10 fours and one six, continuing the fine batting form that has marked his debut series.
  <br>
  <br>
  In his first six Test innings, he has scored 284 runs at an average of 71.
  <br>
  <br>
  Seamers Boland, who took 3-57, and Pat Cummins with 3-86 were the most productive Australian bowlers in conditions that offered little assistance despite overcast skies.
  <br>
  <br>
  The recalled Sundar's dogged knock off 162 balls ended when he was caught at first slip by Steve Smith from off-spinner Nathan Lyon.
  <br>
  <br>
  It ended a partnership that traversed the entire second session after India had advanced from 164-5 overnight to 244-7 at lunch.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sundar survived the most freakish moment of the day when on 18.
  <br>
  <br>
  Attempting to flick a leg-sided delivery from Mitchell Starc, the ball flew from the back of the bat into the slip cordon where a diving Smith spilled a one-handed opportunity.
  <br>
  <br>
  India lost Rishabh Pant and Ravindra Jadeja in the opening session.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pant's innings of 28 ended when he over-balanced while attempting a ramp shot for six off Boland, top-edging the ball to third man where Lyon held the catch.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jadeja was trapped lbw when on 17, playing back to a Lyon delivery that skidded on.
  <br>
  <br>
  The crowd of 83,073 was a record for the third day of a Boxing Day Test, according to Cricket Australia, and the largest day three crowd at the Melbourne Cricket Ground since 1937.

  The record total attendance for a Boxing Day Test is 271,865, which looks certain to be smashed on Sunday after 255,462 spectators came through the gates on the first three days.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rain threatened throughout the day and about 40 minutes of play was lost in a period either side of tea.
  <br>
  <br>
  The series is locked at 1-1 with the fifth and final Test to be played in Sydney next week. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Arsenal began life without Bukayo Saka by beating Ipswich 1-0 to move into second place in the English Premier League and cut Liverpool's lead to six points on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Kai Havertz scored the only goal as Arsenal failed to turn their dominance into a more convincing scoreline.
  <br>
  <br>
  The lack of a clinical goalscorer may ultimately cost Mikel Arteta's men a first league title in more than 20 years, but they took advantage of Chelsea's shock 2-1 defeat against Fulham on Thursday to become Liverpool's closest challenger.
  <br>
  <br>
  Saka is set to be sidelined for "many weeks" in the words of Gunners' boss Arteta with fears the England international could be out until March due to a hamstring injury suffered in last weekend's 5-1 victory at Crystal Palace.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arteta's solution was to start with Gabriel Martinelli in Saka's normal role wide right with Gabriel Jesus continuing up front after scoring five times in Arsenal's previous two outings.
  <br>
  <br>
  The home side were dominant in possession but had few clear-cut chances to show for it until the final quarter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal were frustrated by Everton in a 0-0 draw in their last league game at the Emirates so there was relief when Havertz broke the deadlock on 23 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The German prodded high into the net from Leandro Trossard's low cross for his 12th goal of the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jesus did find the net once more with a cheeky finish between the legs of Arijanet Muric from an almost impossible angle, but was flagged offside.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal's prowess from set-pieces has been well-documented and they should have added to their goals from corners this season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gabriel Magalhaes headed against the outside of the post from point-blank range when it seemed easier to score.
  <br>
  <br>
  As Ipswich's ambition grew as the second half wore on, so the chances at the other end began to flow.
  <br>
  <br>
  Martin Odegaard had given the home crowd a scare by going down holding the left ankle that saw him sidelined by injury for two months earlier in the campaign.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Arsenal captain, though, was quickly back on his feet and weaving his way through the Ipswich defence with a mazy run and powerful strike that Muric tipped over.
  <br>
  <br>
  From the resulting corner, Declan Rice's powerful shot was blocked by Dara O'Shea.
  <br>
  <br>
  Havertz then wasted a glorious chance for his second and Muric saved once more from Mikel Merino to ensure a nervy ending.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Arsenal held out to leapfrog Nottingham Forest and Chelsea into second.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ipswich remain second from bottom, three points adrift of safety.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brighton missed the chance to move within one point of the top five as their poor run continued in a 0-0 draw at home to Brentford.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Seagulls are now winless in their past six games but they remain two points above their opponents.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brentford had the ball in the net early on through Yoane Wissa but the goal was ruled out for offside after a VAR check.
  <br>
  <br>
  Just Brentford's second point away from home all season is enough to edge the Bees ahead of Tottenham into 11th. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 One Mega Millions player has plenty of dough to ring in the New Year after drawing the winning number. After three months without anyone winning the top prize, a ticket worth an estimated US$1.22 billion was sold for the drawing on Friday night.
 <br>
  <br>
  The winner matched the white balls 3, 7, 37, 49, 55 and the gold Mega Ball 6. The identity of the winner was not immediately known.
  <br>
  <br>
  The total amount of the Mega Millions jackpot would only be distributed to a winner who chooses an annuity paid over 29 years. Nearly all grand prize winners opt to take a cash payout, which for Friday night’s drawing is an estimated US$549.7 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite the game’s long odds of 1 in 302.6 million, players continued to purchase tickets as the size of the grand prize grew. Until Friday, the last time a Mega Millions player hit the top prize was September 10.
  <br>
  <br>
  The largest-ever Mega Millions jackpot ticket worth US$1.6 billion was sold in Florida in August 2023. Two prizes for its compatriot Powerball lottery have been larger.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mega Millions and Powerball are sold in 45 states, as well as Washington DC, and the US Virgin Islands. Powerball also is sold in Puerto Rico. (AP)

    'Mainland tourists' spending power is normalising'

<img alt="Quality Tourism Services Association chairman Simon Wong says the catering and retail industries need to adapt. File Photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1785288_1_20241228125627.jpg&q=65">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The chairman of the Quality Tourism Services Association on Saturday reassured the catering and retail sectors that they will still have business as long as they grasp the new consumption habits of mainland tourists.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a television programme, Simon Wong pointed out that the industries should not expect mainland visitors to fork out as much as they used to.
  <br>
  <br>
  He revealed that compared to the peak of pre-Covid times, the spend for each mainland tourist who stays overnight has reduced by HK$3,000 in retail, which is the greatest among all sectors.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong said this might not be due to weaker consumption power among mainlanders.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The catering and retail industries should start to accept that the so-called weakening spending power of tourists from the mainland might only be them normalising their spending," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Maybe we should not fantasise that their spending will be doubled within a short period of time, to be as high as in the past. It might be because their consumption power was particularly strong at that time, and it is only now normalising."
  <br>
  <br>
  While the market will not be booming, he said there will still be business for the catering and retail industries if they recognise such changes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, Wong estimated that businesses have surged up to 20 percent month-on-month during the Christmas holidays.
  <br>
  <br>
  But it has dropped by 10 percent compared to a year ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that the resumption of the multi-entry visa scheme for Shenzhen residents has also boosted the economy.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Invest Hong Kong (InvestHK) said it will expand its overseas network in search for more investment opportunities.
 <br>
  <br>
  Startups in Hong Kong employed about 18-thousand people this year, according to the agency, which was a seven percent growth year-on-year, making a substantial contribution to the labour market.
  <br>
  <br>
  InvestHK's director-general, Alpha Lau, said on Saturday that the government spent a lot of effort in promoting emerging sectors and companies.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The 2024 startup survey shows that we have got a remarkable growth in the total number of startups. Now we have 4,700, up 10 percent from last year," she said in an interview with the Information Services Department.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This year we have seen some new sectors emerging, indicating that the Hong Kong government’s effort to promote industries in this area has now seen a very good result."
  <br>
  <br>
  CEO of a local fintech startup, Ben Wong, said Hong Kong's well-established financial structure was vital for his company's development.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We want to be an international company and Hong Kong provides us with that base on the strategic location. In just a four-hour ride we are able to go into Southeast Asia," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The talent in Hong Kong to me, when it comes to being able to support a financial business, is one of the best in the world. They are highly skilled, and also highly knowledgeable, in helping us grow our business. At the same time, we have been able to also attract international talent."
  <br>
  <br>
  InvestHK said it will particularly focus on countries along the Belt and Road Initiative, and that a new office will be established in Turkey in the first quarter of next year.

    International driving permit kiosks to be launched

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Self-service kiosks where the public can apply for international driving permits will soon be up and running at two locations in Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Transport Department said they can be found at two licensing offices, in Admiralty and Cheung Sha Wan, from January 13, 2025.
  <br>
  <br>
  There will be a daily quota of around 32 applications per kiosk, and  drivers can make reservations from Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The department's CEO of licensing, Chow Wai, said the application process will now be easier for the public with the two kiosks.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They can get their permit within the same day or within an hour after submitting the application. If they use the non-counter means - [applying] online, [via] drop-in box, or by post, usually it would take up to ten working days to send the permit to the applicants," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "One of the benefits of using the kiosk is that they can save waiting time to get the permit."
  <br>
  <br>
  The department said drivers need an iAM Smart+ account, with a digital signing function of a valid personal digital certificate, to use the kiosks.
  <br>
  <br>
  It added that authorities will look into whether more licensing offices can introduce self-service kiosks.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Technology minister Sun Dong said that the business community has a key role to play in Hong Kong's pursuit of becoming an innovation and technology hub.
 <br>
  <br>
  He told an RTHK radio programme on Saturday that I&T is crucial in attaining economic growth.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In terms of the development of the I&T sector, it is without a doubt that the government will play an important leading role, but the government alone is not enough. The whole of society has to participate," Sun said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Therefore, the government's major challenge ahead is how to unite all sectors, particularly business, to boost the development of I&T in the coming five to ten years."
  <br>
  <br>
  He also revealed that the government will roll out land preferential measures to attract businesses to set up production lines in the region.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sun said the Innovation, Technology and Industry Bureau has been conducting talks with relevant organisations, such as the Science Park, and he hopes the policies can be introduced in the near future.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The measures will focus on attracting strategic enterprises to set up factories, production lines as well as actual production facilities and links that can create value to Hong Kong's economic growth," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Of course, apart from providing them land at an attractive price, we will also require these companies to have a certain value of output and return to society within a certain period."
  <br>
  <br>
  Sun also pointed out that the first three buildings of the Hong Kong section of the Hetao Shenzhen-Hong Kong Science and Technology Innovation Cooperation Zone, are expected to be launched next year, adding that leasing arrangements are underway.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tech zone that spans across the Shenzhen River consists of 87-hectare Hong Kong Park, and 300-hectare Shenzhen Park.

    US homelessness hits new record in 2024: report

<div class="itemFullText">
 The number of people in the United States experiencing homelessness reached a new record this year, with lingering inflation and high housing prices among likely drivers, a government report said on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  An estimated 771,480 people were homeless on a single night in January 2024, rising 18 percent from 2023, said the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) in an annual assessment.
  <br>
  <br>
  This translates to about 23 in every 10,000 people in the country, home to the world's biggest economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  The uptick came as households felt the pressure from housing costs, with the median rent for January 2024 being 20 percent higher than that in January 2021, according to the National Low Income Housing Coalition.
  <br>
  <br>
  Apart from housing costs, the HUD report flagged "stagnating wages among middle- and lower-income households, and the persisting effects of systemic racism" as other factors.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other contributing issues included natural disasters that displaced people, rising immigration and an end to homelessness prevention programs introduced during the Covid-19 pandemic.
  <br>
  <br>
  "While this data is nearly a year old, and no longer reflects the situation we are seeing, it is critical that we focus on evidence-based efforts to prevent and end homelessness," said HUD agency head Adrianne Todman in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nearly 150,000 children experienced homelessness on a single night this year, a 33 percent jump over 2023, the report said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Children under the age of 18 were the age group seeing the biggest surge in homelessness between 2023 and 2024. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Gao Xinyu came back from one set down and Zhang Zhizhen was almost flawless as China began the mixed team United Cup with a 3-0 victory over Brazil in Perth on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  China had a 2-0 lead ahead of the mixed doubles after Gao and Zhang prevailed in contrasting singles matches at RAC Arena.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fifth-seeded China's chances of a deep run in the tournament appeared to take a major hit when women's world No. 5 Zheng Qinwen pulled out, prioritising rest ahead of the Australian Open.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the 175th-ranked Gao filled her shoes brilliantly after bravely overcoming cramp to edge Beatriz Haddad Maia 5-7, 6-4, 7-5 in a three-hour, 22-minute thriller that was the longest women's singles match in the tournament's history.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gao required a medical timeout in the second set and had her left thigh heavily strapped before the 17th-ranked Haddad Maia also succumbed to cramp during a gripping third set and resorted to several underhand serves.
  <br>
  <br>
  Haddad Maia moved better after that, but Gao was not to be denied and clinched the biggest victory of her career in her first match against a top 50-ranked player.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I have no idea what happened, my brain was empty and my whole body was cramping," Gao said. "It's a really big stage and it was a high quality match. I just pushed myself."
  <br>
  <br>
  It was far easier for the 45th-ranked Zhang, who thrashed Thiago Monteiro 6-3, 6-0 in a 54-minute demolition.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zhang dictated rallies from the back of the court and completely overwhelmed his 109th-ranked opponent to ensure China sealed the Group E tie. (Xinhua)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Sacramento Kings have fired their head coach Mike Brown, ESPN reported on Friday, citing sources.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Kings lost each of a recent five-game home-stand and sit 12th in the Western Conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  ESPN said sources had told them that assistant coach Doug Christie is expected to take over on an interim basis.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sacramento is 13-18 this season, three games behind the last playoff position, and lost 114-113 to the Detroit Pistons on Thursday, blowing a 19-point third quarter lead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brown was voted the NBA's Coach of the Year in 2023 after ending the Kings' 16-year absence from the playoffs. He was handed a three-year contract extension in June.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 54-year-old has previously coached the Cleveland Cavaliers and the Los Angeles Lakers and was an assistant coach to Steve Kerr at the Golden State Warriors before joining Sacramento. (AFP)

    Trump asks US Supreme Court to pause TikTok ban

    <![CDATA[<div>
<img alt="US President-elect Donald Trump said TikTok is needed for competition. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1785258_1_20241228064422.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President-elect Donald Trump filed a brief on Friday urging the Supreme Court to pause a law that would ban TikTok the day before his January 20 inauguration if it is not sold by its Chinese owner ByteDance.
 <br>
  <br>
  "In light of the novelty and difficulty of this case, the court should consider staying the statutory deadline to grant more breathing space to address these issues," Trump's legal team wrote, to give him "the opportunity to pursue a political resolution."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump was fiercely opposed to TikTok during his 2017-21 first term, and tried in vain to ban the video app on national security grounds.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump called for a US company to buy TikTok, with the government sharing in the sale price, and his successor Joe Biden went one stage further - signing a law to ban the app for the same reasons.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has now, however, reversed course.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Now (that) I'm thinking about it, I'm for TikTok, because you need competition," he recently told Bloomberg.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If you don't have TikTok, you have Facebook and Instagram -- and that's, you know, that's Zuckerberg."
  <br>
  <br>
  Facebook, founded by Mark Zuckerberg and part of his Meta tech empire, was among the social media networks that banned Trump after attacks by his supporters on the US Capitol on January 6, 2021.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ban was driven by concerns that he would use the platform to promote more violence.
  <br>
  <br>
  Those bans on major social media platforms were later lifted.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the brief filed on Friday, Trump's lawyer made it clear the president-elect did not take a position on the legal merits of the current case.
  <br>
  <br>
  "President Trump takes no position on the underlying merits of this dispute," John Sauer wrote in the amicus curiae - or "friend of the court" - brief.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Instead, he respectfully requests that the court consider staying the act's deadline for divestment of January 19, 2025, while it considers the merits of this case, thus permitting President Trump's incoming Administration the opportunity to pursue a political resolution of the questions at issue in the case." (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks stumbled on Friday as major companies saw their shares fall towards the end of a holiday week.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.8 percent to 42,992, while the broad-based S&P 500 slid 1.1 percent to 5,970.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index plunged 1.5 percent to 19,722.
  <br>
  <br>
  Steve Sosnick of Interactive Brokers said the sell-off caught many people by surprise.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think a lot of people got very complacent about the idea that we would have a Santa Claus rally," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was referring to a tendency for markets to fare well in the last five trading days of the year, and the first two in the new year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The selling is very much across-the-board. There's not an obvious catalyst for it today," said Sosnick, noting that the trend was more ferocious as volumes were light.
  <br>
  <br>
  Major companies in particular saw their shares fall, with Microsoft slipping 1.7 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Amazon lost 1.4 percent, while Nvidia dropped 2.0 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Peter Cardillo of Spartan Capital said the slump was both a "year-end adjustment" and due to a rise in US Treasury bond yields.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That's putting the brakes on, applying the brakes to the market," he said. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A man who killed 35 people in a car attack in Zhuhai last month was on Friday sentenced to death.
 <br>
  <br>
  Fan Weiqiu was on trial at the Zhuhai Intermediate People's Court on charges of endangering public safety by dangerous means.
  <br>
  <br>
  The court heard that Fan, 62, deliberately drove through people exercising outside a sports complex in his small SUV on November 11.
  <br>
  <br>
  The court said his motives "were extremely vile, the nature of the crime extremely egregious, the methods particularly cruel, and the consequences particularly severe, posing significant harm to society", state media said.
  <br>
  <br>
  In front of some of the victims' families, officials and members of the public, Fan pleaded guilty, it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The court found Fan had decided to vent his anger over a broken marriage, personal frustrations and dissatisfaction with the division of property after divorce, the report said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fan was also deprived of his political rights for life.
  <br>
  <br>
  The incident in Zhuhai has been described as the worst attack in China in a decade. (Xinhua/AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier dissolved parliament on Friday and confirmed the expected February date for an early general election after the collapse of Olaf Scholz's government last month.
 <br>
  <br>
  Scholz's coalition was brought down by internal fights over how to revive Europe's largest economy, but a deadly car-ramming attack at a Christmas market last week has renewed the country's heated debates over security and immigration.
  <br>
  <br>
  Confirming the February 23 date for the election, Steinmeier emphasised the need for "political stability" and appealed for the campaign to be "conducted with respect and decency."
  <br>
  <br>
  A Saudi doctor, Taleb al-Abdulmohsen, 50, was arrested at the scene of the attack on the Christmas market in the eastern city of Magdeburg which left five people dead and more than 200 injured.
  <br>
  <br>
  Interior Minister Nancy Fraser has said Abdulmohsen held "Islamophobic" views but his exact motive remains unclear.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the wake of the attack, Scholz appealed to Germans to "link arms" and to not allow "hatred to determine our coexistence."
  <br>
  <br>
  The conservative CDU/CSU is leading in the polls on around 32 percent under its leader Friedrich Merz and even before last week's attack it had been promising a harder line on immigration as well as a rightward shift on social and economic policy.
  <br>
  <br>
  In second place on 19 percent is the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), which held what it called a "memorial" rally in Magdeburg on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  At the event, the AfD's regional leader Jan Wenzel Schmidt said Germany could "no longer take in madmen from all over the world" and demanded the country "close the borders." (AFP)

<img alt="Steve Smith's epic innings ended when he danced down the wicket looking to drive but got an inside edge, with the ball bouncing off his pads and trickling onto leg stump. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1785235_1_20241227213610.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Australia's fiery pace attack destroyed India's top order on Friday to put them in the driving seat of the fourth Test after they set a daunting first innings target on the back of Steve Smith's 34th Test century.
 <br>
  <br>
  The visitors were 164-5 at the close on day two at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, still 310 runs adrift after Australia were out for 474 soon after lunch on the back of Smith's stylish 140.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rishabh Pant was not out six and Ravindra Jadeja on four, with three wickets in the final half-hour bursting India's momentum after they were 153-2.
  <br>
  <br>
  Scott Boland and Pat Cummins grabbed two wickets each.
  <br>
  <br>
  Skipper Rohit Sharma reverted to his usual role as opener after dropping to six in the past two Tests.
  <br>
  <br>
  But it did nothing to help his woeful recent form and he was out for three, spooning an attempted pull shot off Pat Cummins to Boland at mid-on for a simple catch.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cummins pounced again to remove the in-form KL Rahul with the last ball before tea, bowling him for 24.
  <br>
  <br>
  But opener Yashasvi Jaiswal stood firm with a high-quality innings, playing well off the front foot and crunching a series of stylish boundaries in his 82.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 22-year-old, who scored 161 in the first Test at Perth, looked destined for another century but threw his wicket away in a comical mix up with Virat Kohli.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jaiswal set off for a quick single off Boland but his teammate said no, leaving the youngster stranded, ending a dangerous 102-run stand.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kohli, who was fined 20 percent of his match fee for a day one shoulder charge on Australian debutant Sam Konstas, was caught behind by Alex Carey for 36 off Boland, who then removed nightwatchman Akash Deep without scoring.
  <br>
  <br>
  The hosts resumed on 311-6 after a dominant opening day and plundered another 163 runs, with the composed Smith slamming 13 fours and three sixes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Smith padded up again on 68, with Cummins alongside him on eight.
  <br>
  <br>
  They took 15 off one Deep over before Smith hooked Jasprit Bumrah for six to rub salt in the wounds, with India's body language showing their frustration.
  <br>
  <br>
  Smith reached his 34th Test century with a boundary off Nitish Kumar Reddy, which came on the back of a return to form in the last Test in Brisbane where he made 101.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was a patient innings from the 35-year-old and moved him alongside four other players on the all-time list of century-makers, including Sunil Gavaskar and Brian Lara.
  <br>
  <br>
  Only six men have scored more, led by Sachin Tendulkar's 51.
  <br>
  <br>
  With the landmark out of the way, both men began swinging the bat and Cummins paid the price, caught for a fine 49 by Reddy in the deep off Jadeja to end a 112-run stand.
  <br>
  <br>
  Starc was bowled by Jadeja for 15 in the first over after lunch, with Smith following in bizarre fashion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Facing Deep, he danced down the wicket looking to drive but got an inside edge, with the ball bouncing off his pads and trickling onto leg stump.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nathan Lyon (13) was the final wicket to fall, lbw to Bumrah who ended with 4-99.
  <br>
  <br>
  The five-match series is locked at 1-1 after India won by 295 runs in Perth before being crushed by 10 wickets in Adelaide. The rain-affected third Test in Brisbane was drawn. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The government said it plans to build some 180,000 flats in two new towns in northern New Territories near the border, under the final stages of the wider Northern Metropolis project.
 <br>
  <br>
  One of the sites is the New Territories North New Town, which covers more than 1,400 hectares and stretches from the Heung Yuen Wai and Man Kam To border points to near Lo Wu.
  <br>
  <br>
  The land area accounts for about one-third of the entire Northern Metropolis.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Development Bureau said on Friday there will be about 170,000 flats in the new town, housing half a million people.
  <br>
  <br>
  About 200 hectares would be considered a priority zone for development, which includes the University Town – an idea that was floated earlier – an enterprise park in Heung Yuen Wai and a commercial and residential zone near the border.
  <br>
  <br>
  Outside the priority area, officials said the plot could house new industries such as advanced construction and manufacturing. There will also be sites earmarked for sports and culture.
  <br>
  <br>
  The other new town is Ma Tso Lung.
  <br>
  <br>
  It's smaller in size, covering about 55 hectares, and could house around 10,000 units.
  <br>
  <br>
  A Development Bureau spokesperson said officials have scaled back the size of the Ma Tso Lung project, so it won't touch on wetland conservation zones or buffer areas.
  <br>
  <br>
  The spokesperson added the plan is to build mostly private flats in both new towns, noting that the government's target of building 300,000 public flats over a decade is met by plots elsewhere.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Excluding New Territories North and Ma Tso Lung, the government has already found land that can build 410,000 public flats," the spokesperson said. "So from this point of view, it seems we shouldn't give public flats priority when developing these two places."
  <br>
  <br>
  Another spokesperson said the two new towns could be attractive for residents who often travel across the border.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials also said the development scheme would result in the eviction of 13 non-indigenous villages, three of which are in Ma Tso Lung.
  <br>
  <br>
  Construction work for the Ma Tso Lung project will begin in 2027 and that of the priority area in the New Territories North New Town is expected to start a year later.
  <br>
  <br>
  The first batch of residents could move in seven years afterwards.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials will launch a two-month public consultation exercise on the preliminary plans in the middle of next month.

 Officials have called on tourists to stay in Hong Kong overnight after the New Year countdown next week.
 <br>
  <br>
  Authorities announced earlier on Friday that service hours at two border crossings will be extended on January 1, with the Shenzhen Bay Control Point operating throughout the early morning hours and the Lo Wu Control Point staying open until 2am, two hours longer than normal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials from the Transport Department said visitors could consider staying in the city after the fireworks display
  <br>
  <br>
  "We encourage mainland tourists to consider staying one more day in Hong Kong after the countdown, so they can fully immerse themselves in the diverse tourism experience in Hong Kong," Principal Transport Officer for the New Territories, Ken Wong, said at a press briefing.
  <br>
  <br>
  There will be a 12-minute fireworks display at Victoria Harbour to usher in 2025.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Acting Superintendent for Kowloon West Traffic, Ho Chun-hin, called on people to use public transport and not to go to the Hung Hom Promenade.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the past, some people would go to the promenade in Hung Hom to watch the fireworks. However, due to ongoing construction work there, it cannot be used as a viewing area this time. We kindly ask members of the public to choose other places," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police also said they will cordon off some roads in Central, Wan Chai, Eastern District and Tsim Sha Tsui in the evening on December 31.

<div class="itemFullText">
 China on Friday warned the United States it did not tolerate interference over Washington's comments this week on rewards offered by the Hong Kong government leading to the arrest of six national security suspects.
 <br>
  <br>
  "China is strongly dissatisfied and firmly opposes this. Hong Kong affairs are purely China's internal affairs, and we do not tolerate interference and meddling by any external power," Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning told reporters at a regular press briefing.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The extraterritorial application of Hong Kong's national security laws is fully consistent with international law and practice."
  <br>
  <br>
  On Tuesday, Hong Kong authorities announced six more people living overseas were placed on the national security wanted list, offering rewards of HK$1 million each for information leading to their arrest. The US State Department called it "a form of transnational repression", adding some of those individuals were based in the US. (Agencies)

<img alt="National Assembly speaker Woo Won-shik bangs a gavel after the vote to impeach acting President Han Duck-soo. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1785194_1_20241227163536.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korea's parliament impeached acting President Han Duck-soo on Friday over a short-lived martial law, plunging the country deeper into political chaos, as the Constitutional Court said it would swiftly trial suspended President Yoon Suk-yeol.
 <br>
  <br>
  The impeachment of Han, who has been acting president since Yoon was impeached on December 14 for declaring martial law on December 3, has thrown South Korea's once-vibrant democratic success story into uncharted territory.
  <br>
  <br>
  The motion led by opposition parties passed with 192 of the 300 votes amid rowdy scenes by ruling People Power Party members who surrounded the speaker's podium, chanting the vote was invalid and parliament had committed "tyranny".
  <br>
  <br>
  Ahead of the parliamentary session, opposition leader Lee Jae-myung said his Democratic Party, which has majority control of parliament, will go ahead with the plan to impeach the acting president, accusing Han of "acting for insurrection".
  <br>
  <br>
  "The only way to normalise the country is to swiftly root out all the insurrection forces," Lee said in a fiery speech, adding the party was acting on the public order to eradicate those who have put the country at risk.
  <br>
  <br>
  There has been overwhelming public support for Yoon's removal, according to opinion polls conducted after his martial law attempt.
  <br>
  <br>
  The plan for a vote to impeach Han was unveiled on Thursday by the main opposition Democratic Party after he declined to immediately appoint three justices to fill vacancies at the Constitutional Court, saying it would exceed his acting role.
  <br>
  <br>
  Until just before voting began, it was unclear how many votes were needed to impeach Han as acting leader. The threshold for a prime minister is a simple majority, while a two-thirds majority is needed for a president.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaker Woo Won-shik declared a simple majority would constitute parliamentary approval.
  <br>
  <br>
  Han said in a statement after the vote that he would step aside to avoid more chaos and will await a Constitutional Court ruling on his impeachment.
  <br>
  <br>
  By law, Finance Minister Choi Sang-mok will assume the acting presidency.
  <br>
  <br>
  Choi earlier pleaded with parliament to withdraw the plan to impeach Han, saying it would do serious damage to the country's economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  The South Korean won retreated to 1,475.4 per dollar, down 0.53 percent at 0707 GMT ahead of the parliamentary vote.
  <br>
  <br>
  The vote to determine Han's fate comes on the same day the Constitutional Court held its first hearing in a case reviewing whether to overturn the impeachment and reinstate Yoon or remove him permanently from office. It has 180 days to reach a decision. (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China on Friday launched its first Type 076 new-generation amphibious assault ship, the Sichuan, in Shanghai.
 <br>
  <br>
  Named after Sichuan province, the independently-developed new vessel was put into the water at a launch-and-naming ceremony.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was given the hull number 51.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Sichuan has a full-load displacement of over 40,000 tonnes and features a dual-island superstructure along with a full-length flight deck.
  <br>
  <br>
  It incorporates innovative electromagnetic catapult and arrestor technologies, enabling it to carry fixed-wing aircraft, helicopters and amphibious equipment.
  <br>
  <br>
  As the new-generation amphibious assault ship of the People's Liberation Army Navy, it plays a key role in advancing the Navy's transformation and enhancing its combat capabilities in the far seas, according to Navy officials.
  <br>
  <br>
  Following its launch, the ship will undergo a series of planned tests, including equipment commissioning, mooring tests and sea trials.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Navy unveiled its inaugural 075-class amphibious assault ship, the Hainan, in Shanghai in 2019. Two more Type 075 amphibious assault ships, the Guangxi and the Anhui, have also been commissioned.  (Xinhua)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Cantonese opera enthusiasts are making the most of the iconic Sunbeam Theatre before it closes down in March after more than 50 years.
 <br>
  <br>
  The theatre in North Point is to be transformed into a church.
  <br>
  <br>
  Veteran Cantonese opera singer Joyce Koi on Friday described the theatre as her second home and the place where she built her fame in the industry.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said she will enjoy the remaining days performing in the theatre, adding that she hopes to see more theatre spaces open up for shows.
  <br>
  <br>
  A woman surnamed Ngai, 76, said she witnessed the history of Sunbeam Theatre, recalling fond memories of going there with her mother. Ngai said she will try to watch as many shows as she can before the theatre closes on March 3.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's like coming home. I usually come here with my friends and family. It makes me very happy because we watch the performance and then go out for dinner. Sometimes we watch a show in the morning, go to dim sum, then another in the afternoon followed by a dinner with ten to twenty people," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a press conference about her upcoming show, Cantonese opera singer Angel Leung, who will perform during the theatre's final days, said the venue holds many memories.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think most Cantonese opera actors and actresses have a lot of memories here at Sunbeam Theatre because most of us would have been audience members sitting down there at the auditorium, and then gradually we became performers performing on this stage, and we have acted many different roles and characters on this stage, so I think every one of us [will] actually miss this place very much," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As for future plans, although this venue will not be used in the future, it will be used for other religious purposes. However we still have other venues such as the West Kowloon Xiqu Centre and also some other government venues such as Ko Shan Theatre, we will still have a lot of performances there."
  <br>
  <br>
  Leung added that she hopes to see Cantonese opera continue to grow in the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There are many things that we can do, especially focusing on promoting this art form to our next generation and also promoting it to the international audience groups," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think it's actually a very iconic culture in Hong Kong that represents this place because Cantonese opera in Hong Kong has its own style. I think it's really a very good way of promoting this city to foreigners."
  <br>
  <br>
  The theatre will be taken over by the Island Evangelical Community Church, with the sale spanning the ground floor through to the sixth floor, and also the rooftop of Kiu Fai Mansion.

 Service hours at two border checkpoints will be extended in the early hours of New Year's Day, the government said on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Shenzhen Bay Control Point, which usually closes at midnight, will stay open throughout the night, while Lo Wu Control Point will stay open an extra two hours longer than normal until 2am.
  <br>
  <br>
  East Rail Line services will be extended, with the last train to Lo Wu leaving Admiralty at 00.56am.
  <br>
  <br>
  Private cars, other than those with permits for the Lok Ma Chau checkpoint, will be able to cross the border via the Shenzhen Bay port, a statement said.
  <br>
  <br>
  An emergency transport coordination centre will operate round-the-clock to monitor traffic conditions and public transport services, and will carry out contingency measures when necessary to meet service demands.
  <br>
  <br>
  A government spokesman thanked mainland authorities for making the special arrangements.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The full support and co-ordination of the leaders and relevant departments of Guangdong Province and Shenzhen Municipality are crucial to the implementation of the special boundary-crossing arrangements, reflecting the effective and close co-operation between Hong Kong and Shenzhen," he said.

 National People's Congress Standing Committee member Starry Lee on Friday said she hopes the newly restored multi-entry visa scheme for Shenzhen residents can be extended to cover more cities in the Greater Bay Area (GBA).
 <br>
  <br>
  Lee said the SAR saw more mainland visitors over Christmas, which benefited the retail, catering and hospitality sectors.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We believe that with the close monitoring of the implementation, more and more cities in the GBA in particular can have more relaxed visa application procedures so that more people from different cities in the Guangdong area can come to Hong Kong to visit and we can exchange more," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee earlier attended a standing committee meeting in Beijing where she said 10 bills were discussed and some, involving value-added tax, the Supervision Law and the Science and Technology Popularisation Law, were passed.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 14th National People's Congress will open its third annual session in the capital on March 5, and Lee described 2025 as a "critical year", saying Hong Kong should play a more active role in inviting foreign investment and attracting talent.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Japan's government on Friday approved a record budget for the next fiscal year, ramping up spending on social welfare and defence.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 115.5 trillion yen (US$730 billion) budget for the year from April 2025, greenlit by the cabinet, includes 8.7 trillion yen in defence spending.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also includes social security spending of around 38.3 trillion yen – up from 37.7 trillion the previous year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The defence ministry said in a briefing document that Japan was facing its "toughest and most complex security environment" since the Second World War, repeating a warning from Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 8.7 trillion yen approved on Friday will help pay for measures to help attract recruits to Japan's Self-Defense Forces, and to improve relations between the US and Japanese militaries with locals in Okinawa.
  <br>
  <br>
  It will also go towards a system to collect satellite information on ballistic missiles, such as those fired by North Korea.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another challenge facing the country is its ageing population caused by chronically low birth rates and a cautious approach to immigration.
  <br>
  <br>
  Japan is one of the world's oldest societies, and this year the proportion of its people aged 65 or over reached a record 29.3 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The draft budget needs to be approved by the parliament, and the ruling Liberal Democratic Party and its smaller coalition partner Komeito will need cooperation from opposition parties, having lost their majority in an October snap election. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korea's spy agency said on Friday it had confirmed that a North Korean soldier sent to back Russia's war against Ukraine had been captured by Ukrainian forces.
 <br>
  <br>
  Pyongyang has deployed thousands of troops to reinforce Russian troops, including in the Kursk border region where Ukraine mounted a shock border incursion in August.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Through real-time information sharing with an allied country's intelligence agency, it has been confirmed that one injured North Korean soldier has been captured," South Korea's National Intelligence Service said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The soldier was captured by the Ukrainian army, an intelligence source told AFP news agency, adding that the location where he was seized was unknown.
  <br>
  <br>
  The first confirmation of the capture of a North Korean soldier came days after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Monday that nearly 3,000 North Korean soldiers had been "killed or wounded" so far. Seoul's Joint Chiefs of Staff also said on Monday that more than 1,000 North Korean soldiers have been killed or wounded.
  <br>
  <br>
  North Korean state media said on Friday that Russian President Vladimir Putin sent a New Year's message to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, saying "the bilateral ties between our two countries have been elevated after our talks in June in Pyongyang".
  <br>
  <br>
  A landmark defence pact went into effect in December after the two sides exchanged ratification documents. Putin hailed the deal in June as a "breakthrough document". (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Friday said the well-being of families is deeply valued by his administration, and that it strives to build a harmonious society for all.
 <br>
  <br>
  Giving the opening address for the Asian Family Summit 2024, the CE underscored the government's commitment to working with different stakeholders to cultivate a pro-family environment.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Our latest initiatives, in partnership with the Family Council, include supporting the community in launching family education projects of an extended scope. We will also organise the Hong Kong Excellence Family Awards next year to promote good family values among the general public,” he said in a video message.
  <br>
  <br>
  “As announced in my Policy Address this October, we will strengthen parental education by setting up new community parents and children centres in different parts of the city.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The chief executive added that the Social Welfare Department’s care teams are also well-trained to identify and reach out to households in need.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee stressed that building a more caring and inclusive society for all families requires the effort of not only the government, but also all sectors of the community.
  <br>
  <br>
  He thanked organisers of the summit for assembling people who are dedicated to the healthy development of families.
  <br>
  <br>
  The summit runs until Sunday, bringing together some 700 participants from professional groups, academia, NGOs and the public to discuss challenges faced by families and review existing policies.

    Finland suspects ship of breaching undersea cables

<div class="itemFullText">
 Finnish authorities have seized a ship carrying Russian oil in the Baltic Sea on suspicion it caused the outage of an undersea power cable connecting Finland and Estonia a day earlier, and that it also damaged or broke four internet lines.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Cook Islands-registered ship, named by authorities as the Eagle S, was boarded by a Finnish coast guard crew on Thursday, that took command and sailed the vessel to Finnish waters, a coast guard official said at a press conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  "According to our understanding, an anchor of the vessel that is under investigation has caused the damage," said Robin Lardot, director of the Finnish National Bureau of Investigation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two fibre-optic cables owned by Finnish operator Elisa, linking Finland and Estonia, were broken while a third link between the two countries owned by China's Citic was damaged, Finnish transport and communications agency Traficom said.
  <br>
  <br>
  A fourth internet cable running between Finland and Germany and belonging to Finnish group Cinia was also believed to have been severed, the agency said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both the Finnish and Estonian governments held extraordinary meetings on Thursday to assess the situation, they said in separate statements.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a press conference following the meeting, Estonian officials agreed with the Finnish authorities' suspicion that the Cook Islands-flagged tanker Eagle S "intentionally" struck the offshore cable.
  <br>
  <br>
  Repairing the 170-km Estlink 2 interconnector will take months, and the outage raised the risk of a strained power supply during the winter, operator Fingrid said in a statement. (Agencies)

    Airport to expand use of unmanned vehicles

 Passengers will be able to ride on the new unmanned shuttle between the Hong Kong port of Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge and 11 SKIES shopping mall at Chek Lap Kok from the end of next year, Airport Authority executive director Steven Yiu said.
 <br>
  <br>
  With the shopping mall located near Terminal 2, the shuttle service is expected to boost travel between the mega bridge and the airport, and facilitate shoppers.
  <br>
  <br>
  The journey between the port and 11 SKIES will only take three minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yiu said 26 vehicles will be put into use in the initial stage and can carry 500 passengers an hour, with the capacity set to double later.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the 16 seaters boast state-of-the-art features.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Every car, we equip with different positioning systems. We have cameras. They are equipped with all the video and analytic functions, so they can detect any abnormality on the road,” Yiu said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The second is GPS. It’s not one GPS. We have four different GPS, supplied by China, the US, Russia and Europe. We have 10 radars to detect all the motions on the road so the vehicles can react.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Yiu also said the authority plans to launch an unmanned vehicle link between the port and Tung Chung in 2028.
  <br>
  <br>
  A fleet of 100 vehicles can carry 5,000 people per hour, and the capacity would be raised to 8,000 later.
  <br>
  <br>
  A designated road will be built in Tung Chung for the unmanned vehicles.
  <br>
  <br>
  The authority also plans to expand the pooling service fleet for airport staff within the airport restricted area by using unmanned vehicles within two years.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Two-time Grand Slam champion Simona Halep on Friday pulled out of Australian Open qualifying and a warm-up tournament in Auckland, citing pain in her knee and shoulder.
 <br>
  <br>
  The former world number one, who is working to re-establish herself after a doping ban, was handed a wildcard for qualifying at the first major of the year next month at Melbourne Park.
  <br>
  <br>
  She was also due to play the lead-up Auckland Classic, but the 33-year-old Romanian said on Instagram her 2025 season was on hold.
  <br>
  <br>
  "After discussing with my team at length, we agreed it is sensible to delay the start of my season," said Halep, the 2018 Melbourne runner-up.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I will rest up and intend for my next event to be Cluj, where I can't wait to play in front of the amazing Romanian fans," she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Halep was suspended for doping in October 2022 and returned to the sport in March after having her ban reduced from four years to nine months.
  <br>
  <br>
  She has denied knowingly doping. (AFP)

 Curtis Jones fired Liverpool seven points clear at the top of the Premier League as the title favourites survived a scare in their 3-1 win against struggling Leicester.
 <br>
  <br>
  Arne Slot's side were shocked by Jordan Ayew's early strike at Anfield, but the leaders recovered their composure to equalise just before the interval through Cody Gakpo.
  <br>
  <br>
  England midfielder Jones marked his 100th top-flight appearance with the second goal soon after half-time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mohamed Salah's 19th goal this term wrapped up Liverpool's 11th win in their last 13 games in all competitions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We created enough, but because we went 1-0 down it was a game," Liverpool manager Slot said. "Then you saw how good we are and Leicester didn't want to come back into the game."
  <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool's comeback lifted them seven points clear of second-placed Chelsea, who were beaten 2-1 by Fulham earlier in the day.
  <br>
  <br>
  The rampant Reds, who hold a game in hand on Chelsea, have been beaten just once in 17 league matches this season.
  <br>
  <br>
  They have won 22 of their 26 games in all competitions in a remarkable run since Slot arrived from Feyenoord in the close-season to replace Jurgen Klopp.
  <br>
  <br>
  Klopp led Liverpool to their last Premier League title in 2020 and Slot has them perfectly positioned to emulate that feat in the second half of the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Also through to the League Cup semi-finals and top of the Champions League, Liverpool, who travel to West Ham for their last match of the year on Sunday, will go into 2025 in contention of an unprecedented quadruple.
  <br>
  <br>
  Third-bottom Leicester are one point from safety after a third consecutive defeat.
  <br>
  <br>
  Salah nearly gave Liverpool the perfect start as his close-range effort smacked the post.
  <br>
  <br>
  But on a night when Anfield was surrounded by a murky mist, Liverpool's defence was lost in the fog in the sixth minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Fulham scored twice in the final 10 minutes to end Chelsea's 12-game unbeaten run in all competitions with a stunning 2-1 Premier League win at Stamford Bridge.
  <br>
  <br>
  Substitutes Harry Wilson and Rodrigo Muniz shocked the Blues to secure Fulham's first away win at their west London rivals since 1979.
  <br>
  <br>
  Defeat leaves second-placed Chelsea still four points adrift of leaders Liverpool, who have two games in hand over their nearest challengers, starting with the visit of Leicester later on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Victory lifts Fulham up to eighth, level on points with champions Manchester City, and within just one point of fifth-placed Newcastle to further their European ambitions for next season.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is a privilege to give our fans this happiness," said Fulham boss Marco Silva. "The second half reaction was top. It is not a coincidence that we are the team in the Premier League that has got the most goals from players off the bench."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chelsea boss Enzo Maresca has insisted in recent weeks that his young side are not yet cut out for a title challenge despite their fine form.
  <br>
  <br>
  Silva's men have now taken points from Liverpool, Arsenal and Chelsea this month and the Portuguese's changes turned the tide in the visitors' favour. (AFP)

    Man Utd crash at Wolves, Man City held by Everton

<div class="itemFullText">
 Bruno Fernandes was sent off as Manchester United crashed to an embarrassing 2-0 defeat at lowly Wolves, while Erling Haaland missed a penalty as crisis-torn Manchester City failed to end their dismal run with a 1-1 draw against Everton.
 <br>
  <br>
  United suffered a third successive loss in all competitions to leave new boss Ruben Amorim with five defeats in his 10 games since replacing the sacked Erik ten Hag.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fernandes was dismissed two minutes into the second half at Molineux for a second booking after fouling Nélson Semedo.
  <br>
  <br>
  United's 10 men cracked in the 58th minute, when Matheus Cunha's corner went straight in as goalkeeper André Onana flapped under pressure from Matt Doherty and Santiago Bueno.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hwang Hee-chan compounded Amorim's misery when he tapped in with just seconds left.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was another bitter blow for United, who endured a humiliating 3-0 defeat by Bournemouth at Old Trafford last weekend after losing 4-3 in the League Cup at Tottenham.
  <br>
  <br>
  With his team marooned in 14th place – just eight points above the relegation zone – Amorim's woes might not be over, with United facing in-form Newcastle on Monday before travelling to Liverpool in their first game of 2025.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's so tough to win games in this league with 11 men. With 10 men, it's more difficult," Amorim said. "Of course, when you lose, when we don't win, it's a step back – it was really hard with the sending off."
  <br>
  <br>
  Wolves climbed out of the bottom three thanks to their second successive win under new manager Vitor Pereira.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, campions Manchester City have just one victory in their last 13 games in all competitions as their Christmas schedule started in disappointing fashion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bernardo Silva put City in front early on before Iliman Ndiaye salvaged a point for Everton.
  <br>
  <br>
  Seven minutes into the second half, Haaland had the chance to end his longest goal drought at the Etihad but Jordan Pickford dived low to his right to make the save.
  <br>
  <br>
  City are languishing in seventh place and sit five points adrift of the top four, with their astonishing decline showing no sign of ending.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Of course we need results and we didn't get it. The team played really good again in all departments and unfortunately could not win," said City boss Pep Guardiola, whose side are at risk of failing to qualify for the Champions League for the first time in 15 years.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We accept it," Guardiola added. "It is life. We did not expect it to not win games many times – but what do you have to do? Continue." (AFP)

    Two dead in treacherous Sydney-Hobart yacht race

 Two sailors have died in separate incidents in the treacherous Sydney to Hobart bluewater classic, organisers said Friday, while race favourite Comanche was forced to retire.
 <br>
  <br>
  Both crew members, on Flying Fish Arctos and Bowline, were hit by booms as the yachts were making their way south along the New South Wales coast after setting off from Sydney Harbour on Boxing Day.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other crew tried to revive them, but were unsuccessful.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As these incidents are being dealt with by the Water Police and all family members are yet to be contacted, we cannot provide further details at this stage," the race committee said in a brief statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our thoughts are with the crews, family and friends of the deceased."
  <br>
  <br>
  Gale-force winds and high seas had been forecast for the 628-nautical mile event, which ends in the Tasmanian state capital Hobart after the fleet tackles the notorious Bass Strait.
  <br>
  <br>
  Weather is a critical factor in the race, first held in 1945, with winds and conditions often changing rapidly.
  <br>
  <br>
  Six men died, five boats sank and 55 sailors were rescued in 1998, when a deep depression exploded over the fleet in the Bass Strait.
  <br>
  <br>
  So far seven yachts have pulled out from the initial fleet of 104, organisers said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alive, last year's overall winner of the Tattersall Cup, which takes into account boat size and other factors, was one of the first casualties, retiring with reported engine issues.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a major setback, race record holder Comanche is also out with mainsail damage, leaving the door open for its main supermaxi rival LawConnect to win line honours for the second straight year. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks finished a low-key session little changed on Thursday as US Treasury bond yields retreated and a report pointed to higher holiday retail sales.
 <br>
  <br>
  Holiday consumer data showed a 3.8 percent increase in US retail spending from November 1 to December 24, according to a Mastercard SpendingPulse review of a key period for retailers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Solid spending during this holiday season underscores the strength we observed from the consumer all year," said Michelle Meyer, chief economist for the Mastercard Economics Institute.
  <br>
  <br>
  Equities veered in and out of positive territory throughout the post-Christmas trading round when several overseas bourses were closed.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished up 0.1 percent at 43,325.
  <br>
  <br>
  The broad-based S&P 500 slipped less than 0.1 percent to 6,037, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index dipped 0.1 percent to 20,020.
  <br>
  <br>
  Large technology companies that have led the market in much of 2024 mostly took a breather. These included Netflix, Tesla and Amazon, all of which declined.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among individual companies, United States Steel fell 3 percent after would-be acquirer Nippon Steel of Japan pushed back the time-frame of its targeted acquisition to the first quarter of 2025 from the fourth quarter of 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  The move came after a US government panel could not reach consensus on whether the transaction harmed US national security, pushing the decision to President Joe Biden, who has criticised the takeover. (AFP)

    India's former PM Manmohan Singh dies aged 92

<img alt="Manmohan Singh is credited with having overseen an economic boom in Asia's fourth-largest economy in his first term. File photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1785102_1_20241227051336.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Manmohan Singh, the former Indian prime minister whose economic reforms made his country a global powerhouse, has died at the age of 92, current leader Narendra Modi said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  India "mourns the loss of one of its most distinguished leaders," Modi posted on social media platform X shortly after news broke of Singh's passing.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As our Prime Minister, he made extensive efforts to improve people's lives."
  <br>
  <br>
  Singh was taken to a hospital in New Delhi after he lost consciousness at his home on Thursday, but could not be resuscitated and was pronounced dead at 9:51 pm local time, according to a statement by the All India Institute of Medical Sciences.
  <br>
  <br>
  Singh, who held office from 2004 to 2014, is credited with having overseen an economic boom in Asia's fourth-largest economy in his first term, although slowing growth in later years marred his second stint.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I have lost a mentor and guide," opposition Congress leader Rahul Gandhi said in a statement, adding that Singh had "led India with immense wisdom and integrity."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Millions of us who admired him will remember him with the utmost pride," said Gandhi, a scion of India's powerful Nehru-Gandhi dynasty and the most prominent challenger to Modi.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mallikarjun Kharge, leader of the opposition in parliament's upper house, said "India has lost a visionary statesman, a leader of unimpeachable integrity, and an economist of unparalleled stature."
  <br>
  <br>
  President Droupadi Murmu wrote on X that Singh will "always be remembered for his service to the nation, his unblemished political life and his utmost humility."
  <br>
  <br>
  Born in 1932 in the mud-house village of Gah in what is now Pakistan, Singh studied economics to find a way to eradicate poverty in India and never held elected office before taking the vast nation's top job.
  <br>
  <br>
  He won scholarships to attend both Cambridge, where he obtained a first in economics, and Oxford, where he completed his PhD.
  <br>
  <br>
  Singh worked in a string of senior civil posts, served as a central bank governor and also held various jobs with global agencies including the United Nations.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was tapped in 1991 by then Congress prime minister P.V. Narasimha Rao to reel India back from the worst financial crisis in its modern history.
  <br>
  <br>
  In his first term Singh steered the economy through a period of nine-percent growth, lending India the international clout it had long sought. (AFP)

    Membership of UK's Reform party tops Conservatives

<img alt="The anti-immigration party's leader Nigel Farage hailed the membership figure as an " src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1785088_1_20241226214338.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Membership of Britain's upstart anti-immigration Reform UK party has overtaken that of the centre-right Conservative Party for the first time, the party said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Party leader and Brexit figurehead Nigel Farage hailed the figure as an "historic moment."
  <br>
  <br>
  Immigration was a major issue at the ballot box at the UK's July general election which saw the Conservatives ousted after 14 years in power.
  <br>
  <br>
  The digital counter on the Reform website showed a membership tally ticking past the 131,680 figure declared by the main opposition Conservatives during its leadership election earlier this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The youngest political party in British politics has just overtaken the oldest political party in the world," wrote Farage on X, formerly Twitter.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Reform UK are now the real opposition."
  <br>
  <br>
  Party chairman Zia Yusuf said the milestone showed the long "stranglehold on the centre-right of British politics by the Tories has finally been broken."
  <br>
  <br>
  The last declared Conservative Party tally was the lowest on record and a drop on 2022 when there were around 172,000 members.
  <br>
  <br>
  Reform won five seats in the 650-seat UK parliament in July, although it received roughly 14 percent of total votes cast.
  <br>
  <br>
  Reform maximised the damage to the Conservatives by splitting the right-wing vote and picking up former Tory supporters in key constituencies.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Labour Party won by a landslide although Prime Minister Keir Starmer has had a bumpy first five months in power.
  <br>
  <br>
  An Ipsos opinion poll earlier this month found that 53 percent of Britons said they were "disappointed" in what the Labour government had achieved so far.
  <br>
  <br>
  British politics has been dominated by the two main political parties – Labour and the Conservatives – for decades. but commentators have warned that major political parties have seen irreversible downturns in their popularity in the past. (AFP)

    Australia's top order fires to take charge of 4th Test

<img alt="19-year-old Sam Konstas brings the crowd at the MCC alive with a ramp shot. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1785087_1_20241226212400.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Australia's top four all slammed 50 or better on Thursday to take a firm grip on day one of the fourth Test against India, with fearless teenage opener Sam Konstas stealing the show.
 <br>
  <br>
  Batting after captain Pat Cummins won the toss on a steamy day, the hosts reached 311-6 by the close in front of more than 87,000 fans at the Melbourne Cricket Ground.
  <br>
  <br>
  They were aided by some inconsistent early bowling and a flying start from Konstas.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 19-year-old blasted a hugely entertaining 60 off 65 balls in a debut to remember, pounding 18 off one Jasprit Bumrah over and having a run-in with superstar Virat Kohli.
  <br>
  <br>
  At the close, Steve Smith was not out 68 and Pat Cummins was eight. Marnus Labuschagne made 72 and Usman Khawaja 57.
  <br>
  <br>
  All the bowlers were punished but they rallied with four wickets in the final session, including dangerman Travis Head for a duck, to haul themselves back into the contest.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bumrah led the charge, ending with 3-75.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was quite surreal with the big crowd, the biggest crowd I've ever played before," said Konstas.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I just played with freedom and backed myself. Lucky to get a few runs. A bit disappointed with the way I got out but hopefully we have got a bit of momentum for tomorrow."
  <br>
  <br>
  The five-match series is locked at 1-1 after India won by 295 runs in Perth before being crushed by 10 wickets in Adelaide. The rain-affected third Test in Brisbane was drawn.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A lot of credit to the way Sam played. The intent he showed sort of put us on the back foot," said Indian batting coach Abhishek Nayar.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But it took a lot of character for our bowlers to stick in there. It wasn't the easiest conditions to bowl. At times like that it is important to stick to your plans and post-lunch we came back really strong."
  <br>
  <br>
  With Konstas in for the axed Nathan McSweeney, he and Khawaja shared an 89-run opening partnership – the hosts' best of the series – before the teenager was undone by the spin of Ravindra Jadeja.
  <br>
  <br>
  Australia's youngest-ever opener faced the first over from a menacing Bumrah and survived despite the Indian spearhead repeatedly beating his bat.
  <br>
  <br>
  Konstas said before the match he had a plan to combat Bumrah, and as he got his eye in he incredibly reverse ramped him for two fours and a six in one over, bringing the crowd alive.
  <br>
  <br>
  A frustrated Kohli forcefully bumped shoulders with him at one point and they exchanged words, which could see both players in trouble if the match referee takes the matter further.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I was just doing my gloves and I think he accidentally bumped me. But that's just cricket, the tension," said Konstas.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was unfazed and slammed 18 off the next Bumrah over, including another six.
  <br>
  <br>
  His half-century came off just 52 balls – the third-fastest on debut for Australia.
  <br>
  <br>
  At the other end Khawaja, twice the age of his opening partner, was content to be the support act, grinding his way to a 27th Test 50 in a welcome return to form.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bumrah finally removed him after a 121-ball stay with Khawaja's pull shot going only as far as KL Rahul at midwicket, leaving Labuschagne and Smith to see them to tea.
  <br>
  <br>
  Smith survived three lbw appeals from Akash Deep when they returned before India finally earned a reward when spinner Washington Sundar, in the side for Shubman Gill, tempted Labuschagne into a drive that was collected by Kohli.
  <br>
  <br>
  The dangerous Head marched to the crease after plundering centuries in both Adelaide and Brisbane but only lasted seven balls.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bumrah did the damage, with the Australian leaving a delivery that clattered into his off stump, before the Indian star accounted for Mitchell Marsh (4) and Alex Carey (31) fell to Deep.
  <br>
  <br>
  Smith kept plugging away to reach a 42nd Test 50 as he targets a second century of the series. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 At least 10,457 migrants died or disappeared while trying to reach Spain by sea in 2024, an NGO said on Thursday, more than 50 percent more than last year and the most since it began keeping a tally in 2007.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 58-percent increase includes 1,538 children and 421 women, migrants' rights group Caminando Fronteras or Walking Borders said in a report which covers the period from January 1 to December 5, 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  It amounts to an average of 30 deaths per day, up from around 18 in 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  The group compiles its data from hotlines set up for migrants on vessels in trouble to call for help, families of migrants who went missing and from official rescue statistics.
  <br>
  <br>
  It blamed the use of flimsy boats and increasingly dangerous routes as well as the insufficient capacity of maritime rescue services for the surge in deaths.
  <br>
  <br>
  "These figures are evidence of a profound failure of rescue and protection systems. More than 10,400 people dead or missing in a single year is an unacceptable tragedy," the group's founder, Helena Maleno, said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The victims were from 28 nations, mostly in Africa, but also from Iraq and Pakistan.
  <br>
  <br>
  The vast majority of the fatalities – 9,757 – took place on the Atlantic migration route from Africa to Spain's Canary Islands, which has received a record number of migrants for the second year in a row.
  <br>
  <br>
  Seven migrant boats landed in the archipelago on Wednesday, Christmas Day, Spain's maritime rescue service said on social media site X.
  <br>
  <br>
  At their closest point, the Canaries lie 100 kilometres off the coast of North Africa. The shortest route is between the coastal town of Tarfaya in southern Morocco and the island of Fuerteventura in the Canaries.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the Atlantic route to the Canary Islands is particularly dangerous because of strong currents.
  <br>
  <br>
  Along with Italy and Greece, Spain is one of the three major European gateways for migrant arrivals.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to the interior ministry, 60,216 migrants entered Spain irregularly between January 1 and December 15 – a 14.5 percent increase over the same time last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The majority, over 70 percent, landed in the Canaries. (AFP)

    Palestinian TV says Israeli strike kills 5 journalists

<img alt="An Israeli missile hit their vehicle outside the Al-Awda Hospital in Nuseirat. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1785079_1_20241226191746.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A Palestinian TV channel affiliated with a militant group said five of its journalists were killed on Thursday in an Israeli strike on their vehicle in Gaza, with Israel's military saying it had targeted a "terrorist cell."
 <br>
  <br>
  A missile hit the journalists' broadcast truck as it was parked in the Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza, according to a statement from their employer, Al-Quds Today.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is affiliated with Islamic Jihad, whose militants have fought alongside Hamas in the Gaza Strip and took part in the October 7, 2023 attack on Israel that sparked the war.
  <br>
  <br>
  The channel identified the five staffers as Faisal Abu Al-Qumsan, Ayman Al-Jadi, Ibrahim Al-Sheikh Khalil, Fadi Hassouna and Mohammed Al-Lada'a.
  <br>
  <br>
  They were killed "while performing their journalistic and humanitarian duty," the statement said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We affirm our commitment to continue our resistant media message," it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Israeli military said in its own statement that it had conducted "a precise strike on a vehicle with an Islamic Jihad terrorist cell inside in the area of Nuseirat."
  <br>
  <br>
  It added that "prior to the strike, numerous steps were taken to mitigate the risk of harming civilians."
  <br>
  <br>
  According to witnesses in Nuseirat, a missile fired by an Israeli aircraft hit the broadcast vehicle, which was parked outside Al-Awda Hospital, setting the vehicle on fire and killing those inside.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Committee to Protect Journalists' Middle East arm said the organisation was "devastated by the reports that five journalists and media workers were killed inside their broadcasting vehicle by an Israeli strike."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Journalists are civilians and must always be protected," it added in a statement on social media.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Palestinian Journalists Syndicate said last week that more than 190 journalists had been killed and at least 400 injured since the start of the war in Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was triggered by the Hamas-led October 7 attack last year, which resulted in 1,208 deaths, mostly civilians, according to a tally of Israeli official figures.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel's retaliatory military campaign has killed at least 45,361 people in Gaza, a majority of them civilians, according to figures from the Hamas-run territory's health ministry that the UN considers reliable. (AFP)

<img alt="LawConnect edged Comanche to win by just 51 seconds last year and the two 100-foot supermaxis are again expected to battle for line honours.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The crews of more than 100 yachts set sail on Thursday on a "boat-breaking" Sydney-Hobart yacht race, with gale-force winds and high seas forecast for the gruelling bluewater classic.
 <br>
  <br>
  Under blue, mid-summer skies, spectators crowded onto boats and lined the shore of a breezy Sydney Harbour as a starting cannon set the fleet on a dash to the open ocean.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a dramatic opening contest, reigning line honours champion LawConnect lost an early lead when one of her sails failed to unfurl.
  <br>
  <br>
  Comanche, four-time line honours champion and the event's record holder, took over as frontrunner.
  <br>
  <br>
  By late evening, Comanche was speeding southwards down Australia's east coast with a lead of more than eight nautical miles over LawConnect.
  <br>
  <br>
  LawConnect edged Comanche to win by just 51 seconds last year and the two 100-foot supermaxis are again expected to battle for line honours.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alive, last year's overall winner of the Tattersall Cup, which takes into account boat size and other factors, was the first casualty of this year's race, retiring with reported engine issues.
  <br>
  <br>
  Of the 104 entrants at the start of the race, 102 remain after the withdrawals of Alive and the two-handed Transcendence Rudy Project, which dismasted.
  <br>
  <br>
  Race crews face gales, storms and big waves as they sail south and then tackle the notorious Bass Strait towards the Tasmanian state capital Hobart.
  <br>
  <br>
  Weather is a critical factor in the 628-nautical mile event, first held in 1945. (AFP)

<img alt="Remarks from Bank of Japan governor Kazuo Ueda in which he refrained from signalling a potential interest rate hike next month boosted regional sentiment. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1785073_1_20241226183315.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Asian stocks rose in thin Boxing Day trade on Thursday, extending a "Santa Rally" with key markets Hong Kong and Sydney still shut for the holidays.
 <br>
  <br>
  Japan's Nikkei index closed up 1.1 percent, boosted by comments from the Bank of Japan governor and share price gains for top-selling automaker Toyota.
  <br>
  <br>
  China's plans for massive bond issuances in 2025 also bolstered investor sentiment.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Even though many in the region are still shaking off a bit of a holiday hangover, with several markets closed for Boxing Day, Asian stocks opened higher, riding a favourable wave from China's financial bond juggernaut," said Stephen Innes from SPI Asset Management.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shanghai, Bangkok and Taipei all edged up 0.1 percent, while Seoul lost 0.4 percent and Singapore shed 0.1 percent. Jakarta and Wellington were closed.
  <br>
  <br>
  London Stockton, an analyst at Ned Davis Research, noted that the "Santa Claus rally could still be alive, with strong seasonality into the end of the year."
  <br>
  <br>
  Stock markets have traditionally fared well in the last five trading days of the year and the first two in the new year, a trend known as the "Santa Claus rally."
  <br>
  <br>
  Among a number of possible reasons advanced by experts include the festive holiday mood and purchasing ahead of the end of the tax year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Innes said remarks from Bank of Japan governor Kazuo Ueda in which he refrained from signalling a potential interest rate hike next month also "influenced bullish regional sentiments."
  <br>
  <br>
  Japanese market heavyweight Toyota ended nearly six percent higher after reports in the Nikkei business daily said it aimed to double its return on equity – a key measure of a company's financial performance.
  <br>
  <br>
  In thin corporate news on Thursday, Japan Airlines reported a cyberattack that caused delays to domestic and international flights and prompted a temporary halt to ticket sales.
  <br>
  <br>
  However later in the day the carrier said its systems had been restored after the "large data attack."
  <br>
  <br>
  Markets had been closed across Europe and North America for Christmas. The Dow Jones closed up 0.9 percent on the eve, while the tech-heavy S&P 500 rallied 1.1 percent. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong travellers will soon be able to fly on the homegrown C919 aircraft from Chek Lap Kok airport, with China Eastern Airlines assigning the narrow-body passenger jet to its daily route between the SAR and Shanghai from January 1 next year.
 <br>
  <br>
  The news was announced by the the Transport and Logistics Bureau on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a Facebook post, Secretary for Transport Mable Chan thanked the Civil Aviation Administration of China for its continued strong support.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The move hopefully will allow more SAR residents a chance to step on the C919 and experience the remarkable achievements of the nation's aviation development. International travellers can also know more about the technological advances of China's aviation development," the post read.
  <br>
  <br>
  "By assigning the C919 to a regular route between Hong Kong and Shanghai Hongqiao airports, it reflects the importance of the SAR as a global aviation hub."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said she has already instructed the Civil Aviation Department and the Airport Authority to provide comprehensive assistance, ensure the best experience for passengers and promote the nation's aviation achievements.
  <br>
  <br>
  She earlier met representatives of Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China, or COMAC, and thanked the company for setting up an office in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong can provide assistance on many fronts, including aircraft maintenance, personnel training, as well as leasing and sale of aircraft," Chan wrote.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The SAR government on Thursday expressed its strong disapproval towards the extension of US sanctions under the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, accusing Washington of double standards and political grandstanding.
 <br>
  <br>
  The act was first signed into law in 2019. It was extended for another five years on Monday after US President Joe Biden passed the National Defence Authorisation Act, which includes a wide range of provisions.
  <br>
  <br>
  That means the US government will continue to impose sanctions on mainland and Hong Kong officials involved in the enactment of laws safeguarding national security.
  <br>
  <br>
  The act also demanded an annual review of Hong Kong's political situation and decide whether the SAR should continue to enjoy favourable treatment on trade relations.
  <br>
  <br>
  A Hong Kong government spokesperson said Washington was merely trying to intimidate SAR officials who safeguard national security according to the Hong Kong National Security Law and the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The HKSAR Government strongly condemns its [US government] political grandstanding rife with ill intentions, which have been seen through by all. The HKSAR despises the so-called 'sanctions' and will not be intimidated by such a despicable behaviour," the spokesperson said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The spokesperson reminded the US that it substantial economic interest in Hong Kong, citing a trade surplus of about US$270 billion over the past decade, while nearly 1,400 American companies operate in the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  The spokesperson reiterated that foreign governments and legislatures should not interfere in Hong Kong's internal affairs.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Australian authorities urged people in dozens of rural communities to leave home "immediately" on Thursday to escape an out-of-control bushfire tearing through a national park.
 <br>
  <br>
  About 600 firefighters were battling the blaze in the Grampians National Park 240 kilometres west of Melbourne, a Victoria state emergency services spokesperson said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The blaze has persisted for more than a week in hot, windy conditions, scorching 55,000 hectares (136,000 acres) – about one-third of the park – so far without causing any deaths or destroying homes.
  <br>
  <br>
  State emergency services warned residents to leave home immediately in more than two dozen mostly small rural communities, with populations ranging from as few as six to as many as several hundred.
  <br>
  <br>
  People in several other communities were told to take shelter indoors because it was unsafe to leave.
  <br>
  <br>
  Firefighters expected shifting winds to complicate their task during the day, said Victoria state control centre spokesman Luke Hegarty.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are reaching a critical part of the day when we see the wind change moving through the western part of the state," he said in an afternoon update.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're expecting strong winds and variable winds to be a concern for us over the next few hours."
  <br>
  <br>
  A total fire ban was declared across the whole of Victoria, barring any fires in the open air. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korea's opposition said on Thursday it had filed an impeachment motion against acting president Han Duck-soo, in an escalating row over the composition of the Constitutional Court which would decide whether to remove his predecessor from office.
 <br>
  <br>
  South Korea fell into a political crisis when President Yoon Suk Yeol, currently suspended, declared martial law on December 3.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon was stripped of his duties by parliament on December 14 over the dramatic declaration, but a constitutional court ruling upholding the decision by lawmakers is necessary to complete the impeachment process.
  <br>
  <br>
  The court is however currently short of three judges. While it can go ahead with its six members on the bench, a single dissenting vote would reinstate Yoon.
  <br>
  <br>
  The opposition wants Han to approve three more nominees to fill the bench, something that he has so far refused to do, essentially leaving both sides in a deadlock.
  <br>
  <br>
  The opposition Democratic Party therefore wants the acting president impeached too.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have filed the motion... and will report it to the plenary session today," MP Park Sung-joon told reporters at the National Assembly of the action against Han.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will put it to a vote tomorrow."
  <br>
  <br>
  Han's refusal to formally appoint the three judges proves that he "does not have the will or qualification to uphold the constitution," the Democratic Party's floor leader Park Chan-dae told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Han has said that he would certify the judges' appointments only if his ruling People Power Party (PPP) and the opposition reach a compromise on the nominees.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The consistent principle embedded in our constitution and laws is to refrain from exercising significant exclusive presidential powers, including the appointment of constitutional institutions," Han argued.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A consensus between the ruling and opposition parties in the National Assembly, representing the people, must first be reached," added the 75-year-old career bureaucrat.
  <br>
  <br>
  If the opposition passes the impeachment motion against Han in Friday's vote, it would mark the first time democratic South Korea has impeached an acting president.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Han's place, Finance Minister Choi Sang-mok would step in as acting president.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the impeachment motion, the opposition accuses Han of violating his duty as acting president, citing his refusal to formally appoint the judges and promulgate two special probe bills to investigate Yoon's short-lived imposition of martial law and graft allegations involving his wife, Kim Keon Hee.

Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1785051_1_20241226153332.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 LeBron James and Steph Curry served up a Christmas Day feast as their rivalry delivered another classic with the Los Angeles Lakers edging the Golden State Warriors 115-113 on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Curry made a stunning 31-foot three-point throw with 7.1 seconds left on the clock to tie the game, only for Austin Reaves to win the game for the Lakers with a driving layup with 1.1 seconds left.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 36-year-old Curry and James, three years his senior, had traded three-pointers down the stretch as fans were treated to a ding-dong finale from the two future Hall of Famers.
  <br>
  <br>
  James put up 31 points and ten assists without the support of teammate Anthony Davis, who left the game in the first quarter after turning his ankle.
  <br>
  <br>
  Game-winner Reaves enjoyed a triple-double with 26 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists.
  <br>
  <br>
  Curry's 38 points included 8-15 three-point shooting while Anthony Wiggins made 21 points and 12 rebounds, but Golden State fell to an 11th loss in 14 games.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Today is the day of giving, and that's what me and Steph continue to do and try to do for our fans, for our beautiful game," said James.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We don't know how many times we're going to be able to have this matchup. We try to give the game what it deserves, because it's given us so much, we try to give it right back," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  James was playing in a record 19th Christmas Day game and took the occasion to take a gentle swipe at the NFL's encroachment on the day.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I love the NFL but Christmas is our day," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mikal Bridges and the New York Knicks edged Victor Wembanyama and the San Antonio Spurs 117-114 in a thriller at Madison Square Garden.
  <br>
  <br>
  French star Wembanyama put up 42 points with 18 rebounds and four blocks for the Spurs but Bridges took the glory with a brilliant 15-point fourth-quarter display that left him with a season-high 41 points and the win.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 20-year-old, who stands 7-foot-3 (2.21m), was 16-31 on shooting and made six of 16 three-point throws and while Bridges took the applause from the home crowd, he was quick to praise the Frenchman.
  <br>
  <br>
  "From 40 feet out, from right under the rim, from 15 feet out, he's just unbelievable, just to see what he's doing, credit to him and how much work he has put in," said Bridges.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 28-year-old Bridges, who was traded from the Brooklyn Nets in July, shot 17-25 from the field and was six for nine on three-point attempts as his team improved to 20-10.
  <br>
  <br>
  San Antonio were just a point behind with two minutes remaining before Bridges made back-to-back jumpers to open up a five-point lead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Karl-Anthony Towns with 21 points and Jalen Brunson with 20 points and nine assists were crucial for the Knicks in the win.
  <br>
  <br>
  Defending champions the Boston Celtics (22-8) lost back-to-back games for the first time this season when they were upset at home by the Philadelphia 76ers 118-114.
  <br>
  <br>
  Injury-prone 76ers star Joel Embiid hurt his ankle in a pre-game fall but was able to start and showed his importance with 27 points, nine rebounds and the game-clinching free throws at the end to clinch the win for the 11-17 Philadelphia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tyres Maxey scored 33 points and made 12 assists with his 13 points in the fourth quarter crucial as Philadelphia, who had led by 16 at the break, recovered from Boston's third quarter rally.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jayson Tatum top-scored for the Celtics with 32 points and also grabbed 15 rebounds.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was far from a Merry Christmas for the Dallas Mavericks who lost their Slovenian star Luka Doncic with a calf injury in the second quarter of their 105-99 loss to the Minnesota Timberwolves in a rematch of last season's Western Conference finals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Doncic, who had scored 14 points, limped out of the game and did not return. The Mavericks did manage a brave comeback attempt without him, before falling short.
  <br>
  <br>
  Anthony Edwards put up 26 points for Minnesota.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Timberwolves led 57-40 at the half and extended that advantage to 28-points before Dallas, led by Kyrie Irving who made 39 points, started to work their way back into the contest.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was close at the end but Irving missed a three-point shot that would have given Dallas the lead in the last minute and a two-foot shot from Edwards and a pair of free throws from Julius Randle made sure of the win. (AFP)

    Greenpeace laments HK's waste reduction progress

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A Greenpeace campaigner on Thursday said Hong Kong saw a drop in the volume of rubbish dumped at landfills last year, but the improvement is marginal and far from satisfactory.
 <br>
  <br>
  According to statistics published by the Environmental Protection Department last week, the city's municipal solid waste dropped by 2.2 percent to 10,111 tonnes per day in 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on an RTHK programme, Leanne Tam said the data showed little progress was made on waste reduction over the past decade.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Looking at the data, the reduction is not significant. Ten years ago, the government set many different waste reduction targets, such as increasing recycling rates to around 50 percent," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Compared to 10 years ago, our current daily municipal solid waste volume remains high at nearly 11,000 tonnes, which really isn't much of a difference."
  <br>
  <br>
  Tam added that while recycling rates increased, the improvement was minimal. She pointed out that the volume of recycled plastics went up by 7,300 tonnes last year, which is equivalent to only three days' worth of plastic waste generated.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The increase in recycling is actually not significant. And in recent years, recycling has cost hundreds of millions in public funds annually for community recycling facilities, but this only resulted in a one percent increase this year. We believe this shows poor cost-effectiveness and efficiency," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The advocate said the focus should shift more towards reducing waste at source rather than just recycling, including implementing reusable tableware systems and encouraging people to bring their own containers through incentives.

    Catering business merry this Christmas
   </title>

<img alt="" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1785032_1_20241226131102.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A catering representative said business was up 8 percent compared to last year during Christmas, despite residents travelling out of Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  That's partly attributed to the resumption of the multi-entry visa for Shenzhen residents as well as the SAR hosting activities such as a pyrotechnics show across the harbour.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on an RTHK programme on Thursday, Simon Wong, president of the Hong Kong Federation of Restaurants and Related Trades, says the industry has also adopted new promotion tactics to attract tourists.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We see a lot of hotels and different eateries rolling out new ideas, like using the panda theme, putting up panda decorations, and introducing new dishes. These attract mainland tourists to come to Hong Kong to spend Christmas apart from just seeing the show, as the city has a more festive atmosphere than the mainland," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong pointed out that quite a number of mainland tourists stayed in the city for a couple more days, rather than heading home immediately after a day trip.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that hotels offering buffets benefited the most among all eateries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Lau Hak-bun, the chief supervisor of The Kowloon Pearls, Precious Stones, Jade, Gold and Silver Ornament Merchants Association, told the same programme that business in his sector this Christmas was more or less the same as last year's.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The people flow this Christmas was much higher than last year's, more than a 10 percent increase. But this did not help much with our sales. The performance was almost the same as last year," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With the resumption of the multi-entry visa two weeks ago, the number of mainland customers continued to increase, and sales these two days are quite good. We expect a slight increase in business by New Year's Eve," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lau also said he expects gold sales to improve before the Lunar New Year as people tend to buy gold accessories to prepare for the festival, despite the price of gold having increased by around 20 percent compared to early 2024.

    O'Sullivan to move to HK, hails city's snooker scene

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Snooker star Ronnie O'Sullivan, who recently obtained residency in Hong Kong, said he will try to ramp up his form ahead of a major tournament scheduled in Kai Tak in March next year.
 <br>
  <br>
  The seven-time world champion became an SAR resident in October through the Quality Migrant Admission Scheme. Fellow snooker star Judd Trump followed suit earlier this week.
  <br>
  <br>
  O'Sullivan explained what drove the decision during an exclusive interview with RTHK in Macau, where he's headlining an invitational tournament.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I always enjoyed playing in Hong Kong, with a fantastic venue and good promoters," O'Sullivan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Rocket", as he's often referred to, is also looking forward to the World Grand Prix at the Kai Tak Sports Park, the first snooker ranking event in the city in more than three decades.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I need to play some more tournaments to be ready, I think. My aim is to play more tournaments in the new year … I need to maybe make a bit more of an effort," he admitted.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 49-year-old Englishman said he'll consider "year by year" whether to wrap up his professional career.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he already revealed plans to set up a number of snooker clubs around the world, including in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Everybody loves snooker, and everyone loves to watch snooker. Snooker is the hardest out of all the cue sports. It's very popular here in Hong Kong," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think [Hong Kong] needs a good academy, good training centre for young players to come and learn and get good coaching, and help them develop their own game."
  <br>
  <br>
  He also confirmed plans to relocate to the city, and is now looking for an apartment with a view of Victoria Harbour.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked about Trump's decision to follow in his footsteps, O'Sullivan said it was "not out of surprise".
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think it makes sense since [Trump's] girlfriend is from Hong Kong. He likes being here more than the UK, it makes complete sense for him," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked whether he will be open to collaboration, O'Sullivan gave a more reserved answer.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I don't really align myself with other players. I like to be my own boss, do my own thing. I think it's better if we both do our own career, our own stuff away from snooker," O'Sullivan replied.

    Tsunami memorials begin across Asia 20 years on

<div class="itemFullText">
 Emotional ceremonies began across Asia on Thursday to remember the 220,000 people who died two decades ago when a tsunami devastated coastal areas around the Indian Ocean, in one of the worst natural disasters in human history.
 <br>
  <br>
  On December 26, 2004, a 9.1-magnitude earthquake off Indonesia's western tip generated a series of massive waves that pummelled the coastline of 14 countries, from Indonesia to Somalia.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Indonesia's Aceh Province where more than 100,000 people were killed, a siren rang out for three minutes at the Baiturrahman Grand Mosque, followed by Islamic prayers to kick off a series of memorials scheduled around the region.
  <br>
  <br>
  Indonesian mourners will attend a mass grave ceremony and a communal evening prayer in provincial capital Banda Aceh, while beachside memorials and religious ceremonies were scheduled in Sri Lanka, India and Thailand, some of the worst hit countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I thought it was doomsday," said Hasnawati, a 54-year-old teacher who goes by one name, at the mosque which was damaged by the tsunami.
  <br>
  <br>
  "On a Sunday morning where our family were all laughing together, suddenly a disaster struck and everything's gone. I can't describe it with words."
  <br>
  <br>
  Victims of waves as high as 30 metres included many foreign tourists celebrating Christmas on the region's sun-kissed beaches, bringing the tragedy into homes around the globe.
  <br>
  <br>
  The seabed being ripped open pushed waves at double the speed of a bullet train, crossing the Indian Ocean within hours.
  <br>
  <br>
  A total of 226,408 people died as a result of the tsunami, according to EM-DAT, a recognised global disaster database.
  <br>
  <br>
  There was no warning of the impending tsunami, giving little time for evacuation, despite the hours-long gaps between the waves striking different continents.
  <br>
  <br>
  Indonesia suffered the highest death toll, with more than 160,000 people killed along its western coast.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Thailand, where half of the more than 5,000 dead were foreign tourists, unofficial vigils were expected to accompany a government memorial ceremony. (AFP)

 Thousands protested on Wednesday in several areas of Syria after a video circulated showing an attack on an Alawite shrine in the country's north, a war monitor and witnesses said.
 <br>
  <br>
  Syria's new Islamist-led authorities said the footage was "old" and that "unknown groups" were behind the attack, saying "republishing" the video served to "stir up strife", a day after hundreds protested in Damascus against the torching of a Christmas tree.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said "thousands of people" took to the streets on Wednesday, with major demonstrations in the coastal cities of Tartus and Latakia, provinces that are the heartland of the Alawite minority which deposed ruler Bashar al-Assad hails from.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Britain-based Observatory also reported protests in parts of the central city of Homs and other areas including Qardaha, Assad's hometown.
  <br>
  <br>
  State news agency SANA said police in central Homs imposed a curfew from 6:00 pm until 8:00 am local time on Thursday, while local authorities in Jableh also announced a night-time curfew.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Observatory said the protests erupted after a video began circulating earlier on Wednesday showing "an attack by fighters" on an important Alawite shrine in the Maysaloon district of Syria's second city Aleppo.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said five workers were killed, adding that the shrine was set ablaze.
  <br>
  <br>
  Observatory chief Rami Abdel Rahman said the video was filmed early this month, after rebels led by Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) launched a lightning offensive and seized control of major cities including Aleppo on December 1, ousting Assad a week later. (AFP)

 An Azerbaijan Airlines passenger jet crashed on Wednesday in western Kazakhstan, killing 38 of the 67 people on board, officials said.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Embraer 190 aircraft was supposed to fly northwest from the Azerbaijani capital Baku to the city of Grozny in southern Russia, but instead flew across the Caspian Sea and went down near the city of Aktau in Kazakhstan.
  <br>
  <br>
  The plane's course on Flight Radar website showed it flying away from its normal route and then circling over the area where it eventually crashed near Aktau, which is an oil and gas hub on the eastern shore of the Caspian Sea.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The situation is not very good, 38 dead," Russia's Interfax news agency quoted Kazakh Deputy Prime Minister Kanat Bozumbayev as saying.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Kazakh emergency situations ministry reported that "29 survivors including three children have been hospitalised."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Kazakh transport ministry said the plane was carrying 37 nationals from Azerbaijan, six from Kazakhstan, three from Kyrgyzstan and 16 from Russia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Azerbaijan Airlines, the country's flag carrier, said the plane "made an emergency landing" around three kilometres from Aktau.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kazakhstan said it had opened an investigation into the cause of the crash, which was not immediately clear.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We cannot disclose any investigation results at this time," the office of Azerbaijan's prosecutor general said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "All possible scenarios are being examined, and the necessary expert analyses are underway," it added. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Pope Francis called on Wednesday for "arms to be silenced" around the world in his Christmas address, appealing for peace in the Middle East, Ukraine and Sudan as he denounced the "extremely grave" humanitarian situation in Gaza.
 <br>
  <br>
  He used his traditional message to the world's 1.4 billion Catholics to call for talks for a just peace in Ukraine as the country was pummelled by 170 Russian missiles and drones in a Christmas morning barrage Kyiv branded as "inhumane."
  <br>
  <br>
  His voice breathless, the 88-year-old pontiff also appealed for a ceasefire in Gaza and for the freeing of Israeli hostages held there by Hamas.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think of the Christian communities in Israel and Palestine, particularly in Gaza, where the humanitarian situation is extremely grave," he told thousands of the faithful gathered in front of St Peter's Basilica in Rome for the "Urbi et Orbi" ("to the city and the world") address.
  <br>
  <br>
  "May there be a ceasefire, may the hostages be released and aid be given to the people worn out by hunger and by war."
  <br>
  <br>
  Francis also extended his call for peace to Sudan, which has been ravaged by 20 months of brutal civil war and where millions are under the threat of famine.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky railed at Russia's attempt to take out his country's battered power grid, with one energy worker killed in the 13th major attack on the system this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Putin deliberately chose Christmas to attack," he said. "What could be more inhumane? More than 70 missiles, including ballistic missiles, and more than 100 attack drones."
  <br>
  <br>
  Ukraine has been marking Christmas on December 25 for the past two years rather than on January 7, when most Orthodox believers celebrate, as a snub to Moscow.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, Russia said five people were killed in Ukrainian strikes on its territory overnight, including one by a downed drone in North Ossetia in the Caucasus.
  <br>
  <br>
  The feast day was also marred by tragedy when an Azerbaijan Airlines jet carrying 67 people from Baku to the Chechen capital Grozny crashed in western Kazakhstan, officials said, though 32 survivors have been reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  Christmas celebrations were also muted in the biblical birthplace of Jesus, the Israeli-occupied West Bank city of Bethlehem.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since the war in Gaza began, the Palestinian town has done away with its giant Christmas tree and the elaborate decorations that normally draw throngs of tourists.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This year we limited our joy," said Bethlehem mayor Anton Salman.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Latin patriarch, Archbishop Pierbattista Pizzaballa, told a small crowd there on Tuesday that he had just returned from Gaza, where he "saw everything destroyed, poverty, disaster".
  <br>
  <br>
  "But I also saw life – they don't give up. So you should not give up either. Never."
  <br>
  <br>
  At Manger Square, in the heart of the Palestinian city, a group of scouts held a parade that broke the silence.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We want life, not death," read banners carried by them and "Stop the Gaza genocide now!"
  <br>
  <br>
  About 1,100 Christians live in Gaza, with hundreds gathering at a church there to pray for an end to the war.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This Christmas carries the stench of death and destruction," said George al-Sayegh, who has had to take refuge for weeks in the 12th-century Greek Orthodox Church of Saint Porphyrius in Gaza City.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a message to Christians all over the world, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu thanked them for supporting Israel's fight against the "forces of evil."
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere in the Middle East, hundreds of people took to the streets in Christian areas of Damascus to protest the burning of a Christmas tree in a Syrian town, just over two weeks after Islamist-led rebels ousted president Bashar al-Assad.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If we're not allowed to live our Christian faith in our country, as we used to, then we don't belong here anymore," said a demonstrator who gave his name as George.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Germany, Christmas was also a grim affair for many families after a deadly attack at a market, prompting President Frank-Walter Steinmeier to issue a message of healing.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hatred and violence must not have the final word," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Buenos Aires, a Christmas solidarity dinner for the homeless fed around three thousand people at a time when more than half of Argentina's population is affected by poverty.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the United States, where the annual tradition of "tracking" Santa Claus swung into action, a US Air Force general said there was no need to worry that recent mystery drone sightings might affect deliveries.
  <br>
  <br>
  And in Paris, worshippers gathered at the Notre Dame cathedral for the first Christmas mass since its reopening following a devastating fire in 2019. (AFP)
