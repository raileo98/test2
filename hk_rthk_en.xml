 The Hong Kong Sevens tournament kicked off with a bang at Kai Tak Stadium on Friday, as the Canadian and Japanese women's squads faced off.
 <br>
  <br>
  More than 1,000 spectators watched the inaugural Hong Kong Sevens match played at the new venue at 10:30am.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A strong 7.7 magnitude earthquake hit central Myanmar on Friday, the United States Geological Survey (USGS) said, buckling roads in the capital Naypyidaw and with tremors felt in China and Thailand.
 <br>
  <br>
  Bangkok police say a high-rise building under construction collapsed when the earthquake hit  around midday, and possible casualties are not yet known.
  <br>
  <br>
  A dramatic video circulating on social media showed the multi-story building with a crane on top collapsing into a cloud of dust, while onlookers screamed and ran.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police said they were responding to the collapse, which happened near Bangkok’s popular Chatuchak Market, but had no immediate information on how many workers were on the site at the time of the collapse.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tremor's epicentre was located 16 kilometres northwest of the city of Sagaing at a depth of 10 kilometres around 12:50 pm, the USGS said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some metro and light rail services were suspended in Bangkok.
  <br>
  <br>
  Roads were buckled by the force of the tremors and chunks of ceilings fell from buildings.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tremors were also felt through northern Thailand and down to the capital Bangkok, where residents ran into the streets as buildings shook.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I heard it and I was sleeping in the house, I ran as far as I could in my pyjamas out of the building," said Duangjai, a resident of the popular northern tourist city Chiang Mai.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tremors were also felt in Yunnan province, according to Beijing's quake agency, which said the jolt measured 7.9 in magnitude.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earthquakes are relatively common in Myanmar, where six strong quakes of 7.0 magnitude or more struck between 1930 and 1956 near the Sagaing Fault, which runs north to south through the centre of the country, according to the USGS.
  <br>
  <br>
  A powerful 6.8-magnitude earthquake in the ancient capital Bagan in central Myanmar killed three people in 2016, also toppling spires and crumbling temple walls at the tourist destination.
  <br>
  <br>
  The impoverished Southeast Asian nation has a strained medical system, especially in its rural states. (AFP/AP)

<img alt="Danny Woo says the ICAC has started using an AI system to improve work efficiency. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797856_2_20250328151239.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The city's top graft-buster, Danny Woo, on Friday warned that authorities will take tough action against those who call for invalid votes to be cast during the upcoming election for the city's legislature at the end of the year.
 <br>
  <br>
  His remarks came after Chief Executive John Lee last week announced that the general election for the Legislative Council will be held on December 7, with a by-election to be held on September 7.
  <br>
  <br>
  In an interview with local media, Woo, who heads the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC), reminded the public that disrupting the electoral process is a legal offence.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Never ever try to challenge the law because it's clearly written that it's an offence for any person to incite others not to vote or to cast invalid votes through any public activities during the election period," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And also do not share or repost these remarks as there is a chance of breaking the law as well."
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, Woo noted that the number of complaints reported to the ICAC rose to 2,058 last year, three percent higher.
  <br>
  <br>
  Forty-four of the cases were made against the Hong Kong Correctional Services, and that was more than double that of a year earlier.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, Woo pointed out, only a small number of the cases reached the prosecution phase.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ICAC, he said, is seeking to use artificial intelligence to improve work efficiency and has launched an AI system, Dr Deep, based on mainland firm DeepSeek's AI models, to help combat corruption.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I want to emphasise that many of our own systems are developed by ourselves because many of them contain confidential and sensitive information," Woo said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So our computer systems are studied and maintained in-house and not operated on by outsiders.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This means our development of AI is also done by ourselves.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Since DeepSeek unveiled its large AI models, it's been a real eye-opener," Woo said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He hinted that the Dr Deep system could be available for public use in the future and that residents could search for corruption-related information on the system.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Myanmar's junta chief Min Aung Hlaing will join a regional leaders' summit in Thailand next week where he is seeking high-level bilateral meetings, said three sources with direct knowledge, in a rare visit to a Southeast Asian country since seizing power in coup that led to a civil war.
 <br>
  <br>
  Min Aung Hlaing is the subject of widespread western sanctions and is barred from attending summits of the Southeast Asian bloc ASEAN due to the Myanmar military's failure to implement an agreed peace plan with the bloc.
  <br>
  <br>
  He will join the April 3-4 summit in Bangkok of the BIMSTEC grouping of mostly South Asian countries, where the Myanmar delegation is seeking bilateral meetings with leaders and top officials.
  <br>
  <br>
  The meetings being sought include ones with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the chief adviser of Bangladesh’s interim government, Muhammed Yunus, the sources said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They have been reaching out asking for meetings," one of the sources said, referring to Myanmar officials.
  <br>
  <br>
  Myanmar has been in crisis since the military overthrew the elected government of Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi, sparking mass protests that escalated into an armed rebellion against the junta.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than a third of the population is in need of humanitarian assistance, according to the United Nations.
  <br>
  <br>
  The junta chief said on Thursday said an election would be held in December, promising a free and fair vote and to transfer state power to the winning party. (Reuters)

<img alt="Jessica Pegula has a word with Alexandra Eala after squeezing through to the finals. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797850_2_20250328133508.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Philippines sensation Alexandra Eala's remarkable run at the Miami Open came to a brave end with a three-set loss to Jessica Pegula in the semi-finals on Friday Hong Kong time.
 <br>
  <br>
  In an enthralling and exhausting battle over two hours and 24 minutes, fourth-seeded American Pegula emerged with a 7-6 (7/3) 5-7 6-3 win to seal a place in Saturday's final against world number one Aryna Sabalenka.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 19-year-old Eala, ranked 140th in the world, had only two WTA main draw victories to her name before arriving in Miami.
  <br>
  <br>
  She proceeded to beat three Grand Slam winners in Jelena Ostapenko, Madison Keys and world number two Iga Swiatek.
  <br>
  <br>
  The lowest-ranked semi-finalist in the tournament's history, Eala seriously threatened to go one step further with another accomplished and effervescent display.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tide looked to have turned against her when Pegula broke to go 3-1 up in the second set, but Eala broke back and her fist pump and look of determination was a sign of things to come.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eala broke Pegula three times in the set and was broken twice herself but crucially was able to hold when serving for the set at 6-5.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both players protected their serve better in the deciding set but Eala's forehand let her down when the American broke to go 5-3 up and she served out for a victory that brought her visible relief.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sabalenka blasted her way into the final with a convincing 6-2 6-2 demolition of Italy's Jasmine Paolini.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sabalenka needed just 71 minutes to wrap up her win against the sixth seed and with the win the Belarusian, who was beaten in the Indian Wells final earlier this month by Mirra Andreeva, will appear in the Miami final for the first time in her career.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm super happy with the level I played today. Of course super happy to be in my first Miami Open final," said Sabalenka.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sabalenka was never behind against Paolini and the match was only tied twice – at 1-1 in each set.
  <br>
  <br>
  She served six aces and broke the Italian's serve four times,
  <br>
  <br>
  "I definitely would say that this was one of the best matches in the season so far.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I don't know. I was just so focused on myself, on the things I had to do today.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It felt like everything was just going smoothly my way," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sabalenka will be keen to banish the memory of defeat in the Indian Wells final and in the Australian Open final, where she lost to Keys.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The lessons [of those defeats] was I believe focus on myself, not on what's going on the other side," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think in those finals I was more focusing on my opponents than on myself.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think I just have to bring the same attitude, the same mindset that I had today, I think I have to bring it in the finals.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I really feel this time I'm going to do better than I did in the last two finals," added the 26-year-old.
  <br>
  <br>
  She is only the sixth woman to reach the finals of both stops on the American "Sunshine Swing" in the same season. (AFP)

<img alt="Relatives of drug war and extrajudicial killing victims in Quezon City watch a live telecast of the initial appearance of Rodrigo Duterte at the International Criminal Court in the Hague. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797846_1_20250328130849.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Family and supporters of former Philippine president Rodrigo Duterte will rally on Friday to mark his 80th birthday and protest his detention in The Hague on a charge of crimes against humanity.
 <br>
  <br>
  Duterte could spend the rest of his life in jail if convicted at the International Criminal Court (ICC) of the charge tied to his "war on drugs" in which thousands were killed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Supporters are planning more than 200 simultaneous birthday rallies demanding his release.
  <br>
  <br>
  Philippine Vice President Sara Duterte, his eldest daughter, has been in the Dutch city for more than two weeks helping assemble his legal team.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another of the ex-president's daughters, 20-year-old Veronica as well as her mother, Cielito Avancena, said they failed to get inside the prison to see him on Wednesday – but remained hopeful.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I will make sure I get to see him," Veronica told a Philippine television network outside the ICC detention centre.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another of the ex-president's sons is expected, as well as his ex-wife Elizabeth Zimmerman, according to Sara Duterte.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ICC chief prosecutor's application for his arrest said Duterte's alleged crimes were "part of a widespread and systematic attack directed against the civilian population" in the Philippines.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Potentially tens of thousands of killings were perpetrated," the prosecutor alleged of the campaign that targeted mostly poor men, often without proof they were linked to drugs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Duterte's arrest on March 11 and rapid handover to the international tribunal came on the heels of his family's bitter falling out with his successor, President Ferdinand Marcos.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cracks began to appear in their alliance soon after Marcos teamed up with Sara Duterte to sweep the presidential and vice presidential elections in May 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  The vice president quit her cabinet post as education secretary after being denied the defence portfolio, while Duterte himself began calling Marcos a drug addict.

  Last month, Sara Duterte was impeached by a pro-Marcos House of Representatives on charges that include an alleged assassination plot against the president.

  The outcome of her Senate trial will likely depend on the number of seats her allies win in May 12 mid-term elections.

  One of her party's candidates, former Philippine police chief and drug war enforcer Ronald Dela Rosa, says he expects to be arrested by the ICC next.

  The ex-president faces a six-month wait inside the United Nations' Scheveningen prison before his next scheduled court appearance on September 23.
  <br>
  <br>
  He is only allowed two visits per day – a lawyer and a family member, said the vice president.
  <br>

  "I urged him to write a book and then when you get out, we'll sell it and make money out of it," she said. (AFP)

 Public transport operators are boosting services to accommodate the large crowds of passengers expected during the Hong Kong Sevens tournament.
 <br>
  <br>
  The three-day event at the new Kai Tak Stadium started on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The MTR said it was increasing the frequency of trains on the Tuen Ma Line and deploying more staff than usual at Kai Tak and Sung Wong Toi stations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Citybus and KMB, meanwhile, said 11 special routes would be in operation at the end of each day of the tournament.

    HK stock swings propel derivatives trade to highs

<img alt="The number of outstanding futures and options contracts on the city's bourse has surpassed the record set last year by 70 percent. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797841_1_20250328124759.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Big swings in stock markets and hedge fund activity have propelled Hong Kong's derivative trading to unprecedented highs.
 <br>
  <br>
  The number of outstanding futures and options contracts on the city's bourse has reached 22 million so far this year, surpassing the record set in 2024 by 70 percent in less than three months.
  <br>
  <br>
  Analysts and investors attribute the sharp rise in the use of derivatives this year to the craze around Chinese technology firms and the growing use of hedging tools by long-short funds to navigate geopolitical and tariff uncertainties.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stock exchange operator Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing has boosted its derivatives offering over the past six months to meet the market's growing demand as investors look to gain more exposure to Chinese assets in a way that helps lower their risk.
  <br>
  <br>
  New product launches have included Weekly Hang Seng Tech Index Options as well as weekly options for 10 individual stocks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Options, particularly those betting on large tech companies such as Tencent, Alibaba and Xiaomi, have dominated the increase in trading, the analysts and investors said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have seen meaningful pick-up in single stock options activities," said Jason Lui, head of APAC equity and derivatives strategy at BNP Paribas in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  By entering into call or put options contracts, investors make leveraged bets on the future price movements of the underlying assets but limit losses.
  <br>
  <br>
  Outsized gains in some very large companies have spurred investors to trade single stock options to maximise returns, Lui said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The emergence of China's low-cost artificial intelligence reasoning model DeepSeek and President Xi Jinping's rare meeting with tech entrepreneurs have sent the Hang Seng Index up 17 percent this year. E-commerce giant Alibaba and smartphone and EV maker Xiaomi have surged 50 percent each to lead the gains.
  <br>
  <br>
  Big stock swings often come with high volatility, posing particular risks to the Chinese market, which still faces tariff threats from US President Donald Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ocean Arete, a Hong Kong-based US$1 billion macro hedge fund, recently boosted its China equity exposure while staying hedged for potential market turbulence.
  <br>
  <br>
  "One of the primary uncertainties we're trying to navigate is the US-China relationship and geopolitics broadly," said Yuexin Zeng, head of investor relations at Ocean Arete.
  <br>
  <br>
  Volatility will "remain higher for longer," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  A volatility gauge tracking the Hang Seng Index hit a two-year high in October and rose again last month when the Hong Kong benchmark skyrocketed to a three-year high.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hedge fund Aspoon Capital, which generated a 14 percent return in the first two months this year, is adding China tech index put options to hedge the tariff risk.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We do think the market can be too complacent about the tariff now," Aspoon Chief Investment Officer Ryan Yin said in a newsletter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Derivatives trading "absolutely has been strong in the last three to six months for China underlying [assets]," said Nick Silver, head of prime services for Asia Pacific at BNP Paribas.
  <br>
  <br>
  Investors have had to become much more familiar with trading in a choppy and sometimes downward trending market in recent years, he said, "and using derivatives is probably the best, most efficient way to do that." (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Josh Giddey buried a miracle shot from beyond halfcourt at the final buzzer as the Chicago Bulls overturned an 18-point fourth-quarter deficit to beat the Los Angeles Lakers 119-117.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Bulls (33-40) trailed 115-110 with 12.6 seconds remaining before delivering down the stretch with a wild sequence of plays.
  <br>
  <br>
  Patrick Williams hit a 3-pointer to trim the deficit back to two points before Giddey, who moments earlier had airballed a floater, stole LeBron James' inbound pass, flicked the pass to White, who drained a trey to put Chicago in front 116-115 with 6.1 seconds to play.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Lakers retrieved the lead on an Austin Reaves layup with 3.3 seconds on the clock, before the Bulls, who had no timeouts left, struck at the buzzer.
  <br>
  <br>
  Giddey passed the inbound to Williams, who gave it straight back and the Australian nailed the game-winning 47-foot prayer over James.
  <br>
  <br>
  Giddey finished with 25 points, 14 rebounds and 11 assists for his fifth triple-double of the season, while Coby White scored 26 points and Kevin Huerter added 21.
  <br>
  <br>
  Reaves scored 30 points for the Lakers, and Luka Doncic had 25 points, 10 boards and eight assists. Jaxson Hayes contributed 19 points, and James paired 17 points with 12 assists.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Lakers' lead had ballooned to 91-75 on the back of a commanding 32-17 third period in which they dominated the Bulls at both ends.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere, the Indiana Pacers set a club record by scoring 162 points in their 53-point win over the Washington wizards, who also gave up the most points in their franchise history.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Pacers scored five more than the previous record set last season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tyrese Haliburton led the way with 29 points for the Pacers, becoming one of nine players who scored in double figures. (Reuters)

    'Use AI chatbots in triage system to avoid mistakes'
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<div>
<img alt="A patients' rights group has proposed the use of AI chatbots in triage system at public hospitals to help patients gain a better understanding of their conditions. File Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797824_1_20250328114303.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A patients' rights group says it hopes the government can use AI chatbots in its triage system at public hospitals to help patients gain a better understanding of their conditions and symptoms.
 <br>
  <br>
  “I have used the UK emergency service as well,” WeCareBill Foundation co-founder Kelly Yim said in RTHK's Backchat programme on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I find it quite useful when they have the AI chatbot to do the challenging bits, like differentiating the level of emergency of a patient.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I'm just thinking maybe we can do this with nurse consultations or triages, and try with more advanced technology so that maybe this risk [of misjudgements] can be mitigated.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Some people have expressed worries about being charged more because of being categorised wrongly during triages when the revamped healthcare charges come into effect from January 1.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under the changes, "critical" and "emergency" patients being treated at  accident and emergency (A&E) wards will have their charges exempted, while fees for “urgent”, “semi-urgent” and “non-urgent” patients will be raised to HK$400 from HK$180.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government has relaxed income and asset limits to expand eligibility for medical fee waivers and said about 1.4 million people are expected to benefit from the tweaks, up from 300,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the same programme, an official from the Hospital Authority reiterated that the revamp is aimed at focusing resources on serving those in need.
  <br>
  <br>
  “With all these measures, we are trying to reserve our healthcare resources [in order to help, in particular, acute, serious and critical patients]," the authority’s chief manager in allied health,  Priscilla Poon, said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “But at the same time, we won't forget [the less well-off sections of the public].
  <br>
  <br>
  “So that's the reason why we need ... balance.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We need to impose some kind of relaxation of our waiver mechanisms and safety net in order to help ... the poor, who are not really actually supported by other, say, private services.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, a former A&E doctor also urged the government to prioritise the implementation of advanced technology to help cope with a manpower shortage.
  <br>
  <br>
  Aaron Lee, who’s now a clinical assistant professor at the University of Hong Kong, said the new fees planned for emergency wards at public hospitals could reduce the burden on staff.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he stressed that the effect may only be short-term.
  <br>
  <br>
  “This effect will tail off," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We saw it with previous increases in fees in the departments before,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “So there must be some implementation of more important measures in the departments...
  <br>
  <br>
  "There may be implementation of the AI system, not only in the A&E departments, but also maybe at the primary-care level.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee said a big burden would be lifted from the public healthcare system if patients were able to conduct some sort of tests themselves before deciding whether to seek medical attention at hospitals.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping met with representatives of the international business community in Beijing following last weekend's China Development Forum (CDF), Xinhua News Agency reported on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  "China is firmly committed to advancing reform and opening up. The door of opening up will only open wider and wider," Xi told the executives, including hedge fund boss Ray Dalio and Samsung Electronics chief Lee Jae-yong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China is committed to high-quality development and accelerating green, digital and intelligent transformation, and has strong industrial supporting capacity," Xi said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Foreign enterprises in China can develop their advantages and capabilities and gain an advantage in global competition," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Thursday, Reuters reported that the global heads of German automakers BMW and Mercedes, as well as chip giant Qualcomm were among the foreign business leaders attending the meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  Friday's gathering also followed a similar one last year, which saw the first meeting between Xi and foreign business leaders after the CDF.
  <br>
  <br>
  This year's CDF saw Premier Li Qiang urge countries to open their markets and combat "rising instability and uncertainty". (Agencies)

    Rubio says too early for high-level Russia talks

<img alt="Marco Rubio says US President Donald Trump's administration would hold consultations to discuss the outcome of the meetings with Russia. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797827_1_20250328115755.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US Secretary of State Marco Rubio warned on Thursday it was premature to expect high-level talks with Russia, while the United States weighs Moscow's response to Washington's efforts to end the Ukraine war.
 <br>
  <br>
  Asked by a reporter if it was time for higher-level talks after indirect US negotiations with the two sides in Saudi Arabia, Rubio said: "I think you have to make more progress on a technical level."
  <br>
  <br>
  "There's a lot of work to be done with both sides, particularly with the Russian side, which we haven't talked to for years," Rubio said on his plane to his home city of Miami from a three-nation Caribbean tour.
  <br>
  <br>
  On how long it would take to make progress, Rubio said, "I just can't put a timeframe on that because it doesn't depend on us."
  <br>
  <br>
  Rubio said US President Donald Trump's administration would hold consultations to discuss the outcome of the meetings.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has repeatedly said he hopes to meet soon with Russian President Vladimir Putin, likely in Saudi Arabia.
  <br>
  <br>
  The United States announced on Tuesday that both Russia and Ukraine had agreed to hold fire in strikes on the Black Sea.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Russia later said it had conditions, as it seeks relief from the sweeping sanctions imposed by the West.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rubio had earlier called on Russia to accept unconditionally a Ukrainian-backed proposal for a 30-day ceasefire.
  <br>
  <br>
  French President Emmanuel Macron has rejected Russian calls for an easing of Western sanctions, saying it was far too early and more progress was needed. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 At the official opening of the Boao Forum for Asia on Thursday, Vice Premier Ding Xuexiang said China's economy was remaking itself with the growing capacity to drive growth through innovation.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on
  <a href="https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/news-programmes/this-episode.htm?cmsid=77" target="_blank">
   <u>
    <b>
     RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme
    </b>
   </u>
  </a>
  , China strategist and former senior Hong Kong government official, Andrew Leung, on Friday told Carol Musgrave that Beijing's achievements in science and technology were key to the nation's success and the vice premier's speech aimed to highlight that point.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As far as innovation is concerned, we are in the fourth and fifth industrial revolutions, with a digital global economy, connectivity, changing the way we conduct our lives, how businesses are conducted and indeed how countries trade and interact with one another, and of course China's technological innovation, particularly self-reliance, was mandated by President Xi [Jinping]."
  <br>
  <br>
  Leung also said China was overcoming the barriers to trade and technology that the United States was throwing at it.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China has been progressing by leaps and bounds as illustrated by China's ability to build a space station from scratch... all this shows that innovation is the way to go."

<div class="itemFullText">
 A Kowloon City district councillor believes the area will not be congested when Hong Kong Rugby Sevens tournament games end every evening.
 <br>
  <br>
  The three-day tournament that kicks off today will be staged at Kai Tak Sports Park for the first time ever, having been held at Hong Kong Stadium in Causeway Bay for decades.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on an RTHK radio programme on Friday, Vivian Wong, who also chairs a working group on boosting the local economy in the district, said previous test events at the new grounds had gone smoothly.
  <br>
  <br>
  "During the Hong Kong Sevens, spectators will be coming in and out at all times," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They won't enter or leave at the same time.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Therefore, it's kind of different than, say, the opening ceremony on March the first when they could test out what problems would arise if people left the venue all at once."
  <br>
  <br>
  Apart from visiting nearby malls and Kowloon City, Wong expects spectators will also head for the new Sevens fan village for live music, meet-and-greet opportunities with rugby teams, as well as drinks and food booths.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said the inaugural Kai Tak Dining Cove Carnival next to the Kai Tak Stadium will also be a lure for revellers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, a Kowloon City restaurant owner revealed on the same show that businesses near the stadium are already seeing a boom in business.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mark Lam pointed out that business in the area had gone up 20 percent whenever tests events were held, as well as during the stadium's opening ceremony.
  <br>
  <br>
  His eatery has been flexible with its opening hours whenever events are scheduled at the city's largest sports venue.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the past, before the pandemic, our restaurant closed at 3am," Lam said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Business was booming at that time.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But after and during the pandemic, the catering business was sluggish. We had to close by 10:30 or 11pm.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With the Kai Tak Sports Park opening, now we close around 1 o'clock in the morning, and we open at 11:30am, with no breaks during the day.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So customers can come during lunch, tea, or after shows at the venue."
  <br>
  <br>
  Pedestrian traffic in the district had surged by 20 to 30 percent during the stress tests and the opening ceremony, Lam added.

<img alt="Foreign Minister Wang Yi (right) met Bangladesh leader Muhammad Yunus on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York, September 25, 2024. File photo: Xinhua" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797825_1_20250328114316.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping met Bangladesh leader Muhammad Yunus in Beijing on Friday, state media reported, as Dhaka's relations with neighbouring India remains shaky.
 <br>
  <br>
  Yunus took charge of Bangladesh last August after the toppling of autocratic ex-premier Sheikh Hasina, who fled to New Delhi after an uprising.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 84-year-old Nobel laureate flew to Beijing on Wednesday and met with Xi on Friday, Chinese state news agency Xinhua reported, without giving further details.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yunus is expected to return to Bangladesh on Saturday after holding several other high-level meetings in the capital.
  <br>
  <br>
  India was the biggest benefactor of Hasina's government, and her overthrow sent cross-border relations into a tailspin.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dhaka's top foreign ministry bureaucrat said on Tuesday that Bangladesh was "sending a message" with Yunus's choice to spend his first state visit in China.
  <br>
  <br>
  Several agreements are expected to be signed on economic and technical assistance, cultural and sports cooperation, and media collaboration between the two countries, according to the Bangladeshi administration.
  <br>
  <br>
  Talks are also expected to touch on Bangladesh's immense population of Rohingya refugees, most of whom fled a violent military crackdown in neighbouring Myanmar in 2017. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 When Hong Kong artist Movana Chen moved to Lisbon in 2021, she started knitting together maps collected during Covid isolation in an attempt to unravel physical boundaries.
 <br>
  <br>
  She transformed the maps into large pieces of garment donned by herself and her partner, dancer Francisco Borges, as part of a performance art piece at Art Basel Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <img src="https://rthk-s3-nps-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/mfile_1797813_2_L_20250328104141.jpg">
   <div class="image-title-1">
    <span>
    </span>
   </div>
   <br>
   The inspiration for the performance – which sees the pair cocooned in the weaved-together maps – came from Chen’s time living near the Portuguese seaside, when she experienced pandemic-induced solitude.
   <br>
   <br>
   "[The act of weaving together] the maps is like inviting people and my friends during the lockdown period. So like in 2020, people can't send me the maps during that time. Everything was closed," she said.
   <br>
   <br>
   Chen said their performance, titled "Questioning the Line", also explores the entanglement between human and nature and the roles of borders and nationality.
   <br>
   <br>
   "For us it has different layers of lines, different lines to question. For example, one of the lines is this, between human and nature. Where is that line really?" Chen's partner, Borges told RTHK.
   <br>
   <br>
   "We are born from the land, we eat the food from the land, we drink the water from the land. And when we poison the land, and we poison the water, we poison ourselves. So where is really that barrier, that clear line?" he said.
   <br>

    <div class="image-title-1">
     <span>
     </span>
    </div>
    <br>
    To show human unity and interdependence, Chen also collects expired passports and gives them new life by knitting them together in a separate project called "Beyond the Surface".
    <br>
    <br>
    She is not the only artist exploring humanity and nature at this year's Art Basel.
    <br>
    <br>
    American painter and writer Alec Egan lost his home and studio to the Los Angeles fire in January. Despite the devastation, he created five new paintings to depict LA coastal scenes in a temporary studio provided by Anat Egbi Gallery, which is showcasing his works at Art Basel.
    <br>
    <br>
    Egan's new works – which reflects both disaster and nature – pays homage to his lost work and captures the eerie beauty of ash-filled skies.
    <br>

      <span>

     <br>
     "In the face of something really traumatic, he continues to focus on beauty and there is quiet solitude. So I hope that [audiences will take away] hopefulness," said the gallery's sales director Amanda McMorran.
     <br>
     <br>
     Adding another compelling voice to the fair is first-time exhibitor Shin Min from Seoul's P21 studio.
     <br>

      Drawing from her experience working in the service industry, her "Ew! There is hair in the food!!" exhibition highlights misogyny in Korea, and challenges the notion of never saying no to customers.
      <br>
      <br>
      "I talk about workers' hair because we are not robots. We are human and we are not machines. We have hair. We have spit," Shin said in explaining the central message of her work.

    Rubio warns Venezuela against Guyana attacks

<img alt="Guyanese President Mohamed Irfaan Ali, left, with Marco Rubio in Georgetown, Guyana. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797818_1_20250328105815.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Top US diplomat Marco Rubio bluntly warned Venezuela against attacking its oil-rich neighbour Guyana, brandishing the power of the US military to protect the small South American nation.
 <br>
  <br>
  Venezuela, whose leftist leader Nicolas Maduro is despised by the Cuban-American Rubio, has increasingly pushed its claim to the disputed Essequibo region controlled by Guyana, and was accused this month of making an incursion.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I have full confidence saying it now as secretary of state – there will be consequences for adventurism. There will be consequences for aggressive action," Rubio said in Guyana.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked what the United States would do if Venezuela attacked ExxonMobil oil projects in Guyana, Rubio said: "It would be a very bad day -- a very bad week for them."
  <br>
  <br>
  Stopping short of spelling out a military response, Rubio said: "We have a big navy, and it can get almost anywhere."
  <br>
  <br>
  Maduro responded angrily to the threat, calling Rubio an "imbecile" and saying "no one threatens Venezuela."
  <br>
  <br>
  While in Guyana, Rubio signed an agreement to boost security cooperation with the country including through greater information sharing. It comes years after Guyana and the United States agreed to joint maritime patrols.
  <br>
  <br>
  Guyanese President Irfaan Ali welcomed the stance of Rubio, who called Venezuela's claims "illegitimate."
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm very pleased at the reassurance of the US, ensuring the safeguard of our territorial integrity and sovereignty," Ali said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Venezuelan Foreign Minister Yvan Gil, in a statement on Telegram, said his country did "not need nor seek conflicts, but neither will we allow foreign interests to try to rewrite the reality about our Essequibo."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Get your noses out of this dispute!" he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Guyana, an English-speaking former British and Dutch colony where the majority of the 800,000 people still live in poverty, has for years had a long-shot movement that has sought to join the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  Such formal accession was not on the agenda, but Trump has made no secret of his passion for expansionism in the Western Hemisphere, even at the expense of traditional alliances.
  <br>
  <br>
  While Exxon has dominated the oil industry, China has made rapid inroads in Guyana with infrastructure projects including an expansion of the international airport where Rubio landed. (AFP)

<img alt="Shohei Ohtani and the Los Angeles Dodgers were also winners to start the new campaign. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797817_2_20250328105734.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Carlos Rodon pitched effectively into the sixth inning and was backed by two early homers as the host New York Yankees hung on for a 4-2 victory over the Milwaukee Brewers in the season opener for both teams.
 <br>
  <br>
  Austin Wells hit a leadoff homer three pitches into the home half of the first inning and Anthony Volpe connected in the second as the Yankees improved to 7-1 in season openers under manager Aaron Boone.
  <br>
  <br>
  Aaron Judge added an RBI double in the seventh and Cody Bellinger followed that at-bat with a sacrifice fly in his Yankees debut. Those runs proved crucial when New York's new closer, Devin Williams, struggled in the ninth against his former team.
  <br>
  <br>
  Starting the third season of a six-year, $162 million deal, Rodon (1-0) allowed one run on four hits in 5 1/3 innings. The left-hander struck out seven and walked two in his second career Opening Day start.
  <br>
  <br>
  Milwaukee's Freddy Peralta (0-1) allowed two runs on four hits in five innings during his second career Opening Day start.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eleswhere, Shohei Ohtani, Teoscar Hernandez and Tommy Edman hit home runs, Blake Snell went five strong innings and the defending champion Los Angeles Dodgers capped a day of celebration with a 5-4 victory over the visiting Detroit Tigers.
  <br>
  <br>
  In his Dodgers debut, the free-agent addition Snell (1-0) gave up two runs on five hits over five innings with two strikeouts. The two-time Cy Young Award winner was able to work around four walks. Blake Treinen pitched a scoreless ninth for his first save.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ohtani hit his second home run in the third game of the season as the Dodgers played at home for the first time since a victory in Game 2 of the 2024 World Series against the New York Yankees.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Houston, Framber Valdez tossed seven shutout innings and the new-look Astros claimed a 3-1 victory over the visiting New York Mets.
  <br>
  <br>
  Valdez (1-0) became the first left-hander in franchise history to make four consecutive Opening Day starts.
  <br>
  <br>
  He scattered four hits, issued two walks and recorded four strikeouts, seemingly strengthening as he worked deeper into his outing. Valdez tossed 90 pitches, 56 for strikes. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump withdrew right-wing firebrand Elise Stefanik as his nominee for US ambassador to the United Nations as Republicans fear for their narrow majority in Congress.
 <br>
  <br>
  The New York congresswoman is just the second Trump cabinet pick not to go through, after Matt Gaetz pulled out of the running to be attorney general following allegations of sexual misconduct.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stefanik is a vocal Trump ally and pro-Israel stalwart.

  "With a very tight Majority, I don't want to take a chance on anyone else running for Elise's seat" in the House of Representatives, Trump said on his Truth Social platform on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said it was "essential that we maintain EVERY Republican Seat in Congress."
  <br>
  <br>
  "The people love Elise and, with her, we have nothing to worry about come Election Day. There are others that can do a good job at the United Nations," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said he had asked Stefanik to stay in Congress and "rejoin the House leadership team," although he did not say in what capacity.
  <br>
  <br>
  Republicans won both the House and Senate in the November 2024 election that returned Trump to the White House, but they have a very tight lead in the lower chamber.
  <br>
  <br>
  They control the House by 218 seats to 213, giving them just a tiny margin and making it difficult to pass key legislation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two crucial special elections will be held in Florida on April 1 to fill the seats vacated by Mike Waltz, who is now Trump's national security advisor, and Gaetz.
  <br>
  <br>
  While both Republicans comfortably won the seats in November, polling in one of the districts has shown the Democratic candidate closing the gap considerably.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump himself has leaned into the races, with an appearance Thursday at a candidate's online event seen as evidence that Republicans are worried.
  <br>
  <br>
  Those concerns were further heightened on Tuesday, when a special election for Pennsylvania's state senate saw Democrats flip a district that Trump won handily last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stefanik has effectively been in limbo since Trump's nomination, keeping her place in the House for a number of key votes.
  <br>
  <br>
  A firebrand who was considered a moderate before the Trump era, Stefanik is seen as one of the most vocal supporters in Congress of both Israel and US Jewish causes. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Novak Djokovic turned on the style to take his place in the last four of the Miami Open with an impressive 6-3, 7-6 win over American Sebastian Korda, becoming the oldest man to reach a Masters 1000 semi-final.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 37-year-old Serb made a strong start against Korda, breaking early to get a first set advantage that he never let slip.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Korda showed great resilience in the second set, taking the contest to a tie-break.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the fourth-seed Djokovic, looking for his seventh Miami Open title but first since 2016, again came up strong, sealing the win with a powerful ace.
  <br>
  <br>
  Djokovic, who will face Bulgarian Grigor Dimitrov on Friday, had no doubt what had been the key to his success, after winning 84 per cent of his first-serve points.
  <br>
  <br>
  "One word, serve. I was serving very well, probably the best serving performance, not just here, but in a long time," he told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere, Czech teenager Jakub Mensik marched into his first Masters semi when he defeated France's Arthur Fils 7-6, 6-1.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fils had enjoyed one of the biggest wins of his career on Wednesday when he defeated top-seed Alexander Zverev, but he struggled to repeat the feat against the impressive 19-year-old Mensik.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Czech will next face American third seed Taylor Fritz, who came through an enthralling battle with Italian Matteo Berrettini with a 7-5, 6-7, 7-5.
  <br>
  <br>
  Berrettini looked buried in the second set tie-break when he trailed 6-3 but his booming serve and some incredible returns gave him the opportunity of a deciding set. In total, Berrettini saved six match points in the second set.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was nip and tuck with the pair on serve until Fritz, working hard on the baseline, broke to go 6-5 up and then held on for the win. (AFP)

    New NBA All-Star Game format was 'a miss', says Silver

<img alt="The NBA said the four-team mini-tournament for this year's All-Star Game will be scrapped. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797807_1_20250328094751.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 It's unclear what next year's NBA All-Star Game will look like, but commissioner Adam Silver said the league is "a bit back to the drawing board" as it moves away from the three-game mini-tournament that was implemented this season.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters on Thursday following a board of governors meeting, Silver said the league will look for ways to improve the mid-season event, which this year drew 4.7 million viewers across TNT platforms - down 13 percent from last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The only NBA All-Star Game with fewer viewers came in 2023, with 4.6 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I thought we made almost an immeasurable amount of progress," Silver said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I thought this was a little better, but it was a miss. We're not there in terms of creating an All-Star experience that we can be proud of, that our players can be proud of."
  <br>
  <br>
  This season's format featured four teams competing in a three-game mini-tournament, with 24 All-Stars divided among three teams in San Francisco.
  <br>
  <br>
  The fourth team was the Rising Stars event winner, which was held two nights before the All-Star Game. Four-time NBA MVP LeBron James, a late scratch, was not among the participants. Anthony Edwards also scratched.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We recalibrated around this year's All-Star game in San Francisco, around more of an entertainment product, and I don't think it worked," Silver said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The breaks were too long. And I get it: It was an opportunity to celebrate TNT, as they were gonna have their last All-Star Game. It was well-intentioned."
  <br>
  <br>
  Next year's All-Star Game will be broadcast on NBC, which takes over following a 23-year run by TNT.
  <br>
  <br>
  The commissioner added that despite the success of the NHL's Four Nations Face-Off, the NBA doesn't appear to be set on adding a USA vs. World format for next year's All-Star Game in Inglewood, California, which will be the new home of the Los Angeles Clippers. (Reuters)

    Light rain aids firefighters in South Korea

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Light rain offered some relief to South Korean authorities tackling the country's worst wildfires on record, with exhausted firefighters making another push on Friday to contain blazes stretching 70 km.
 <br>
  <br>
  At least 28 people have died and more than 45,000 hectares of largely forest land in the country's southeast have been charred or are burning, as strong winds have driven blazes from central Uiseong county to coastal regions over the past week.
  <br>
  <br>
  Uiseong reported fires had been put out in 95 percent of the area as of early Friday, and flames in 85 percent of the neighbouring Andong city, which is home to UNESCO World Heritage sites, have been doused, according to the Korea Forest Service.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeongdeok county on the east coast, where the fire spread from the initial blaze more than 70 km away in under 12 hours, was still fighting to contain the flames, with nearly a third of the area still ablaze.
  <br>
  <br>
  Light rain of less than 3 mm fell in some parts of the regions on Thursday and had offered "a little help," forest service spokesman Kim Jong-gun said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Firefighters and helicopters were taking advantage of more favourable weather and better visibility to make a push to make more progress before winds are expected to pick up later on Friday, he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The blazes that began in Uiseong have become the biggest single forest fire in South Korea's history, destroying an area equivalent to about two-thirds of the island of Singapore.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 80 helicopters started flying at daybreak on Friday to dump water, the safety ministry said. A helicopter pilot died on Wednesday after crashing while trying to tackle a blaze.
  <br>
  <br>
  The wildfires have displaced more than 30,000 residents, many of whom are elderly, and ravaged everything in their path, including historic temples and homes, in the mountainous forest regions of North Gyeongsang province. (Reuters)

    Government strongly condemns UK report on HK

<img alt='The SAR government urged the UK to "respect international law" and "immediately stop interfering in Hong Kong matters." File photo: RTHK' src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797769_1_20250328093204.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Thursday said it strongly disapproved of and must resolutely refute the untruthful remarks, slanders and smears against various aspects of the SAR in the UK's six-monthly report on Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  "The HKSAR Government strongly condemns and rejects the UK's attempt through a so-called six-monthly report to make misleading and irresponsible remarks about Hong Kong matters, wantonly put politics above the rule of law and attempt to interfere in Hong Kong's law-based governance by despicable political manoeuvres," a government statement said.
  <br>
  <br>
  It urged the UK to discern facts from fallacies, respect international law and basic norms governing international relations, and stop interfering in Hong Kong matters.
  <br>
  <br>
  The statement said Hong Kong enjoyed a high degree of autonomy under the 'one country, two systems' principle, pointing out that the Sino-British Joint Declaration did not authorise the UK to interfere in Hong Kong's affairs after its return to the motherland.
  <br>
  <br>
  The statement also rejected UK criticism that laws safeguarding national security in the SAR had eroded rights and freedoms.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With at least 14 pieces of laws safeguarding national security in the UK, those remarks by the UK are not only totally distorting and confounding right and wrong, but they also entirely disregard the constitutional duty and practical needs of the HKSAR to legislate, and the positive effects brought by the enactment of the relevant national security legislation on economic development and protection of human rights," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government statement highlighted Hong Kong's number one ranking in the Economic Freedom of the World 2024 Annual Report, among 165 economies. It said it was evident that international funds and investments were confident in Hong Kong's development.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government spokesman stressed that "the rule of law in Hong Kong is strong and robust, and withstands the test of time", while human rights in the city have always been guaranteed constitutionally by both the Constitution and the Basic Law.

    Arctic sea ice hits record low, says US agency

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Arctic sea ice had its weakest winter buildup since record-keeping began 47 years ago, a symptom of climate change that will have repercussions globally, scientists said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Arctic reaches its maximum sea ice in March each year and then starts a six-month melt season.
  <br>
  <br>
  The National Snow and Ice Data Centre said the peak measurement taken on Saturday was 14.33 million square kilometres - about 80,000 square kilometres smaller than the lowest previous peak in 2017.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Warming temperatures are what’s causing the ice to decline,'' ice data scientist Walt Meier said. “You know, sea ice in particular is very sensitive... 31 degrees is ice skating and 33 degrees it’s swimming.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Scientists said warming conditions in the Arctic - the region is warming four times faster than the rest of the world - affect weather elsewhere.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The warming winter atmosphere above the Arctic Circle does impact large-scale weather patterns that do influence those of us outside the Arctic,” said Julienne Stroeve, an ice scientist at the University of Manitoba.
  <br>
  <br>
  Of the smaller sea ice, Stroeve noted that not only was there less of it, the remaining ice was thin enough for more of it to melt quickly this summer. She cautioned that a record low area in the winter didn't guarantee a record small area in the summer.
  <br>
  <br>
  Melting Arctic sea ice - mostly in the summer - is making the polar bear population smaller, weaker and hungrier because they rely on the sea ice to hunt from, scientists said. And winter sea ice is especially important for fisheries and seal pups, Meier said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arctic sea ice's biggest year since record-keeping began was 1979, at 16.64 million square kilometres. That means since satellites began tracking it, Arctic sea ice's winter peak has shrunk by about the size of Pakistan. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The SAR’s men’s basketball team have made history by qualifying for the FIBA 3x3 Asia Cup for the first time ever, while their teammates from the women’s team representing Hong Kong, China fell just short of doing the same.
 <br>
  <br>
  The men’s squad of Chan Wing-hei, Lam Chun-tat, Tsoi Lung-tak and Wong Ho-yin fought their way into the tournament by topping their qualifying group.
  <br>
  <br>
  They beat Bahrain, Guam and Malaysia in the process, and a one-point loss to Indonesia didn’t stop them from becoming one of twelve teams making the group stage.
  <br>
  <br>
  It's the first time the SAR progressed to the main draw in eight tries, since the competition made its debut 12 years ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  The team will play hosts Singapore on Saturday afternoon and Mongolia at night, as they look to advance further in the competition.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong, China's women's team would've also qualified for the Cup for the first time - but they dropped the final do-or-die game against Chinese Taipei, 17-19.

    Australian PM calls general election for May 3

<div class="itemFullText">
 Australia will hold a general election on May 3, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said on Friday, locking in a showdown over climate action, nuclear power and a runaway housing market.
 <br>
  <br>
  Albanese's centre-left Labour party took office in May 2022, turfing out a conservative government deeply unpopular after almost a decade in charge.
  <br>
  <br>
  But initial enthusiasm for Albanese, 62, has evaporated in recent months as the government nears the end of its three-year term.
  <br>
  <br>
  Polls show him neck-and-neck with right-leaning Peter Dutton, 54, a hard-nosed former detective who wants to cut back on immigration and reverse a ban on nuclear power.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Over the last few years, the world has thrown a lot at Australia in uncertain times," the prime minister told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Because of the strength and resilience that our people have shown, Australia is turning the corner. Now, on May 3, you choose the way forward."
  <br>
  <br>
  Albanese declared he was "born ready" to deal with climate challenges, tariff turmoil and the long tail of inflation.
  <br>
  <br>
  And he warned any foreign foes intent on meddling in the election campaign to "back off".
  <br>
  <br>
  Coal mining-superpower Australia will choose between two candidates with sharply contrasting ideas on climate change and emissions reduction.
  <br>
  <br>
  Albanese's government has embraced the global push towards decarbonisation, warning of a future in which iron ore and polluting coal exports no longer prop up the economy. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Barcelona swept to a comfortable 3-0 victory over Osasuna to move three points clear at the top of La Liga despite their discontent at having to play their match on Thursday local time.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Catalans' appeal against the rescheduling of this game was rejected but Hansi Flick's side, unbeaten in 19 matches across all competitions, still made light work of Osasuna, 14th.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ferran Torres and Dani Olmo netted in the first half with Robert Lewandowski on target after the break.
  <br>
  <br>
  Barca were without key winger Raphinha as he played for Brazil on Wednesday in South America in World Cup qualifying but cruised at the Olympic stadium regardless.
  <br>
  <br>
  The match was originally due to be played on March 8 but it was postponed after a Barcelona club doctor died.
  <br>
  <br>
  Flick put veteran striker Lewandowski on the bench, deploying Torres in his place to excellent effect.
  <br>
  <br>
  Barcelona controlled the game from the start, taking the lead through Torres after 11 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Osasuna goalkeeper Sergio Herrera then brought down Olmo to concede a penalty for Barcelona's second midway through the first half.
  <br>
  <br>
  Herrera saved Olmo's spot kick, but a re-take was ordered after an Osasuna player encroached, and this time the playmaker made no mistake.
  <br>
  <br>
  The second half was a low key affair as Barcelona were content with their lead, until Lewandowski came on for Torres, hungry to get in on the action.
  <br>
  <br>
  The veteran Polish striker nodded home from Fermin Lopez's cross at the end of a quick break to extend Barca's lead and his own at the top of Spain's scoring charts with 23 league goals. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Automakers were battered on Thursday as stock markets fell on both sides of the Atlantic after US President Donald Trump announced significant tariffs on imported vehicles and parts, pressing ahead with tough trade policies many fear will spark a recession.
 <br>
  <br>
  On Wall Street, the Dow, the tech-heavy Nasdaq and the broad-based S&P 500 all slipped, with General Motors giving up 7.4 percent and Ford dipping 3.9 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Tokyo, Toyota - the world's top-selling carmaker - fell two percent. Honda shed 2.5 percent, Nissan was off 1.7 percent and Mazda dropped six percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Seoul-listed Hyundai gave up more than four percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among European auto firms, Volkswagen shed 1.3 percent, Porsche lost 2.6 percent, Mercedes dropped 2.7 percent and BMW fell 2.5 percent, helping to push the Frankfurt DAX index down 0.7 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jeep maker Stellantis lost more than four percent. India's Tata Motors, which exports Jaguars and Land Rovers to the United States, also lost ground - leading analysts to speculate on where markets may be headed.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The trade war has escalated, and unsurprisingly, German carmakers are leading the declines or are among the biggest decliners today," said StoneX Group analyst Fawad Razaqzada.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jochen Stanzl, chief market analyst with CMC Markets, added: "While investors see a fair chance for successful negotiations between the European Union and the US in the coming weeks, many prefer to wait for these discussions rather than speculate in advance."
  <br>
  <br>
  "What we're going to be doing is a 25 percent tariff on all cars that are not made in the United States," Trump said on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The rate, which takes effect on April 3 at 12:01 am affects foreign-made cars and light trucks imported into America. The tariffs also apply to auto parts.
  <br>
  <br>
  About half of the cars sold in the United States are made within the country. Of the imported vehicles, about half come from Mexico and Canada, with Japan, South Korea and Germany also major suppliers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Japan's government called the tariffs "extremely regrettable" while Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney called it a "direct attack" on his country's workers.
  <br>
  <br>
  French Finance Minister Eric Lombard warned: "The only solution for the European Union will be to raise tariffs on American products in response."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by 0.4 percent to 42,299, while the broad-based S&P 500 Index lost 0.3 percent to 5,693. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index tumbled 0.5 percent to 17,804. (AFP)

 Foreign Minister Wang Yi met with French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot in Beijing on Thursday, vowing to deepen cooperation and strategic coordination.
 <br>
  <br>
  “China is willing to work with France to enhance dialogue across all domains and levels, transcend differences, and deepen cooperation,” Wang said, adding that both countries should “assume the responsibility of major nations” and support each other’s multilateral initiatives.
  <br>
  <br>
  Barrot praised the “pragmatic cooperation” between France and China, emphasizing that amid rising global uncertainty and protectionism, “France-China relations are even more important.”
  <br>
  <br>
  He reaffirmed France’s commitment to the one-China policy, support for free trade, and opposition to decoupling.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ministers also discussed China-EU relations, agreeing on the need for dialogue to resolve trade disputes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang stressed that “cooperation outweighs competition, and consensus surpasses differences,” while Barrot voiced support for EU-China dialogue to resolve trade disputes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Following the talks, China and France issued a joint statement on climate change. (Xinhua)

    Beijing offices again question CK Hutchison ports deal

    <![CDATA[<div>
<img alt="The latest Ta Kung Pao article reposted by Beijing offices in Hong Kong said CK Hutchison's ports deal didn't make business sense. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797760_1_20250328011558.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Central government bodies in charge of Hong Kong affairs on Thursday reposted another news article criticising a controversial deal by CK Hutchison’s to sell dozens of ports – including strategic assets along the Panama Canal – to a US consortium led by investment firm BlackRock.
 <br>
  <br>
  The article by the Ta Kung Pao newspaper quoted business experts who questioned whether the Li Ka-shing-owned conglomerate had gotten the best deal it could have, stressing that businesses should “stand with the nation in the face of hegemonic bullying.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The article noted that public opinions that the sale did not appear to conform to the business logic of maximising profits.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Not only is the valuation of the assets low, but the decision was made very quickly, without adopting the ‘highest-bidder wins principle,” the article said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Western media reports have also pointed out that the US consortium had gotten a bargain.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The Ta Kung Pao report also quoted Bai Ming, Deputy Director of the Ministry of Commerce’s International Market Research Institute, as saying the deal was done “quickly and cheaply”, noting that CK Hutchison did not launch a global bidding race to find the best deal to maximise profits as logic would dictate.
  <br>
  <br>
  The report also said businessmen in Hong Kong should learn from the example of firms that had faced “unreasonable suppression” from the United States and yet chose to stand with the nation and prospered with the country’s support.
  <br>
  <br>
  A member of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference, Su Qingdong, was quoted as saying that all sectors of society expect the relevant firm to reconsider the deal from the country’s perspective, though there has not been a positive response so far.
  <br>
  <br>
  This was the fourth Ta Kung Pao article lashing out against the sale that had been reposted by both the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office and the central government’s liaison office here.

    Work under way to boost night-time services: HA
   </title>

<img alt="" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797727_2_20250327205242.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hospital Authority (HA) has stressed that decisions on how and where to beef up public healthcare services will "depend on the actual situation", amid calls to offer more general outpatient services at night.
 <br>
  <br>
  Tony Ko, the authority's chief executive, also said on Thursday reforms to the city's public healthcare system should be looked at "in totality".
  <br>
  <br>
  At present, less than one-third of 74 government general outpatient clinics offer evening consultations, with services running until 10pm.
  <br>
  <br>
  During a Legislative Council meeting on Wednesday, health chief Lo Chung-mau was asked if authorities were planning to boost evening services so people need not seek help at accident and emergency wards.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lo responded by saying that work is being done to increase capacity.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked about offering more night-time services, Ko said that the HA is working to expand general outpatient clinic capacity.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We work closely with not only our primary healthcare colleagues to provide more sessions both during daytime, holidays, weekends as well as night time, and at the same time, we have close liaison with our private medical practitioner counterparts, encouraging them to do more sessions during holidays, during weekends, giving more general support to patients," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  With the administration facing a budget deficit, chairman Henry Fan said the HA is looking at ways to trim its expenditure. The body is set to receive some HK$100 billion in government subvention for 2025/26.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fan said the authority should focus on boosting productivity, including cutting administrative work for frontline staff, further using technology and simplifying procurement procedures.
  <br>
  <br>
  The most painless way to save money is to reduce waste, he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, public hospitals recorded a turnover rate of 5 percent for full-time doctors in the 12 months ending in January. Nearly 340 doctors left the public workforce, while some 7,200 doctors remain.
  <br>
  <br>
  There are now over 29,500 nurses, with a departure rate of 7.2 percent during the same period.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The chairman of Polytechnic University (PolyU)'s governing council on Thursday said Hong Kong must make use of its super-connector role under One Country, Two Systems to support the nation's diplomatic efforts.
 <br>
  <br>
  At a seminar focusing on China's diplomacy in the new era, Lam Tai-fai said Western countries such as the United States are creating problems through unfair practices like sanctions and protectionism.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the other hand, Lam added, Beijing continued to promote peace and cooperation through building friendships with countries. He said one of PolyU's missions is to nurture patriotic students with a global perspective.
  <br>
  <br>
  Also at the seminar was Huo Yuzhen, former Chinese ambassador to the Czech Republic and Romania.
  <br>
  <br>
  The veteran diplomat was involved in a Foreign Ministry initiative aimed at fostering cooperation between China and Central and Eastern European nations, such as Poland, Greece and Serbia.
  <br>
  <br>
  She described the initiative, which began in 2012, as a success, pointing to achievements in many areas which benefitted the people of both sides.
  <br>
  <br>
  Looking ahead, Huo suggested focusing on new areas of cooperation, such as green energy, advanced technology, and artificial intelligence.
  <br>
  <br>
  At the same event, former Chinese ambassador to Georgia and Tajikistan Yue Bin spoke about the development of Sino-Russian relations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yue described how the bond between the two neighbours has grown stronger over time, evolving into a comprehensive strategic partnership building on mutual trust.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said on Thursday he would call a general election "imminently," with local media reporting the poll would be held on May 3.
 <br>
  <br>
  Albanese's left-leaning Labor government is nearing the end of its three-year term and must hold an election by May 17 at the latest.
  <br>
  <br>
  Recent polls show the government is neck-and-neck with its conservative rivals, who were turfed out in 2022 after almost a decade in power.
  <br>
  <br>
  As speculation mounted on Thursday, Albanese said he was preparing to call the election "soon."
  <br>
  <br>
  "It will be called pretty imminently," he told a local radio station.
  <br>
  <br>
  Multiple media outlets – including national broadcaster ABC – reported Albanese would announce the official start of campaigning on Friday, setting an election date of May 3.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 62-year-old's government released its annual budget this week, courting votes with surprise tax cuts and a raft of other sweeteners.
  <br>
  <br>
  Conservative leader Peter Dutton, 54, has pilloried Albanese, accusing him of "weak" leadership and stoking inflation through government largesse.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dutton's signature policy is a US$200 billion scheme to construct seven industrial-scale nuclear reactors, putting the brakes on the growth of renewable energy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Polling shows economic concerns and the high cost of housing will dominate the contest.
  <br>
  <br>
  Although inflation has eased under Albanese – from 7.8 percent in 2022 to 2.4 percent in December – many households are still struggling with high food, fuel, and power prices.
  <br>
  <br>
  Major cities Sydney and Melbourne now rank among the 10 least-affordable housing markets in the world, according to the annual Demographia affordability index. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong will continue to deepen international co-operation and integrate into national development despite a complex external environment, Chief Executive John Lee said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Writing on his Facebook page after attending the opening ceremony of the Boao Forum in Hainan, Lee said he was encouraged by Vice Premier Ding Xuexiang's remarks.
  <br>
  <br>
  In his speech, Ding pointed out four suggestions for Asia and the world's future and "three perspectives" on China's economic development.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee said the SAR must move forward steadily by leveraging its unique position of supporting the country's development while connecting with the rest of the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Under One Country, Two Systems, Hong Kong is the world's only open economy that simultaneously enjoys both Chinese and international advantages," he wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  The chief executive outlined plans to continue pursuing reforms with breakthrough thinking, including advancing projects like the Northern Metropolis and Greater Bay Area development.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee met the director-general of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, Qu Dongyu, earlier in the morning.
  <br>
  <br>
  During the meeting, Lee discussed the city's potential for developing its fisheries and agricultural sector with diverse food industries.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also expressed interest in working with the organisation on water quality simulation systems and sustainable aquaculture development, according to his Facebook page.

<div class="itemFullText">
 China warned on Thursday a trade war would have "no winners" after US President Donald Trump announced 25 percent import tariffs on foreign-made cars.
 <br>
  <br>
  "There are no winners in a trade war or a tariff war," Foreign Ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "No country's development and prosperity has been achieved by imposing tariffs."
  <br>
  <br>
  The new tariffs won't help Washington solve its own problems, the ministry said.
  <br>
  <br>
  China also rebuffed a suggestion from Trump that he might offer to reduce tariffs on the country to get Beijing's approval for the sale of popular social media platform TikTok.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Commerce Ministry in Beijing said its position on the tariff issue is consistent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ministry said China is willing to engage with Washington on the basis of mutual respect, equality and mutual benefit.
  <br>
  <br>
  TikTok's parent ByteDance has to find a non-Chinese buyer of the short video app used by 170 million Americans by April 5 or face a US ban on national security grounds. (AFP/Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Thursday said they are investigating a suspected assault at a flat in Sham Shui Po after a video shared online appeared to show an elderly woman being physically abused by a helper.
 <br>
  <br>
  Officers said a woman reported last week that her mother, 81, had been abused in a flat at Lai On Estate.
  <br>
  <br>
  Footage reportedly from a surveillance camera appeared to show the elderly woman tied up in bed and being gagged with a towel.
  <br>
  <br>
  She was later taken to hospital with injuries to her face and hands, police said.
  <br>
  <br>
  No arrests have been made over the alleged incident.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Britain's Civil Aviation Authority said it plans to set incentives for London's Heathrow to invest in its operations and provide high-quality service as part of the regulator's periodic review, days after a closure at the airport rocked airlines.
 <br>
  <br>
  The review and guidance look into several aspects of how Heathrow, a major global travel hub, functions and develops: from investments, to airline charges, to environmental impact, and preparedness to handle a crisis.
  <br>
  <br>
  The watchdog said on Thursday that under its latest regulatory review that would look into operations from 2027 to 2031, the CAA would also "carefully consider the rules on resilience after the closure of Heathrow Airport on 21 March 2025."
  <br>
  <br>
  Heathrow Airport was closed for all of last Friday after a huge fire at a nearby electrical substation wiped out its power, disrupting flight schedules around the world. (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korea's auto sector is expected to face "considerable difficulties" when US import tariffs on cars announced by President Donald Trump take effect and the government plans an emergency response by April, the industry minister said.
 <br>
  <br>
  South Korea will also actively engage the US government to explore measures to minimise the negative impact on South Korea's auto companies and suppliers, Industry Minister Ahn Duk-geun said in a meeting with industry officials on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Global uncertainties are growing but South Korean auto companies will not be fighting alone," Ahn said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government will consider financial assistance, investment support, and help with market diversification, he said, adding that parts suppliers are expected to be hit particularly hard.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's 25 percent tariff on imported vehicles sparked criticism and threats of retaliation from countries affected by the move.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shares in South Korea's Hyundai Motor shed more than 4 percent and sister automaker Kia Corp fell more than 3 percent. Hyundai Motor shares are set to post their biggest daily drop since late October.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hyundai together with affiliate Kia is the world's third-largest automaker by sales.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2024, South Korea's exports of automobiles to the United States stood at US$34.7 billion, accounting for 49 percent of its total auto exports. (Reuters)

    Thais give green light to draft law for casinos

<img alt="Protesters rally near Government House in Bangkok against the casino-entertainment complex bill. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797665_1_20250327133509.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Thailand's cabinet on Thursday approved a draft law for casinos and entertainment complexes, as the government looks to attract more tourists and build a major gaming industry.
 <br>
  <br>
  Gambling is mostly banned in Thailand apart from state-controlled horse racing, the lottery and on some sports but successive governments have pressed the case for allowing casinos to draw in more foreign visitors and create more jobs and state revenue.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the latest draft approved by cabinet will significantly limit how many Thai punters can go to casinos, with an entry fee of 5,000 baht and proof of at least 50 million baht in bank deposits, effectively blocking large swathes of the population, where per capita gross domestic product is about US$7,300.
  <br>
  <br>
  A deputy finance minister said this month the assets requirement for Thai nationals would be dropped because it would exclude too many people.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another restriction is that the casino area may only occupy up to 10 percent of the entire space of an entertainment complex, according to a government statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The draft law will be sent to parliament, and if passed, will also need approval from the Senate and the king.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra said details of the law were not final as parliament would have the final say.
  <br>
  <br>
  A Citi report late last year estimated that about half of people aged 20 and more in Thailand could be casino players, providing a base for the country to potentially become the world's third-largest gambling destination.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government, led by the populist Pheu Thai party, hopes to attract at least 100 billion baht in new investment in casinos and entertainment complexes and see an annual boost to foreign arrivals of 5 to 10 percent, while generating revenue of more than 12 billion baht a year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite most betting and gambling being outlawed in Thailand, illicit operations have operated for years.
  <br>
  <br>
  A January opinion poll in Thailand indicated there was opposition to the plan, however, and some political parties have argued that building a gambling industry would worsen social problems.
  <br>
  <br>
  Several countries in Southeast Asia have legalised casinos, but only a few like Singapore has been successful in drawing global giants such as Las Vegas Sands Corp on the back of robust regulations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tourism is a key driver of Thailand, Southeast Asia's second-largest economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  This year, the government expects 38 million foreign arrivals, closing in on its pre-pandemic record of nearly 40 million tourists. (Reuters)

<img alt='Irina Fan, director of research at the Trade Development Council, says the impact of US tariffs on Hong Kong is "relatively mild". File photo: RTHK' src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797662_1_20250327132129.jpg&q=60">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Trade Development Council said Hong Kong exporters are well-prepared for the new round of US tariffs set to take effect on April 2.
 <br>
  <br>
  The council's export confidence index for the first quarter stood at 51, up 1.8 points from the fourth quarter of 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  The expectation index, which shows exporters’ expectations for the next quarter, also rose. It climbed one point to 51.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on RTHK’s
  <i>
   Backchat
  </i>
  programme on Thursday, the council’s director of research Irina Fan said the city’s export performance is driven by strong sales and procurement, as well as higher prices.
  <br>
  <br>
  Regarding the impact of US tariffs on local exports, Fan described it as “relatively mild” compared with some of Washington's major trading partners, including China, Canada and Mexico.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Hong Kong's exporters are quite well-prepared for higher US tariffs," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Our exporters took a very agile and flexible business strategy also actually in the past few years to mitigate the risk from higher US tariffs, which actually started in the year of 2018.
  <br>
  <br>
  “They already adopted strategies like diversifying their sourcing, engaging with new partners and new markets, relocating some of their production lines, and also continuing to reduce their reliance, the selling to the US markets."
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite trade tensions, Fan said 75 percent of exporters expect their profits to remain stable or grow, and that industries such as jewellery, equipment and materials, timepieces, electronics and toys remained positive in their outlook.

    'Art Basel, Art Central a barometer for art market'

<img alt="Daniel Kwok, an independent art consultant, says that art fairs and auctions will give the city's art market a boost. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797660_1_20250327130541.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An expert has said that ongoing art shows and upcoming auctions will give the mainland and Hong Kong art scene a boost, and serve as a barometer for future market performance.
 <br>
  <br>
  Last year, the broader art market suffered a notable hit, with sales of modern and contemporary works declining by about 40 percent year on year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sales of traditional Chinese artworks also fared poorly, with transactions for Chinese painting and calligraphy auctions dropping by more than 20 percent year on year to 12.6 billion yuan last year, according to independent consultant Daniel Kwok.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I would say the traditional Chinese art market remained depressed last year, as the weak performance of the real economy and financial markets has clearly reduced buyers’ interest in the art market," he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Even though stock markets in mainland China and Hong Kong seem to be recovering, collectors and buyers still need time to rebuild their confidence," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, Kwok said that events such as Art Basel and Art Central, as well as auctions next month, will offer more clues on whether sentiment in the art market has improved, and if Beijing’s recent stimulus measures have had any effect on collectors.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I believe Art Basel and Art Central will create an exciting weekend for Hong Kong, providing a direct boost to both our cultural and tourism industries. These events also showcase the strength of the Hong Kong art market," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, the art specialist noted that despite the economic downturn, interest in Chinese porcelain antiques have been growing.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Because those imperial porcelain made for the emperors are all produced with exceptional craftsmanship, so even by today's standards, these pieces remain stunning to us," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kwok said another hot trend is Ming-style wood furniture famous for its intricate designs and Huanghuali wood – which comes from a rare species of rosewood. He noted that a Huanghuali wood table was sold for more than 45 million yuan on the mainland last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Looking ahead, Kwok cautioned that the heightened tension between China and the US might weigh on the art market.
  <br>
  <br>
  He pointed out that US tariff hikes may affect art shipments between the two countries.

  "I believe the unstable international climate will make buyers more cautious and conservative,” he explained.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Vice Premier Ding Xuexiang on Thursday said China's economy is remaking itself with the growing capacity to drive growth through innovation.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to dignitaries and business leaders from around the world at the Boao Forum for Asia being held in Hainan, he said this ability has helped the nation tide over economic difficulties and lifted its medium-to-long-term growth prospects and potential.
  <br>
  <br>
  “China’s firm commitment to an innovation-driven development strategy has led to… a boost in our innovation capacity and a successful transition from old to new growth drivers,” Ding said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Today, the pursuit of high quality development has become a nationwide consensus and the drive to develop new quality productive forces and spur innovation has become a widespread trend.”
  <br>
  <br>
  He pointed out that China ranks among the world's fastest growing major economies, and accounts for about 30 percent of global growth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ding also said the nation’s economy has a stronger outlook and that despite a surge of difficulties and challenges, the economy hit its target of five percent last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, the vice premier and Politburo Standing Committee member called on Asian leaders attending the forum to safeguard stability in the region.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said Asia has a stabilising role and that this must be "dearly cherished".
  <br>
  <br>
  “Even as we speak, changes of the world, of our times, and of historic significance are unfolding in unprecedented ways. Our world is experiencing far greater instability and uncertainty,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We should... act as builders and guardians of regional peace and make sure Asia continues to be a land of peace and stability.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Solidarity and cooperation must be strengthened to build an Asian community with a shared future, Ding added.

    Home prices drop to lowest level in nearly nine years

<img alt="Home prices continued to decline last month. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797650_1_20250327120658.jpg&q=65">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong home prices slumped for the third month in a row in February, dropping to their lowest level in almost nine years.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Rating and Valuation Department on Thursday said prices fell almost 0.9 percent from the month before, following a decline of 0.7 percent in January.
  <br>
  <br>
  The official home price index in February was at its lowest level since July 2016.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rents, meanwhile, were up 0.3 percent from January, reaching their highest level in five months.
  <br>
  <br>
  Commenting on the latest data, Eddie Kwok, executive director of valuation and advisory services at property consultancy firm CBRE Hong Kong, said the city's overall property prices were still "largely stable" and the latest declines were partially due to reduced transaction activities during the Lunar New Year holiday.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said he expects market sentiment to turn positive in the months ahead as the SAR government has reduced stamp duty to HK$100 for properties valued up to HK$4 million, adding that the stock market revival could also lend support.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We see the residential property prices are bottoming out," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "However, as developers are pushing units to capture pent-up demand, it might be difficult for the residential market to record a strong rebound," he said, adding that price increases might only apply to newly built units.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kathy Lee, head of research and retail consultancy at property firm Colliers, said stamp duty adjustments could have weighed on home prices.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Sellers and buyers have tried to push the selling price or purchase price to be below the HK$4 million threshold. That could also have had some impact on the price declines over the past month," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  While Lee forecast that prices will remain static in the first half of the year, she said there could be total growth of up to 0.5 percent by the end of the year if the US Federal Reserve reduces interest rates.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both Kwok and Lee said the rental market will remain strong, especially over the summer, because it will be boosted by demand from new arrivals to the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  "However, the increases of rental prices will not be to a great extent as there's also the affordability cap for new arrivals such as students," Lee said.

    Govt 'pays almost all drug costs despite fee hike'
   </title>

<img alt="" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797648_1_20250327115415.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hospital Authority's chief pharmacist said on Thursday the upcoming hike in medication fees will help to subsidise the purchase of new drugs, as well as those used to fight cancer or rare diseases.
 <br>
  <br>
  Starting January, patients have to pay HK$20 for a four-week supply of drugs, up from the current HK$15 for a 16-week supply.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on an RTHK radio programme, William Chui pointed out that the government is still covering nearly all healthcare costs even with the hike.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The government now subsidises 92 to 93 percent of the cost of a drug," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Even after increasing the fees, 90 percent of the cost is still covered.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Therefore, we cannot actually recover the cost of the drug, we can only hope to reduce waste.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We hope patients will understand that – when there is medicine they do not need or when they have a lot of drugs left over at home, they can let their doctors know."
  <br>
  <br>
  He emphasised that even though each prescription is set to be for a maximum for four weeks, this does not mean patients have to return to hospitals and clinics for another prescription after the period.
  <br>
  <br>
  Otherwise, the workload of pharmacies will be much heavier, he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chui added that patients can still be dispensed a maximum supply of 24 weeks each time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the consultant of the accident and emergency wards of the New Territories East cluster believes higher fees for A&E wards will not discourage patients from turning up.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If you ask whether the higher charge will cause patients to not come, I believe it won't," Cheng Chi-hung said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Because they will gradually know how to assess the situation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Sometimes patients might not be clear about their condition.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Obviously, for a cold, they will turn to primary healthcare.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But when it comes to cases like a sprain after exercising, or a suspected bone fracture, I believe patients will still choose to head to accident and emergency wards."
  <br>
  <br>
  Non-critical and non-emergency cases, or those deemed as category three to five patients, will need to pay HK$400 per visit – up from the present flat rate of HK$180 – starting next year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hung noted that it is difficult to predict that there will be a decline in the number of A&E patients, even though the figure dropped by five percent after the previous fee increment in 2017.

    'Winter flu season over but summer poses new threat'

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) says the winter influenza season has come to an end after about 11 weeks, but people should next get jabs to protect themselves against a possible summer flu season.
 <br>
  <br>
  Around 800 severe and fatal cases were recorded among adults over winter, while 10 children became seriously ill after catching the virus, the centre said on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a press briefing, CHP controller Edwin Tsui said the predominant strain of the virus during winter, A (H1), was also prevalent in 2018/19, but the number of severe and fatal cases among adults this time decreased by 15 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tsui said severe cases involving children dropped by 60 percent when compared with six years ago, thanks to a higher vaccination rate.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said people should also get vaccinated in case flu strikes again this summer.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think the risk or the probability of having a summer influenza season in Hong Kong is still present, and usually the summer influenza season will come in July and August," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "After this winter influenza season, we have to guard against any respiratory infections, especially the summer influenza activities and seasons. So what members of the public should do is to get vaccinated."
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the Hospital Authority said it will increase manpower around Easter.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For Easter, according to previous experience, the attendance will slowly grow along the four days of the public holidays. After that, there will be the peak in the following weekend," chief manager Larry Lee said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The good thing about this year is we don't bundle the Easter holiday together with the Ching Ming Festival."

    LeBron snaps Lakers' three-game slump with late tip-in

<img alt="LeBron James (23) and the Lakers snapped a three-game losing streak. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797649_1_20250327120443.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 LeBron James tipped in a buzzer-beating rebound with 0.1 seconds remaining as the Los Angeles Lakers halted their three-game losing streak with a pulsating 120-119 road victory over the Indiana Pacers.
 <br>
  <br>
  A thrilling duel in Indianapolis saw the Pacers climb out of a 13-point fourth-quarter hole to snatch a 119-118 lead with 42 seconds remaining, and leave the Lakers staring down the barrel of a fourth straight defeat.
  <br>
  <br>
  But with the clock ticking down, Luka Doncic made one last drive to the basket -- only to see his attempted 13-foot floater bounce off the rim.
  <br>
  <br>
  James reacted fastest, leaping to palm the ball into the bucket for the winning score and give the Lakers a precious victory in the race for Western Conference playoff berths.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 40-year-old James -- who had failed to score from the field in the opening three quarters -- finished with 13 points, 13 rebounds and seven assists.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lakers coach J.J. Redick saluted the veteran superstar's perseverance in dragging his team over the line despite having an offensive off-night.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's another great example of where he doesn't necessarily have it going early, and got off to a slow start offensively," Redick said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But he was so good defensively for us. And then he takes over in the fourth quarter and gets rewarded by the basketball gods because he didn't let go of the rope and didn't stop competing."
  <br>
  <br>
  James said he hadn't been bothered by his low-key offensive performance.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Whatever it takes to help your teammates win," James said. "For me, I can always do other things that still impact the game, even when I'm not scoring."
  <br>
  <br>
  Doncic led the Lakers scoring with 34 points, seven rebounds and seven assists while Austin Reaves and Rui Hachimura had 24 and 14 respectively.
  <br>
  <br>
  The win leaves the Lakers in fourth place in the west on 44-28. The top six finishers in the standings automatically qualify for the NBA playoffs. (AFP)

    Japan warns of 'significant impact' of US tariffs

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Japan's government on Thursday warned of a "significant impact" on its economic ties with the United States -- and on global trade -- after US President Donald Trump announced import tariffs on cars.
 <br>
  <br>
  Tokyo is a close economic and strategic US ally, with its firms the biggest investors in the United States and one in 10 Japanese jobs are connected to the auto sector.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump announced on Wednesday 25 percent tariffs "on all cars that are not made in the United States" effective 12.01am eastern time on April 3.
  <br>
  <br>
  Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, who last month held friendly talks with Trump at the White House, said Japan was reviewing an "appropriate" response.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Japan has made significant investments and significant job creation, which doesn't apply to all countries... we are the number one (country) in investment in the United States," Ishiba added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The US president's understanding on this is significantly deepening. However, various things are happening, so we are considering all kinds of countermeasures," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chief government spokesman Yoshimasa Hayashi went further, calling the tariffs "extremely regrettable" and warning of major effects.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We believe that the current measures and other broad-based trade restrictions by the US government could have a significant impact on the economic relationship between Japan and the US, as well as on the global economy and the multilateral trading system," Hayashi told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In response to this announcement, we have again told the US government that this measure was extremely regrettable and we strongly urged the US government to exclude Japan from the scope of this measure," Hayashi said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's announcement hammered carmakers in Asia.
  <br>
  <br>
  The world's top-selling automaker Toyota at midday was down 2.7 percent, while Nissan shed 2.6 percent and Honda was off 2.7 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  In South Korea, Hyundai shares dipped 4.0 percent. (AFP)

    Fils outplays top seed Zverev in Miami Open upset

<img alt="Alexander Zverev returns a shot against Arthur Fils in their fourth-round match at the Hard Rock Stadium. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797645_1_20250327114411.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 France's Arthur Fils upset top-seed Alexander Zverev with an outstanding display earning him a 3-6, 6-3, 6-4 win over the German in the fourth round of the Miami Open.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 20-year-old Frenchman will face 19-year-old Czech Jakub Mensik in the quarter-finals with both players chasing their first Masters 1000 semi-final spot.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rallying from a set down on Wednesday, Fils showed great determination to fight his way back and go 4-1 up in the second set.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zverev responded to take a 3-1 lead early in the third but again Fils refused to let the match slip from his grasp.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fils, using his athleticism and his powerful forehand, broke back to 3-2 and then when Zverev went long on a return took a 4-3 lead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zverev held when serving to stay in the game at 5-4 down but Fils kept his composure to serve out for one of the biggest wins of his career.
  <br>
  <br>
  The victory was all the more impressive given that Fils later revealed he was suffering from back pain.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I was feeling not great in the rallies. I've had a little problem in my back since I was young, so sometimes it hurts me a little bit," explained Fils.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I had to find a rhythm, [be] more aggressive and come into the court to play my game and not let him play, because when you let him play he is one of the best tennis players in the world. I'm really happy about the way I did it," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fils had also reached the quarter-finals at Indian Wells this month and he becomes the first Frenchman to make the last eight in both legs of the "Sunshine Double" since Gael Monfils in 2016.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the opening quarter-final, Bulgarian Grigor Dimitrov battled back from a set down to beat Argentine Francisco Cerundolo 6-7 (6/8), 6-4, 7-6 (7/3) in a riveting duel.
  <br>
  <br>
  After Cerundolo edged the first, the 33-year-old Dimitrov found his rhythm and was relentless in forcing Cerundolo to work on the baseline for every point.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cerundolo was 6-5 up in the third set and had one match point but Dimitrov showed his grit again and was able to hold and force the contest to a tie-break.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dimitrov raced out to a 3-0 lead and never looked in danger as he ran out the winner to book his place in the semi-finals where he will face the winner of Wednesday's later match between Novak Djokovic and American Sebastian Korda.
  <br>
  <br>
  An exhausted Dimitrov needed medical attention at the conclusion of the match, skipping the on-court interview. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wildfires raging in South Korea doubled in size on Thursday from a day earlier, as authorities called the blazes the country's worst natural fire disaster with at least 26 people killed and historic temples incinerated.
 <br>
  <br>
  More than 33,000 hectares has been charred or were still burning in the largest of the fires that began in the central Uiseong county, making it the biggest single forest fire in South Korea's history. The previous record was 24,000 hectares in a March 2000 fire.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are nationally in a critical situation with numerous casualties because of the unprecedented rapid spread of forest fires," Acting President Han Duck-soo told a government response meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  The military has released stocks of aviation fuel to help keep firefighting helicopters flying to douse flames across mountainous regions in the southeast of the country where fires have been burning now for nearly a week.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 120 helicopters have been deployed in three regions battling the blazes, the safety ministry said. South Korea relies on helicopters to fight forest fires because of its mountainous terrain.
  <br>
  <br>
  The wildfires that originated in Uiseong have been moving rapidly eastward, spreading almost to the coast, carried by gusty winds and with dry conditions aggravating the situation.
  <br>
  <br>
  While the meteorological agency has forecast some rain for the southwest, precipitation is expected to be under five millimetres for most of the affected areas.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The amount of rain is going to be small so it doesn't look like it'll be big help in trying to extinguish the fire," Korea Forest Service Minister Lim Sang-seop told a briefing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Experts have said the Uiseong fire showed extremely unusual spread in terms of its scale and speed, and that climate change is expected to make wildfires more frequent and deadly globally.
  <br>
  <br>
  Higher temperatures amplified by human-caused climate change contributed to the existing seasonally dry conditions, "turning dry landscapes into dangerous fire fuel" in the region, the Climate Central group, an independent body made up of scientists and researchers, said in a report. (Reuters)

 Asian shares mostly skidded with Wall Street on Thursday while the dollar hovered near a three-week high after US President Donald Trump announced new tariffs on all auto imports, ratcheting up a global trade war that risks fuelling inflation.

  In Hong Kong, however, the Hang Seng Index rose 60.54 points, or 0.26 percent, to open at 23,543.86.
  <br>

  Japan's Nikkei fell 1.2 percent, led by heavy losses in automakers.

 Foreign Minister Wang Yi will meet top French diplomat Jean-Noel Barrot on Thursday for talks on topics like the war in Ukraine and trade between China and the European Union.
 <br>
  <br>
  Beijing has said it hopes this week's visit by the French foreign minister would see the countries deepen cooperation in a world facing "turbulence and transformation".
  <br>
  <br>
  It has also said the two sides will discuss ways to "jointly resist unilateralism and the resurgence of the law of the jungle".
  <br>
  <br>
  Paris expects the talks will focus on a resolution to the Ukraine conflict, as well as the Middle East and trade tensions between China and the EU.
  <br>
  <br>
  After his meeting Wang, Barrot will then head to Shanghai, where he will on Friday inaugurate a hydrogen production plant built by the Air Liquide group and participate in a Franco-Chinese business forum. (AFP)

    Canada PM dubs US auto tariffs 'direct attack'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney reacted with anger on Wednesday to US President Donald Trump's imposition of import tariffs on cars, branding it a "direct attack" on his country.
 <br>
  <br>
  "We will defend our workers. We'll defend our companies. We'll defend our country. And we'll defend it together," said Carney.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This will hurt us, but through this period, by being together, we will emerge stronger."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said earlier Wednesday that he was placing 25 percent tariffs on auto imports and, to underscore his intention, he stated “This is permanent.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Carney said he needs to see the details of Trump's executive order before taking retaliatory measures.
  <br>
  <br>
  He called it unjustified and said he would leave the election campaign to go to Ottawa on Thursday to chair his special Cabinet committee on US relations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carney earlier announced a CA$2 billion (US$1.4 billion) “strategic response fund” that would protect Canadian auto jobs affected by Trump’s tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Autos are Canada’s second largest export, and Carney noted it employs 125,000 Canadians directly and almost another 500,000 in related industries.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Canada will be there for auto workers,” he said. (Agencies)

    Trump hints at lower tariffs for China over TikTok

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump said on Wednesday he would be willing to reduce tariffs to get a deal done with TikTok's Chinese parent ByteDance to sell the short video app used by 170 million Americans.
 <br>
  <br>
  ByteDance has an April 5 deadline to find a non-Chinese buyer for TikTok or face a US ban on national security grounds that was supposed to have taken effect in January under a 2024 law.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said he was willing to extend the deadline if an agreement over the social media app was not reached.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With respect to TikTok, and China is going to have to play a role in that, possibly in the form of an approval, maybe, and I think they'll do that. Maybe I'll give them a little reduction in tariffs or something to get it done," Trump told reporters on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  TikTok did not immediately comment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has used tariffs as a bargaining chip in the TikTok negotiations in the past.
  <br>
  <br>
  On January 20, his first day in office, he warned that he could impose tariffs on China if Beijing failed to approve a US deal with TikTok. Earlier this month, Trump hiked his additional tariffs on all imports from China to 20 percent up from 10 percent issued in February.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vice President JD Vance has said he expects the general terms of an agreement that resolves the ownership of the social media platform to be reached by April 5.
  <br>
  <br>
  The future of the app used by nearly half of all Americans has been up in the air since a law, passed last year with overwhelming bipartisan support, required ByteDance to divest TikTok by January 19.
  <br>
  <br>
  The app briefly went dark in January after the US Supreme Court upheld the ban, but flickered back to life days later once Trump took office. Trump quickly issued an executive order postponing enforcement of the law to April 5 and said last month that he could further extend that deadline to give himself time to shepherd a deal.
  <br>
  <br>
  The White House has been involved to an unprecedented level in the closely watched deal talks, effectively playing the role of investment bank. (Reuters)

    Teenage Filipino Eala stuns Swiatek at Miami Open

<img alt="Alexandra Eala is the first player from the Philippines to reach the semi-finals of a WTP 1000 tournament. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797607_1_20250327071056.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Alexandra Eala, a 19-year-old wildcard from the Philippines, produced a huge upset at the Miami Open on Wednesday, defeating world number two Iga Swiatek 6-2 7-5 to reach the semi-finals.
 <br>
  <br>
  Ranked 140th in the world, Eala, the first woman from her country to reach the last eight of a WTA 1000 tournament, took advantage of a unusually poor display from Swiatek, keeping her focus as she fought back from 4-2 down in the second set.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eala broke the Pole for the eighth and final time when Swiatek was serving to stay in the match at 6-5 down in the second set and looked stunned as she struggled to contain her emotions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm just in disbelief right now. It's so surreal," she said on court.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm so happy and so blessed to be able to compete with such a player on this stage," said Eala, who has now beaten three grand slam winners on her route to the last four at Miami -- having dealt with Jelena Ostapenko and Madison Keys before upsetting four-time French Open champion Swiatek.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm trusting my shots and I have a great team to tell me that I can do it," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eala moved to Spain at the age of 13 to join Rafael Nadal's academy in Mallorca and Toni Nadal, the Spaniard's uncle and former coach, was in her box for the match.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It meant a lot that he showed up here. It showed the confidence he had in me and the confidence the academy had in me," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eala will next face American Jessica Pegula, who outplayed Britain's Emma Raducanu 6-4 6-7 6-2.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Just because I won this match or the one before doesn't make the next one any less tough. If anything it will be more tough, so it will take everything that I have," said Eala.
  <br>
  <br>
  Swiatek will look forward to moving on to the clay season after conceding that she had been far from her usual level.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm sure I wasn't playing my best game and I felt like my forehand collapsed a little, so it wasn't comfortable and Alexandra, for sure, used her chances and pushed me, so for sure she deserves to win this match," she said. (AFP)

    Denmark welcomes US limiting Greenland visit

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Denmark welcomed on Wednesday Washington's decision to limit an American delegation's visit to Greenland to a US military base, after previous plans for the unexpected trip sparked criticism.
 <br>
  <br>
  US Vice President JD Vance announced on Tuesday that he would accompany his wife Usha on Friday to the Pituffik Space Base in Greenland, the Danish self-governing island coveted by President Donald Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since returning to power in January, Trump has insisted he wants to take over Greenland for national security purposes, refusing to rule out the use of force to do so.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vance's announcement came just hours after Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen and Greenland's outgoing Prime Minister Mute Egede harshly criticised plans by a US delegation to visit the Arctic island uninvited.
  <br>
  <br>
  Egede had qualified the initial plans as "foreign interference", noting the outgoing government had not "sent out any invitations for visits, private or official".
  <br>
  <br>
  Following March 11 elections, Greenland has only a transitional government, with parties still in negotiations to form a new coalition government.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have asked all countries to respect this process," Egede had said in a Facebook post.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yet the White House announced on Sunday that Usha Vance would travel to Greenland from Thursday to Saturday, while Egede had said US national security adviser Mike Waltz was also expected to take part.
  <br>
  <br>
  US media had reported that Energy Secretary Chris Wright would be part of the visit as well.
  <br>
  <br>
  Usha Vance had been scheduled to view "historical sites, learn about Greenlandic heritage and watch the Avannaata Qimussersu, Greenland's national dogsled race," in the southwestern town of Sisimiut, the White House had said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Frederiksen denounced that visit as "unacceptable pressure" being put on Greenland and Denmark, and vowed "to resist". (AFP)

 Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu threatened on Wednesday to seize parts of Gaza if Hamas does not release hostages, while the militant group warned they would return "in coffins" if Israel does not stop bombing the Palestinian territory.

  Just over a week since the military resumed operations following a January truce, Israel said two projectiles were fired from the Gaza Strip, with one intercepted and the other landing near the border, and with no immediate reports of any casualties or damage.
  <br>
  <br>
  The rocket fire came a day after hundreds of Palestinians staged a rare protest against Hamas, chanting slogans against the Islamist movement and calling for an end to the war.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shattering weeks of relative calm in the war brought by the fragile ceasefire, Israel last week resumed intense bombardment and ground operations across Gaza, while militants returned to launching rocket attacks.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to the health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza, 830 people have been killed in the territory since Israel resumed its strikes on March 18. No deaths have been reported on the Israeli side.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israeli officials say the resumption of operations was meant to pressure Hamas into releasing the remaining hostages, after a stalemate in talks with mediators on extending the truce – which saw 33 Israeli captives freed in exchange for Palestinian prisoners.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel wanted an extension of the truce's initial phase, while Hamas demanded talks on a second stage that was meant to lead to a permanent ceasefire.
  <br>
  <br>
  Netanyahu told parliament that "the more Hamas persists in its refusal to release our hostages, the stronger the pressure we will exert".
  <br>
  <br>
  "This includes the seizure of territories, along with other measures I will not elaborate here," he added, days after his Defence Minister Israel Katz had warned: "The more Hamas refuses to free the hostages, the more territory it will lose, which will be annexed by Israel".
  <br>
  <br>
  Of the 251 hostages seized during Hamas's October 7, 2023 attack on Israel which triggered the war, 58 are still held in Gaza, including 34 the Israeli military says are dead. (AFP)

 The SAR's tennis star, Coleman Wong, said late Wednesday that he was more confident about cracking the top 100 in the men's singles world rankings, following his historic success at the Miami Open.
 <br>
  <br>
  He became the first player representing Hong Kong, China to make the third round of an ATP Masters 1000 tournament, beating World No. 14 Ben Shelton in the second round before losing to Adam Walton.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong, currently ranked 182 in the world, said he was glad to prove the doubters wrong with his play - and that it's possible for someone from the SAR to beat a top-20 player.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I want to very much thank everyone in Hong Kong for their support. You all motivated me a lot. Especially the doubters - they always seem to say, oh you're not good enough. There isn't a tennis player from the SAR who is able to shine on the world stage, and beat a top 20 player," he told reporters at the airport after returning to the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So I want to tell everyone that it's possible."
  <br>
  <br>
  The 20-year-old has been training at the Rafa Nadal Academy in Spain.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said he's very grateful that the tennis legend had called him to offer his congratulations.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That was super. He found my agent asking for my number, and he called me on his own number. Nadal texted me his congratulations. He says he hopes I can keep going as he thought I gained a lot for Hong Kong," Wong said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He called me a world-class player."
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong said he now plans to play at the Barcelona and Madrid opens, saying his coaching team think he's ready for more action on the clay.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also explained that he drank some coke during matches because he was a bit tired and he wasn't into coffee, so the coaching staff said he could down the soft drink for some caffeine.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong said he felt physically drained while playing in the third round as he wasn't used to the grind at major competitions.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said that's an area he would look to make improvements on.

<div class="itemFullText">
 US stocks veered off course on Wednesday after the White House said President Donald Trump would announce fresh tariffs on the auto sector after markets close.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 0.3 percent at 42,454.79, while the broad-based S&P 500 Index fell 1.1 percent to 5,712.20.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tech-focused Nasdaq Composite Index tumbled 2.0 percent to 17,899.01, while the CBOE Volatility Index -- Wall Street's so-called "fear gauge" -- jumped seven percent, reflecting market jitters.
  <br>
  <br>
  The turn in market sentiment followed White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt's remarks earlier Wednesday that Trump would unveil the "auto industry" tariffs at 4:00 pm (2000 GMT).
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's the continuation of worries regarding the tariffs and the impact on the economy," Peter Cardillo from Spartan Capital Securities told AFP.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Everyone is (also) waiting to see what the reciprocal tariffs are going to be on April the 2nd," he added. "So it's a continuation of this wall of worries."
  <br>
  <br>
  US automakers fell on the news, with Tesla closing down 5.6 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  General Motors shed 3.1 percent, while Ford initially slipped, before reversing course to finish up 0.1 percent. (AFP)

    Trump announces 25pc tariff on non-US-built cars

<img alt="US President Donald Trump announces tariffs on auto imports in the Oval Office. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797599_1_20250327060802.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump announced steep tariffs on auto imports Wednesday, in a move set to fuel tensions with trading partners ahead of further promised levies next week.
 <br>
  <br>
  "What we're going to be doing is a 25 percent tariff on all cars that are not made in the United States. If they're made in the United States, it is absolutely no tariff," he said at the White House.
  <br>
  <br>
  The move is set to take effect April 2 -- with duties to be collected from April 3 -- and impact foreign-made cars and light trucks.
  <br>
  <br>
  The levies will be in addition to those already in place for the goods, and Trump added that "this is permanent."
  <br>
  <br>
  Since returning to the presidency in January, Trump has imposed fresh tariffs on imports from major US trading partners Canada, Mexico and China -- as well as a 25 percent duty on steel and aluminium.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he previously offered automakers temporary reprieve from the levies affecting North America.
  <br>
  <br>
  Uncertainty over Trump's trade plans and worries they could trigger a downturn have roiled financial markets, with consumer confidence also falling in recent months amid fears of the tariffs' effects.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wall Street slumped ahead of Trump's announcement, with the tech-focused Nasdaq plunging 2.0 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shares in automaker General Motors closed 3.1 percent down, while Ford eked out a 0.1 percent gain.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Trump administration has referred to levies as a way to raise government revenue, revitalize American industry and press countries on US priorities.
  <br>
  <br>
  But targeting imported cars could strain ties with countries like Japan, South Korea, Canada, Mexico and Germany -- which are close US partners.
  <br>
  <br>
  About 50 percent of cars sold in the United States are manufactured within the country. Among imports, about half come from Mexico and Canada, with Japan, South Korea and Germany, also major suppliers.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Center for Automotive Research has previously estimated that US tariffs -- including those on metals and imported autos -- could increase the price of a car by thousands of dollars and weigh on the jobs market.
  <br>
  <br>
  Besides the automobile industry, Trump is also eyeing sector-specific tariffs on industries like pharmaceuticals and semiconductors.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Wednesday, he reaffirmed his intent to impose tariffs on lumber and pharmaceuticals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wednesday's announcement on autos comes ahead of April 2, which Trump has dubbed "Liberation Day" for the world's biggest economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  He has promised reciprocal levies on the date, tailored to different trading partners in an attempt to remedy practices that Washington deemed unfair.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Wednesday he said these duties will impact all countries but that they would be "very lenient."
  <br>
  <br>
  It is unclear if further sector-specific tariffs would be announced on April 2, with the White House noting this week that the situation remained fluid.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump told reporters Monday that he might "give a lot of countries breaks" eventually, without elaborating.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he added Tuesday that he did not want too many exceptions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hopes of a narrower tariff rollout had given financial markets a boost, but investors remain jittery over rapid policy changes.
  <br>
  <br>
  While Trump has invoked emergency economic powers for some recent tariffs, his auto levies may build on a previous government investigation completed in 2019, former US trade official Ryan Majerus told AFP.
  <br>
  <br>
  The probe found that excessive imports were weakening the internal economy and might impair national security.
  <br>
  <br>
  At the time, one recommendation was to institute tariffs of up to 25 percent to bolster US production of autos and parts.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The advantage with autos," said Majerus, now a partner at the King & Spalding law firm, is that the administration "can act a lot quicker if they want, as opposed to, say in lumber or copper, where they had to launch investigations."
  <br>
  <br>
  US trade partners have been furthering talks with Washington as Trump's reciprocal tariff deadline looms.
  <br>
  <br>
  EU trade chief Maros Sefcovic met his American counterparts Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and trade envoy Jamieson Greer this week.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sefcovic said on social media that "the EU's priority is a fair, balanced deal instead of unjustified tariffs." (AFP)
