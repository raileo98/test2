<div class="itemFullText">
 The first report on last month’s Jeju Air crash in South Korea confirmed bird strikes in the plane's engines, though officials haven't determined the cause of the accident that killed all but two of the 181 people on board .
 <br>
  <br>
  The preliminary accident report released on Monday said feathers and bird blood stains were found in both engines.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The samples were sent to specialised organisations for DNA analysis, and a domestic organisation identified them as belonging to Baikal Teals,” the report said, referring to a migratory duck.
  <br>
  <br>
  The report also said the plane's black box stopped recording about four minutes before the crash.
  <br>
  <br>
  South Korea earlier announced it would remove a concrete structure at the end of the airport's runway that was involved in the crash.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some experts have said that Muan International Airport’s localiser — a set of antennas in a concrete structure that guide aircraft during landings — likely made the crash of the Jeju Air plane worse.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Boeing 737-800 skidded off the airport’s runaway on December 29 after its landing gear failed to deploy, slamming into the concrete structure and bursting into flames.
  <br>
  <br>
  Many observers said the structure should have been made with lighter materials that could break more easily upon impact.
  <br>
  <br>
  Investigators have said that air traffic controllers warned the pilot about possible bird strikes two minutes before the aircraft issued a distress signal confirming that a bird strike had occurred, after which the pilot attempted an emergency landing. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Officials closed the Cheung Sha Wan Lunar New Year fair for several hours on Monday after some stalls were damaged by strong winds overnight.
 <br>
  <br>
  Goods were left scattered on the ground and scaffolding was damaged, with a similar scene at a fair in Tsz Wan Shan.
  <br>
  <br>
  A woman selling orchids at Cheung Sha Wan told RTHK she thinks she has lost tens of thousands of dollars due to the damage.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For the entire year, the two days before the Lunar New Year is the most important for business. This is really miserable for farmers," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Environment Secretary Tse Chin-wan inspected the scene in the morning.
  <br>
  <br>
  The fair reopened at around 3pm after damaged scaffolding was removed.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Radio Television Hong Kong (RTHK) is launching a new season of the series "The Nitty Gritty of Law" with the Law Society next month to explore different legal issues with experts in the field.
 <br>
  <br>
  RTHK assistant director Vincent Lee told a launch ceremony on Monday that the inaugural season of the programme, which was solely in audio form, had been well-received.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the coming season will also be aired on television and online platforms, while introducing a radio drama to promote legal knowledge.
  <br>
  <br>
  Roden Tong, the president of the Law Society, said he hopes audiences can learn more about the law through the programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  The programme, which has 16 episodes, will be aired on Sundays with the first episode launching on February 2.
  <br>
  <br>
  The episodes will first be aired from 12.15pm to 1pm on RTHK Radio 1, before being broadcast on RTHK TV 31 on 7pm. They are also available on RTHK's website and mobile app.
  <br>
  <br>
  Legal experts, such as former secretary for justice Elsie Leung and a number of ex-Law Society heads, will be invited to the show to discuss various legal topics, such as family law, criminal law, and intellectual property.

 Monday marks the 28th day of the 12th lunar month.
 <br>
  <br>
  According to Chinese tradition, it is a day designated for "spring cleaning", when families deep-clean their homes in the run up to the Lunar New Year and put up new "fai chuns" -- red banners bearing auspicious phrases.
  <br>
  <br>
  While the market is flooded with mass produced, digitally-printed "fai chuns", many people still prefer the more traditional, handwritten ones that are becoming quite rare these days.
  <br>
  <br>
  RTHK visited an elderly calligraphy master in North Point, and asked him why it's so important to preserve this traditional craft.

<img alt="Rosanna Law says the government hopes to review the positioning of performance venues by the end of this year. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1789282_1_20250127121148.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism Rosanna Law said the government would conduct a strategic review of the use of the city's performance venues.
 <br>
  <br>
  Law expected this would be completed by the end of the year.
  <br>
  <br>
  In an interview with Ta Kung Pao published on Monday, Law said Hong Kong would have more venues to stage more kinds of performances and sports events.
  <br>
  <br>
  These include the Kai Tak Sports Park, and the WestK Performing Arts Centre that is set to be completed next year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Airport Authority also recently announced that it would build the second phase of the AsiaWorld-Expo to expand the total exhibition space to 100,000 square metres.
  <br>
  <br>
  The project is set for completion in 2028.
  <br>
  <br>
  “This venue has a favourable location, [it’s] near the airport, and [it’s also] convenient for Zhuhai and Macau travellers to head to. I have high hopes [for the venue],” Law said.
  <br>
  <br>
  With more venues, she said the SAR would be able to stage more events.
  <br>
  <br>
  “If there is a better allocation, world-class venues can carry out more world-class performances.”
  <br>
  <br>
  In another interview with Wen Wei Po, the minister stressed the city has to focus on both quality and quantity for tourism development.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The White House said on Sunday that Colombia had backed down and agreed to accept repatriated citizens on military flights, after US President Donald Trump threatened major sanctions.
 <br>
  <br>
  Afterwards, Colombia said it had "overcome the impasse" with Washington in the row over the reception of migrants deported from the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will continue receiving Colombians who return as deportees," Foreign Minister Luis Gilberto Murillo said at a news conference after Bogota blocked the entry of US planes carrying deported Colombians.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump had threatened sanctions of 25 percent that would quickly scale up to 50 percent against Latin America's fourth largest economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Colombia has agreed to "unrestricted acceptance of all illegal aliens from Colombia returned from the United States, including on US military aircraft, without limitation or delay," a White House statement said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Today's events make clear to the world that America is respected again," it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "President Trump will continue to fiercely protect our nation's sovereignty, and he expects all other nations of the world to fully cooperate in accepting the deportation of their citizens illegally present in the United States."
  <br>
  <br>
  Colombian President Gustavo Petro, a leftist, had infuriated Trump by refusing to accept military planes of Colombians deported from the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  He had earlier said he would take back migrants but "with dignity," including on civilian planes. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Kaylin Hsieh has become the third Hong Kong fencer in history to win a Grand Prix, after defeating world number six Nelli Differt in the women's epée final in Doha.
 <br>
  <br>
  Hsieh, 23, beat the Estonian 15-7 on Monday for her first victory against the 34-year-old in six attempts.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SAR fencer joins Olympic gold medallists Edgar Cheung and Vivian Kong in winning a Grand Prix for Hong Kong, China.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hsieh wrote on social media that she started the competition with a cold and struggled to find rhythm, but decided to try to fight through it to see how far she could go.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Sometimes life throws challenges at you when you least expect it and you just have to find a way to push through," she wrote, calling her triumph an unforgettable moment.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This gold medal is not just a milestone for me. It's a reminder of the power of resilience and mindset."
  <br>
  <br>
  Hsieh, currently ranked 28th in the world, last topped a podium in international competition in the under-17 World Championships in 2018.
  <br>
  <br>
  She snatched a bronze at the World Cup in Vancouver last November.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hsieh represented the SAR in her Olympic debut in Tokyo.
  <br>
  <br>
  She was an individual and team champion representing the University of Notre Dame in the US during the 2022 NCAA fencing tournament.

    China's factory output falls in January

<img alt="Workers producing photovoltaic modules for solar panels in a factory in Suqian, Jiangsu province. China's PMI dipped below the 50-mark in January, indicating contraction in manufacturing activity. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1789279_1_20250127115151.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Official data on Monday showed that China's purchasing managers' index (PMI) for its domestic manufacturing sector came in at 49.1 in January, down from 50.1 in December.
 <br>
  <br>
  That's below the 50-mark separating growth from contraction.
  <br>
  <br>
  The PMI for China's non-manufacturing sector, which includes services and construction, was also lower in January coming in at 50.2, down from 52.2 in December.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the combined profit of major industrial enterprises went up 11 percent year on year in December 2024, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  NBS statistician Zhao Qinghe said the PMI data in January was influenced by factors such as the approaching Chinese New Year holiday and enterprise employees' returning home for festival reunions.
  <br>
  <br>
  The world's second-largest economy hit the government's growth target of around five percent over 2024, but exports and industrial output far outpaced retail sales and unemployment remained elevated.
  <br>
  <br>
  US President Donald Trump's threat to impose a 10 percent punitive duty on Chinese imports on February 1 also adds to the lingering uncertainty surrounding the economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  China's trade surplus reached almost US$1 trillion last year, as producers looked to shift stocks overseas to counter weak domestic demand.
  <br>
  <br>
  The country's outbound shipments were further assisted by factory gate deflation and a weak yuan, making Chinese goods more competitive in global markets.
  <br>
  <br>
  Back at home, falling prices affected corporate profits and workers' incomes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Policymakers have promised to roll out further stimulus over 2025, in addition to the ones already implemented last year, as Beijing prioritises revitalising domestic demand.
  <br>
  <br>
  Getting mainland consumers spending again would reduce producers' exposure to Trump's tariff threats, which he said could be as high as 60 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  State leaders are also hoping last year's policy support measures will increase demand in the struggling property sector and ease developers' financial difficulties, which affects domestic demand and local government finances. (Xinhua/Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A Hospital Authority (HA) dietician told people to avoid festive fat traps and overeating during the Lunar New Year holiday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Registered dietitian Ivy Chua from the HA said people can order healthier dishes when they are having their reunion dinner at restaurants.
  <br>
  <br>
  “If you really want to eat out, try to control the portion and the food choices you are having. For example, you can choose some better quality protein, something like  steamed fish is a really lower fat protein source,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  People can get rid of chicken skin, and avoid eating sauces to have a healthier diet, she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chua also said people could select high-fibre food, like vegetables, so as to eat less meat.
  <br>
  <br>
  To avoid overeating before the main reunion dinner, Chua said people could have high-fibre snacks before the big meal.
  <br>
  <br>
  She also reminded citizens, especially diabetes patients and people who have high blood pressure and high blood lipids, not to have too many Chinese New Year cakes and deep-fried traditional snacks as they contain a lot of oil, salt and sugar.
  <br>
  <br>
  “There is a lot of food that is really high in calories, especially in fat and sugar. I'd recommend everyone to try limit their portion of the food, especially the traditional snacks, and actually they can find some healthier snacks to replace it,” Chua said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chua suggested that people can make healthier snacks at home such as rice crackers, low calorie jelly with fruits, or plain popcorn with a little bit salt.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Quarterback Jalen Hurts and running back Saquon Barkley rushed in three touchdowns each as the Philadelphia Eagles reached the Super Bowl with a 55-23 win over the Washington Commanders in the NFC Championship game.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Eagles' powerful running game proved too much for the Commanders as Philadelphia reached the NFL's championship showpiece for the second time in three years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Philadelphia's 55 points, with seven rushing touchdowns, was the highest total scored in a conference championship game, beating the previous best of 51 points set by the Buffalo Bills in 1991.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Chiefs will face the NFC champion Philadelphia Eagles in the Super Bowl in New Orleans on February 9 - in a rematch of the 2023 Super Bowl, which they lost to the Kansas City Chiefs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Washington's Jayden Daniels was looking to become the first rookie quarterback to reach the Super Bowl, but while he was his composed self again, the Commanders defense was no match for Philadelphia's awesome power on the ground.
  <br>
  <br>
  After Zane Gonzalez opened the scoring with a field goal for the Commanders, Barkley displayed his incredible power and speed once again as he sprinted home for a 60-yard score.
  <br>
  <br>
  Barkley then put the Eagles 14-3 up late in the first quarter bursting into the end-zone from four yards out.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Commanders got themselves back into the game when another Gonzalez field goal was followed up by Daniels connecting with Terry McLaurin on a 36-yard touchdown pass.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the final minutes of the opening half were a mess for the Commanders. On fourth-and-5 from near midfield, Eagles receiver A.J. Brown was able to get behind cornerback Marshon Lattimore for a crucial 31-yard completion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Then, Lattimore got called for pass interference in the end zone after a third-down incompletion, which left Hurts with just a yard to rush in for a score.
  <br>
  <br>
  A disastrous turnover followed when Jeremy McNichols was stripped off the ball on the kickoff return, allowing the Eagles to have the ball again. Hurts made the most of it - finding Brown with a 4-yard pass as Philadelphia opened up a 15-point lead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gonzalez's field goal reduced the gap before the interval but the Eagles were in no mood to open the door to their divisional rivals with Hurts showing his prowess with his feet as he ran in from 9-yards out.
  <br>
  <br>
  Daniels then showed his rushing ability, wrongfooting the Eagles defense with a sharp change of direction for a 10-yard score and then he provided a succesful two point conversion to reduce the deficit to 11 points.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Hurts started the fourth quarter with a quarterback sneak getting him over the line for his fourth overall touchdown.
  <br>
  <br>
  After another Barkley touchdown, rookie running back Will Shipley joined the party, with a 2-yard rush in the final minutes. (AFP)

    Leicester beats Spurs; United edges past Fulham

Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1789240_1_20250127053623.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Leicester pushed Tottenham boss Ange Postecoglou closer to the exit door with a 2-1 win that extended Spurs' dismal run, while Manchester United's 1-0 victory at Fulham eased the pressure on Ruben Amorim.
 <br>
  <br>
  Tottenham blew the lead on home turf as they crumbled to a sixth defeat in their last seven league games.
  <br>
  <br>
  With only one win in their last 11 top-flight matches, Postecoglou's side are languishing in 15th place, just eight points above the bottom three.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was another woeful result for the beleaguered Australian, who has faced mounting calls for his dismissal throughout a turbulent second season in charge.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tottenham are dangerously close to being sucked into the relegation battle but Postecoglou believes his injury-ravaged squad are still fighting for him.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When you are the manager of a football club, you can be very vulnerable and isolated. I don't feel that," said Postecoglou.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I feel like this group of players, not for me, are giving everything for the club. I have a group of staff that is really committed. I focus on that."
  <br>
  <br>
  Richarlison had headed the home side in front but two goals in four minutes at the start of the second half from Jamie Vardy and Bilal El Khannouss ended Leicester's seven-game losing streak in the league.
  <br>
  <br>
  While Postecoglou fights to save his job, Leicester manager Ruud van Nistelrooy can breathe a little easier over his own future.
  <br>
  <br>
  Leicester are now one place and one point above the relegation zone.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's a massive win," said Van Nistelrooy. "The players are buying into it. I can only be very proud of this team."
  <br>
  <br>
  Any notion United could be dragged into a relegation battle now appears gone after Lisandro Martinez's deflected strike ground out a much-needed victory at Fulham for the Red Devils.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chances were at a premium for both sides until the Argentinian's effort flicked off Sasa Lukic to loop over Bernd Leno.
  <br>
  <br>
  Joachim Andersen had a header cleared off the line by Toby Collyer as the visitors held out for a victory which lifts United up to 12th.
  <br>
  <br>
  Aston Villa's hopes of Champions League qualification for a second consecutive season were dented as an under-strength West Ham battled back to earn a 1-1 draw in Birmingham.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jacob Ramsey's strike was just reward for a fast start by Unai Emery's side.
  <br>
  <br>
  Graham Potter was forced to name four full-backs in his starting line-up for the injury-hit Hammers, who were without captain Jarrod Bowen.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the visitors rallied in the second half and were unfortunate not to take all three points after Emerson Palmieri's header levelled.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lucas Paqueta thought he had won the game in stoppage time, but Tomas Soucek had strayed offside before teeing up the Brazilian to quell Potter's jubilant celebration on the touchline.
  <br>
  <br>
  Villa remain in eighth, four points off the top four, while West Ham sit 14th.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brentford benefited from penalty controversy to beat Crystal Palace 2-1 at Selhurst Park.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thomas Frank's team earned a 66th minute spot-kick when Maxence Lacroix fouled Nathan Collins.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bryan Mbeumo's spot-kick hit the post, but Palace's reprieve was short-lived as VAR ruled Marc Guehi had encroached before the shot.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Brentford forward gratefully accepted his second chance by sending Palace keeper Dean Henderson the wrong way for his 14th goal this season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kevin Schade netted in the 80th minute for Brentford before Palace winger Romain Esse came off the bench to score with his first touch on his debut five minutes later. (AFP)

<img alt="US President Donald Trump (Left) and Colombian President Gustavo Petro are at loggerheads over mass deportations of migrants by Washington. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1789231_1_20250127031851.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump vowed on Sunday to hit Colombia with steep tariffs and other sanctions after his counterpart Gustavo Petro blocked deportation flights from the United States.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Petro's denial of these flights has jeopardized the National Security and Public Safety of the United States, so I have directed my Administration to immediately take the following urgent and decisive retaliatory measures," Trump posted on his Truth Social platform.
  <br>
  <br>
  He listed "25 percent tariffs," a travel ban on Colombian government officials, and invoking sanctions under emergency presidential powers -- among several other severe responses.
  <br>
  <br>
  Colombia's refusal to accept the flights is the second case of a Latin American nation refusing US military deportation flights.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The US cannot treat Colombian migrants as criminals," Petro wrote, noting that there were 15,660 Americans without proper immigration status in Colombia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Petro's comments add to the growing chorus of discontent in Latin America as Trump's week-old administration starts mobilising for mass deportations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brazil's foreign ministry late on Saturday condemned "degrading treatment" of Brazilians after migrants were handcuffed on a commercial deportation flight. Upon arrival, some of the passengers also reported mistreatment during the flight, according to local news reports.
  <br>
  <br>
  The plane, which was carrying 88 Brazilian passengers, 16 US security agents, and eight crew members, had been originally scheduled to arrive in Belo Horizonte in the southeastern state of Minas Gerais.
  <br>
  <br>
  There, Brazilian officials ordered the removal of the handcuffs, and President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva designated a Brazilian Air Force (FAB) flight to complete their journey, the government said in a statement Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The commercial charter flight was the second this year from the US carrying undocumented migrants deported back to Brazil and the first since Trump's inauguration, according to Brazil's federal police.
  <br>
  <br>
  The use of US military aircraft to carry out deportation flights is part of the Pentagon's response to Trump's national emergency declaration on immigration on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the past, US military aircraft have been used to relocate individuals from one country to another, like during the US withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021.
  <br>
  <br>
  This has been the first time in recent memory that US military aircraft were used to fly migrants out of the country, one American official said. (Agencies)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Israeli army fire killed 22 people in south Lebanon on Sunday including a soldier, health officials said, as residents tried to return home on the day Israel was meant to withdraw under a truce deal.
 <br>
  <br>
  The withdrawal deadline is part of a ceasefire agreement reached two months ago that ended Israel's war with Iran-backed Hezbollah, which had left the Lebanese militant group weakened.
  <br>
  <br>
  The deal that took effect on November 27 said the Lebanese army was to deploy alongside United Nations peacekeepers in the south as the Israeli army withdrew over a 60-day period that ends on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The parties have traded blame for the delay in implementing the agreement, and on Friday Israel said it would keep troops across the border in south Lebanon beyond the pullout date.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lebanon's health ministry said on Sunday that Israeli forces opened fire on "citizens who were trying to return to their villages that are still under (Israeli) occupation".
  <br>
  <br>
  The Israeli military said in a statement that its "troops operating in southern Lebanon fired warning shots to remove threats" where "suspects were identified approaching the troops".
  <br>
  <br>
  A joint statement from the UN special coordinator for Lebanon, Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert, and the head of the UNIFIL peacekeeping mission acknowledged that "as seen tragically this morning, conditions are not yet in place for the safe return of citizens to their villages". (AFP)

    Yoon Suk-yeol indicted on insurrection charges

<img alt="It follows the now-suspended President Yoon's short-lived imposition of martial law on December 3. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1789208_1_20250126184414.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korea's prosecutors indicted President Yoon Su-yeol on Sunday on charges of leading an insurrection with his short-lived imposition of martial law on December 3, the main opposition party said.
 <br>
  <br>
  "The prosecution has decided to indict Yoon Suk-yeol, who is facing charges of being a ringleader of insurrection," Democratic Party spokesman Han Min-soo told a press conference. "The punishment of the ringleader of insurrection now begins finally."
  <br>
  <br>
  The indictment was also reported by South Korean media.
  <br>
  <br>
  Anti-corruption investigators last week recommended charging the jailed Yoon, who was impeached by parliament and suspended from his duties over the incident.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon's lawyers had urged the prosecutors to immediately release the him from what they call illegal custody.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under criminal investigation, he has been in custody since becoming the first sitting president to be arrested on January 15.
  <br>
  <br>
  Insurrection is one of the few criminal charges from which a South Korean president does not have immunity. It is punishable by life imprisonment or death, although South Korea has not executed anyone in decades.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon and his lawyers argued at a Constitutional Court hearing last week in his impeachment trial that he never intended to fully impose martial law but had only meant the measures as a warning to break political deadlock.
  <br>
  <br>
  In parallel with his criminal process, the top court will determine whether to remove Yoon from office or reinstate his presidential powers, with 180 days to decide.
  <br>
  <br>
  South Korea's opposition-led parliament impeached Yoon on December 14, making him the second conservative president to be impeached in the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon rescinded his martial law after about six hours after lawmakers from the main opposition party, confronting soldiers in parliament, voted down the decree.
  <br>
  <br>
  Soldiers equipped with rifles, body armour and night-vision equipment, were seen entering the parliament building through smashed windows during the dramatic confrontation. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump said on Saturday that Jordan and Egypt should take more Palestinians from Gaza, where Israel's war against Hamas has caused a humanitarian crisis.
 <br>
  <br>
  "I said to him I’d love you to take on more because I’m looking at the whole Gaza strip right now and it’s a mess, it’s a real mess. I’d like him to take people," Trump said about his call on Saturday with Jordan's King Abdullah.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I’d like Egypt to take people," Trump told reporters, adding he would speak to Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel launched its campaign in Gaza after the October 7 attack by the Hamas, when militants killed 1,200 people and took more than 250 hostages to Gaza, according to Israeli tallies. Since then, Israel's campaign has killed more than 47,000 Palestinians in Gaza, according to health authorities there. More than 400 Israeli soldiers have also died in Gaza combat. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's public hospitals are ready to handle an expected rise in flu cases during the Lunar New Year, Hospital Authority (HA) chief executive Tony Ko said on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a television programme, Ko said the authority has taken steps to prepare for the peak flu season.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have arranged additional manpower and asked colleagues to avoid taking many leaves during that period. We have also increased the number of hospital beds, so we are confident in our ability to handle an uptick in service demand," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ko, who will step down in July after serving for almost six years, said it is an appropriate time to leave and that he has no regrets.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have successfully overcome many challenges like the Covid pandemic. Looking at the Hospital Authority now, we've recovered our services, improved our systems, and built better cooperation with the mainland and other countries... I can see many things are on track. It's the right time to leave," he explained.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that the HA will continue to automate and streamline certain work processes so that clinical staff can spend more time with patients and better serve them.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hongkongers braved the chilly conditions to explore the 1.1-kilometre section of the East Coast boardwalk from Fortress Hill to North Point, which opened on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  North Point resident Adrienne Garvey told RTHK that her family is looking forward to using the promenade.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The kids play area here is fantastic… the kids are loving and exploring it, and I am looking forward to running along here, all the way down to Kennedy Town [in future]. I can have a nice long running route to train on," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hopefully we'll be here every week, if it's the kids with their scooters and running and playing in the park, I think this is a really nice place. It is under the shade as well, so in the summer it will be so good.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Her son Max also said he loves the play area.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The waterfront looks quite nice, and I think it's very fun because it has a playground. Also we like running down the bumps. It's the first day we are here, so we are just going to maybe go and see the whole bridge," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another resident, surnamed Kwok, said the trail is perfect for running.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I often run, and it is impossible to run along the harbour before. So I came this morning to take a look to prepare for future runs… It is very comfortable and faces the sea," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pet owner Carina Chan also told RTHK that the boardwalk is great for walking her dog.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We go to East Coast Park every day via Java Road. We had to cross the road each time, but now with the boardwalk... it is more convenient and safe," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The harbourfront walkway - built under the Island Eastern Corridor - spans 2.2 kilometres in total.
  <br>
  <br>
  Its eastern section, which will connect North Point to Quarry Bay, is set to open in phases in the second half of this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The walkway is part of a bigger, 13-kilometre harbourfront promenade project that will eventually connect Kennedy Town with Shau Kei Wan.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan has vowed to beef up efforts in promoting Hong Kong to the rest of the world, saying some of those attending the World Economic Forum in Davos have signalled their intention to set up shop in the SAR.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chan also said on Sunday that he has invited delegations to explore the "tremendous opportunities" offered by Hong Kong, the Greater Bay Area as well as the mainland, during the high-level conference in Switzerland.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Some fintech companies in Europe said they are planning to set up shop in Hong Kong, and use the city as a base for expanding business in Asia," he wrote on his weekly blog.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This year, we will continue to step up our efforts to promote Hong Kong, so that more friends can learn about, make good use of, and contribute to Hong Kong."
  <br>
  <br>
  The finance chief added that the SAR can help connect the mainland with developed economies and emerging markets in the Global South in areas like technology and green finance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan also pointed out that the economic situation in China and the United States, as well as Sino-US ties, were topics of concern among those attending the Davos forum.
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted that Vice Premier Ding Xuexiang had cited facts and data in explaining China's economy to let foreign investors have a more comprehensive understanding of the country's development while strengthening their confidence.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Sunday said the government will set up three more community living rooms this year to improve the quality of life for underprivileged families.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a Facebook post, Lee said two projects -- in Shau Kei Wan and Kowloon City -- have already received funding from the Community Care Fund and are expected to begin operations by mid-2025.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CE said some grassroots families told him that community living rooms have become another home for them, with shared facilities such as kitchens and bathrooms; and offering services like homework assistance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, Lee said the first batch of light public housing units in Yuen Long -- providing 2,150 units -- will be ready for move in, in the first quarter.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that the second phase of the project will be open for applications soon.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The administration is committed to fixing housing problems for grassroots families. We are taking concrete action to help these families find a place to live and feel secure," he wrote.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The head of the government's investment promotion agency on Sunday said her office will focus on bringing in non-local companies that can "create a larger financial impact" in Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  In the past year, InvestHK helped a record 539 non-local companies establish or expand in the SAR, with total investment reaching HK$67.7 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The companies we want to attract are from all industries... We want to put more focus on companies that would create more jobs, and to bring in more direct investments, and create a larger financial impact for Hong Kong," its director-general, Alpha Lau, said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A lot of these [companies] that we brought in... they are looking at the growth of the demographics and the wealth in the region, so they would want to invest more here."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lau said her department would boost promotional efforts in regions like Eastern Europe, Central Asia and Southeast Asia.
  <br>
  <br>
  The director-general added that she would act as a “salesperson” and clarify any misunderstandings that foreign firms might have about the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The concerns that some of them might have, whether because of geopolitics or other reasons -- they might be due to a misunderstanding or a lack of knowledge about Hong Kong. I think facts tell a thousand words," Lau said.

    Flu outbreak to worsen after LNY break: paediatrician

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A University of Hong Kong (HKU) paediatrician on Sunday called on people to stay on the alert, saying the current influenza outbreak may worsen after the Lunar New Year holiday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a radio programme, Mike Kwan from HKU’s Department of Paediatrics and Adolescent Medicine said the flu season is expected to peak next month, and people should get vaccinated as soon as possible, if they haven’t already done so.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Temperatures will drop during the upcoming Lunar New Year [holiday], and there will be more social contact through New Year visits and gatherings," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Some residents will also travel abroad, but they should be aware that many countries across Asia, including Japan and Korea, are currently experiencing flu outbreaks, so everyone needs to be careful."
  <br>
  <br>
  Three severe flu cases involving children were reported last week, with two of them unvaccinated.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kwan said kids who’ve received the flu jab typically show milder symptoms, and require only one to two days of hospitalisation in more serious cases.
  <br>
  <br>
  The expert also urged members of the public to use reliable test kits and maintain good personal hygiene.

<div class="itemFullText">
 North Korea has conducted a strategic cruise missile test, state media KCNA reported on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The country's leader Kim Jong Un oversaw the test on Saturday, according to the report which described it as a test-fire of an "important weapon system."
  <br>
  <br>
  The strategic cruise missiles traveled 1,500 kilometers and flew between 7,507 and 7,511 seconds before hitting their targets, KCNA reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  North Korea's war deterrence means were being "perfected more thoroughly," Kim was quoted as saying, while the leader also vowed to continue efforts to strengthen the military.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Kim Jong Un affirmed that the DPRK will always make strenuous efforts...to perform its important mission and duty for defending sustainable and lasting peace and stability on the basis of more powerfully developed military muscle in the future."
  <br>
  <br>
  The DPRK stands for North Korea's official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
  <br>
  <br>
  The report said the missile test was part of plans to build national defence capabilities against potential enemies in line with changing regional safety circumstances. (Reuters)

<img alt="Cody Gakpo scores Liverpool's fourth goal against Ipswich. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1789155_2_20250126074029.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Cody Gakpo struck twice as Premier League leaders Liverpool thrashed Ipswich 4-1 to maintain their six-point lead over Arsenal, who survived Myles Lewis-Skelly's controversial red card to snatch a 1-0 win at Wolves in the Premier League on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Troubled champions Manchester City recovered from Abdukodir Khusanov's debut disaster to move into fourth place with a vital 3-1 win against top four rivals Chelsea.
  <br>
  <br>
  At Anfield, Liverpool cruised to their second successive league victory thanks to a first half goal-spree.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dominik Szoboszlai's 11th-minute opener fizzed past Ipswich goalkeeper Christian Walton from Ibrahima Konate's assist.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mohamed Salah doubled Liverpool's advantage in the 35th minute with his 23rd goal in all competitions this term.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was also the Egypt forward's 100th Premier League goal at Anfield.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gakpo killed off Ipswich before half-time when he bundled home after Walton parried Szoboszlai's shot in the 44th minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dutch forward netted again in the 66th minute, heading past Walton from Trent Alexander-Arnold's cross.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jacob Greaves' stoppage-time diving header was little consolation for third-bottom Ipswich.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool's 16th win from 22 league games this season keeps them on course for a first English title since 2020.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think about how can I make sure these players play in a style I would love them to play. And they have done that from the start. It's a joy to watch," Liverpool boss Arne Slot said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The quadruple-chasing Reds have a game in hand on second-placed Arsenal, who left it late before keeping the pressure on the leaders.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal, without ill captain Martin Odegaard, had Lewis-Skelly contentiously sent off for tripping Matt Doherty to stop a Wolves counter-attack in the 43rd minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal were furious, protesting that the tackle was too far from goal to warrant a red card.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Premier League Match Centre confirmed on social media that the 18-year-old defender was sent off for "serious foul play".
  <br>
  <br>
  But Wolves were also reduced t0 10 men in the 70th minute when Joao Gomes earned a second booking for a foul on Jurrien Timber.
  <br>
  <br>
  And Italy defender Riccardo Calafiori won it for Arsenal in the 74th minute with a half-volley that went in off the far post.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's obvious that it was very difficult to accept. I leave it to you guys because it's that obvious. You don't need my words. It was so obvious," Arteta told reporters of Lewis-Skelly's dismissal.
  <br>
  <br>
  At the Etihad Stadium, Uzbekistan defender Khusanov, signed from Lens as part of struggling City's January overhaul, made a woeful start when his miscued header allowed Noni Madueke to give Chelsea a second minute lead.
  <br>
  <br>
  But City, who also gave a debut to Egypt forward Omar Marmoush after his move from Eintracht Frankfurt, hit back to equalise with Josko Gvardiol's 42nd minute strike.
  <br>
  <br>
  Erling Haaland chipped out of position Chelsea keeper Robert Sanchez to put City ahead in the 68th minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  Phil Foden sprinted clear to score his sixth goal in his last four league games in the 87th minute as Pep Guardiola's side climbed one point above sixth-placed Chelsea.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was a much-needed win for City, who suffered a damaging loss at Paris Saint-Germain on Wednesday and must beat Club Brugge next week to have a chance of reaching the Champions League play-off round.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dango Ouattara hit a hat-trick as Bournemouth dented Nottingham Forest's top four charge with a 5-0 demolition at the Vitality Stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  Andoni Iraola's side are undefeated in their last 11 league games and up to seventh place after ending third-placed Forest's own impressive run of eight top-flight matches without losing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Justin Kluivert bagged Bournemouth's opener and Ouattara completed a memorable treble before Antoine Semenyo sealed the Cherries' biggest victory this season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alexander Isak starred as fifth-placed Newcastle won 3-1 at bottom of the table Southampton.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jan Bednarek put Southampton ahead but in-form Isak struck twice before Sandro Tonali scored Newcastle's third.
  <br>
  <br>
  Everton boss David Moyes celebrated becoming the third manager to reach 700 Premier League games with a 1-0 win at Brighton secured by Iliman Ndiaye's 42nd minute penalty. (AFP)

<img alt="USA's Madison Keys celebrates after beating Belarus' Aryna Sabalenka during their women's singles final match on day fourteen of the Australian Open. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1789140_1_20250125213922.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Underdog Madison Keys upset Aryna Sabalenka 6-3, 2-6, 7-5 in the Australian Open final on Saturday to win her first Grand Slam crown at the age of 29.
 <br>
  <br>
  The American ended world number one Sabalenka's dream of becoming the first woman for 26 years to win a third successive Melbourne Park singles title.
  <br>
  <br>
  Keys yelled in delight and wiped away tears on securing the title after withstanding a fierce fightback from the Belarusian two-time defending champion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sabalenka, the 2023 and 2024 champion, buried her head in a towel after her 20-match win streak at Melbourne Park was ended.
  <br>
  <br>
  For 19th-seeded Keys it was the culmination of a 15-year journey from teenage prodigy to major winner.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I have wanted this for so long and I have been in one other Grand Slam final and it did not go my way," said an emotional Keys, whose coach Bjorn Fratangelo is also her husband.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I didn't know if I was ever going to get back to this position to try to win a trophy again.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm mostly just really proud of myself to get back to this position, to be able to play the way that I played and finish on such a strong note."
  <br>
  <br>
  The American had been tipped as a future world number one after winning her maiden WTA Tour match at the age of 14.
  <br>
  <br>
  She made her first major semi-final at Melbourne Park 10 years ago as a 19-year-old, but a decade on she can finally call herself a Grand Slam champion.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I made my very first Grand Slam semi-final here in Melbourne," said Keys, the runner-up at the US Open in 2017.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So to now have won my first Grand Slam in the same place means the absolute world to me.
  <br>
  <br>
  "My team believed in me every step of the way. So thank you so much," added Keys, who will now equal her career-high seventh in the world ranking she attained nine years ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They believed in me when I didn't believe in myself and helped me every step of the way. Last year was so tough, with some really bad injuries, I didn't know if I was gonna be able to do it again." (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Palestinian militants and Israel carried out a hostage-prisoner swap on Saturday under a Gaza ceasefire deal, but a last-minute dispute blocked the expected return of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians to devastated northern Gaza.
 <br>
  <br>
  As part of the exchange, the second since the truce took effect last Sunday, four freed Israeli women hostages, all soldiers, arrived home in Israel after more than 15 months of captivity in Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  In exchange, Israel's prison service confirmed that 200 prisoners, whom it called "terrorists", were freed.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Israeli captives, Karina Ariev, Daniella Gilboa and Naama Levy, all aged 20, and Liri Albag, 19, waved, smiled, and gave thumbs up as they were paraded on a stage in Gaza City.
  <br>
  <br>
  Masked and armed militants flanked them during a ceremony watched by hundreds of residents.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Tel Aviv, where a crowd gathered to watch their release on a large TV screen at a plaza known as Hostage Square, there were tears of joy, applause and a loud cheer as Israeli flags waved.
  <br>
  <br>
  After their handover to the Red Cross, Israel's military said the women were transferred back into Israel and "reunited with their parents".
  <br>
  <br>
  Buses carrying the released Palestinians left Ofer prison in the occupied West Bank and Ktziot prison in the Negev desert.
  <br>
  <br>
  As dozens of the former prisoners reached the West Bank city of Ramallah, crowds of Palestinians erupted in joy, raising many of them onto their shoulders.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamas’ political bureau had said on Friday that Palestinians displaced by the war to southern Gaza should have been able to begin returning to the north following Saturday's releases.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Israel on Saturday said it would block such returns until civilian woman hostage Arbel Yehud is released.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said she "was supposed to be released today" but a Hamas source has said Yehud will be "released as part of the third swap set for next Saturday". (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Saturday condemned lawmakers in the United States again for proposing a bill to review sanctions against certain SAR officials, judges and prosecutors, calling it an attempt to intimidate those safeguarding national security.
 <br>
  <br>
  A government spokesperson said in a statement that safeguarding national security is a constitutional duty and an inherent right of sovereign states, while accusing US officials of hypocrisy and using double standards.
  <br>
  <br>
  The statement said that the National Security Law has helped restore social stability and improve the business environment after the “black-clad violence” of 2019.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the Economic Freedom of the World 2024 Annual Report, Hong Kong ranks as the world's freest economies among 165 economies. In the World Competitiveness Yearbook 2024, Hong Kong's ranking improved by two places to fifth globally," the spokesperson said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "However, those US politicians insist on turning a blind eye to all these facts, and even clamour for so-called 'sanctions' against the HKSAR personnel who dutifully safeguard national security.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The HKSAR Government strongly condemns their political grandstanding rife with ill intentions, which have been seen through by all."
  <br>
  <br>
  The spokesperson also said that authorities reject any so-called sanctions and vowed to continue its efforts to safeguard national security, and urged US lawmakers to respect international law and stop interfering in Hong Kong's internal affairs.
  <br>
  <br>
  The spokesman also affirmed that human rights in Hong Kong are constitutionally protected and that law enforcement actions are conducted based on evidence without regard to political beliefs.
  <br>
  <br>
  They added that the judiciary operates independently, ensuring fair trials and adherence to the rule of law.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The judicial system of the HKSAR has always been highly regarded by international communities. Any attempt by any country, organisation, or individual to interfere with the judicial proceedings in the HKSAR by means of political power is a reprehensible act undermining the rule of law of the HKSAR," the spokesperson said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Making any statement with the intent to interfere with or obstruct the course of justice, or engaging in conduct with the same intent, is very likely to constitute the offence of criminal contempt of court or the offence of perverting the course of justice."
  <br>
  <br>
  The statement added that the government remains committed to implementing the National Security Law and upholding the principle of "One Country, Two Systems".

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Saturday visited residents in Oi Man Estate ahead of the Lunar New Year.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lee greeted those who came out to see him at the housing estate in Ho Man Tin, and shook hands with members of the public.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm also here to have a look at the operation of shops. I bought these turnip cakes. I love them and I will share them with my wife. I heard from the shops that business has been good, meeting their expectations," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier in the day, Lee visited the community living room in Hung Hom, and had a meal with people there.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee was accompanied by the Secretary for Home and Youth Affairs, Alice Mak, who pointed out that care teams have an important role to play when it comes to assisting residents.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The chief executive visited the residents with a care team, and learnt about how they provide services to people in the community. We did a year-end clean-up and home repairs for the elderly," Mak said.
  <br>
  <br>
  She added government officials will continue to visit residents, including elderly people, grassroots families and ethnic minorities, at different districts before the Lunar New Year.
  <br>
  <br>
  An 88-year-old resident said she was happy that she was able to shake hands with the Chief Executive and that people have high expectations of him.

<img alt='Pete Hegseth has pledged to focus the military on "lethality" and to bring back "warrior culture" to the Pentagon. File photo: AFP' src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1789114_1_20250125153744.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The US Senate narrowly confirmed former Fox News co-host Pete Hegseth as Pentagon chief on Friday, despite allegations of alcohol abuse, sexual misconduct and other fears about his ability to lead the world's most powerful military.
 <br>
  <br>
  Three Republican senators voted against Donald Trump's pick as secretary of defense, resulting in a 50-50 tie that required JD Vance to cast the deciding ballot – only the second time in history a vice president has had to intervene to save a cabinet nominee.
  <br>
  <br>
  The razor-edged result underscored concerns about Hegseth, who will take over the Pentagon with war raging in Ukraine, the Middle East volatile despite ceasefires in Lebanon and Gaza, and as Trump expands the military's role in security on the US-Mexico border.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 44-year-old is a former Army National Guard officer who until recently worked as a co-host for Fox News – one of Trump's favoured television channels.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hegseth has a combative media personality, fierce loyalty and telegenic looks – common hallmarks in Trump's entourage.
  <br>
  <br>
  Supporters say Hegseth's deployments in Afghanistan and Iraq give him the insight to run the Defense Department better than more experienced officials who would normally be considered for the job.
  <br>
  <br>
  He has pledged to focus the military on "lethality" and to bring back "warrior culture" to the Pentagon.
  <br>
  <br>
  In confirming him, Republicans brushed aside his lack of experience leading an organisation anywhere near the size of the Defense Department – the country's largest employer with some three million personnel.
  <br>
  <br>
  They also approved Hegseth despite allegations of financial mismanagement at veterans' nonprofits where he previously worked, reports of excessive drinking, and allegations that he sexually assaulted a woman in California.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked during his confirmation hearing last week about criticism he has faced, Hegseth said there was a "coordinated smear campaign" against him, and that he is "not a perfect person, but redemption is real".
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has stood by him, telling reporters on Friday: "Pete's a very, very good man."
  <br>
  <br>
  Shortly after he was confirmed, Trump wrote on his Social Truth platform: "Congratulations to Pete Hegseth. He will make a great Secretary of Defense!" (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Train stations and airports across China saw the biggest peak in travellers on Saturday ahead of the Lunar New Year, as millions of people returned home to spend the holidays with their families in an annual migration that is expected to be a record.
 <br>
  <br>
  During the traditional 40-day period that runs before, during and after eight straight days of public holidays, some nine billion interprovincial passenger trips, on all forms of transport combined, are expected to be made, according to Xinhua news agency.
  <br>
  <br>
  Train and air travel are expected to "hit record highs" during this year's migration, Xinhua reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Transport Ministry said it expects 510 million train trips and 90 million air trips during the period.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to the national railway company, which has added thousands of trains to meet demand, Saturday is "the main peak" at stations before the holidays.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said it used data from ticket sales and waiting lists to predict and regulate supply.
  <br>
  <br>
  With many people working and studying in provinces other than their own, there is a large population migration around the New Year holiday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Many factories have already closed for the holiday, with such workers traditionally returning home earlier than the rest of the population.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the Immigration Department has estimated that around eight million people will enter and leave Hong Kong during the Lunar New Year holiday. About seven million people are expected to do so through land border control points.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Year of the Snake, begins on Wednesday. (Additional reporting by AFP)

    'Police sparing no effort to fight violent crimes'

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police commissioner Raymond Siu on Saturday said cracking down on triads and violent crimes are some of his top priorities.
 <br>
  <br>
  Siu made the comments following the Police College's passing-out parade, where reporters asked him about two men who were attacked by a group of knife-wielding men outside a Yuen Long industrial building in the early hours of Wednesday, leaving one dead and another injured.
  <br>
  <br>
  The commissioner said there were a total of 3,313 assault cases in the first eleven months of last year, down from the same period in the previous year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are focusing on these violent cases, and we will spare no effort. In addition to our intelligence collection to cracking down on their illegal activities, we will also use other means, such as cutting off their financial resources," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We also have many intelligence-led operations. In the past, our arrest rate for triad-related crimes was actually close to 40 percent. It is up to us to take the initiative to carry out operations to attack them."
  <br>
  <br>
  Siu also said that the police adopts a zero-tolerance policy towards any illegal or disciplinary violations and will handle such cases seriously.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was referring to the case where police arrested 12 people, including seven officers, on suspicion of money laundering, involving about HK$10.5 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will definitely deal with any colleague who violates laws and discipline. On the other hand, we have many colleagues. Colleagues who violate laws only account for a very small part of the entire police force," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Of course, we think even one case is too many but I hope everyone understands that we maintain public order and prevent and combat crime in the Hong Kong Police Force. Most of our colleagues work very hard, and our low crime rate today is also the result of our colleagues’ hard work."
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Siu said the police force is steadily increasing in size, with the number of applications rising by 46 percent in the current fiscal year, compared to the one before.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said various measures are being implemented, including a recruitment fast-track process at overseas universities.

    Remaining land sales to top HK$4bn: minister

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Development Secretary said on Saturday that she's confident that revenues from land sales in the next two months will top HK$4 billion, but the full year figure might still fall short of the government's original projection in last year's budget forecast.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a radio programme, Bernadette Linn noted that a land parcel in Tai Wai had attracted a significant number of bids on Friday. The government has several land sales scheduled between now and the end of the fiscal year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I believe that the final number will be higher than the number just mentioned, but it may not reach the original estimate of more than HK$30 billion," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think that at this time our real estate market hasn't fully recovered, so that's understandable. It takes time for the market to warm up."
  <br>
  <br>
  She noted that the last budget had projected average annual expenditure of about HK$90 billion on public works projects over the next four years.
  <br>
  <br>
  The development secretary said work is proceeding on these projects, including the Northern Metropolis project, which she believes can meet existing benchmarks.
  <br>
  <br>
  She also said some Northern Metropolis projects are already under construction, and others have entered the planning process, stressing that these works were huge in scale, and would take years to complete.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said the New Territories North New Town will be carried out in phases.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the past, people often heard about new development areas like the Kwu Tung North New Development Area, which is just a few hundred hectares. The entire San Tin Technopole is about 600 hectares. Thus, the development of over 1,000 hectares has to be carried out in phases," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In this case, we'll prioritize about 200 hectares within that area. It will include industrial parks, private housing, and part of a university town. We hope to finalize discussions here so we can start the statutory process early and begin construction in 2028."
  <br>
  <br>
  Linn added that the authorities will adjust the pace of some projects, to ensure that the government's cash flow is managed effectively, such as waterfront beautification and park facilities.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, she noted that the Kau Yi Chau Artifical Islands project has not been abandoned, but time constraints mean it's uncertain whether reclamation work can begin under the current administration.

    Largest Kai Tak drill yet meets expectations: minister

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Transport Secretary Mable Chan said on Saturday that it took just 45 minutes to process spectators after a test event at the Kai Tak Sports Park.
 <br>
  <br>
  The largest drill to date involved some 63,000 people, and was held on Friday evening at three venues at the park.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on an RTHK radio programme, Chan said extra MTR train services had been laid on and ten extra bus routes were arranged to carry 7,300 passengers, which was higher than expected.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Two franchised bus operators arranged the ten special routes... We hope these routes can be used to carry passengers when large-scale events are organised in the future. So it would be similar to the arrangements at the Hong Kong Coliseum and the Hong Kong Stadium," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, Chan said Greater Bay Airlines had let passengers and the government down, after it cancelled more than 100 flights for February and March, blaming factors like delayed aircraft deliveries and inspection requirements. She said it's been asked to submit a report on the problems.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan also said she hoped it's better prepared to deal with increased traffic expected over the Lunar New Year and Easter holidays.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Secretary for Security, Chris Tang, said that a Hong Kong resident who was detained in Myanmar and forced to carry out illegal work will return to the SAR on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  A government task force has been in Thailand investigating reports that a number of Hongkongers had been lured to Southeast Asian countries and held against their will.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a radio programme, Tang said the 29-year-old man had been rescued and taken to Thailand, and was in good shape mentally and physically.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister said the man will return to the city, accompanied by members of the task force.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the government would do its utmost to rescue the remaining ten Hong Kong residents being detained in the region, noting that civil conflicts present challenges to the task force members.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In fact, I have been seeing the Myanmar consulate and also the Cambodian consulate in Hong Kong to discuss how to have the safe return of our Hong Kong people," Tang said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said all parties were committed to doing their utmost to ensure the safe return of the Hong Kong residents.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tang also thanked the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for its support and assistance, allowing the man to reunite with his family before the Lunar New Year.

    Trump Administration freezes foreign aid

<img alt="US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has sent an internal memo effectively freezing most US foreign aid. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1789082_1_20250125091823.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The United States, the world's biggest donor, froze virtually all foreign aid on Friday, making exceptions only for emergency food, and military funding for Israel and Egypt.
 <br>
  <br>
  Secretary of State Marco Rubio sent an internal memo days after President Donald Trump took office vowing an "America First" policy of tightly restricting assistance overseas.
  <br>
  <br>
  "No new funds shall be obligated for new awards or extensions of existing awards until each proposed new award or extension has been reviewed and approved," said the memo to staff seen by AFP.
  <br>
  <br>
  The sweeping order appears to affect everything from development assistance to military aid -- including to Ukraine, which received billions of dollars in weapons under Trump's predecessor Joe Biden as it tries to repel a Russian invasion.
  <br>
  <br>
  The directive also means a pause of at least several months of US funding for PEPFAR, the anti-HIV/AIDS initiative that buys anti-retroviral drugs to treat the disease in developing countries, largely in Africa.
  <br>
  <br>
  Launched under president George W. Bush in 2003, PEPFAR is credited with saving some 26 million lives and until recently enjoyed broad popular support along partisan lines in Washington.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the memo explicitly made exceptions for military assistance to Israel -- whose longstanding major arms packages from the United States have expanded further since the Gaza war -- and Egypt, which has received generous US defense funding since it signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1979.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rubio also made an exception for US contributions to emergency food assistance, which the United States ahs been contributing following crises around the world including in Sudan and Syria.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lawmakers from the rival Democratic Party said that more than 20 million people relied on medication through PEPFAR and 63 million people on US-funded anti-malaria efforts including nets.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For years, Republicans in Congress have decried what they see as a lack of US credibility vis-a-vis countries like China, Russia, and Iran," said Representative Gregory Meeks, the top Democrat on the House Foreign Relations Committee, and Representative Lois Frankel.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Now our credibility is on the line, and it appears we will cut and run from American commitments to our partners around the world," they wrote in a letter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Washington has long leveraged aid as a tool of its foreign policy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meeks and Frankel also noted that foreign assistance is appropriated by Congress and said they would seek its implementation.
  <br>
  <br>
  The memo allows the State Department to make other case-by-case exceptions and temporarily to fund salaries to staff and other administrative expenses.
  <br>
  <br>
  The memo called for an internal review of all foreign assistance within 85 days.
  <br>
  <br>
  In justifying the freeze, Rubio -- who as a senator was a supporter of development assistance -- wrote that it was impossible for the new administration to assess whether existing foreign aid commitments "are not duplicated, are effective and are consistent with President Trump's foreign policy."
  <br>
  <br>
  The United States has long been the world's top donor in dollar terms, although a number of European nations, especially in Scandinavia, give significantly more as a percent of their economies.
  <br>
  <br>
  The United States gave more than US$64 billion in overseas development assistance in 2023, the last year for which records were available, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, which advises industrialised countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump had already on taking office Monday signed an executive order suspending foreign assistance for 90 days, but it was not immediately clear how it would be implemented.
  <br>
  <br>
  Anti-poverty group Oxfam said that Trump was abandoning a longstanding consensus in the United States for foreign assistance.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Humanitarian and development assistance accounts for only around one percent of the federal budget; it saves lives, fights diseases, educates millions of children and reduces poverty," Oxfam America president Abby Maxman said in a statement. (AFP)

    Profit-taking pushes US markets lower

<img alt="Wall Street's major indices opened flat, and ended the session lower. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1789069_1_20250125055434.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US markets concluded a winning week on a tepid note on Friday, retreating following mixed earnings in a move attributed to profit taking.
 <br>
  <br>
  After a flattish open, all three major indices moved into negative territory -- a trend that held the rest of the session.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is normal consolidation or profit taking after a big 2-week rally," said Adam Sarhan of 50 Park Investment.
  <br>
  <br>
  The S&P 500, which closed at a record on Thursday, fell 0.3 percent to 6,101.24.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average also declined 0.3 percent to 44,424.25, while the Nasdaq Composite Index dropped 0.5 percent to 19,954.30.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stocks have gained in recent sessions following benign US inflation data, strong earnings from banks and the new presidency of Donald Trump in Washington.
  <br>
  <br>
  Markets have thus far welcomed his growth-oriented agenda and largely shrugged off his threats of tariffs.
  <br>

  Sarhan said the market was poised for a pause given the heavy calendar next week, which includes a Federal Reserve monetary policy decision and earnings from tech giants and other big companies.

  <br>
  Among individual companies, Facebook parent Meta gained 3.2 percent after CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the company would invest up to US$65 billion in 2025 in new artificial intelligence infrastructure, including a datacentre "so large it would cover a significant part of Manhattan."
  <br>
  <br>
  Boeing dropped 1.4 percent after announcing it will incur a bigger than expected loss in the fourth quarter due mainly to costs connected to a lengthy labour strike last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Others with big earnings-related moves included American Express, down 1.4 percent; CSX, down 5.8 percent; and Texas Instruments, down 13.1 percent. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Foreign Minister Wang Yi spoke with United States Secretary of State Marco Rubio by telephone on Friday, saying both sides should find the right way to get along in the new era.
 <br>
  <br>
  This is the first known contact between the two top diplomats since Donald Trump was sworn in as US president on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang said President Xi Jinping and his US counterpart had an important discussion last Friday, pointing out the direction and setting the tone for bilateral relations.
  <br>
  <br>
  The foreign minister said both sides should follow through on the important consensus reached by the two leaders.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang said Beijing and Washington should maintain communication, manage differences, expand cooperation based on the principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation, and promote the stable, healthy and sustainable development of China-US ties.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang also said China will never allow Taiwan to be separated from the motherland.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The United States has made a solemn commitment to pursue the one-China policy in the three Sino-US joint communiques and must not break its promise,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rubio, for his part, said Washington is willing to hold open discussions with Beijing, and that the US opposes "Taiwan independence". (Xinhua and agencies)

<img alt="Eric Chan, centre, said it's too early to declare that the Kai Tak Sports Park will officially open on March 1. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1789051_1_20250124230739.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government said the largest drill to date was successfully held at Kai Tak Sports Park on Friday evening, involving some 63,000 people.
 <br>
  <br>
  Most of the participants were government workers or people from community groups.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two-hour drills were held at three venues -- the main stadium, the Kai Tak Arena and the youth sports ground, as officials tested out arrangements with the first two having capacity crowds.
  <br>
  <br>
  At the 50,000-seater main stadium, bands from the disciplined forces put on a concert, as different scenarios, including simulated security issues, were tested.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials carried out evacuation drills as well as having spectators leave in a regular manner at the other two venues.
  <br>
  <br>
  A number of senior officials, including Chief Secretary for Administration Eric Chan, culture, sports and tourism minister Rosanna Law and civil service chief Ingrid Yeung were on hand to observe the proceedings.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said the park is scheduled to open sometime in March, but added reports saying that March 1 is the official opening day might be premature.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Because we have many stress tests in the future - we have two large-scale stress tests [next month], so up to now, depending on the results of the tests, I think we cannot confirm the opening date," he told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  As part of the tests, all participants left the venues at around the same time as they picked their own mode of transport.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities recorded crowd control and transport data for analysis.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan added the scheduling of events in future should ensure that a capacity crowd at the three venues would not leave the park at the same time.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he said authorities mapped out worst-case scenarios to train up the ability of different parties to react to emergencies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Several participants told RTHK they were happy with the experience, saying signs giving directions were good and the sound system was solid.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Two men were charged on Friday with murdering a man in Yuen Long in the early hours of Wednesday, as well as wounding another.
 <br>
  <br>
  Police said the pair, 19 and 27, are due to appear in Fanling Court on Saturday. The 27-year-old suspect also faces a charge of possessing dangerous drugs.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two defendants were among six men arrested so far over the death of the 24-year-old man.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officers said two suspects, 23 and 26, were arrested in Tin Shui Wai on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The incident took place outside an industrial building on Wang Yip Street West, when two men were attacked by a group of knife-wielding men.
  <br>
  <br>
  One of them died and the other was conscious when he was taken to hospital.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Defending champion Jannik Sinner overcame some third-set cramping and beat Ben Shelton 7-6 (2), 6-2, 6-2 on Friday to return to the Australian Open final as he pursues a third Grand Slam title.
 <br>
  <br>
  The No.1-ranked Sinner, a 23-year-old from Italy, fell behind in the opening set and twice was a point from losing it when Shelton served at 6-5. But Sinner broke there, then dominated the ensuing tiebreaker, and broke again to begin the second set.
  <br>
  <br>
  The only trouble Sinner ran into the rest of the way was when he clutched at his left hamstring, and then his right thigh, in the third set. He was treated by a trainer, who massaged both of Sinner's legs during changeovers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sinner won his first major title at Melbourne Park a year ago, then grabbed his second one at the US Open in September.
  <br>
  <br>
  He'll try to add to that total when he faces No. 2 Alexander Zverev on Sunday for the championship.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zverev advanced when Novak Djokovic quit after one set of their semifinal on Friday because of a leg injury. (AP)

<img alt="Bank of Japan chief Kazuo Ueda told a news conference that the pace and timing of future hikes was yet to be determined. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1789025_1_20250124192649.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Bank of Japan (BoJ) raised interest rates on Friday to their highest in 17 years and signalled more hikes to come, sending the yen higher against the greenback.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 25-basis-point rise to 0.5 percent comes as data indicated the Japanese economy was developing in line with BoJ expectations and followed another bumper inflation reading.
  <br>
  <br>
  The move, which leaves borrowing costs at the highest since 2008, was also underpinned by "steadily" rising wages and financial markets being "stable on the whole", the BoJ said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Japan's economic activity and prices have been developing generally in line with the Bank's outlook, and the likelihood of realising the outlook has been rising," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  If its outlook is met, "the bank will accordingly continue to raise the policy interest rate and adjust the degree of monetary accommodation," it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  BoJ chief Kazuo Ueda told a news conference the pace and timing of future hikes was yet to be determined.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We would like to make a decision after we have studied the impact of this rate hike," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The hawkish comments sent the yen up as much as 0.7 percent against the US dollar to 154.84 yen.
  <br>
  <br>
  Even as other central banks have raised borrowing costs in recent years -- and started cutting again in 2024 -- the BoJ has remained an outlier.
  <br>
  <br>
  But it concluded last March that Japan's "lost decades" of economic stagnation and static, or falling prices were over, finally lifting rates above zero.
  <br>
  <br>
  That increase was followed by another in July that caught investors off guard and sparked turmoil in global equity and currency markets.
  <br>
  <br>
  This time Ueda prepared markets for an increase -- some 75 percent of economists expected one -- and the reaction was more muted on Friday. (AFP)

    LCSD lowers age limit to 8 at licensed billiard halls

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Licensed billiard establishments that meet specific criteria can apply to let people as young as eight years old enter these premises, as a means of promoting the sport's development in Hong Kong, said the Leisure and Cultural Services Department (LCSD).
 <br>
  <br>
  Currently, only those aged 16 or above are allowed entry.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other relaxations include allowing young patrons to stay until 11pm, compared with 8pm right now, and they could enter as early as 7am.
  <br>
  <br>
  Those in school uniforms will also be permitted to enter.
  <br>
  <br>
  The department said licensed billiard establishments hoping to accept younger patrons can make applications from February 25.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vincent Law, chairman of the Billiard Sports Council of Hong Kong China (HKBSCC), said he hopes the department can clearly lay out the specific requirements that billiard halls need to take.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The details of the requirements are yet to be announced, but according to my understanding, you have to have certain security facilities implemented in the premises, for example, maybe CCTV. Also you need certain tools and facilities which are suitable for use by children," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "During some sessions, such as training sessions and tournaments, there needs to be some coach who is qualified to coach billiard sports."
  <br>
  <br>
  Law also said that he hopes to see all restrictions removed in the long run.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is only a first step because I think the ultimate objective is to completely remove all restrictions on billiard establishments because we are just like any other sports venue," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Why should there be a restriction on the age of the person who uses the facilities?"
  <br>
  <br>
  He added he hopes to see the LCSD promote the scheme to the around 50 currently licensed billiard halls, noting that establishment owners will have to assess the administrative work and costs before considering to apply.

    'Beetroot salad not ruled out in poisoning cases'

<img alt="Health officials say they can't rule out that a beetroot salad gave passengers on two Cathay flights food poisoning earlier this month. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1789003_1_20250124174253.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Health officials said on Friday that they could not rule out that beetroot salad contaminated with a bacterium served on board was responsible for the suspected food poisoning suffered by dozens of passengers of two Cathay Pacific flights arriving from Nepal this month.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) said its investigation found that 43 passengers, aged between 11 and 75, developed food poisoning symptoms such as vomiting, nausea, abdominal pain and diarrhoea, about 10 to 60 minutes after having meals on the CX640 flights from Kathmandul on January 8 and 9.
  <br>
  <br>
  None of the passengers had to be taken to hospital, the CHP said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Stool samples from two patients tested positive for Staphylococcus aureus. The overall clinical symptoms and incubation period of the affected persons were compatible with food poisoning caused by Staphylococcus aureus," the centre said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  It added that the beetroot salad was the only food served on board that was likely to have caused such poisoning, from a statistical standpoint.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, tests on samples taken from the aircraft showed the level of Staphylococcus aureus in the salad did not exceed food safety standards.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CHP said the food was supplied exclusively to Cathay for its flights from Kathmandu since the start of the month and the factory concerned was later asked to stop providing it. Inspections of the factory found the way the food was being handled might have increased the risk of contamination.
  <br>
  <br>
  In response, Cathay acknowledged the findings but stressed that no signs of contamination were found in the samples it checked in its own lab.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Cathay Pacific confirms that this salad is not served on any of our other flights. Aside from these two cases, there have not been any similar instances of customers experiencing symptoms of suspected food poisoning on any of our recent flights," it said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The airline apologised again to passengers affected and added that it has reinforced food-handling processes and staff training on hygiene.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Record high winds from Storm Eowyn battered Ireland and Northern Ireland on Friday, leaving 560,000 homes and businesses without power and forcing the cancellation of hundreds of flights and the closure of schools and public transport.
 <br>
  <br>
  Officials had warned the storm was set to be one of the most dangerous they have faced and told people to stay indoors. The Irish weather agency, Met Eireann, said a gust of 182 kilometres per hour overnight at Mace Head in County Galway provisionally broke an 80-year record.
  <br>
  <br>
  ESB Networks, which provides energy for the whole of Ireland, said "unprecedented" damage to its network had led to power outages affecting 560,000 homes, farms and businesses. It expected significant outages as the storm tracks northwards.

  <br>
  The power company said ahead of the storm that it could take up to nine days to restore power for some customers.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 110 scheduled departures and 110 arrivals at Dublin airport were cancelled, the airport said, adding that further cancellations and delays were possible.
  <br>
  <br>
  All schools in Ireland and Northern Ireland were closed on Friday and public transport will not run in Ireland while a red wind warning remains in place.
  <br>
  <br>
  The red warning - the highest alert level - was in place for the entire country for the first time since Storm Ophelia in 2017, which killed three people.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is due to be lifted for most of Ireland at 1100 GMT and in British-ruled Northern Ireland at 1400.
  <br>
  <br>
  A red warning is also in place for southwestern and central areas of Scotland from 10am until 5pm GMT, the UK Met Office said, warning people to expect flying debris resulting in danger to life, damage to buildings with roofs blown off and the closure of roads and bridges.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dozens of flights from airports at Edinburgh and Glasgow were cancelled, and National Rail advised people living across Scotland and parts of northern England not to travel on Friday. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Spectators booed an injured Novak Djokovic as he left the court in Rod Laver Arena after quitting one set into his Australian Open semifinal against Alexander Zverev on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Dealing with a what he said was a torn muscle, Djokovic lost the opener 7-6 (5) when he put a forehand volley into the net, then began shaking his head and immediately walked over to shake Zverev's hand. The 37-year-old Djokovic packed up his equipment and walked off toward the locker room, pausing to respond to the jeers by giving two thumbs-up.
  <br>
  <br>
  At his news conference, Djokovic said the pain in his taped left leg was “getting worse and worse.” He hurt it during his quarterfinal victory over Carlos Alcaraz on Tuesday night.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I knew," Djokovic said, "even if I won the first set, it was going to be a huge uphill battle for me.”
  <br>
  <br>
  He was bidding for an 11th championship at the Australian Open and record 25th Grand Slam title overall.
  <br>
  <br>
  But this is the second time in the past four major tournaments he was unable to finish because of an injury: He withdrew from last year's French Open before the quarterfinals because he tore the meniscus in his right knee during a match.
  <br>
  <br>
  Djokovic underwent surgery in Paris and, less than two months later, reached the final at Wimbledon, then won a gold medal for Serbia at the Paris Olympics.
  <br>
  <br>
  The No. 2-seeded Zverev reached his first title match at Melbourne Park and on Sunday will face the winner of Friday’s second semifinal between No. 1 Jannik Sinner of Italy, the defending champion, and No. 21 Ben Shelton of the United States. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Home prices fell 7.1 percent in 2024, official figures showed on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  It was the third year in a row of declining prices, which have dropped 27 percent since the start of 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eddie Kwok, executive director of CBRE Hong Kong’s valuation and advisory services, said price increases could be on the cards after Lunar New Year and the financial secretary's budget speech next month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kwok said major banks have lowered their prime rates since the US Federal Reserve's interest rate cut last September and since then prices have been stabilising.
  <br>
  <br>
  Martin Wong, head of research and consultancy for Greater China at Knight Frank, said prices could rebound by up to five percent this year, with most of the increase likely to come in the second half.
  <br>
  <br>
  Figures from the Rating and Valuation Department also showed that prices fell 0.7 percent in December from the month before, ending a two-month increase.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A worker died after falling to the ground at a construction site on Tsung Tau Ha Road in Fo Tan.
 <br>
  <br>
  Police said they received a report at around 1pm on Friday that a man fell from a height of between three and four metres.
  <br>
  <br>
  Emergency personnel were called to scene where the man was certified dead.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Labour Department said officers were sent to investigate the cause of the incident.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chiu Kin-keung, the vice chairman of the Hong Kong Construction Industry Employees General Union, said the deceased welding worker was on a spider lift platform before the fall.
  <br>
  <br>
  He believed that a fractured steel beam struck the platform, causing it and the worker to fall.
  <br>
  <br>
  The worker had his safety harness attached to the platform but that also broke, Chiu said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the Association for the Rights of Industrial Accident Victims said it would be providing support to the family of the man killed.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said the accident marked at least the 10th fatal fall since the beginning of last year.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Federation of Trade Unions (FTU) on Friday urged the government to step up efforts to promote Hong Kong’s tourist spots and nurture more talent in the sector.
 <br>
  <br>
  At a press conference, the party called for more religious and architectural tours to showcase the city's beauty beyond Victoria Harbour.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Apart from the traditional shopping theme that we are quite well-recognised in the international arena, we would also like international tourists to know about how Hong Kong is naturally beautiful," said FTU lawmaker Joephy Chan.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Apart from Victoria Harbour, of course, there are also different sea views that you can have in Hong Kong. We need to further elaborate on that on different social [media] platforms as well."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan suggested journeys to temples, mosques and landmarks such as Sun Yat Sen Memorial Park to promote religious diversity and peace education.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another FTU lawmaker, Dennis Leung, highlighted the need for more training for tour guides and the recruitment of retirees into the role.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Because we have some sites in New Territories where the younger generation do not understand the history, so we hope that the government can gather all the village inhabitants or some retired people to help to promote tourism, to act as a guide to help the visitors to know more about the culture in this visiting site," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The party also urged officials to improve accessibility to tourist spots by adding more bus routes.

    Tourists want to see pandas all over Hong Kong: DAB

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 DAB lawmakers on Friday said each district should have panda-themed events and decorations to encourage tourists to explore different places across Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  The party said it has submitted various suggestions to the government's Working Group on Developing Tourist Hotspots, which was established last year to come up with ways to revitalise the tourism industry.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lawmaker Vincent Cheng said Hong Kong should promote the concept of "panda is everywhere" on top of "tourism is everywhere".
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's definitely a good chance for businesses to have a showcase everywhere, in different districts," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A lot of visitors, they're not only visiting the places, they also would like to see panda decorations everywhere in Hong Kong. We can also dress them up. Like in Sham Shui Po, they can dress up like a Sham Shui Po special edition for the panda as well."
  <br>
  <br>
  Other suggestions the party made included a walking tour in Central and Western for tourists to visit temples and taste food and drink, including sugarcane juice and dim sum.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the legislators urged the authorities to set up a one-stop platform to enable event organisers to reach out to different government departments in a more simple way.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Friday said the city's financial system remains robust, despite intensified geopolitical risks causing greater volatility in regional and global markets.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chan made the remark during a discussion on "stemming financial fragmentation", at the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting in Davos.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also said Hong Kong "steadfastly" upholds the linked exchange rate system, or the currency peg, and that recent surveys showed global investors were optimistic about the SAR's business outlook.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan added that the city has undergone significant transformations in the stock markets, wealth management and digital asset sectors, as he also stressed that China's economy is steadily growing and achieving high-quality development.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, the finance minister continued to promote green finance projects, as well as "impact investments", or funds aimed at generating social or environmental effects.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan held talks on trade with some of his global counterparts, including the investment minister of Saudi Arabia, Khalid Al-Falih, and the finance chief of Egypt, Ahmed Kouchouk. Chan invited the ministers to visit the SAR as part of efforts to deepen ties with the Global South.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also met Jenny Johnson, CEO of investment firm Franklin Templeton, to discuss how to expand the company's business in the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan is due to return to Hong Kong on Saturday.

    'Blatantly unconstitutional' birthright order blocked

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A federal judge blocked Donald Trump's attempt to restrict birthright citizenship in the United States on Thursday as liberal states scored their first victory against the new president's hardline agenda.
 <br>
  <br>
  The ruling imposes a 14-day stay on the enforcement of one of the most controversial executive orders Trump signed in the hours after he was sworn into office for a second term.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is a blatantly unconstitutional order," US District Judge John Coughenour was reported as saying during the hearing in Washington state.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I've been on the bench for over four decades, I can't remember another case where the question presented is as clear as this one is," said Coughenour, who was appointed by a Republican president, Ronald Reagan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump told reporters his administration would "obviously" appeal the ruling, while the Department of Justice said it would defend the executive order, which a spokesman said "correctly interprets" the US Constitution.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We look forward to presenting a full merits argument to the court and to the American people, who are desperate to see our nation's laws enforced," the spokesman said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Birthright citizenship is enshrined in the US Constitution under the 14th Amendment which decrees that anyone born on US soil is a citizen.
  <br>
  <br>
  It says, in part: "All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's order was premised on the idea that anyone in the United States illegally, or on a visa, was not "subject to the jurisdiction" of the country, and therefore excluded from this category.
  <br>
  <br>
  An incredulous Coughenour chided Justice Department attorney Brett Shumate over his assertion that Trump's order was constitutional.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Frankly, I have difficulty understanding how a member of the bar could state unequivocally that this is a constitutional order," Coughenour said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It just boggles my mind."
  <br>
  <br>
  The ruling comes after a flurry of lawsuits filed by 22 states, two cities and numerous civil rights groups.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was hailed by states that took part in the legal actions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "No president can change the constitution on a whim and today's decision affirms that," Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ruling is "the first of many wins to come as my office fights instances of executive overreach and any illegal actions the new administration may take."
  <br>
  <br>
  Washington Attorney General Nick Brown said Trump's order was "un-American."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Birthright citizenship makes clear that citizenship cannot be conditioned on one's race, ethnicity or where their parents came from," he said after the ruling.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's the law of our nation, recognised by generations of jurists, lawmakers and presidents, until President Trump's illegal action."
  <br>
  <br>
  The legal challenge was no surprise, and Trump had acknowledged it was likely when he signed the order.
  <br>
  <br>
  He has repeatedly – and wrongly – asserted that the United States is the only country in the world with birthright citizenship; in fact more than 30 others also have it, including Canada and Mexico. (AFP)

 A Hong Kong woman on holiday in Japan has died after being hit by a train.
 <br>
  <br>
  Japanese media reports said the woman, 61, was standing on tracks near Otaru, Hokkaido on Thursday and was taking photos of the sea when she was struck by the train.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kyodo News Agency cited police as saying the woman's husband was standing nearby at the time but was not injured.
  <br>
  <br>
  The accident caused the suspension of almost 20 train services, including some to the region's main airport, railway officials said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Chinese Consulate in Sapporo and the Immigration Department in Hong Kong both said they were ready to help the woman's family if assistance was required.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump said his conversation with President Xi Jinping last week was friendly, and he thought he could reach a trade deal with China.
 <br>
  <br>
  The leaders of the world's two biggest economies discussed issues including TikTok, trade and Taiwan in a phone call before Trump took office on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since taking office, Trump has spoken about a 10 percent punitive duty on Chinese imports. He has also threatened tariffs against the European Union, Mexico and Canada.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It went fine. It was a good, friendly conversation," Trump said of his call with President Xi in an interview with Fox News aired on Thursday evening.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I can do that," Trump said when asked if he could make a deal with China over fair trade practices.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said he would rather not use tariffs against China but called tariffs a "tremendous power."
  <br>
  <br>
  "But we have one very big power over China, and that's tariffs, and they don't want them, and I'd rather not have to use it, but it's a tremendous power over China," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing has vowed to defend its national interests over Trump's threat to impose the duty, with the Foreign Ministry saying there are no winners in a trade or tariff war. (Reuters and agencies)

    'Travel agencies should be flexible in giving refund'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Consumer Council has called on travel agencies to be flexible in refunding passengers affected by the cancellation of flights at Greater Bay Airlines.
 <br>
  <br>
  The low-cost carrier earlier announced the cancellation of 128 flights in February and March, while stressing that Lunar New Year services won't be affected.
  <br>
  <br>
  The consumer watchdog had received six complaints as of Thursday night, involving about HK$14,000 in total.
  <br>
  <br>
  Its chief executive Gilly Wong told an RTHK radio programme on Friday that travel agencies should maintain close contact with the airline to offer refunds to passengers as soon as possible.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In principle, they (agencies) should only arrange a refund after receiving the money [from the airline]. But they can exercise discretion and compassion when handling individual cases," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong pointed out that some agencies had told passengers it could take months for them to get their money back, but said in some cases the refund should arrive earlier.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If they only stick to the rulebook, that leads to customer dissatisfaction and complaints. It's not an ideal approach in terms of their reputation."
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong also said Greater Bay Airlines should not impose surcharges for passengers opting for other destinations.
  <br>
  <br>
  She added that the airline should offer updates and reach out to consumers quickly.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 NBA superstars LeBron James and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander were named among the starters for next month's NBA All-Star Game.
 <br>
  <br>
  Oklahoma City star Gilgeous-Alexander and Los Angeles Lakers icon James were included in the Western Conference's five starters along with Golden State's Stephen Curry, Phoenix's Kevin Durant and Denver's Nikola Jokić.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gilgeous-Alexander has been in blistering form for the Oklahoma City Thunder this season, scoring a career-high 54 points in his most recent outing.
  <br>
  <br>
  It will be the 26-year-old Gilgeous-Alexander's third All-Star selection.
  <br>
  <br>
  James, meanwhile, will be making his 21st All-Star Game – all of them as a starter.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Eastern Conference starters included the Boston Celtics' Jayson Tatum and two-time MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo of the Milwaukee Bucks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cleveland's Donovan Mitchell earns his sixth All-Star appearance, with the starters completed by two New York Knicks players – Jalen Brunson and Karl-Anthony Towns.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 2025 All-Star weekend will take place in San Francisco from February 14 to 16. (AFP)

    Wembanyama delights Paris crowd, leads Spurs to win
   </title>

<img alt="" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1788921_1_20250124073743.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Victor Wembanyama delighted his home crowd in Paris by scoring 30 points and grabbing 11 rebounds as he led the San Antonio Spurs to a 140-110 rout of the Indiana Pacers.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 21-year-old centre took control of the game in a third-quarter performance when the Spurs roared into a 23-point lead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wembanyama was playing in the French league a year and a half ago before his selection as the number one pick in the 2023 draft set him on the path to global stardom.
  <br>
  <br>
  Returning to France with the Spurs for the first time, Wembanyama's first block of the game brought roars from the 15,935 crowd at a sold-out the Bercy Arena, where he helped France win the men's basketball silver medal at the Paris Olympics last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  There was an even bigger cheer when he scored his first points 4 minutes into the game from a shot from the lane.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That was one of the matches that was closest to my heart," Wembanyama said. "And in terms of pure performance, it's in the top five."
  <br>
  <br>
  "It means everything. It's crazy to have the public like that – tonight was different," he added. "It's a different kind of support that the crowd brings and we tried to use the circumstances to our advantage and tonight was an easy night to use it to our advantage."
  <br>
  <br>
  The first of two regular-season games in the French capital this week was watched by a host of former NBA stars including French four-time champion Tony Parker, his former San Antonio teammates Manu Ginobili and David Robinson, as well as Pau Gasol and the legendary Oscar Robertson.
  <br>
  <br>
  Paris Saint-Germain footballers Ousmane Dembele and Achraf Hakimi and Super Bowl winner Odell Beckham Jr. were also on hand to enjoy the action.
  <br>
  <br>
  They saw Wembanyama drive Spurs to a 103-80 lead in the third quarter with three rejections in a row, two assists and a thunderous dunk, bringing the crowd to the feet to chant "MVP, MVP, MVP".
  <br>
  <br>
  His teammate Devin Vassell contributed 25 points for the Spurs, who could afford to bench Wembanyama and his fellow starters with five minutes remaining. They moved to a 20-22 record for the season and stay in contention for the play-in tournament.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bennedict Mathurin top-scored for the Pacers with 24 points.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Spurs meet the Pacers again on the same court on Saturday. (AFP)

<img alt="Tottenham are sixth in the table after their victory over Hoffenheim. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1788918_2_20250124070744.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Manchester United and Tottenham both enjoyed some much needed respite from their Premier League woes with victories in the Europa League.
 <br>
  <br>
  Bruno Fernandes conjured up the injury time winner in United's 2-1 defeat of Scottish giants Rangers, while in Germany Son Heung-min scored twice in a 3-2 win for Spurs at Hoffenheim.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both English teams closed in on direct qualification to the last 16.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Red Devils looked set to suffer more disappointment at Old Trafford when Cyriel Dessers levelled for an injury-ravaged Rangers in the 88th minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Scottish side had fallen behind when goalkeeper Jack Butland punched the ball into his own net early in the second half.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fernandes spared United's blushes and possibly the playoff round by blasting home in stoppage time.
  <br>
  <br>
  United were earlier controversially denied a goal when Matthijs de Ligt's towering header was ruled out for a foul on Robin Propper and VAR did not intervene.
  <br>
  <br>
  United move up to fourth in the table with one match of the league phase remaining.
  <br>
  <br>
  The top eight will qualify directly for the last 16, which may now be beyond Rangers who slip to 13th.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Today was important to get the win because we want to get through in the Europa League, we want to go to the final," said Fernandes. "We want to be in the first eight so we avoid playing two more games."
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Spurs are sixth in the revamped league phase format topped by Lazio, who beat Real Sociedad 3-1 to ensure their ticket to the knock out stages.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eintracht Frankfurt, who beat Ferencvaros 2-0, are placed second.
  <br>
  <br>
  Goals from Son and James Maddison took some of the heat off Spurs manager Ange Postecoglou whose team have lost seven of their last nine Premier League games.
  <br>
  <br>
  Postecoglou had pledged to win silverware for the first time for the London side since 2008 in his second season as boss.
  <br>
  <br>
  With Spurs struggling in 15th behind Liverpool at home that leaves the Europa League, FA Cup and League Cup to fulfil his promise.
  <br>
  <br>
  A win against Swedish outfit Elfsborg in their closing league phase game at home next week will give them an automatic ticket to the next round as one of the top eight finishers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I told them to enjoy it," Postecoglou said. "Winning away in Europe, it's a significant victory for us and gives us a good foothold to get into those top eight spots which will give us a week off."
  <br>
  <br>
  Tottenham charged out of the stalls with Maddison receiving a pinpoint pass from Pedro Porro to fire the ball past keeper Oliver Baumann and into the roof of the net to give Spurs the perfect start after just four minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Richarlison, making only his second start of the campaign, could have doubled the advantage but the Brazilian's shot went straight to Baumann.
  <br>
  <br>
  Attacking at will Spurs were looking to put the game to bed against their out of sorts German hosts.
  <br>
  <br>
  And on 22 minutes Maddison turned provider to set up Son whose shot deflected off a defender, the ball flying over Baumann and into the far corner.
  <br>
  <br>
  The big problem for Spurs given their leaky defence was to hold onto their superiority.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brandon Austin started in goal for them, two weeks after making his debut, and was called on to make a full-stretch save to deny Tom Bischof as half-time beckoned.
  <br>
  <br>
  With the wind in their sails Hoffenheim halved their deficit minutes later when Spurs got caught on the counter, Anton Stach toeing the ball past Austin.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Son's angled shot with 13 minutes left on the clock settled the issue, although David Mokwa's goal two minutes from normal time meant another nerve-jangling ending for Tottenham's long-suffering supporters. (AFP)
