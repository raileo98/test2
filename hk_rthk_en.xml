<div class="itemFullText">
 Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Monday called for "real, lasting peace" this year as European leaders gathered for a summit in Kyiv on the third anniversary of the war in Ukraine.
 <br>
  <br>
  "We have to win peace through strength and wisdom and unity," Zelensky told Ukraine's backers in Kyiv.
  <br>
  <br>
  He vowed at a press conference later that Russia "will not win".
  <br>
  <br>
  EU Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen also warned that despite opening talks with the United States on how to end the conflict, Vladimir Putin was not about to back down.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Putin is trying harder than ever to win this war on the ground. His goal remains Ukraine's capitulation," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Russia said it would halt the attack only if a deal could be reached that "suits" its interests, and accused Europe of wanting to prolong the fighting.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier on Monday, President Xi Jinping held a phone conversation with Putin and said China is happy to see efforts by Moscow and others to defuse the crisis in Ukraine, adding that China and Russia will support each other and achieve common development. (AFP)

    Automotive sector welcomes govt's child car seat rule

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An automotive sector representative on Tuesday welcomed the rule mandating children under eight to be in a safety seat or strapped in with some other restraining device, saying it provides much needed protection for children travelling in private cars.
 <br>
  <br>
  Peter Goh, the CEO of the Hong Kong, China Automobile Association says there is currently no mandatory requirement for youngsters under the age of three to be restrained in any way in a car.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This amendment actually makes it compulsory for all children up to the age of eight to use a [child car seat or restraint of some kind]," he told RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Now the rule is actually trying to make it better for child safety to ensure that all children are adequately protected while travelling in vehicles," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Goh added that the government is trying to refine the rules and to bring Hong Kong more in line with international regulations.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, Goh pointed out that the rule will not apply to children travelling on public transport.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Unfortunately, public transport – buses and taxis – is generally exempted from this mandatory rule because of practical and logistic challenges."
  <br>
  <br>
  People caught flouting the regulation once it comes into effect in November will risk a fine of HK$230, while "serious cases" could lead to court action and penalties as high as HK$2,000.

<div class="itemFullText">
 World MotoGP champion Jorge Martin will miss the first race of the season this weekend in Thailand after sustaining several fractures in a fall, his Aprilia team announced.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Spaniard, who previously suffered several fractures when he crashed his Aprilia during pre-season testing in Malaysia, has a number of breaks in his left hand and also in his heel.
  <br>
  <br>
  He is due to undergo surgery in Barcelona on Tuesday and "will miss the Thailand Grand Prix", the Italian manufacturer said in a statement. "Recovery times will be determined after the surgery."
  <br>
  <br>
  The latest injury is unrelated to the Malaysia crash at the start of February when he broke his right hand and foot after being thrown off his Aprilia at turn two of the Sepang circuit, having emerged unscathed from a crash earlier in the day.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 27-year-old, who has already undergone successful surgery on his right hand, made the move to Aprilia after winning the 2024 championship for Pramac Ducati.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lorenzo Savadori will substitute for the reigning world champion in Thailand. (AFP)

    Canada, Mexico tariffs are going forward: Trump

<img alt="US President Donald Trump wants to impose 25 percent tariffs on Canada and Mexico as soon as March 4. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1793020_1_20250225073658.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump said on Monday that his tariffs on Canada and Mexico are starting next month, ending a month-long suspension on the planned import taxes that could potentially hurt economic growth and worsen inflation.
 <br>
  <br>
  “We’re on time with the tariffs, and it seems like that’s moving along very rapidly,” he said at a White House news conference with French President Emmanuel Macron.
  <br>
  <br>
  While Trump was answering a specific question about the taxes to be charged on America's two largest trading partners, the US president also stressed more broadly that his intended “reciprocal” tariffs were on schedule to begin as soon as April.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The tariffs are going forward on time, on schedule,” Trump said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has claimed that other countries charge unfair import taxes that have come at the expense of domestic manufacturing and jobs.
  <br>
  <br>
  His near constant threats of tariffs have already raised concerns among businesses and consumers about an economic slowdown and accelerating inflation.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Trump claims that the import taxes would ultimately generate revenues to reduce the federal budget deficit and new jobs for workers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Still, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum appeared confident on Monday that her administration would reach agreements with the US government before the deadline set by Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We would need to be reaching important agreements this Friday,” Sheinbaum told reporters before Trump's remarks.
  <br>
  <br>
  In high-level discussions between both governments, Mexico has insisted that the US also take a hard look at the drug distribution and consumption in its own country rather than pointing only at production in Mexico, Sheinbaum said. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 US stocks drifted lower on Monday to compound their sharp losses from last week .
 <br>
  <br>
  The S&P 500 dipped 0.5 per cent to 5,983 after flipping between small gains and losses several times through the day. The relatively modest moves followed its 1.7 per cent tumble on Friday, which came after several weaker-than-expected reports on the US economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow added 0.1 per cent to 43.461, while the Nasdaq composite fell 1.2 per cent to 19,286.
  <br>
  <br>
  Berkshire Hathaway climbed 4.1 per cent for one of the market’s bigger gains after Warren Buffett’s company reported a jumped in operating profits for the latest quarter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Starbucks rose 1.3 per cent after saying it would cut 1,100 corporate jobs and leave several hundred more positions unfilled as new CEO Brian Niccol tries to make it a leaner operation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Big US companies have broadly been reporting better profits for the last three months of 2024 than analysts expected, which is one of the main reasons the S&P 500 set a record before sliding at the end of last week. The pace of reports will slow this week, but several potentially market-moving updates are still on deck.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chief among them is Nvidia, the company that’s become one of Wall Street’s most influential stocks because of what had been nearly insatiable demand for its chips.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wednesday will be the company’s first profit report since a Chinese upstart, DeepSeek, upended the artificial-intelligence industry by saying it developed a large language model that can compete with big US rivals without having to use the top-flight, most expensive chips. (AP)

<img alt="New Zealand’s Rachin Ravindra celebrates after scoring a century against Bangladesh. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1793008_1_20250225053556.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Rachin Ravindra struck a superb 112 to lead New Zealand into the Champions Trophy semi-finals with a five-wicket win over Bangladesh and in turn dump hosts Pakistan out of the semi-final race.
 <br>
  <br>
  The result in Rawalpindi also ensured India's semi-final berth in the 50-over tournament as Bangladesh became the other team from Group A to be knocked out.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both New Zealand and India have two wins from two matches and will now meet in Dubai on Sunday to decide team one and two from the group.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Feels nice to qualify," New Zealand skipper Mitchell Santner said after the win. "Knew Bangladesh would be a challenge."
  <br>
  <br>
  Pakistan, who won the previous edition of the Champions Trophy in 2017, lost to New Zealand and then India in the first International Cricket Council (ICC) event they are hosting since the 1996 ODI World Cup.
  <br>
  <br>
  India refused to tour Pakistan due to political reasons and instead are playing all their matches in Dubai, which will host the final if the Asian giants go the distance.
  <br>
  <br>
  New Zealand have been the team to beat in this group after they humbled Pakistan by 60 runs in the tournament opener.
  <br>
  <br>
  Coming in as firm favourites in their second match, New Zealand elected to field first and spinner Michael Bracewell returned career-best ODI figures of 4-36 to restrict Bangladesh to 236-9.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chasing 237 for victory, New Zealand slipped to 15-2 and 72-3 before Ravindra and fellow left-hander Tom Latham, who made 55, added 129 for the fourth wicket.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both were dismissed before the end but New Zealand still achieved the target with 23 balls to spare.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Black Caps had a disastrous start when pace bowler Tasking Ahmed bowled first-match centurion Will Young for a duck.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bangladesh's new pace sensation Nahid Rana took down Kane Williamson caught behind for five with a delivery bowled at 148.8 kph.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ravindra, who returned to the team after recovering from a nasty blow to his forehead in a recent tri-series match against Pakistan, joined Devon Conway to rebuild the innings.
  <br>
  <br>
  Conway hit back with a flurry of boundaries and made 30 before Bangladesh checked the surge and Mustafizur Rahman hurried one on to the left-hander who chopped on to his stumps.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ravindra stood firm and with fellow left-hander Latham, another centurion in the opener against Pakistan, waded his way through the chase and after reaching his fifty bossed the bowlers.
  <br>
  <br>
  He raised his fourth ODI ton with a single off Rana and raised his bat to soak up the applause.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He's doing Rachin things I guess," Santner said of his batter who hit a hundred in his ODI World Cup debut in 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He loves ICC events – looks like he never left the game," he added. "He wasn't as fluid as he'd have liked but when he gets going he's tough to stop. His partnerships were good too."
  <br>
  <br>
  Ravindra's knock was interrupted by an intruder who barged on to the field to hug the batter before being escorted out of the ground by security.
  <br>
  <br>
  The young boy, wearing a white shalwar kameez, was carrying a photo of a leader of one of Pakistan's radical religious parties.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ravindra finally fell, caught at long-on off leg-spinner Rishad Hossain, and wicketkeeper-batsman Latham's run out added some late drama. But Glenn Phillips, 21 not out, and Bracewell, who hit the winning boundary, sealed the chase.
  <br>
  <br>
  Player of the match Bracewell set up victory with key strikes that started with his second delivery to dismiss Tanzid Hasan out for 24 and end a strong start by Bangladesh.
  <br>
  <br>
  Skipper Najmul Hossain Shanto made 77 and Jaker Ali 45 in an attempt to put up a competitive total but Bracewell kept getting wickets.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was ably supported by the New Zealand quicks with rookie Will O'Rourke returning with two wickets. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Mainland lawmakers on Monday began deliberations on the draft private economy promotion law, which adds new provisions prohibiting arbitrary fees and fines on private enterprises.
 <br>
  <br>
  The draft law was submitted on Monday to an ongoing session of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress for a second reading. The first reading took place last December.
  <br>
  <br>
  The draft bans the forced collection of funds or material donations from private enterprises and specifies that multiple inspection items of the same inspection target should be consolidated whenever possible or included within the scope of cross-departmental joint inspections.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also includes provisions requiring the State Council and local people's governments at or above the county level to regularly report to the standing committees of the people's congresses of their corresponding level on the promotion of the private economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  It stipulates that relevant industry associations and chambers of commerce should fulfill their coordinating and self-regulatory roles in accordance with laws, regulations, and their charters. (Xinhua)

 Three improvised explosive devices were thrown at the Russian consulate in the southern French port city of Marseille on Monday but no one was injured, a police source said.
 <br>
  <br>
  Only two of the devices detonated in the attack on the third anniversary of Russia's campaign in Ukraine, the source said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The consulate was sealed off by police and AFP journalists heard a detonation caused by a bomb disposal robot.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Russian foreign ministry denounced what it called a "terrorist attack".
  <br>
  <br>
  "The explosions on the territory of the Russian consulate general in Marseille have all the signs of a terrorist attack," foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova told Russian reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We demand that the host country undertake exhaustive and speedy investigative measures, as well as steps to strengthen the security of Russia's foreign missions," said Zakharova.
  <br>
  <br>
  Paris condemned the incident. "France condemns any infringement of the security of diplomatic compounds," a foreign ministry spokesperson told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The inviolability, protection and integrity of diplomatic and consular compounds and their staff are fundamental principles in international law," the spokesperson said.
  <br>
  <br>
  A dozen leaders from Europe and Canada were in Ukraine's capital on Monday to mark the third anniversary of Russia’s military campaign.
  <br>
  <br>
  The visitors, including European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, were set to attend anniversary events and discuss supporting Kyiv with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping on Monday held a phone conversation with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin on the third anniversary of the war in Ukraine and said China is happy to see efforts by Moscow and others to defuse the crisis.
 <br>
  <br>
  Xinhua News Agency quoted the president as saying "China is happy to see Russia and relevant parties make positive efforts to defuse the Ukraine crisis".
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi also said China and Russia are good neighbours and true friends supporting each other and achieving common development.
  <br>
  <br>
  The president said their relationship does not target any third party, nor would it be influenced by any third party.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Kremlin said in a statement that Xi expressed his support for dialogue between the US and Russia.
  <br>
  <br>
  US and Russian officials met in Saudi Arabia last week and agreed to start work on restoring bilateral ties and preparing for Ukraine peace talks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, a dozen leaders from Europe and Canada were in Ukraine's capital on Monday to mark the third anniversary of Russia’s military campaign.
  <br>
  <br>
  The visitors, including European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, were set to attend anniversary events and discuss supporting Kyiv with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. (Agencies)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Trade Development Council (HKTDC) on Monday said a new index it has introduced to gauge how well the city fares in environmental, social and governance (ESG) has identified several strengths.
 <br>
  <br>
  The council said it used the index in a survey of more than 1,200 vendors and buyers during several of its trade fairs and business events last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Overall, Hong Kong received a total of 64.3 points on the index, a figure well above the neutral point of 50.
  <br>
  <br>
  Irina Fan, HKTDC's director of research, said the findings suggest Hong Kong excels in areas such as availability and diversity in green and sustainable products or services, talent training and market connection with international trade partners.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fan said the survey showed that ESG considerations are increasingly regarded as integral elements in business decision-making processes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Buyers also indicated a willingness to pay a premium of at least 10% for ESG products, while vendors reported additional profit margins from engaging with ESG businesses, Fan said.

 Drivers are urged to steer clear of certain roads in Central and Wan Chai because of an upcoming triathlon test event.
 <br>
  <br>
  A total of around 110 athletes from Hong Kong, Macau and the mainland will compete in the men's individual, women's individual and mixed relay events at the Central Harbourfront and Victoria Harbour this weekend, as a part of a test event for the National Games in November.
  <br>
  <br>
  The women's and men's individual races are set for 8am and 10:30am on Saturday respectively, while the mixed relay is scheduled for 2pm on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials said from 10am on Wednesday to 6pm on Sunday, the section of Expo Drive between Legislative Council Road and Expo Drive Central will be temporarily closed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Intermittent road closures will be implemented in the Central Harbourfront and Wan Chai North areas from 5am to 8am on Friday, affecting roads such as Lung Wo Road, Yiu Sing Street and Expo Drive.
  <br>
  <br>
  Further road closures will take place from 2am to 2pm on Saturday and from 8am to 6pm on Sunday in the same areas.
  <br>
  <br>
  Athletes will begin with a swim, followed by cycling before finishing with a run.
  <br>
  <br>
  All races will start at the Wan Chai Temporary Promenade. The cycling route will pass Golden Bauhinia Square, while the running course will loop around the Central Harbourfront Promenade, finishing at the Central Harbourfront Event Space.

    Lower goals help push drink container recycling: govt

<img alt="The government is hoping to recover 30 percent of plastic beverage containers and 10 percent of drink cartons in the initial phase of the recycling scheme. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1792962_1_20250224171913.jpg&q=45">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Monday explained why it wants to take a gradual approach to getting drinks companies to collect plastic bottles and cartons for recycling, after a lawmaker suggested its initial target isn't ambitious enough.
 <br>
  <br>
  Under the plans, the bottles and cartons would come with a minimum HK$0.10 rebate and the administration hopes that within eight years, up to 75 percent of the packaging would be recovered.
  <br>
  <br>
  But there will be four phases to the plan and the initial target is for 30 percent of plastic containers and 10 percent of cartons to be collected, a goal described as "relatively conservative" by lawmaker Chan Yuet-ming.
  <br>
  <br>
  Environment Secretary Tse Chin-wan said a gradual approach would help drive the programme to success.
  <br>
  <br>
  "At present in the market, we're talking about a one-percent recovery only. [In the first year], we already require them to increase the [recovery] volume by 10 times," Tse told lawmakers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Compared to overseas markets, Hong Kong really has a very wide diversity of sales outlets. It is rather difficult for recovery rate targets to be raised more than 10 percent. We believe that a phased implementation and a phased increase of the recovery target is more appropriate."
  <br>
  <br>
  The environment chief said the 10-cent rebate is "attractive enough" as an incentive, after several lawmakers raised questions over how sufficient the amount would be in motivating public participation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The rebate is at least 10 cents... The scheme operators can always have the discretion to offer a larger rebate," Tse said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The recovery target is mandatory and this will put pressure on the operators or the suppliers to recover and collect the amount that would hit the target. Otherwise, the penalty would be on them."
  <br>
  <br>
  The government intends to introduce legal amendments in the second quarter of this year to establish a framework for Producer Responsibility Schemes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The proposal for drink suppliers covers containers and cartons with volumes between 100 millilitres and two litres.

    Child car seat rule to come into force in November

<div class="itemFullText">
 Children under eight travelling in private cars will need to be in a safety seat or strapped in with some other child restraining device (CRD) from November 1, transport officials said on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The only exception to the new rule will be for those children who are at least 1.35 metres tall.
  <br>
  <br>
  As well as child car seats, drivers can also secure their young passengers with seat belt adjusters, wearable safety restraint vests or foldable boosters.
  <br>
  <br>
  People caught flouting the regulation will risk a fine of HK$230, while "serious cases" could lead to court action and penalties as high as HK$2,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Transport Department noted that drivers who break the rule might be able to avoid punishment in emergency situations, for example if they didn't have time to put the child in a restraining device because they needed to drive them to hospital urgently.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The new requirement aims to enhance protection for children and passenger safety. CRDs provide effective protection for child passengers in traffic accidents and they can substantially reduce the risks of being killed or seriously injured," a department spokesperson said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials noted that children not covered by the new regulation will still need to be strapped in, either with a restraining device or with a normal adult seat belt.

    CLP's annual profit increases by 75 percent

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 CLP Holdings on Monday said its annual profit increased by about 75 percent to HK$11.7 billion last year, thanks partly to notable improvements in its business in Australia.
 <br>
  <br>
  The power giant made a profit of around HK$6.6 billion in 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  It has declared a fourth interim dividend payment of HK$1.26 per share, bringing the total dividend last year to HK$3.15, up from HK$3.10 in 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  The company's CEO Chiang Tung-keung said one of CLP's goals is to phase out its remaining coal-fired electricity assets and look into opportunities to use different technologies in the future.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We'll start looking at some emerging technologies, including hydrogen, virtual power plants or carbon capture. Those are technologies that we will be interested in," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If we want to achieve net zero by 2050, apart from doing renewable energy, we expect these kinds of technologies will take a very important part, in particular towards the latter part of the coming decade, when we are closer to 2050."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chiang added that CLP supports the government in pushing forward innovation and technology development, especially in the Northern Metropolis.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said his company has reserved sufficient power system capacity to meet the demand for electricity for artificial intelligence and supercomputing centres.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Baptist University says the medical school it is hoping to create would be innovative and creative and not just a replica of the two Hong Kong already has.
 <br>
  <br>
  The university is one of three institutions to answer the government's call for a third medical school in the city, with the University of Science and Technology and Polytechnic University also expressing an interest.
  <br>
  <br>
  Proposals have to be submitted to the government by the middle of next month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Professor Lee Sum-ping, who chairs Baptist University's preparatory committee on the medical school plan, said the existing medical training system needs a shake-up.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Hong Kong needs a third medical school and I believe the new medical school has to be a new one with new features that is innovative, creative, wise and would hold promises for the future. It cannot be another of the old replications,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The university said its four-year programme would be for those who have already completed their first degree, with around 60 students to be enrolled annually.
  <br>
  <br>
  It added that experts would be engaged to help make the curriculum innovative, and there would be an “East-meets-West” approach.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We would pursue a traditional Western medicine curriculum, enriching and supplementing that with Chinese medicine, where students will understand the basic principles, broaden their visual field and perspective, so students can be more encompassing, more humanistic in their approach to their patients after they graduate,” Lee said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under the proposal, students could opt to complete their clinical placement elsewhere in the Greater Bay Area, which the university said would give students unlimited learning opportunities due to the large number of patients available.
  <br>
  <br>
  “In the Greater Bay Area, you actually see a patient, you learn so much more than looking at a slide or reading a book or clicking on the internet. You feel the patient, their consistency and pulsation,” Lee said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The university said it would be able to admit its first batch of students in September 2026 if the government granted permission for the school by the third quarter of this year.

 A mainland court has sentenced four people described as key figures in cross-boundary fraud cases to life in prison.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Supreme People's Court said the four defendants all left China to form telecom fraud organisations, with one of them, surnamed Yu, organising a number of people to go abroad to commit crimes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The announcement comes as the court released sentences over seven telecom-related fraud cases in the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last month, a mainland actor was rescued from a telecom syndicate in Myanmar.

<img alt="The airport handled 5.28 million passengers in the first month of the year. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1792933_1_20250224151810.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Airport Authority said January marked a significant milestone for flights taking off and landing at Chek Lap Kok, with the numbers reaching a post-pandemic high.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, the authority reported a 17 percent increase in flight movements, totalling 33,660 last month. Additionally, the airport handled 5.28 million passengers in the first month of the year, reflecting robust annual growth of 27.8 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The authority added that on January 25, the airport processed over 193,000 passengers, achieving another post-pandemic peak and signalling a complete recovery to pre-pandemic levels.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials said they saw double-digit growth compared to the month before in the number of Hong Kong residents, visitors and transit passengers using the airport.
  <br>
  <br>
  The most significant increases were observed in passenger volumes from Southeast Asia, the mainland and Japan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, cargo volume also continued to rise last month, increasing by 4.1 percent year-on-year to 394,000 tonnes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among the main trading regions, cargo volumes from the Middle East, Europe and Australasia showed the most notable increases.
  <br>
  <br>
  “HKIA [Hong Kong International Airport] serves as a prime double gateway connecting the mainland to the world. AAHK [Airport Authority Hong Kong] is increasing the total number of city terminals in the GBA to 30 by March this year," said Chapman Fong, deputy director of corporate development at the authority.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is part of our effort to continuously enhance HKIA’s intermodal connectivity, including high-speed ferry, coach and limousine services. By facilitating passengers’ journey between the GBA and overseas destinations through HKIA’s extensive aviation network, Hong Kong’s international aviation hub status will be strengthened.”

<div class="itemFullText">
 One of Hong Kong’s most historic theatres, Sunbeam Theatre, will close its doors next month after hosting fans for over five decades.
 <br>
  <br>
  Founded in 1972, the Cantonese opera theatre in North Point is set to be transformed into a church after the curtain falls on March 3.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sunbeam recently presented its final showings of “Trump on Show” – a satirical three-hour production about Donald Trump and China.
  <br>
  <br>
  The show is part of the theatre's final mission to make Cantonese opera more appealing to the younger generation.
  <br>
  <br>
  RTHK was earlier granted backstage access, and joined Sunbeam’s chairman Edward Li, as well as award-winning opera performer Loong Koon-tin for a trip down memory lane.

    Alibaba announces investment in AI, cloud computing

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chinese tech giant Alibaba said on Monday it will invest more than 380 billion yuan (US$52.4 billion) on artificial intelligence and cloud computing over the next three years.
 <br>
  <br>
  Investors have piled into Chinese technology stocks since the start of the year, with Alibaba – which runs some of the country's biggest online shopping platforms – seeing its shares soar to three-year highs.
  <br>
  <br>
  The gains have been boosted since the Hangzhou-based firm announced robust sales growth last week.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alibaba plans to "invest at least 380 billion yuan over the next three years to advance its cloud computing and AI infrastructure", a company statement said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The firm said its strategy was aimed at "reinforcing (Alibaba's) commitment to long-term technological innovation... (and) underscores the company's focus on AI-driven growth".
  <br>
  <br>
  The statement did not detail how the company would allocate the funds or what specific projects would be supported.
  <br>
  <br>
  It did add that the investment would exceed its total AI and cloud spending over the past decade.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alibaba last week reported an 8 percent bump in revenue for the three months through December, beating estimates to reach 280 billion yuan and triggering a 14 percent surge in its Hong Kong shares on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  CEO Eddie Wu said last week that the quarterly results "demonstrated substantial progress in (Alibaba's) 'user-first, AI-driven' strategies and the re-accelerated growth of our core businesses". (AFP)

    Kai Tak a favourite for latest light public housing

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Kai Tak appeared to be a top choice as people put in applications on Monday for homes in the second phase of Hong Kong's light public housing scheme.
 <br>
  <br>
  Four projects in Kai Tak, Kwun Tong, Tuen Mun and Sheung Shui will provide more than 5,000 units, with monthly rents of between HK$860 and HK$3,270.
  <br>
  <br>
  Successful tenants will be able to move in from the fourth quarter of this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  One of those putting in an application, Chaves, told RTHK that Kai Tak would be a convenient location for her.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I've been waiting for the traditional public housing for almost 11 years. I'm paying rent every month, and my savings are just going. [I currently live in] a subdivided unit and there are four units in all. But the rent is quite a bit, I pay HK$5,000 a month," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm retired. I'm 73. I thought I'd apply for this because of Kai Tak. I do a lot of church work, so Kai Tak is easy for me to access the church in Tsim Sha Tsui."
  <br>
  <br>
  A man surnamed Choi was also hoping to get a unit in Kai Tak.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I live in Kam Sheung Road (in Yuen Long) now and it's inconvenient," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  An applicant surnamed Ng also said the Olympic Avenue project adjacent to Kai Tak MTR station was his choice.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I chose Kai Tak. It's more convenient, cleaner and more airy. I live in transitional housing in Chai Wan but the rent is just too expensive. It's around HK$3,000 a month," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government aims to build a total of about 30,000 light public flats by 2028 as a short-term measure for those waiting for traditional public units.
  <br>
  <br>
  Successful applicants under the first light public housing phase will be able to move into the temporary new homes in Yuen Long and Ngau Tau Kok in March and June respectively.

    Tens of thousands vow support for Lebanon's Hezbollah

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Tens of thousands of black-clad mourners vowed support for Hezbollah at the Beirut funeral of slain leader Hassan Nasrallah on Sunday, nearly five months after he was killed in an Israeli airstrike.
 <br>
  <br>
  Nasrallah shared the funeral with his cousin and successor, Hashem Safieddine, who was killed in an Israeli airstrike on a Beirut suburb a few days later.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since Saturday, roads into Beirut have been clogged with carloads of supporters travelling in from Hezbollah's other power centres in south and east Lebanon.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When I saw the coffin, reality dawned upon me," said Lara, 26, adding that she had a hard time coming to terms with his killing.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The pain is great... words cannot describe how I feel," she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  A founding member of Hezbollah in 1982, Nasrallah won renown around the Arab world in May 2000 when Israel ended its 22-year occupation of south Lebanon following relentless attacks by the group under his leadership.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the decades since, Lebanese have been divided over Hezbollah, with many criticising the group for initiating more recent hostilities with Israel in support of Palestinian militant group Hamas.
  <br>
  <br>
  As the funeral began, Israeli warplanes flew at a low altitude over Beirut in what Defence Minister Israel Katz said was a "clear message" to anyone who threatens Israel.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You will specialise in funerals - and we in victories," Katz said.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a televised address at the ceremony, Nasrallah's successor Naim Qassem said Hezbollah would keep following his "path", and rejected any control by the "tyrant America" over Lebanon.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The resistance is not over, the resistance is still present and ready" to face Israel, he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel has carried out multiple strikes in Lebanon since a November 27 ceasefire deal with Hezbollah ended more than a year of hostilities, including two months of all-out war. (Agencies)

    'HK$2 transport scheme should stay with limitations'

<img alt="The HK$2 scheme was originally introduced in 2012 for anyone aged 65 or above. It was expanded in 2022 to also cover those between 60 and 64. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1792879_1_20250224084830.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan is widely expected to unveil measures to trim public expenditure when he delivers his latest budget on Wednesday, with one of them being a possible adjustment to the HK$2 transport fares for people over 60.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chan, who said his budget would present a plan to control spending and increase revenue, has already said the scheme is not financially viable in the long run and that expenses are snowballing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Members of the public who spoke to RTHK say they do not want to lose the scheme – which was introduced in 2012 and expanded in 2022 – but said they understood that things need to be adjusted when times are tight.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jim is among the 2.4 million or so beneficiaries of the scheme, who has been paying concessionary fares since turning 60 last May.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Of course, I don't want the scheme to go away. It saves me a great deal a month every single month on transport. But I understand the dilemma and the fiscal deficit.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I'm willing to compromise somehow in order to keep the scheme the way it is. There could be some compromise in terms of putting a limit on how much of an allowance you actually get."
  <br>
  <br>
  Seventy-five year-old David also felt the welfare initiative should be adjusted to go with the times.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The whole idea was for retired people to go out. But now, a lot of people are not retired at 65. A lot of people are working full time and are taking advantage of this," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “At this moment, the Hong Kong government is in a lot of deficit. They're not rich as they used to be. So when you don't have the money, you should consider cutting your expense."
  <br>
  <br>
  The government reimbursed HK$4 billion to public transport operators in the previous financial year. That figure could shoot up to HK$6 billion this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  But even as the expenditure balloons, unionist lawmaker Bill Tang said the scheme needs to stay.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We think the HK$2 scheme is very, very positive for elderly or disabled [people's] welfare. it's beneficial to release their workforce, not only to employment, but also help to take care of their relatives, more support to the family,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tang suggested an incremental bus fare system so that passengers who hop off after only a few stops pay a fraction of the full fare. He said that would lessen the government's burden in terms of the reimbursement amount.
  <br>
  <br>
  The DAB also opposed any changes to the scheme, saying its expenditure is a drop in the bucket compared with the estimated deficit of HK$100 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Business and Professionals Alliance (BPA) proposed raising the concessionary fare to HK$3 or HK$4, to align with inflation.
  <br>
  <br>
  BPA lawmaker Priscilla Leung also suggested setting a cap on the transport subsidy each beneficiary can get.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We do not agree to cancel a particular sector who are enjoying the scheme right now, including the age span from 60 to 64. We just need to set up a very clear scheme, for example, they may only use two times per day. So they will use it out of necessity,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fellow lawmaker Gary Zhang, meanwhile, is calling for a cautious approach.
  <br>
  <br>
  He urged authorities to hold off drastic changes until analysing data such as people's travel patterns.

<img alt="Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, had earlier declined a US draft agreement on exploitation of his country's valuable minerals. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1792870_1_20250224063736.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A contentious Trump administration proposal to give the United States US$500 billion worth of profits from Ukraine's rare earth minerals as compensation for its wartime assistance to Kyiv has been taken off the table, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Sunday, indicating a more equitable deal was in the works.
 <br>
  <br>
  Zelensky had earlier declined a US draft agreement on exploitation of his country's valuable minerals such as lithium used in the aerospace, defence and nuclear industries because it did not contain security guarantees and came with the US$500 billion price tag.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The question of US$500 billion is no longer there,” Zelenskyy told a news conference at a forum of government officials in Kyiv marking the three-year anniversary of Russia’s attack on Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Ukrainian leader said considering aid as a debt to be repaid would be a “Pandora's box” that would set a precedent requiring Kyiv to reimburse all its backers.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We do not recognise the debt," Zelensky said. "It will not be in the final format of the agreement.”
  <br>
  <br>
  No further details were given on the state of negotiations. Ukraine has insisted on security guarantees that it needs to deter any potential Russian aggression in the future.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's engagement with Russian officials and his recent agreement to reopen diplomatic ties and economic cooperation with Moscow have marked a dramatic about-face in US policy that has rattled leaders in Ukraine and across Europe.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zelensky has expressed fear that Trump pushing a quick resolution would result in Ukraine losing territory. US officials have asserted the Ukrainian leader would be involved if and when peace talks actually start.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump, however, prompted alarm and anger in Ukraine this week when he suggested Kyiv had started the war and Zelensky was acting as a “dictator” by not holding elections.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Sunday, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov told the state Tass news agency that Moscow and Washington would continue bilateral talks at the end of next week.
  <br>
  <br>
  European Union Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and other top EU officials were headed to Kyiv on Monday for talks with Ukraine’s government.
  <br>
  <br>
  British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron were to both visit Washington this week as Europe attempts to persuade Trump not to abandon Ukraine in pursuit of a peace deal. (AP)

<img alt="Following the latest hostage release, Israel has so far not returned 620 Palestinian prisoners under its part of the deal. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1792869_1_20250224062918.jpg&q=25">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Israel said on Sunday it was delaying the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners it had planned to free the day before until militant group Hamas met its conditions.
 <br>
  <br>
  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said that Israel was waiting to deliver the 620 Palestinian prisoners and detainees "until the release of the next hostages has been assured, and without the humiliating ceremonies."
  <br>
  <br>
  That was a reference to recent handovers by Hamas that UN officials have said went against international law because they were not respectful.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamas has made hostages appear on stage in front of crowds and sometimes speak before they were handed over. Coffins with hostage remains have also been carried through crowds.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamas official Basem Naim, meanwhile, said on Sunday talks with Israel through mediators on further steps in a ceasefire agreement are conditional on Palestinian prisoners being released as agreed.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Palestinian Prisoner's Society, a local group that supports Palestinian prisoners, said Israel is practising "state-terrorism against the prisoners and their families".
  <br>
  <br>
  Ghasan Washahi, whose brother was set to be released on Saturday, said his family was disappointed with the delay.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Every time there was a list of prisoners set to be released, we would wait, hoping Islam's name would be among them, but it was never there," he said, referring to his brother.
  <br>
  <br>
  "My mother even started losing hope that he would be freed in the deal. And when his name finally appeared, Israel halted the deal." (Reuters)

<img alt="Christian Democratic Union party leader Friedrich Merz speaks at party headquarters. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1792868_1_20250224062241.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Germany's conservatives swept to victory in Sunday's elections, with their leader Friedrich Merz set to become the next chancellor, followed by the Alternative for Germany (AfD) in second place after record gains.
 <br>
  <br>
  Merz urged the speedy formation of a new coalition government, warning that as US President Donald Trump was driving rapid and disruptive changes, "the world isn't waiting for us".
  <br>
  <br>
  He stressed that – after Trump reached out to Russia and made comments fuelling doubts about the future strength of NATO – Europe must boost its defence capabilities and said that he has "no illusions at all about what is coming out of America".
  <br>
  <br>
  The AfD almost doubled its score to over 20 percent, boosted by fears over immigration and security after a spate of deadly attacks blamed on asylum seekers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Merz's CDU/CSU alliance won more than 28 percent, according to projections at 2000 GMT, crushing the Social Democrats (SPD) of outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz, which were looking at a historic low of 16 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Merz – a long-time party rival of ex-chancellor Angela Merkel – has vowed a crackdown on irregular immigration. He hopes to win back votes from the AfD whose rise has stunned many in the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  For now, the AfD, basking in the vocal support of key Trump allies, is set to stay in opposition. All other parties have vowed to keep it out of power and behind a "firewall" of non-cooperation.
  <br>
  <br>
  But its jubilant leader Alice Weidel hailed the "historic" result and again said her party was ready to govern with the CDU/CSU.
  <br>
  <br>
  Before Merz, 69, takes over, he will have to forge a new coalition government in Europe's top economy, an often drawn-out process he has vowed to complete by Easter. (AFP)

    Liverpool beat City, extend Premier League lead to 11

<img alt="Mohamed Salah opened the scoring for Liverpool against Manchester City. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1792866_1_20250224053528.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Liverpool took a giant stride towards the Premier League title as a 2-0 win over Manchester City opened up an 11-point lead over Arsenal at the top of the table.
 <br>
  <br>
  Mohamed Salah was again Liverpool's star performer as he opened the scoring with his 30th goal of the season in all competitions before setting up Dominik Szoboszlai to double the lead before half-time.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is special. Especially when you are in the title race, it is incredible," said Salah after Liverpool's first league win at the Etihad for a decade. "Me and the big guys in the team, we need another title."
  <br>
  <br>
  Just days after exiting the Champions League to Real Madrid, this was another sobering defeat for the dethroned English champions, who are now 20 points adrift of the leaders.
  <br>
  <br>
  So often during Pep Guardiola's glorious reign, Liverpool have come up just short in English football's great rivalry of recent years.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, their time to match Manchester United's record of 20 English top-flight titles now appears just months away in Arne Slot's first season in charge.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We work every single day to achieve this and it is three months of very hard work to maintain this," said Slot. "It is important to understand why we are where we are."
  <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal's shock 1-0 home defeat to West Ham on Saturday had eased the pressure on Liverpool, that had built after dropping points in two of their last three games at Everton and Aston Villa.
  <br>
  <br>
  A trip to the Etihad has for so long been the stiffest test of all, but City's defensive frailties were easily exposed and they also badly missed the presence of the injured Erling Haaland in attack.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool, by contrast, had their talisman fit and firing as Salah took his staggering tally this season to 25 goals and 16 assists in 27 Premier League appearances.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Egyptian fired the visitors in front on 14 minutes thanks to a brilliantly executed set-piece routine.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alexis Mac Allister's corner was flicked by Szoboszlai into Salah's path and his shot deflected off Nathan Ake past the despairing dive of Ederson.
  <br>
  <br>
  At the other end, City's own Egyptian international showed his ability to finish, but Omar Marmoush had strayed offside before being played in by Phil Foden.
  <br>
  <br>
  City winger Jeremy Doku was skipping past Trent Alexander-Arnold at will, yet the Belgian consistently failed to deliver a telling cross or shot. Salah was not so forgiving as he raced onto a long ball over the top and teed up Szoboszlai to wrong-foot Ederson.
  <br>
  <br>
  The final outcome could have been much more humiliating for City had Liverpool had been as accurate on the counter-attack after the break.
  <br>
  <br>
  Curtis Jones had a third goal ruled out by a VAR review for offside after Szoboszlai just failed to time his run through the heart of the City defence.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ederson was forced into a stunning save from Luis Diaz and only a brilliant last-ditch tackle from Abdukodir Khusanov denied Szoboszlai a second.
  <br>
  <br>
  Marmoush scored a hat-trick in last weekend's 4-0 win over Newcastle and remained a lively threat as he flashed another effort across the front of Alisson Becker's goal.
  <br>
  <br>
  But City lacked the end product to make nearly 70 percent possession count.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite an eighth league defeat of the season, Guardiola's men remain in fourth and will be confident of securing their place in the Champions League next season with a top-five finish likely to be enough.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, after an unprecedented run of four consecutive titles, City look like yesterday's team with Liverpool now champions in waiting. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said she held talks with the British and French leaders this weekend and all had pledged "unflinching" support for Ukraine ahead of the third anniversary of its war with Russia.
 <br>
  <br>
  "We discussed our unflinching support to Ukraine, financially and militarily," Von der Leyen said of her telephone discussions with France's President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer.
  <br>
  <br>
  The EU chief said in a post on the X platform she had "good exchanges" with two key European leaders.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We shared updates on our contacts with US partners and discussed plans for the defence and security of our continent," she said amid growing US-Europe tensions on the Ukraine conflict and funding for Nato.
  <br>
  <br>
  Macron and Starmer are both due in Washington this week for talks with US President Donald Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to Downing Street, Starmer and von der Leyen agreed on the importance of offering guarantees for a just and durable peace in Ukraine when they spoke on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  European states are concerned that, in his desire to end the conflict, Trump will offer Moscow favourable conditions without providing Kyiv with security guarantees while keeping European powers away from negotiations.
  <br>
  <br>
  To mark the third anniversary of the war, Starmer said in an opinion piece for The Sun on Sunday newspaper that "it is in UK and US interests to stand by Ukraine with security guarantee." (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Pope Francis expressed confidence in his treatment Sunday in a message published in place of his weekly Angelus prayer, as the 88-year-old spent a tenth day in hospital.
 <br>
  <br>
  "I am confidently continuing my hospitalisation at the Gemelli Hospital, carrying on with the necessary treatment -- and rest is also part of the therapy!", he said in the message that Vatican sources said was written in the past few days.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier, the Vatican said the pontiff had a "tranquil" night, was alert and had rested after a respiratory crisis and blood transfusions.
  <br>
  <br>
  The pope was admitted to Rome's Gemelli hospital on February 14 after experiencing difficulty breathing for several days and subsequently had pneumonia diagnosed in both lungs.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Vatican described his condition as critical for the first time on Saturday, reporting that the 88-year-old Francis had needed supplemental oxygen and blood transfusions that day after a "prolonged asthma-like respiratory crisis".
  <br>
  <br>
  "The night was tranquil, the pope rested," the Vatican said in a one-sentence update on Sunday morning without providing further information. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Team Hong Kong, China put up a strong fight but fell short against Jiangsu, as they missed out on gold at a men's handball tournament at Kai Tak Arena.
 <br>
  <br>
  The two-day tournament, featuring Guangdong, Jiangsu, Macau, and Hong Kong, wrapped up on Sunday. It also served as a test event for the National Games in November, when the city will host handball and seven other competition events.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite raucous support from the home crowd, the SAR found themselves on the back foot against the onslaught of Jiangsu players.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both sides traded goals early on, but the visitors took a 15-9 lead at the half.
  <br>
  <br>
  After the break, Team Hong Kong, China ramped up their offensive play, closing the gap to just three at one point. However, their rally fizzled out as Jiangsu came away 28-20 winners.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the earlier bronze medal match, Guangdong dominated Macau, China wire to wire. Guangdong jumped to a 20-10 lead at halftime, and pulled away for a final score of 42-20.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeung Tak-keung, the head of Hong Kong's National Games Coordination Office, said more than 2,800 spectators attended the matches.

 Israel's defence minister on Sunday said the army had "evacuated" three refugee camps in the north of the occupied West Bank and had been ordered to remain there for the coming year "to prevent the return of residents".
 <br>
  <br>
  "So far, 40,000 Palestinians have evacuated from the refugee camps of Jenin, Tulkarm, and Nur Shams, which are now empty of residents," Israel Katz said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I have instructed (troops) to prepare for a prolonged presence in the cleared camps for the coming year and to prevent the return of residents and the resurgence of terrorism," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  It marks the first time tanks have operated in the Palestinian territory since the end of the second intifada, or uprising, in 2005.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Hamas accused Israel of placing the Gaza truce in grave danger after the government delayed release of Palestinian prisoners due to be freed after militants released six hostages a day earlier.
  <br>
  <br>
  "What the enemy government is doing by postponing the release of our prisoners according to the agreement is behaving like thugs and exposes the entire agreement to grave danger," senior Hamas official Bassem Naim told AFP, calling on the mediators, "especially the United States" to pressure Israel "to implement the agreement as it is and immediately release this batch of prisoners."
  <br>
  <br>
  Yair Golan, the leader of the Democrats in Israel, says his party has been warning that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu would torpedo the Gaza ceasefire.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Netanyahu ordered the delay in the release of the terrorists, openly violating the deal and blowing up Phase A,” he said in a post on X in reference to more than 600 Palestinian prisoners that Israel was obligated to release as part of the deal, including many women and girls taken from Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  “There are no real negotiations on Phase B, just spin and the neglect of the hostages’ lives.” (Agencies)

    Romantic Warrior claims second in close Saudi Cup race

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong racing royalty Romantic Warrior has come up just short in the world's most lucrative race, galloping to second in an epic finish against Japan's Forever Young in the US$20 million Saudi Cup in Riyadh.
 <br>
  <br>
  Romantic Warrior – the highest-earning racehorse of all time – turned up at the Saudi capital for the race in the early hours of Sunday, Hong Kong time, hoping to add to the US$23 million already in the bank.
  <br>
  <br>
  The seven-year-old horse led the pack until the final 50 metres of the race, when the Japanese dirt star rallied to surge ahead in a nail-biting finish.
  <br>
  <br>
  This marked the first loss for Romantic Warrior since the Turnbull Stakes at Flemington in 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  Still, the Hong Kong-trained horse collected US$3.5 million for finishing second.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He was gallant in defeat. We had a great pitch in behind and he got a little bit of kickback, so I thought I'll get him into clear air and he made ground just beautifully. He went through his paces really nicely all the way to the line and I can safely say I wasn't stopping. I did not alter my stride pace at all," said superstar jockey James McDonald.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Of course, I'm gutted he got beaten ... but he went down on his sword that's for sure and made one hell of a race out of it."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trainer Danny Shum, for his part, called the performance "a good run", noting Romantic Warrior was only beaten by a head.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We all did our best. I hope to win every time, but racing is racing. As long as he tries his best and it's a really good race – I think most of the people enjoyed the race," said Shum.
  <br>
  <br>
  The champion galloper is set to next tackle the 1,800-metre Group One Dubai Turf in April.

    Germans vote in high-stakes election

<img alt="Friedrich Merz, the 69-year-old conservative leader, is in pole position to become Germany's next chancellor. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1792836_1_20250223155012.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Germans are voting in a national election on Sunday that is expected to see Friedrich Merz's conservatives regain power and the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) score its best ever result as Europe's ailing economic powerhouse lurches rightwards.
 <br>
  <br>
  Merz's CDU/CSU bloc has consistently led polls but may not win a majority given Germany's fragmented political landscape, forcing it to sound out coalition partners.
  <br>
  <br>
  Those negotiations are expected to be tricky after a campaign which exposed sharp divisions over migration and how to deal with the AfD in a country where far-right politics carries a particularly strong stigma due to its Nazi past.
  <br>
  <br>
  That could leave unpopular Chancellor Olaf Scholz in a caretaker role for months, delaying urgently needed policies to revive Europe's largest economy after two consecutive years of contraction and as companies struggle against global rivals.
  <br>
  <br>
  It would also create a leadership vacuum in the heart of Europe even as it deals with a host of challenges, including US President Donald Trump's threats of a trade war and attempts to fast-track a ceasefire deal for Ukraine without European involvement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Germany, which has an export-oriented economy and long relied on the U.S. for its security, is particularly vulnerable.
  <br>
  <br>
  Germans are more pessimistic about their living standards now than at any time since the financial crisis in 2008. The percentage who say their situation is improving dropped sharply from 42 percent in 2023 to 27 percent in 2024, according to pollster Gallup.
  <br>
  <br>
  Attitudes towards migration have also hardened, a profound shift in German public sentiment since its "Refugees Welcome" culture during Europe's migrant crisis in 2015. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Beijing has responded to accusations made by Australian authorities, saying it had "deliberately hyped" recent Chinese naval exercises near the Australian coast and confirmed its forces had used live fire, in an incident that riled up Canberra.
 <br>
  <br>
  Defence ministry spokesman Wu Qian on Sunday said the "relevant remarks of the Australian side are completely inconsistent with facts".
  <br>
  <br>
  "During the period, China organised live-fire training of naval guns toward the sea on the basis of repeatedly issuing prior safety notices."
  <br>
  <br>
  Wu stressed that China's actions were "in full compliance with international law and international practices, with no impact on aviation flight safety".
  <br>
  <br>
  "Australia, while well aware of this, made unreasonable accusations against China and deliberately hyped it up," Wu added. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong Children's Hospital will strive to resume services for its ear, nose and throat, or ENT, department by the second half of this year, according to the head of the Hospital Authority.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Kai Tak institution earlier suspended operations of the ENT department due to a manpower shortage. More than 500 patients were redirected to other public hospitals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a radio programme on Sunday, the authority's chief executive Tony Ko said that staff resignations were stabilising.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Usually there are only around 10 staff members from each hospital department, and less at the Children's Hospital. So when several staff members [from the ENT department] resigned within a short period of time at Children's Hospital ... operations had to be suspended," he explained.
  <br>
  <br>
  "However, the overall resignation numbers are stabilising, and staff numbers are slowly recovering."
  <br>
  <br>
  Ko also pledged to boost ENT services in different ways. These include encouraging medical staff outside the speciality to take care of less complicated cases, and allowing non-locally trained doctors to assist in cases.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, he said the authority is prepared for a budget cut in view of the government's fiscal deficit.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For example, through drugs and medical equipment procurement, we have been purchasing from more places such as the mainland. This helped us reduce our costs. In terms of efficiency, our colleagues are able to work more smoothly and see more patients with the help of technology," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are seeing initial results."
  <br>
  <br>
  Ko said the authority is also seeking to implement within six months dozens of recommendations set out by a committee tasked to systemically review public hospital operations and facilities.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among the suggestions are enhancing top-level oversight for quality and safety incidents, and introducing a reward-and-penalty staff assessment system.
  <br>
  <br>
  When asked whether such measures would affect morale, Ko said the ultimate aim of the review is to help both staff and patients.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan has said Wednesday's budget will detail the government's fiscal consolidation strategies, while revealing the colour of choice for his upcoming blueprint.
 <br>
  <br>
  On his official blog, the finance chief said on Sunday the administration would strictly control its spending, increase revenue appropriately, and make use of public resources and market forces to further boost development.
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted the aqua-coloured cover of the budget reflected the unlimited opportunities presented in future developments.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There is infinite vitality in a beautiful lake. Despite the occasional storms, we have firm confidence and positive expectations for the future given the solid backing of the country and the joint efforts of all sectors in Hong Kong," Chan wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  The finance minister also expressed gratitude to those who gave their suggestions during the budget consultation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan will announce his latest budget on February 26, amid an estimated deficit of HK$100 billion for the financial year ending March 31.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Luka Doncic delivered a dominant 32-point performance as the Los Angeles Lakers snapped the Denver Nuggets' nine-game winning streak on Saturday with an impressive 123-100 victory on the road in Colorado.
 <br>
  <br>
  Doncic, playing only his fourth game for the Lakers since his blockbuster trade from Dallas, was in scintillating form as the Lakers conjured a statement wire-to-wire win over their Western Conference rivals.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Slovenian superstar was the standout performer on a night when the Lakers saw four players finish with 20 points or more for the first time this season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Doncic finished with 32 points, 10 rebounds and seven assists while LeBron James backed him with 25 points. Austin Reaves added 23 points and Rui Hachimura 21.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm starting to feel a little bit more like myself, that's why I was smiling the whole game," Doncic said afterward.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There's still a lot of room for improvement and this is only my fourth game. Chemistry takes time. But you saw today that things are getting better."
  <br>
  <br>
  Doncic had signalled he was in the mood for a stellar performance early in the first quarter, arrowing a couple of superb passes to James and Jaxson Hayes to help the Lakers take an 8-3 lead.
  <br>
  <br>
  A sublime three-pointer from Doncic put the Lakers into a 31-18 lead as the visitors remained firmly on top.
  <br>
  <br>
  Doncic finished the first quarter with 16 points, four rebounds and three assists and was soon back into the groove in the second quarter.
  <br>
  <br>
  A delicate lobbed assist to James for an alley-oop dunk made it 60-52 before Doncic unfurled a 24-foot three-pointer to put the Lakers 11 points up.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Nuggets closed the deficit to 63-54 at the half, but the Lakers remained in control for much of the third quarter, taking a nine-point advantage into the final frame.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Lakers continued to keep the scoreboard ticking over in the fourth, and Doncic put Los Angeles into a 20-point lead at 117-97 with just over four minutes remaining after another Denver turnover to effectively ice the game.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Lakers improved to 34-21 with the win and remain fifth in the West. The Nuggets fell to 37-20 with the defeat. (AFP)

 Officials said the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Marathon on Sunday morning proceeded smoothly, but a review will still go ahead for to identify areas of improvement for the upcoming National Games later this year.
 <br>
  <br>
  The cross-boundary race which began and ended in Shenzhen while passing through Hong Kong also served as a test event for the 15th National Games marathon later this year.

  Thirty-eight athletes from various provinces and cities participated, including three male and three female runners from Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zhao Chaochuan, from Yunnan, won the men's race in two hours, 17 minutes and 15 seconds.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SAR's Wan Cheuk-hei was the first man from the SAR to cross the line, clocking a time of of two hours and 33 minutes for eighth overall. He described the whole experience as special.
  <br>
  <br>
  "No matter if we were running against the wind or there were many slopes, it was still a very special route. We are fortunate to be running it for the first time. We don't know for sure if this will be the exact path for the Games, but I thought the arrangements were ideal," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the women's side, Guangzhou's Chen Liqin clinched gold in two hours, 44 minutes and 44 seconds. The SAR's Leanne Szeto, at some two minutes behind, also finished on the podium with a bronze.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There have been marathon events for three consecutive weeks, with this race being the third one, so my feet are starting to get tired. I also feel a bit mentally fatigued from running. I was a little dizzy earlier, but overall it went smoothly. I didn't push myself too hard," Szeto said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeung Tak-keung, head of the SAR's National Games Coordination Office, said the test event ran smoothly and gave Hong Kong marshals valuable experience.
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted that officials would conduct a review into all aspects of the race ahead of the Games this November.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will consult with the athletes, coaches and other experts to see which aspects of the race needs to be optimised or adjusted. However, we can see that the track's width, curves and incline on the Hong Kong course is suitable for the event. Nonetheless, this will need further review later on," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Around half of the cross-boundary marathon took place on Hong Kong's roads. Starting at the Shenzhen Bay Sports Centre, runners entered the SAR via the Shenzhen Bay Port, before traversing the Shenzhen Bay Bridge and Kong Sham Western Highway viaduct, and returning via the same route.

    'All views on regulating ride-hailing welcomed'

<div class="itemFullText">
 All ideas on how officials can regulate online ride-hailing platforms in Hong Kong are welcomed, says the head of a government advisory body spearheading an industry review.
 <br>
  <br>
  Stephen Cheung, who chairs the Transport Advisory Committee, also stressed the importance of finding common ground between the taxi trade and ride-hailing operators.
  <br>
  <br>
  The body and transport officials had heard the views of more than 20 representatives from the taxi trade -- as well as five ride-hailing operators -- in separate meetings last week.
  <br>
  <br>
  The committee pledged to put forward a proposal on regulating car-sharing platforms to the administration within this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I have committed to the stakeholders that [whenever] they have opinions, not only they can express their view to us during the meetings, they can [also] submit their opinion in written form any time they want," Cheung said after appearing on a radio programme on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Even if they meet me on the streets, in whatever occasion they meet me, they can tell me what they think. This is an ongoing consultation process."
  <br>
  <br>
  As to potential adjustments to the HK$2 transport fare concessionary scheme for residents aged 60 or above, Cheung said he's open to all suggestions to "reduce the wastage" amid a budget deficit.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he threw his weight behind the scheme's objective.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Any policy that encourages people to use our public transportation, to move across town, I think is a good policy," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to sources, officials are considering to cap the number of trips at eight per day for users, who will also receive an 80 percent discount on fares exceeding HK$10 -- more than the flat fare of HK$2 they're now paying on all trips.

    Prisoner swap delayed over 'humiliating ceremonies'

<div class="itemFullText">
 Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said early on Sunday that freeing Palestinian prisoners under the Gaza ceasefire deal will be delayed until Hamas ends "humiliating ceremonies" it holds while handing over Israeli hostages.
 <br>
  <br>
  "In light of Hamas' repeated violations - including the disgraceful ceremonies that dishonour our hostages and the cynical use of hostages for propaganda - it has been decided to delay the release of terrorists that was planned for yesterday (Saturday) until the release of the next hostages is ensured, without the humiliating ceremonies", Netanyahu's office said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since a ceasefire came into effect in Gaza on January 19, Hamas has released 25 Israeli hostages in well-rehearsed ceremonies, with masked militants parading the captives on stage and forcing them to wave at Gazans gathered to watch the events, and even address them on a microphone.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the choreographed ceremonies, the hostages are given certificates in Hebrew to mark the end of their captivity before being handed over to Red Cross officials, who then transfer them to Israeli forces.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Thursday, militants even handed over the remains of three hostages in coffins at a ceremony, which drew widespread criticism from the United Nations.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The parading of bodies in the manner seen this morning is abhorrent and cruel, and flies in the face of international law," said UN human rights chief Volker Turk.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamas has dismissed repeated calls by the Red Cross to release the hostages in private.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Saturday, Hamas released six Israeli hostages as part of the scheduled seventh such hostage-prisoner swap under the fragile first phase of the ceasefire deal.
  <br>
  <br>
  In return, Israel was to release more than 600 Palestinian prisoners.
  <br>
  <br>
  But soon after the hostages were released, Israeli sources said that Netanyahu was expected to decide on the Palestinian prisoners' releases.
  <br>
  <br>
  Early on Sunday, Netanyahu announced his decision to suspend the release of Palestinian prisoners until the ceremonies for handing over hostages are halted. (AFP)

<img alt="In his statement, British Foreign Secretary David Lammy reiterated UK's military backing and its pledge to be " src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1792796_1_20250223081441.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 London will unveil a significant package of sanctions against Russia on Monday, which marks three years since the start of its war with Ukraine, UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy said on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  "This is also the time to turn the screws on (Vladimir) Putin's Russia," Lammy said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Tomorrow, I plan to announce the largest package of sanctions against Russia since the early days of the war - eroding their military machine and reducing revenues fuelling the fires of destruction in Ukraine," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  UK's decision to ramp up sanctions comes as US President Donald Trump has in recent weeks sought to sideline Kyiv and its European backers from talks with Russia on the future of the conflict.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is a critical moment in the history of Ukraine, Britain and all of Europe... Now is the time for Europe to double down on our support for Ukraine," said Lammy.
  <br>
  <br>
  London has already imposed sanctions on 1,900 people and organisations with link's to Putin's government since the start of the war, as of January 2025.
  <br>
  <br>
  Its sanctions target the Russian financial, aviation, military and energy sectors, including through bank asset freezes, travel bans, and trade restrictions.
  <br>
  <br>
  EU countries last week agreed a new round of sanctions which includes a ban on imports of Russian aluminium set to be formally adopted on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  In his statement, Lammy reiterated UK's military backing, which includes a pledge to provide US$3.78 billion annually to Kyiv and "being ready and willing to provide UK troops as part of peacekeeping forces if necessary". (AFP)

    Trump revels in mass firings before adoring crowd

<img alt="President Trump addresses the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) annual meeting in National Harbor, Maryland. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1792795_1_20250223075752.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump said on Saturday that “nobody's ever seen anything" like his administration's sweeping effort to fire thousands of federal employees and shrink the size of government, congratulating himself for “dominating” Washington and sending bureaucrats “packing.”
 <br>
  <br>
  Addressing an adoring crowd at the Conservative Political Action Conference just outside Washington, Trump promised, “We’re going to forge a new and lasting political majority that will drive American politics for generations to come.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The president argues that voters gave him a mandate to overhaul government while cracking down on the US-Mexico border and extending tax cuts that were the signature policy of his first administration.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump clicked easily back into campaign mode during his hour-plus speech, predicting that the GOP will continue to win and defy history.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has empowered Elon Musk to help carry out the firings, and the billionaire suggested Saturday that more might be coming.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Consistent with President @realDonaldTrump’s instructions, all federal employees will shortly receive an email requesting to understand what they got done last week,” Musk posted on X, which he owns. “Failure to respond will be taken as a resignation.”
  <br>
  <br>
  A short time later, an “HR” email was sent to federal workers across numerous agencies titled “What did you do last week” and asking that recipients “reply with approx. 5 bullets of what you accomplished last week and cc your manager.” It cautioned against sending classified information, and gave a deadline of just before midnight on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump also said during the speech that he'd carry out harsher immigration policies. But those efforts have so far largely been overshadowed by his administration's mass federal firings.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump also devoted large chunks of his address reliving last year's presidential race, jeering at former president Joe Biden and mispronouncing the first name of former Vice President Kamala Harris - his Election Day opponent - gleefully proclaiming, “I haven’t said that name in a while.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump had kinder words for President Xi Jinping, saying “I happen to like” him. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 One person died, and two police officers were seriously injured on Saturday in a knife attack in eastern France that President Emmanuel Macron said was an "Islamist terror act."
 <br>
  <br>
  Prosecutors said three more officers were lightly wounded in the attack in the city of Mulhouse, carried out by a 37-year-old suspect who is on a terror prevention watchlist, prosecutor Nicolas Heitz told AFP.
  <br>
  <br>
  The suspect was in custody.
  <br>
  <br>
  France's national anti-terror prosecutors unit (PNAT), which has taken charge of the investigation, said the suspect first attacked the municipal police officers, shouting "Allahu Akbar" (God is greatest).
  <br>
  <br>
  A civilian passerby who intervened was fatally injured, the PNAT said in a statement. According to Mulhouse prosecutors, he was a 69-year-old Portuguese national.
  <br>
  <br>
  Macron said there was "no doubt" that the incident was "a terrorist act," specifically "an Islamist terrorist act."
  <br>
  <br>
  The government was determined to continue doing "everything to eradicate terrorism on our soil," Macron added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police established a security perimeter after the attack that happened shortly before 4:00 pm (2300 HKT) during a demonstration in support of the Democratic Republic of Congo in a busy part of Mulhouse, a city of around 110,000 inhabitants.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to union sources, the suspect was born in Algeria and has been under judicial supervision and house arrest, with an expulsion order from France. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A lasting peace in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict can only be achieved through a two-state solution, Foreign Minister Wang Yi said in a phone call with Egyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Wang, returning from the G20 Foreign Ministers' Meeting in Johannesburg, South Africa, reaffirmed China's support for Arab positions on Palestine and opposition to forced displacement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang stressed the importance of a ceasefire and future governance that respects Palestinian autonomy, highlighting the urgency of reconstruction efforts in Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  The foreign minister stated that Gaza is a Palestinian territory, and any future arrangement must respect the will of the Palestinian people, adhering to the principle of "Palestinians governing Palestine" in post-conflict governance.
  <br>
  <br>
  He emphasised the urgent need to develop reconstruction and governance plans.
  <br>
  <br>
  For his part, Abdelatty provided an update on Egypt's efforts to implement the ceasefire and coordinate a reconstruction plan with other Arab nations.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also reiterated Egypt's stance against forced displacement of Palestinians.
  <br>
  <br>
  As a permanent member of the UN Security Council, China plays a key role, Abdelatty said, adding that Arab countries hoped for China's support in restoring peace and rebuilding Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ministers also discussed Sudan and Syria. (Xinhua)

    Hamas releases six more Israeli hostages

<img alt="As on previous occasions the hostages were paraded on stage before being handed over to the Red Cross. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1792777_1_20250222214137.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hamas paraded five Israeli hostages, some looking dazed and others elated, before cheering crowds at two meticulously choreographed ceremonies in the Gaza Strip on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  In the first well-rehearsed morning ceremony in Rafah, Hamas fighters stood in an orderly fashion as they handed over hostages Tal Shoham and Avera Mengistu, who walked with apparent difficulty, to the Red Cross.
  <br>
  <br>
  As in previous hostage releases, the men were given certificates in Hebrew to mark the end of their captivity before being helped into vehicles from the Red Cross, which acts as an intermediary.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamas fighters from the group's armed wing, the Ezzedine Al-Qassam Brigades, wearing fatigues, balaclavas and green headbands, formed a cordon around the area to hold back the crowd of onlookers.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a similarly choreographed ceremony later in Nuseirat, hostages Eliya Cohen, Omer Shem Tov and Omer Wenkret took the stage with shaved heads, smiling at a cheering crowd of hundreds.
  <br>
  <br>
  The trio stood briefly on stage alongside Hamas fighters, waving at the crowd while a camera drone and a photographer captured the moment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shem Tuv, who was abducted on October 7 from the Nova music festival in southern Israel, waved and blew kisses to the crowd before kissing two of his Hamas captors on their keffiyeh-wrapped heads.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel's military said later it had received a sixth Israeli hostage, Hisham al-Sayed, who was captured in Gaza a decade ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  At both ceremonies, the Palestinian militants put on a display of strength.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Rafah, some held Kalashnikov assault rifles and others flaunted hand-held rocket launchers, while Hamas's green flag flew around the square on buildings destroyed by war in the Palestinian territory.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fidaa Awda, a resident of the southern city who attended the ceremony said: "We say and continue to say that we are with the resistance, we are with the valiant Brigades, we are with the fighters."
  <br>
  <br>
  On stage in southern Gaza, in front of a table draped in camouflage cloth, US-made assault rifles reportedly seized from Israeli soldiers in combat were displayed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Behind the table, a slogan in Arabic, English and Hebrew read: "We are the flood. We are the extreme strength."
  <br>
  <br>
  The slogan referenced Operation Al-Aqsa flood, the name used by Hamas and its allied Palestinian factions for their October 7, 2023, attack on Israel that sparked the Gaza war.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other banners depicted fallen Hamas military commanders, including former armed wing chief Muhammad Deif, killed in an Israeli air strike in 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  A poster below the stage read "And the red freedom has a door, struck by every bloodied hand."
  <br>
  <br>
  The sentence is a verse from a 1926 anti-colonial poem by Egyptian poet Ahmad Shawqi which slain Hamas leader and October 7 mastermind Yahya Sinwar was seen reciting in a video taken during the Gaza war.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some in the crowd of hundreds stood on large chunks of concrete from nearby buildings demolished by bombs, others on the upper floors of buildings whose walls appeared damaged by the war.
  <br>
  <br>
  One man held a young boy clad in military fatigues and a Hamas headband as militants in arms paraded on the back of pickup trucks.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, Hamas praised the hostage releases and said that the Israeli public had two options.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Either they receive their prisoners in coffins, as happened on Thursday, due to Netanyahu's arrogance, or they embrace their prisoners alive in commitment to the (Palestinian) resistance's conditions."
  <br>
  <br>
  Sixty-two hostages taken during Hamas's October 7 attack are still being held in Gaza, including 35 who the Israeli military says are dead. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Myanmar handed over more than 100 Chinese scam centre workers to be repatriated through Thailand on Saturday, the third batch in a major crackdown on the illegal operations.
 <br>
  <br>
  Hundreds of foreigners are expected to be sent home from scam compounds in Myanmar over the coming weeks, with the first two batches already flown out on Thursday and Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The compounds are run by criminal gangs and staffed by foreigners, many of whom say they were trafficked and forced to swindle people around the world in protracted internet scams.
  <br>
  <br>
  Myanmar's junta said in a statement that a third group of 111 Chinese nationals was handed over on Saturday via the Thailand-Myanmar Friendship Bridge 2 at the Thai border town of Mae Sot.
  <br>
  <br>
  Live footage on Thai media outlet The Reporters showed people disembarking from two double-decker coaches and boarding a Southern China Airlines plane, a scene similar to that witnessed on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said that the first 50 Chinese nationals boarded a 10:40 am (0340 GMT) flight, with the rest expected to depart on two additional flights throughout the day.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Saturday, Thailand's Deputy Prime Minister Phumtham Wechayachai described the scam centre problem as a "complex transnational crime."
  <br>
  <br>
  As well as stopping fuel supplies and cutting electricity to suspected scam hubs on the Myanmar side, he had instructed senior Thai police to bolster border control measures, he said in a post on his official Facebook account.
  <br>
  <br>
  Many of those freed from scam centres say they were duped into working in them and held against their will, but the central government and state media have described them all as "suspects."
  <br>
  <br>
  On Friday, Foreign Ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun hailed the "thunder-style cooperation" between China, Myanmar and Thailand to tackle the scam centres. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A Syrian man arrested after a stabbing attack at Berlin's Holocaust memorial that wounded a Spanish man had been harbouring a "plan to kill Jews," police and prosecutors said on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 19-year-old arrested on Friday with blood stains on his hands was carrying a copy of the Koran and a prayer rug, and initial investigations suggested "connections with the Middle East conflict," they said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The attacker approached the 30-year-old Spanish man from behind at around 6:00 pm (1700 GMT) on Friday and stabbed him in the neck with a knife, according to the investigators.
  <br>
  <br>
  The assault took place at the Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe, a sombre grid of concrete steles located near the Brandenburg Gate and the US embassy in Berlin.
  <br>
  <br>
  The victim suffered life-threatening injuries to his neck and had to be placed in an artificial coma but was no longer in critical condition.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Syrian suspect came to Germany in 2023 as an unaccompanied minor, police said. He was granted asylum and lived in the eastern city of Leipzig, according to the investigators.
  <br>
  <br>
  There was no evidence of links to other people or groups and the suspect had not previously come to the attention of the police in Berlin, they said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The assault happened two days before a general election after a campaign centred heavily on immigration after a series of deadly stabbing and car-ramming attacks blamed on migrants.
  <br>
  <br>
  Six people who witnessed the knife attack on Friday received counselling from rescue services at the scene, where bloodied clothes were left on the ground.
  <br>
  <br>
  Germany has grown increasingly alarmed about rising anti-Jewish sentiment and violence since the October 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Israel that sparked the war in Gaza. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Pope Francis will miss the Angelus prayer on Sunday for the second straight week as the 88-year-old is treated in hospital for pneumonia, the Vatican said.
 <br>
  <br>
  The text will only be published, not read out, as it was last weekend, the Vatican press office said on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Francis was admitted to Rome's Gemelli hospital on February 14 with bronchitis, but it turned into pneumonia in both lungs, causing widespread alarm.
  <br>
  <br>
  The pontiff's doctors had told a press conference on Friday there was no imminent risk to his life but that he was "not out of danger."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Vatican's early morning update on Saturday said simply: "Pope Francis rested well." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Athletes participating in a handball test event for the National Games on Saturday said they were happy with the atmosphere and facilities at the Kai Tak Sports Park.
 <br>
  <br>
  The men's handball test event is underway at the Kai Tak Arena over Saturday and Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The competing teams are Guangdong, Jiangsu, Macau and Hong Kong, China.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang Quan, a handballer from the Jiangsu team, said the arena is comparable to those in Europe.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think this venue is very professional. Since I have played in Europe before, I find that the lighting and flooring here are very similar to those in Europe - basically the same level," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong men's handball team captain Freddie Tse said the venue arrangements were first-class, rating them 9 out of 10.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm very excited and amazed. It's my first time at Hong Kong's home court, and it's rare to hear our own language. You can see that the spectators are our family and friends. Even the people around us – it feels so familiar," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Huang Peijie from the Guangdong handball team, meanwhile, said the atmosphere was excellent and players were eager to compete.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some spectators told RTHK they were there to support the SAR team and looked forward to watching the actual Games in person.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I play handball myself, that's why I follow this sport closely. I hope more people will get to know this sport. I want to see the Hong Kong team's techniques and learn a move or two," said a spectator.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the match between Jiangsu and Guangdong, Jiangsu led by four points at half-time and managed to secure a spot in the final with a 29-23 victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong team, meanwhile, also made the final after beating Macau 33-19.
  <br>
  <br>
  The final between Jiangsu and Hong Kong will be staged at the Kai Tak Arena on Sunday afternoon.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The SAR's deputies to the National People's Congress from the DAB party said on Saturday that they will propose expanding the multi-entry visa scheme to include more cities in the Greater Bay Area, or even first-tier cities, at the Two Sessions meeting in Beijing early next month.
 <br>
  <br>
  It was among the more than 40 suggestions the party plans to table to the meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  The scheme was recently restored to cover Shenzhen residents.
  <br>
  <br>
  The party pointed out that expanding the coverage could help boost tourism development.
  <br>
  <br>
  Starry Lee, the SAR's sole delegate to the nation's top legislature noted that it is crucial for Hong Kong to open up to new markets, and the commercial sector, in particular, should get ready to do so.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Because they are more flexible in facing all these challenges and they are in a more capable position to open up new markets. Therefore I hope that different chambers and trade associations can join hands together to open up more new markets," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In return, if we have more new markets, we can also bring more talent, investment and technology to our country."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee said she will also propose that the central government set up a "housing purchase fund" to help talents from the mainland to settle in the SAR.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Cleveland Cavaliers boosted their NBA-best record with a 142-105 romp past the New York Knicks on Friday, tightening their grip on the Eastern Conference lead with an all-around dominant display.
 <br>
  <br>
  Donovan Mitchell scored 27 points to lead six Cavs players to score in double figures, connecting on five of seven three-pointers as Cleveland drilled 19 from beyond the arc.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cleveland out-scored the Knicks 66-38 in the paint and held a 23-6 edge in fast-break points, pushing their lead to as many as 42 on the way to a sixth straight victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  Evan Mobley added 21 points and Jarrett Allen scored 10 before departing in the third quarter with a right hand injury.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cleveland guard Darius Garland took a hard fall in the first half, striking his head on the court, but stayed in the game.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jalen Brunson scored 16 of his 26 points in the first quarter for the Knicks but was held scoreless in the second period as the Cavs roared to a 77-50 halftime lead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Karl-Anthony Towns scored 23 points for New York, who are in third place in the East but fell to 0-6 this season against the three teams with the league's best records: Cleveland, Boston and Oklahoma City.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think the biggest thing was just try to set the tone early," Mitchell said, adding that the determination to dominate had nothing to do with the Knicks' first-round playoff win over the Cavs two seasons ago and everything to do with the fact that they could yet meet in this post-season.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For us, it's about how do we continue to build and get better," Mitchell said. "So we're trying to measure ourselves, continue to do what we've been doing."
  <br>
  <br>
  Western Conference leaders Oklahoma City, stunned by a loss to the Minnesota Timberwolves heading into the All-Star break last week, rebounded with a 130-107 victory over the Utah Jazz.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shai Gilgeous-Alexander scored 21 points to lead six Thunder players in double figures. He added eight assists, two rebounds, three blocked shots and a steal in the wire-to-wire win.
  <br>
  <br>
  It came down to the wire in Orlando, where Memphis star Ja Morant drove for a layup that tied it at 104-104 with 1:50 remaining and Desmond Bane delivered the decisive free-throw in the Grizzlies' 105-104 victory over the Magic.
  <br>
  <br>
  Morant scored 23 points while Bane and Jaren Jackson Jr added 16 apiece for the Grizzlies, with Jackson blocking a potential game-winner by Orlando's Paolo Banchero at the buzzer.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Houston, Jalen Green scored 35 points and Alperen Sengun added 24 points and 13 rebounds for the Rockets in a 121-115 victory over Minnesota.
  <br>
  <br>
  Anthony Edwards scored 37 points for the Timberwolves, but was held to just three in the fourth quarter as the Rockets, who led by as many as 14 in the first quarter, clamped down defensively to win a game that featured 20 lead changes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kyle Kuzma, acquired by Milwaukee from the Wizards earlier this month, scored 19 points to lead the Bucks to a 104-101 victory over his former team in Washington.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bucks star Giannis Antetokounmpo, limited by foul trouble, scored 18 points before fouling out with 3:37 left to play.
  <br>
  <br>
  Khris Middleton, who arrived in Washington in the four-team deal that sent Kuzma to Milwaukee, scored 12 points against his former team in his Wizards debut.
  <br>
  <br>
  Middleton's three-pointer with 1:01 remaining pulled the Wizards within 102-101.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Brook Lopez made a pair of free-throws and blocked a Middleton layup, and Middleton came up empty on a last-gasp three-point attempt.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dallas Mavericks, fuelled by 35 points from Kyrie Irving, beat the New Orleans Pelicans 111-103 for a third straight victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  Detroit's Cade Cunningham scored 25 points and handed out 12 assists as the Pistons notched a fifth straight win, 125-110 over the San Antonio Spurs. (AFP)

 Israel's Bibas family announced on Saturday that remains returned to Israel the day before were identified to be of hostage Shiri Bibas, taken captive by Palestinian militants in October 2023.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Israeli kibbutz community of Nir Oz had earlier on Saturday announced Bibas's death, after the International Committee of the Red Cross said it had transferred more human remains to Israeli authorities without saying whose they were.
  <br>
  <br>
  "After the identification process at the Institute of Forensic Medicine, this morning we received the news we feared the most. Our Shiri was murdered in captivity and has now returned home to her sons, husband, sister, and all her family to rest," the Bibas family said in a statement.

  "Despite our fears for their fate, we kept hoping we would get to hug them again, and now we are broken and grieving.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For 16 months, we sought certainty, and now that we have it, there is no comfort in it, but we hope for the beginning of a closure," the family said in a statement on Instagram.

  On Thursday, Hamas handed over four bodies, saying they were of Shiri Bibas, her two young sons, and an elderly hostage.
  <br>
  <br>
  While the remains of her two sons and the elderly hostage were identified positively, Israeli authorities said the fourth body was not that of Shiri Bibas, sparking anger and grief across the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  But on Friday, Hamas – which blamed a possible "mix-up" of bodies – handed over new remains to the Red Cross, which now have been identified to be that of Shiri Bibas.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamas has long maintained an Israeli air strike killed Bibas and her boys – Kfir and Ariel – early in the war.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Bibas family became symbols of the hostage ordeal suffered by Israel since the Hamas attack on October 7, 2023, which sparked the war in Gaza. (AFP)

    Mixed reactions over rumoured changes to HK$2 scheme

<div class="itemFullText">
 Lawmakers have mixed reactions towards the rumoured changes on the HK$2 fare concessionary scheme for the elderly.
 <br>
  <br>
  According to sources, officials are mulling to impose a cap of eight trips per day for citizens aged 60 or above.
  <br>
  <br>
  It's thought while the fare stays at HK$2 for public transport rides costing HK$10 or less, the government would provide an 80 percent discount when the standard fare is above HK$10.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bill Tang welcomed the rumoured amendment, and believes it could help solve the bottomless subsidy pit.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think it would affect two types of people, for those who have to pay more - One is those who go to work everyday. I think they can afford the fare increment from HK$2 to HK$3 or HK$4," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The other is those who have to travel across multiple districts to take care of their grandchildren."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Federation of Trade Unions lawmaker hopes the government could review the threshold of HK$10 should transportation fares continue to rise.
  <br>
  <br>
  Roundtable legislator Michael Tien said he would also welcome the rumoured changes, adding that it would be better than increasing the HK$2 fare itself.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The benefit of that is that it sets a mechanism, so that it automatically adjusts itself for the next 100, 200 years, rather than arguing about when they have to change that again," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Changing it into a percentage would be the best thing."
  <br>
  <br>
  Tik Chi-yuen from Third Side, on the other hand, believed that the rumoured amendment would not have a significant impact in reducing government expenses.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Based on our observations, very few elderly take eight trips per day," he told reporters after a Commercial Radio programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If only a few people take more than eight journeys, economically, the measure has no impact. But this will cause unease among the public and it's unnecessary."

<div class="itemFullText">
 Shenzhen Bay Port will suspend its clearance services on Sunday for the cross-boundary marathon test event of the National Games.
 <br>
  <br>
  The port will be closed from 2am to 11am, with no passengers or vehicles allowed during this period.
  <br>
  <br>
  The closure also affects the Shenzhen Bay Bridge, Kong Sham Western Highway and Ha Tsuen Interchange.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cross-boundary coach services, franchised buses, minibuses and taxis via the port will also be suspended during the time frame.
  <br>
  <br>
  Travellers are advised to use alternative control points, including Lok Ma Chau, Heung Yuen Wai, and Man Kam To.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Transport Department recommended using the East Rail Line or taking KMB routes B1 and B9 to reach these checkpoints.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Passengers [should] use public transport services as much as possible and avoid driving to cross boundary ports during the test event period to avoid traffic congestion and unnecessary delays," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong section of the marathon is about 21 kilometres in total.
  <br>
  <br>
  The athletes will run for two kilometres in Shenzhen before entering Hong Kong through the Shenzhen Bay Port.
  <br>
  <br>
  They will run along the Hong Kong-Shenzhen Western Corridor towards the south until they get to the turning point.
  <br>
  <br>
  The women’s race begins at 7am while the men’s race starts half an hour later.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump fired top US military officer General Charles "CQ" Brown on Friday, as part of a major shake-up of the armed forces' leadership.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump offered no explanation for Brown's dismissal less than two years into his four-year term as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, which followed sweeping layoffs of federal workers and moves to dismantle government institutions just a month into the president's second term.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brown had been nominated to the top military role by Democratic president Joe Biden and became only the second Black person to hold the position.
  <br>
  <br>
  Following Trump's announcement on Brown, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said he was seeking a replacement for Admiral Lisa Franchetti, the first woman to serve as the top US Navy officer.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump thanked Brown for "his over 40 years of service to our country" in a post on his Truth Social platform, describing him as "a fine gentleman and an outstanding leader."
  <br>
  <br>
  The decision sets off a period of upheaval at the Pentagon, which is already bracing for firings of civilian staff, a dramatic overhaul of its budget and a shift in U.S. military deployments under Trump's new America First foreign policy. (Agencies)

    Ticket scalping for Kai Tak opening being combated

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Cultural and tourism minister Rosanna Law on Saturday said officials are working with police to combat ticket scalping for the Kai Tak Sports Park opening next month.
 <br>
  <br>
  Despite a real-name registration system, some people have been reselling tickets online for the star-studded event at prices far beyond HK$10.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a radio programme, Law called on members of the public to stay vigilant against scams.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If you try to buy tickets above face value or buy from scalpers, you will only encourage more scalping activities," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Since we have broadcasts on four TV channels, there's no need to scramble for these tickets that come from unknown sources and could even be fake."
  <br>
  <br>
  People will have to exchange their electronic vouchers for physical tickets at the Kai Tak Arena on February 27, 28 or the event day.
  <br>
  <br>
  The cultural minister said officials will keep pursuing additional guests for the ceremony on March 1, which features athletes, singers and performers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Law also said she's confident about crowd management on the show day, noting that 80 percent of spectators were able to leave on the first MTR train after two major Kai Tak drills.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the tourism chief expects next week's budget speech to reveal this year's visitor forecast, which she thinks will exceed last year's numbers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Last year, visitor arrivals reached 45 million. With more spectacular mega events this year like the giant pandas and the Kai Tak Sports Park opening, I expect visitor numbers to rise further. But we've mentioned that we're not just pursuing quantity but also quality," she said.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The sensation caused by the mainland blockbuster Ne Zha 2 is very much a "lightning in a bottle-style success" which may not be easy to replicate, according to a local film critic.
 <br>
  <br>
  The animated film, based on the mythological character from Chinese folklore, hits the big screens in Hong Kong on Saturday, after smashing box office records on the mainland and abroad.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think what director Yang Yu has done is taking an ancient property, something that every Chinese is intensely familiar with, to fiddle around with it for modern audiences," said Elizabeth Kerr, a Hong Kong-based film critic.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on
  <a href="https://www.rthk.hk/radio/radio3/programme/trendingchina" target="_blank">
   <u>
    RTHK's Trending China programme
   </u>
  </a>
  , she felt the film was a breath of fresh air as the same mythological legends are featured again and again.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The best part about the Ne Zha film is that they're not 'A Journey to the West', they're not 'Monkey King', which I understand that it is beloved ... [But] there's so much more that you can choose from," she explained.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is a kind of strange territory for overseas viewers, for people who know nothing about any of the culture on this side of the world, it's going to be fresh to them."
  <br>
  <br>
  The sequel to the 2019 hit Ne Zha smashed box office records on the mainland just two weeks after its release.
  <br>
  <br>
  The film went on to dethrone Disney's "Inside Out 2" as the highest-grossing animated movie of all time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kerr believes the sequel's more sophisticated and refined visual effects attributed to its success.
  <br>
  <br>
  But she struck a cautious tone over the film's release in the US market, saying it may not replicate the kind of success seen for Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, the Oscar-winning martial arts epic in 2000.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Partially because Crouching Tiger had a wider release. It also had considerable movie stars in it, and a powerhouse distributor pushing it," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  But she insisted Ne Zha 2's value should not be solely judged by its box office revenue.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Ne Zha 2 is one of those things that is very much lightning in a bottle. People will try and repeat it. But you can't force it because how it happened was organic - no one will ever be able to tell you why this worked for this year, at this time, in this country, why it succeeded, no one can."
  <br>
  <br>
  She also hoped Ne Zha's success will encourage mainland filmmakers to experiment with different varieties of scripts, and be willing to "roll the dice" more.

    Scholz hits back at US over Ukraine, free speech

<img alt="Chancellor Olaf Scholz on stage at the SPD's election campaign finale in the Westfalenhallen, Germany. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1792716_1_20250222072303.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Friday stressed his support for Ukraine's sovereignty and defended Germany's commitment to free speech in a push-back against recent broadsides from the Trump administration.
 <br>
  <br>
  As US President Donald Trump has reached out to Russia, feuded with Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky and threatened to sideline Europe, Scholz said that "Germany and Europe must stick to their own positions".
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at his last major campaign event before Sunday's elections, Scholz pledged that "we won't leave Ukraine alone and decide things over their heads and we will ensure that Ukraine is a country that can choose its own government".
  <br>
  <br>
  Germany has been Kyiv's second-biggest supplier of military aid after the United States since Russia launched its military operation in Ukraine in February 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  Scholz also pushed back at accusations from Trump's inner circle, including tech billionaire Elon Musk and Vice President JD Vance who called Germany's policies against online hate crime "Orwellian".
  <br>
  <br>
  Musk has strongly supported the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) and, on the day of Trump's inauguration, performed a right-arm gesture that some interpreted as a Nazi salute, a charge he has firmly rejected.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I have nothing against people becoming billionaires but becoming a billionaire because you want the right to insult people and break the law is not acceptable," Scholz said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We in Europe will stick to our rules, for example that Nazi symbols are banned in Germany."
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Zelensky said after a flurry of phone calls with leaders of allied countries that Europe must do "much more" to bring about peace.
  <br>
  <br>
  After speaking to the leaders of countries including Germany and Poland on Friday, Zelensky said in his televised evening address that "Europe must and can do much more to ensure that peace is actually achieved" in Ukraine. (AFP)
