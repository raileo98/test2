<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lawmakers on Friday said the new Skytopia development planned as part of an expansion of Airport City will boost tourism-related industries.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Airport Authority says the development will include a "one-stop arts hub" and a "jet fresh market".
  <br>
  <br>
  DAB lawmaker Holden Chow welcomed the move, saying it will boost the economy by bringing more tourists to the city and creating jobs.
  <br>
  <br>
  He told RTHK’s Hong Kong Today programme that now is also a good time for more flights routes to be introduced, to further enhance the SAR's status as a global aviation hub.
  <br>
  <br>
  “With the third runway already launched, we believe that we always need to connect more direct air services to more jurisdictions, including Europe and North America,” Chow said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The authority says Skytopia will cost about HK$100 billion, including HK$30 billion for infrastructure.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lawmaker Rock Chen, who’s a member of the authority's board, said many potential investors have expressed an interest in funding the plan.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the authority hopes to collaborate with Art Basel to stage events, as well as art sales to attract collectors, entrepreneurs and artists to Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  Calvin Au, a researcher at the Our Hong Kong Foundation think tank said having interesting facilities around the airport could attract people to choose to use Chek Lap Kok for their travels.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China's economy ended 2024 on better footing than expected, growing 5.4 percent in the fourth quarter from a year earlier, to put the full-year GDP growth at 5 percent.
 <br>
  <br>
  Boosted by a flurry of stimulus measures, the economy grew at the quickest pace since the second quarter of 2023 in the final quarter of 2024, to help authorities meet their annual growth target of around 5 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The national economy was generally stable with steady progress and new achievements were made in high-quality development,” a report by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Particularly, with a package of incremental policies being timely rolled out, the social confidence was effectively bolstered and the economy recovered remarkably,” it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Manufacturing was a strong engine for growth last year, with industrial output jumping 5.8 percent from a year earlier.
  <br>
  <br>
  Total retail sales of consumer goods grew 3.5 percent at an annual rate.
  <br>
  <br>
  Exports expanded 7.1 percent in annual terms, while imports grew 2.3 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Retail sales, a key gauge of consumer sentiment, were up 3.5 percent. Industrial output rose by 5.8 percent. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Mainland authorities have begun preparations to resume group tours to Taiwan by residents of Shanghai and Fujian province in the near future, the culture and tourism ministry said on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The two sides have yet to resume such tours since the end of Covid-19, and have blamed each other for the lack of progress.
  <br>
  <br>
  The culture and tourism ministry said in a short statement that the resumption of group tours from Shanghai, as well as from Fujian province, which sits on the other side of the Taiwan Strait from the island, would happen soon. However, it did not give a date for the resumption of travel.
  <br>
  <br>
  This was being done in order to further promote the normalisation of people-to-people exchanges and "enhance the interests and well-being of compatriots on both sides of the strait," the ministry said. (Reuters)

    Diallo's 12-minute hat-trick rescues Man Utd

<div class="itemFullText">
 Amad Diallo scored a sensational 12-minute hat-trick as Manchester United roared back to beat Premier League basement club Southampton 3-1, narrowly avoiding a humiliating fourth straight home defeat.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Ivory Coast international – United's standout player this season – levelled in the 82nd minute before putting the hosts ahead in the dying seconds of the 90 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was still not done, capitalising on an error from Taylor Harwood-Bellis to grab a third in stoppage time, giving the scoreline a skewed look.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was cruel luck on a Saints side battling to avoid finishing the season as the worst side in Premier League history, still with just one win to their name.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ivan Juric's men had deservedly taken the lead through a Manuel Ugarte own goal towards the end of the first half and had numerous chances to extend their lead.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Diallo was once again the saviour for misfiring United following his winning goal at Manchester City and his late equaliser against Liverpool in recent weeks.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Today we showed at the end we were the best team," the winger said. "I am so happy for the win today because this team deserves it. I am ready to play every position where the manager likes to put me."
  <br>
  <br>
  United manager Ruben Amorim praised his forward, underlining his attacking threat.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He pushes the other team into the final third – that is really important," he said. "We didn't have a good game, but at this moment – winning is the most important thing."
  <br>
  <br>
  United secured a morale-boosting FA Cup win at Arsenal on Sunday, which followed a battling 2-2 draw at league leaders Liverpool. (AFP)

    Retail sales figures cast pall over US markets

<img alt="Wall Street ended lower as investors digested the latest US retail figures. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1787923_1_20250117063623.jpg&q=70">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US markets finished lower on Thursday following a mixed US retail sales report, while European luxury stocks pushed higher following strong results from Cartier owner Richemont.
 <br>
  <br>
  Major US indices spent part of the day in positive territory but were unable to extend Wednesday's rally in a session Briefing.com described as "lacklustre."
  <br>
  <br>
  US retail sales grew 0.4 percent from November to December. That was slower than November but still a solid increase. In a separate report, the National Retail Federation estimated the growth in US holiday sales at four percent for 2024, topping estimates.
  <br>
  <br>
  The retail figures came on the heels of Wednesday's consumer price index figures, which eased concerns that the Federal Reserve will keep interest rates high.
  <br>
  <br>
  After major indices gained around two percent Wednesday, all three finished lower on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  But bourses in Europe and Asia pushed higher.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Paris stock market surged more than two percent after Cartier owner Richemont reported record quarterly sales.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Swiss luxury firm ended the day more than 16 percent higher. Sales in Richemont's Asia-Pacific region fell seven percent in the third quarter, dragged down by an 18 percent drop in China, Hong Kong and Macau.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the company enjoyed double-digit increases in Japan, Europe, the Middle East and Africa.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Paris, shares of Louis Vuitton, Hermes and Gucci owner Kering rose, while Burberry forged higher in London.
  <br>
  <br>
  London rose more than one percent even as data showed the UK economy expanded at a slower pace than expected in November.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kathleen Brooks, research director at XTB trading group said there were "threats to inflation down the road, but they are concerns for another day.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For now, stocks are playing catch up, bonds remain stable and the weakening in the dollar in recent days has helped to boost risk sentiment," Brooks added.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, investors remain cautious ahead of Donald Trump's return to the White House. The Republican has promised to ramp up tariffs on imports, and slash taxes and regulations, something that many fear could reignite inflation.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average eased 0.2 percent to 43,153.13, the S&P 500 also lost 0.2 percent to 5,937.34, and the Nasdaq Composite index fell 0.9 percent to 19,338.29.  (AFP)

    Medvedev stunned by teen qualifier Tien in Aussie Open

<img alt="Tien (L) speaks with Russia's Daniil Medvedev after his victory. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1787918_1_20250117054531.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Last year's runner-up Daniil Medvedev was dumped out in the Australian Open second round by 19-year-old qualifier Learner Tien in a massive Melbourne shock at close to 3:00 a.m. Melbourne time.
 <br>
  <br>
  In his debut Australian Open, the American ranked 121 stunned the world number five 6-3, 7-6 (7/4), 6-7 (8/10), 1-6, 7-6 (10/7) in a nailbiter and faces France's Corentin Moutet in the next round.
  <br>
  <br>
  The left-handed Californian Tien soaked up the applause at Margaret Court Arena after the biggest win of his young career following four hours and 48 minutes of seesawing action.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Honestly it hasn't really set in yet," he said. "I'm just pretty happy to be off the court. I don't think I've played a match that long ever, or even spent that much time on a tennis court straight."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Honestly, I'm just glad to be off," he added. "Obviously really happy, but I don't think it fully hit me yet."
  <br>
  <br>
  Tien had defeated Argentina's Camilo Ugo Carabelli in five sets in the first round for his maiden victory at a Grand Slam at the fourth attempt.
  <br>
  <br>
  "These are my first two five-setters," said the gifted teenager, a known talent in tennis circles. "It is nice to feel that I can play these more physical matches and get through them."
  <br>
  <br>
  It was a painful exit for Russia's former world number one Medvedev, who has lost three of the last four finals at Melbourne Park including to Jannik Sinner in 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 28-year-old Medvedev needed five sets to beat the 418th-ranked Kasidit Samrej on Tuesday in his first match of the season, smashing his racquet and a net camera in a rage at one point.
  <br>
  <br>
  He started more serenely against Tien but errors crept into his play and Tien shook off any early nerves by clinching the first set in 47 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tien showed his mettle and his pedigree in the eighth game by prevailing in one gruelling 32-shot rally.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 2021 US Open champion Medvedev and Tien went to a second-set tie break, where the Russian was left exasperated by a double foot fault on his way to losing the set.
  <br>
  <br>
  The third set again went to a tie break, where Medvedev pulled out an ace under excruciating pressure to save match point and then clinched the set at the third time of asking to come back from the brink.
  <br>
  <br>
  Suddenly it was all Medvedev and he raced through the fourth set to tee up a decider. Tien appeared to have run out of steam.
  <br>
  <br>
  But from somewhere he located some extra reserves of energy and the duo exchanged breaks early in the fifth set.
  <br>
  <br>
  There was still time for another twist at 5-5 and 15-all on Tien's serve when a shower came, briefly holding up proceedings.
  <br>
  <br>
  They exchanged breaks of serve to go into a 10-point tie break, where there was again nothing between them until Tien finally sealed the deal on his second match point. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police have arrested a man for using forged documents and making false crime reports, after he allegedly fabricated an email from the Kai Tak Sports Park and separately claimed he was the victim of a blackmail case.
 <br>
  <br>
  Officers alleged that the man released a press statement earlier this month claiming that his application to host an international football event -- featuring FC Barcelona -- at the new stadium was rejected, and included what he claimed was an email from the park.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kai Tak Sports Park said it never received any application documents about the proposed match.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officers said the suspect also filed a false police report claiming that a journalist covering the story blackmailed him for HK$10 million via an email.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sun Yi-ki, a chief inspector with the force, said officers believe both emails were forged by the suspect.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Police do not rule out that the suspect may have been overly optimistic about his ability to organise international events. When his plan failed due to inexperience and poor management, he tried to shift the responsibility by misleading the media and forging emails that falsely claimed Kai Tak Sports Park had rejected his venue application," Sun said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kai Tak Sports Park said it is willing to cooperate with the police probe and will continue to handle all leasing applications in a professional manner.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Retail sales in the United States cooled in December, according to government data released on Thursday, despite receiving a boost from petrol stations and autos.
 <br>
  <br>
  The performance was likely helped by replacement vehicle sales after the devastation of Hurricane Helene in September, analysts said, and consumers buying cars earlier to avoid potentially higher tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  But still, overall, sales grew 0.4 percent from November to December, reaching US$729.2 billion, the Department of Commerce said.
  <br>
  <br>
  This was a slower pace than November's 0.8 percent reading.
  <br>
  <br>
  From a year ago, retail sales were up 3.9 percent in December.
  <br>
  <br>
  For all of 2024, total sales were 3.0 percent higher from 2023, said the report.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among sectors, sales at restaurants and bars slid 0.3 percent from November to December, while those at building material and supplies dealers dropped 2.0 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  But at motor vehicle and parts dealers, sales rose 0.7 percent on-month, while those at petrol stations jumped 1.5 percent – likely due to higher petrol prices in December.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Attempts to get ahead of post-tariff price hikes seem to be lifting measures of underlying retail sales," said economists Samuel Tombs and Oliver Allen of Pantheon Macroeconomics in a recent note.
  <br>
  <br>
  But they warned: "Sales (that) pulled forward due to hurricane damage and the threat of tariffs, or a passing boost from the shifting timing of Black Friday, do not provide the foundation for a sustained climb in spending." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Thursday said they arrested 12 people, including seven police officers, on suspicion of money laundering, involving about HK$10.5 million.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, the force said the eight men and four women, aged between 28 and 68, allegedly laundered suspected criminal proceeds using 22 bank accounts between 2017 and last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two of the detained officers were also arrested for suspected fraud. They’d allegedly rented out their mortgaged residential properties between 2019 and last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officers from the Financial Intelligence and Investigation Bureau arrested the 12 people in Sheung Shui, Fanling, Tuen Mun and Kwai Chung on Thursday morning. The police officers were off-duty at the time of the arrests.
  <br>
  <br>
  The force said all seven officers, aged between 28 and 39, have been suspended from duty.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities stressed they attach great emphasis on the conduct of their officers, adding that those who breach the law will not be condoned.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Thursday said a Hongkonger who was rescued after being trapped in Southeast Asia was forced to work 17 hours a day and beaten for not meeting targets.
 <br>
  <br>
  Officers said the victim, 25, was lured by a social media job advertisement offering HK$120,000 to transport diamonds from Thailand to Taiwan.
  <br>
  <br>
  After arriving in Bangkok last October, he was taken to Myanmar and held in a mountain compound guarded by armed men.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lau Ho-tak, a chief inspector with the force, said the victim was forced to conduct online scams on social media.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Over the past three months, the victim was repeatedly beaten and denied meals because he failed to meet the fraud targets set by management staff at the compound. There are still visible injuries on his body," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police did not disclose whether the victim's family paid ransom in this case.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officers added that they are still in contact with some of the remaining 11 Hongkongers held captive in Southeast Asia and are trying all means to rescue them.
  <br>
  <br>
  The force warned members of the public to stay vigilant against overseas job offers that promise high salaries without requiring professional skills.

    Hong Kong Disneyland pleased with 2024 performance

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong Disneyland said on Thursday that it’s pleased with the theme park’s performance last year in terms of visitor numbers and revenue, and expects it to continue doing very well this year.
 <br>
  <br>
  The theme park’s vice president for communications and public affairs, Anita Lai, said the new 'World of Frozen' attraction, which opened in November 2023, was a big draw for tourists.
  <br>
  <br>
  “A year ago, we launched 'World of Frozen'. This is a movie and a story that people love,” Lai told reporters, adding that there’s been a surge in the number of mainland tourists buying the park’s annual pass.
  <br>
  <br>
  She pointed out that there was a double-digit growth in the number of Shenzhen visitors during last year’s Halloween compared to the same period in 2023, and that Hong Kong Disneyland Resort hotels reached 90 percent occupancy during the Christmas period.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said the park will step up promotions in both the mainland and Southeast Asian countries to entice more visitors during the Lunar New Year period.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked if the park is worried about vigorous competition with Ocean Park -- which will be putting the twin panda cubs on display next month -- Lai said Hong Kong Disneyland welcomes new events and highlights to inject momentum into the city's tourism industry.

<div class="itemFullText">
 An Australian mother has been charged with poisoning her one-year-old baby girl and posting video of the infant's distress to get online GoFundMe donations, police and local media said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 34-year-old woman allegedly went to "great lengths" to conceal that she was giving prescription and pharmacy drugs to the baby without medical approval, Queensland detective inspector Paul Dalton told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hospital staff in the Queensland capital Brisbane alerted police to their suspicions in October last year when the girl was there for treatment of a serious mental condition, Dalton said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police took "immediate action" to protect the baby and launched an investigation, he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The woman from Queensland's Sunshine Coast was widely reported in local media to be the baby's mother, though police would not officially confirm this.
  <br>
  <br>
  She was accused of filming and posting images of the baby's "immense distress and pain" between August and October last year to elicit financial donations from online followers, Dalton said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Testing for unauthorised medicines allegedly returned a positive result this month, police said.
  <br>
  <br>
  She was charged on Thursday with 11 offences.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There are no words to describe just how repulsive offences of this nature are," Dalton said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There is no excuse for hurting a child, particularly one so young that is totally dependent on adults to care and love for them."
  <br>
  <br>
  The woman is accused of raising just over Aus$60,000 (US$37,000) via GoFundMe, which was working to return the money to donors, Dalton said.
  <br>
  <br>
  She was scheduled to appear at Brisbane Magistrates Court on Friday. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Israel on Thursday accused Hamas of backtracking on parts of the Gaza ceasefire deal announced a day earlier, and said the cabinet will not meet on the deal until Hamas's agreement is confirmed.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Hamas has reneged on parts of the agreement reached with the mediators and Israel in an effort to extort last-minute concessions," Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said in a statement, adding the situation created a "last minute crisis."
  <br>
  <br>
  It did not specify which parts of the deal were at issue.
  <br>
  <br>
  The statement added that the Israeli cabinet, which has yet to approve the agreement, "will not convene until the mediators notify Israel that Hamas has accepted all elements of the agreement."
  <br>
  <br>
  Key mediator Qatar said on Wednesday that Israel and Palestinian Islamist movement Hamas had agreed to a ceasefire in Gaza starting on Sunday, along with a hostage and prisoner exchange after more than 15 months of war.
  <br>
  <br>
  The United States also announced the deal, which largely reproduces the framework of a blueprint presented by President Joe Biden in May 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thirty-three Israeli hostages will be released in the first, 42-day, phase of the agreement, Qatar's Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al-Thani said. (AFP)

 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Thursday said Hong Kong is the most preferred platform for mainland enterprises to expand their business overseas, as Tencent-backed digital lender WeBank opened a Hong Kong headquarters for its new tech arm.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at the inauguration and signing ceremony for WeBank Technology, Chan said the city's financial technology ecosystem has seen positive growth in recent years, with the number of firms in the sector growing 15 percent year-on-year to 1,100 in 2024, including eight digital banks and four digital insurance companies.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Under One Country, Two Systems, Hong Kong has the unique advantage to connect the mainland with the world, and is also the most preferred platform for mainland enterprises to go overseas," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As we have a full chain of financing and professional services, this could support WeBank Technology to export its advanced tech and explore business expansion in the international market, especially, to provide more inclusive financial services to countries in the Global South to support local social and economic development."
  <br>
  <br>
  Shenzhen vice-mayor Luo Huanghao, who also attended the event, said the mainland's tech hub will collaborate with Hong Kong to further promote the application of the digital yuan through more trials.
  <br>
  <br>
  WeBank president Li Nanqing said the opening of the new headquarters in Hong Kong can help the company expand along Belt and Road countries and boost economic integration between Hong Kong and Shenzhen.
  <br>
  <br>
  WeBank gained regulatory approval to set up its fintech subsidiary in Hong Kong last July and plans to invest up to US$150 million and create high-skilled jobs in the SAR.

    Apple loses top spot in China smartphone sales

<div class="itemFullText">
 Apple lost its status as the best selling smartphone brand in the crucial Chinese market last year, new data showed on Thursday, with a pair of local rivals surpassing it with surging shipments.
 <br>
  <br>
  The California-based tech giant claimed a market share of 15 percent in the world's number two economy, behind Huawei's 16 percent and top-ranking Vivo's 17 percent, according to industry data provider Canalys.
  <br>
  <br>
  Also coming in at 15 percent, with total smartphone sales narrowly behind Apple's, were Chinese brands Oppo and Honor, the data showed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Apple's performance in the country is suffering from a slump in iPhone sales, which dropped to 42.9 million in 2024, compared to a market-leading 51.8 million the previous year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Intense competition has led to a constantly shifting landscape," said Amber Liu, Research Manager at Canalys, adding that Apple "faced growing competitive pressure from domestic flagship devices".
  <br>
  <br>
  Top-ranked Vivo showed "strong momentum" last year, Liu said, noting that the firm's strategy was helping "solidify its position in entry-level to mid-to-high-end segments".
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Huawei, a Shenzhen-based tech giant that was once the target of tough sanctions from Washington, continued a resurgence in its home market in 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  The firm achieved a 37 percent year-on-year jump in total smartphone shipments last year, the Canalys data showed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Apple's iPhone remains popular in China, but many consumers in the vast market have switched to domestic alternatives in recent years as sector competition intensifies. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The R&D centre at Hong Kong's Automotive Platforms and Applications Systems (APAS) on Thursday warned electric vehicle (EV) owners to be careful when charging their cars on the mainland.
 <br>
  <br>
  The centre said most EVs in Hong Kong use either Japanese or American charging standards and an adaptor is usually needed to charge them on the mainland.
  <br>
  <br>
  But such adaptors are hard to find, the centre said, with those that are available coming with a price tag of between several thousand and tens of thousands of dollars.
  <br>
  <br>
  There's also a lack of standardisation regarding safety when it comes to the adaptors, the centre said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chief Executive Officer of the centre Du Yonghai said to help solve these problems, they are developing their own adaptor which they plan to make commercially available.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have been actively engaging with several partners so that we can commercialise that product, that solution and make it available to the market," Du said.
  <br>
  <br>
  As of last month, about 100,000 electronic vehicles were registered in Hong Kong.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Chinese Manufacturers' Association of Hong Kong has urged the government to provide more fiscal and tax support for local enterprises, including extending the principal moratorium arrangements to allow companies to delay their loan payments for a longer time.
 <br>
  <br>
  This was among an array of proposals it put forward to the administration on Thursday ahead of the financial budget next month.
  <br>
  <br>
  The association’s president Wingco Lo said small and medium-sized companies are facing several challenges at the moment.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Currently we are facing a couple of difficulties, like the pricing from the importer, and also the geopolitical pressure, and also the operating [costs]. We are suggesting the government have more support for the small and medium companies to promote local businesses," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  With Donald Trump set to return to the White House next week, Lo said more efforts are needed to diversify businesses to minimise the impact of possible tariffs and Sino-US tensions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lawmaker Jimmy Ng, and the association's executive committee member, said he wants to see more bilateral free trade agreements between the SAR and emerging economies.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We should now focus more on the Asean countries and the Belt and Road countries. For a traditional market they are either not rich enough now or they are not very friendly to us. So the international market is no longer only the States and Europe. We should look for other business economies for a better future."

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Indian Bollywood star Saif Ali Khan was stabbed in a scuffle with an intruder at his home early on Thursday and underwent surgery at a hospital, media reports said.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 54-year-old actor was taken to the hospital from his home in Mumbai, the country's financial and entertainment capital, where he lives with his movie star wife Kareena Kapoor and two sons.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two of the six wounds were deep, with one near his spine, the Press Trust of India news agency cited a doctor at Mumbai’s Lilavati Hospital as saying.
  <br>
  <br>
  Indian media quoted police as saying the intruder barged into the house at about 2.30am and fled after stabbing Khan.
  <br>
  <br>
  A female employee at Khan's home was also injured during the attack and was being treated, they said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police are investigating and have launched a search for the attacker.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kapoor, Khan' wife, said in a statement that his family was fine and requested “the media and fans to be patient and not speculate any further as the police is already doing their due investigations.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Khan, who is also a movie producer, has been featured in about 70 films and television series.
  <br>
  <br>
  He is the son of former Indian cricket captain Mansur Ali Khan Pataudi and Bollywood actress Sharmila Tagore.
  <br>
  <br>
  He won multiple awards for his roles in Hindi cinema, including seven Filmfare Awards. In 2010, he received the Padma Shri, the fourth highest Indian civilian award. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China on Thursday said it welcomed a ceasefire agreement in Gaza between Israel and the Hamas militant group, vowing "unremitting efforts to promote peace and stability in the Middle East".
 <br>
  <br>
  "We also sincerely hope that relevant parties will take the ceasefire in Gaza as an opportunity to promote the easing of regional tensions," Foreign Ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun told a regular briefing.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Wednesday, Qatar and the United States announced a ceasefire and hostage-release deal between Israel and Hamas.
  <br>
  <br>
  The truce would take effect on Sunday and involve the exchange of Israeli hostages for Palestinian prisoners, after which the terms of a broader peace deal would be finalised.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing on Thursday said it hoped the "agreement can be effectively implemented to achieve a comprehensive and permanent ceasefire in Gaza".
  <br>
  <br>
  China would "continue to provide humanitarian assistance to Gaza and make positive efforts to resume post-war reconstruction," Guo said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China will work with the international community to make unremitting efforts to promote peace and stability in the Middle East," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israeli President Isaac Herzog, who holds a largely ceremonial role, said the deal was the "right move" to bring back hostages seized during the October 7, 2023 Hamas attack that sparked the war.
  <br>
  <br>
  That attack, the deadliest in Israeli history, resulted in the deaths of 1,210 people, mostly civilians, according to a media tallies of official Israeli figures.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel's ensuing campaign has destroyed much of Gaza, killing 46,707 people, most of them civilians, according to figures from the Hamas-run territory's health ministry. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Airport Authority on Thursday unveiled a new development called "SKYTOPIA" for Hong Kong's Airport City, aiming to develop it into a world-class landmark.
 <br>
  <br>
  The authority unveiled the Airport City development blueprint which includes measures to expand AsiaWorld-Expo, build the city’s largest yacht bay, and set up the city’s first art storage facility.
  <br>
  <br>
  The three-runway system at the airport commenced operation in November last year, and will boost the airport’s capacity to 120 million passengers a year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chairman of the Airport Authority, Fred Lam, said the Airport City will be more than just about serving travellers using the airport.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We envisage that our airport will not be just a place for passengers to board their planes or a portal for entering Hong Kong,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Our vision is to develop SKYTOPIA into a landmark of its own and also a world leading destination, attracting visitors from within Hong Kong and its prosperous Greater Bay Area, as well as major markets in Asia and around the world.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Cissy Chan, an executive director with the authority, said the Airport City will integrate commercial and cultural activities, and will be a key economic driver for Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said the project would not only consolidate Hong Kong’s status as an international aviation hub, but also boost the city’s development in art trading and entertainment.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Airport Authority said the project would cost about HK$100 billion, including HK$30 billion on infrastructure.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police say they believe they have caught one of four people who raided a jewellery store in Sheung Shui on Wednesday evening and the man, 23, will be charged with robbery.
 <br>
  <br>
  Jewellery worth HK$1.5 million was stolen from a shop on San Fung Avenue by a group of people wielding knives and hammers who escaped in a private car, officers said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Weapons believed to be linked to the raid were later found in a car involved in a crash on Lam Kam Road, while clothes and masks officers suspect were worn by the robbers were found on a nearby hillside.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Through our investigation, we suspect that the vehicle that we mentioned had been surveilling the crime scene a couple of days before the incident took place," Chief Inspector Law Like-him said at a media briefing.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We suspect this shows it was a pre-planned, organised crime."
  <br>
  <br>
  The suspect, who was arrested in Pat Heung in the early hours of Thursday, is expected to appear in Tuen Mun Magistrates' Courts on Saturday, police said.

 Another Hongkonger held captive in Southeast Asia has been released and returned to Hong Kong on Thursday, officials said.
 <br>
  <br>
  No details were revealed as to what had happened to the SAR resident or how their ordeal came to an end.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Security Bureau, along with colleagues from the police force and the Immigration Department, immediately went to the airport to follow up, confirming that the rescued individual had arrived safely," an official post on social media said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Secretary for Security Chris Tang described the return as "good news".
  <br>
  <br>
  "My team and I will continue to follow up and hope that every Hong Kong resident [detained] can come home safely," he wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier this week, officials said 12 Hongkongers were being held prisoner in Myanmar and Cambodia after being tricked into travelling to Thailand on the false promise of well-paid work there. The captives are said to have been forced into taking part in scams.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police on Wednesday said two women also recently returned to Hong Kong after suffering a similar fate, with their families paying ransoms to secure their release.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tang met representatives from the Royal Thai Consulate-General on Thursday to discuss rescue plans for those still detained in the region.
  <br>
  <br>
  A government taskforce also went to Bangkok earlier this week to talk to officials there about the situation.

    First successful launch for Blue Origin rocket

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Blue Origin, the space company founded by billionaire Jeff Bezos, launched its massive New Glenn rocket for the first time early on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The rocket, whose inaugural mission had been delayed by several years, blasted off from the Cape Canaveral Space Force Base in Florida.
  <br>
  <br>
  The mission is seen as critical to Blue Origin's efforts to compete with Elon Musk's SpaceX, which dominates the commercial space industry.
  <br>
  <br>
  "LIFTOFF! New Glenn is beginning its first ever ascent toward the stars," Blue Origin said on social media platform X.
  <br>
  <br>
  "New Glenn has passed the Karman line, the internationally recognised boundary of space!" the firm posted just a few minutes later.
  <br>
  <br>
  And then: "Second stage engine cutoff confirmed. New Glenn's second stage and payload are now in orbit."
  <br>
  <br>
  An initial test launch of the towering 98-metre rocket, dubbed New Glenn in honour of the legendary American astronaut John Glenn, had been scrubbed early on Monday morning after repeated halts during the countdown.
  <br>
  <br>
  The company later said it had discovered an icing issue on a purge line and would aim for a possible early Tuesday morning launch, but that weather conditions were unfavourable.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Monday night, Blue Origin announced that launch had been postponed.
  <br>
  <br>
  With the mission, dubbed NG-1, Amazon founder Bezos is taking aim at the only man in the world wealthier than him: fellow tech innovator Musk.
  <br>
  <br>
  Musk's company SpaceX dominates the orbital launch market through its prolific Falcon 9 rockets, which have become vital for the commercial sector, the Pentagon and Nasa.
  <br>
  <br>
  "SpaceX has for the past several years been pretty much the only game in town, and so having a competitor... this is great," G. Scott Hubbard, a retired senior Nasa official, earlier told reporters, expecting the competition to drive down costs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Upping the high-stakes rivalry, SpaceX also plans another orbital test this week of Starship -- its gargantuan new-generation rocket.
  <br>
  <br>
  Blue Origin will now attempt to land New Glenn's first-stage booster on a drone ship stationed about 1,000 kilometres downrange in the Atlantic Ocean.
  <br>
  <br>
  SpaceX has made such landings now routine, but this will be Blue Origin's first shot at the sci-fi feat.
  <br>
  <br>
  High seas last week caused the New Glenn launch to be pushed back several days.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the rocket's upper stage will fire its engines toward Earth orbit, reaching a maximum altitude of roughly 12,000 miles above the surface.
  <br>
  <br>
  A US Defence Department-funded prototype of an advanced spaceship called Blue Ring, which could one day journey through the solar system, will remain aboard for the roughly six-hour test flight.
  <br>
  <br>
  Blue Origin has experience landing its New Shepard rockets -- used for suborbital tourism -- but they are five times smaller and land on terra firma rather than a ship at sea.
  <br>
  <br>
  Physically, the gleaming white New Glenn dwarfs SpaceX's 230-foot Falcon 9 and is designed for heavier payloads.
  <br>
  <br>
  It slots between Falcon 9 and its big sibling, Falcon Heavy, in terms of mass capacity but holds an edge with its wider payload fairing, capable of carrying the equivalent of 20 moving trucks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Blue Origin has already secured a Nasa contract to launch two Mars probes aboard New Glenn.
  <br>
  <br>
  The rocket will also support the deployment of Project Kuiper, a satellite Internet constellation designed to compete with Starlink.
  <br>
  <br>
  For now, however, SpaceX maintains a commanding lead, while other rivals -- United Launch Alliance, Arianespace, and Rocket Lab -- trail far behind. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chipmaking giant TSMC on Thursday announced a better-than-expected net profit for the fourth quarter as it benefits from booming demand for AI technology.
 <br>
  <br>
  The company is the world's largest contract maker of chips that are used in everything from Apple's iPhones to Nvidia's cutting-edge artificial intelligence hardware.
  <br>
  <br>
  The firm said net profit for the three months to December jumped 57 percent on-year to NT$374.7 billion (US$11.4 billion).
  <br>
  <br>
  That was better than the NT$369.8 billion forecast by analysts, and underscores expectations for sustained spending on AI infrastructure from the likes of Microsoft and Amazon.
  <br>
  <br>
  Net revenue for the fourth quarter rose 38.8 percent to NT$868.46 billion, TMSC said, beating forecasts. (AFP)

    First concert test to happen at main Kai Tak Stadium

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A charity concert is set to take place on Saturday at Kai Tak Sports Park, marking the main stadium's inaugural non-sporting event, with authorities saying it will serve as a test to simulate the logistics for future large-scale performances at the venue.
 <br>
  <br>
  Authorities said approximately 18,000 spectators will attend, with about 4,000 gathering on the ground-level turf area.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tang King-shing, the venue's director for strategic planning, said that assessing the turf's use will be one area of focus during their testing.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The stage and the spectators will be sitting on protective layer using I-track, it's the name of the protective layer, so there won't be any question of damaging the turf itself. So that's why before we have been emphasising the fact that as far as the surface of the main stadium is concerned, it's a flexible arrangement," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We can use genuine turf for high-quality football or rugby events and use the layer underneath, the I-track, for concert events like the one coming this Saturday by simply removing the turf."
  <br>
  <br>
  Commissioner for Sports George Tsoi said event organisers have chosen to close the roof for this concert to better test their acoustics and audio effects.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We hope we can have the opportunity to test out all the different elements and the coordination amongst our different staff and as well as the arrival and dispersal of our audience," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We hope that we can have good experience and further improve our operations in future."
  <br>
  <br>
  Tsoi said doors will open for concert goers at 4pm, with the performance scheduled to start at 6pm and wrap up before 8pm.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that attendees should have already gotten their tickets in advance and they should review the list of prohibited items prior to arriving.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tsoi said more test events are to come, with each one increasing in scale and sophistication, highlighting another large test on January 24 with over 60,000 participants to prepare for the official opening of the Sports Park in March.
  <br>
  <br>
  Principal Transport Officer/Urban of the Transport Department Eric Wan said the MTR will implement special service arrangements, including increased train frequencies, and KMB and Citybus will organise three bus routes serving East Kowloon, West Kowloon and Hong Kong Island during the dispersal period.

<img alt="Chris Tang says different parties are doing what they can to get 12 SAR residents freed from criminal gangs in Southeast Asia. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1787795_1_20250116130412.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Security minister Chris Tang said on Thursday that a government taskforce's trip to Thailand this week has improved the chances of securing the release of a dozen Hongkongers being held captive in Southeast Asia.
 <br>
  <br>
  Tang said the delegation, led by his deputy Michael Cheuk, exchanged important information with Thai counterparts, as well as the Chinese Embassy.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Of course our country helps a lot. During their trip, our officials met officials at the Chinese Embassy in Thailand. Organisations from our country are also working behind the scenes to get the 12 home safely," he told NOW TV.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tang conceded, however, that it will not be easy to rescue those being held prisoner.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will do everything we can in the hope that we can secure the safe return of the 12," the minister said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tang said the Hongkongers, in their early 20s to 40s, were tricked into travelling to Thailand by gangs who falsely promised them well-paid jobs and good accommodation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two other SAR residents who suffered a similar fate were recently freed after their families paid ransoms, according to the police. Tang said people should contact the police if they are asked to hand over money to secure the release of relatives held captive.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tang also offered advice for people who suspect they have been tricked into travelling abroad, saying they should scream while in a public place and seek help immediately.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said from 2022 to 2023, 46 people from Hong Kong were deceived into working for scamming syndicates in Southeast Asia, with the majority eventually returning to the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said such crimes resurfaced in the second quarter of last year.

<div class="itemFullText">
 World No. 2 Iga Swiatek romped into the third round of the Australian Open on Thursday to set up a high-profile clash with 2021 US Open champion Emma Raducanu.
 <br>
  <br>
  While Poland's Swiatek was racing past World No. 49 Rebecca Sramkova 6-0, 6-2 at the Rod Laver Arena, Britain's Raducanu was entering uncharted waters at the nearby Kia Arena.
  <br>
  <br>
  Raducanu had reached the second round in Melbourne on three previous occasions but never advanced further.
  <br>
  <br>
  She was forced to battle in a topsy-turvy match against her good friend Amanda Anisimova of the United States, with both players exchanging multiple breaks before the Briton came through 6-3, 7-5.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Melbourne Park's centre court, Swiatek broke the Slovakian's opening service game and never looked back.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sramkova was playing in a Grand Slam second round for the first time and had no answer to the precision and power of the Pole.
  <br>
  <br>
  Swiatek won 64 percent of points off the Slovakian's first serve in an opening set that lasted 27 minutes, the Pole dropping just 10 points.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sramkova finally got on the board in the eighth game of the match, to huge cheers from the a sympathetic crowd.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Swiatek remained in control, closing out a comprehensive victory after exactly one hour.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I felt really solid today and it was a really efficient game," said Swiatek. "I'm happy that I kept my focus."
  <br>
  <br>
  Raducanu said she was looking forward to the challenge of playing against Swiatek.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It will be a very good match for me," she said of facing the five-time Grand Slam champion. (AFP)

 Sources on Thursday said a man has been arrested in Pat Heung, in connection with an armed robbery in Sheung Shui the previous evening.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a statement released earlier, police said they suspect that four men, wielding knives and hammers, had robbed a jewellery shop on San Fung Avenue at around 6.30pm on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officers said the suspects fled the scene in a private car, which later crashed with another vehicle on Lam Kam Road near Ng Tung Chai.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police said three men then fled the crash scene.

<img alt="Lawmaker Johnny Ng says there's no urgent need to raise the amber travel alert for Thailand, given it remains safe to travel there. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1787765_1_20250116094448.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A lawmaker on Thursday said the great importance that both Hong Kong and Thai officials have attached to tackling the problem of so-called scam farms in Southeast Asian countries will help prevent citizens falling prey to fake job offers in future.
 <br>
  <br>
  This came as police in Hong Kong arrested a woman for allegedly luring two females from the SAR to Southeast Asia and forcing them to take part in scams.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 32-year-old has been charged with conspiracy to defraud.
  <br>
  <br>
  Undersecretary for Security Michael Cheuk led a delegation to Thailand earlier in the week to help 12 Hong Kong residents who were detained in Myanmar and Cambodia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme, Johnny Ng noted the two governments took the matter very seriously.
  <br>
  <br>
  He believes this will allow the public to realise the seriousness of the matter.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is a very, very good education to let the general public know that we cannot take free air tickets, or free hotels, hospitality... in order to get more unbalanced [rewards] from some jobs," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He suggested the SAR government reach out to its Myanmar and Cambodian counterparts directly, as well as step up cooperation with international police with the help of the central government.
  <br>
  <br>
  While Hong Kong raised the travel alert for Thailand to amber in 2014 due to mass demonstrations in the country, Ng said there was no urgent need to raise the alert level amid the current situation, as it remains a safe destination.

    South Korea's Yoon refuses to attend questioning

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korea's arrested President Yoon Suk Yeol does not intend to take part in a second day of questioning on Thursday, his lawyer said, further stonewalling a criminal probe into whether he committed insurrection with his martial law bid.
 <br>
  <br>
  Yoon, the first sitting South Korean president to be arrested, was taken to the Seoul Detention Centre on Wednesday evening after refusing to cooperate, where he was expected to have spent the night in a solitary cell.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities have 48 hours to question the suspended president, after which they must release him or seek a warrant to detain him for up to 20 days.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon's refusal to cooperate with investigators comes as the Constitutional Court is due to hold a second hearing in his impeachment trial to determine whether to remove him permanently or reinstate his presidential powers.
  <br>
  <br>
  South Korea is grappling with a political crisis sparked by Yoon's brief attempt to impose martial law on December 3 that was voted down by parliament.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon's arrest on Wednesday ended a weeks-long standoff with authorities after police swooped before dawn on his fortified hillside villa in Seoul to the despair of followers at the site.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon said he turned himself in for questioning by corruption investigation officials to prevent what he called the risk of "unsavoury bloodshed", though he continued to protest that it was an illegal investigation and invalid arrest warrant.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon has up to now refused to talk with investigators who had prepared a questionnaire of more than 200 pages, an official from the Corruption Investigation Office for High-ranking Officials (CIO) that is heading the criminal inquiry said on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The embattled leader did not even reply to a question, a CIO official said.
  <br>
  <br>
  His questioning is due to resume at 2 pm local time, on Thursday, according to CIO.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Yoon Kab-keun, one of Yoon’s lawyers, said in a text message to reporters that Yoon would not show up for the questioning.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yonhap reported the same lawyer as citing Yoon's health as a factor and saying further questioning was pointless, without elaborating.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CIO official said he understood it was possible to forcibly bring Yoon for questioning but would make further checks on relevant laws.
  <br>
  <br>
  A small crowd of protesters supporting Yoon gathered and sat on a road outside the CIO office, calling the president's arrest illegitimate.
  <br>
  <br>
  Opinion polls show a majority of South Koreans support impeaching Yoon, but the attempts to arrest him appear to have rallied his hardcore supporters. (Reuters)

 The Vietnam government said late on Wednesday that it would consider removing regulatory hurdles to allow aircraft manufactured by Chinese state-owned planemaker COMAC to operate in the country.
 <br>
  <br>
  COMAC is seeking to establish itself as an alternative to leading planemakers, Airbus and Boeing. Right now, its two passenger plane models currently operate almost exclusively within mainland China, and the company seeks to expand its presence in international markets.
  <br>
  <br>
  Before an airline can operate any aircraft model, it must receive approval from the national aviation regulator.
  <br>
  <br>
  Deputy Prime Minister Tran Hong Ha assigned the transport ministry to review existing rules to remove regulatory hurdles to enable COMAC planes to operate in Vietnam, the government said in a statement, after a meeting in Hanoi between Ha and COMAC Board Director Tan Wangeng.
  <br>
  <br>
  COMAC has been eyeing Vietnam as a potential market for some time, and conducted a Southeast Asia marketing tour last February, during which it flew two demonstration planes to the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ha said as an initial step low-cost carrier VietJet, Vietnam's leading private airline, may work with a Chinese airline operating COMAC planes to test aircraft on some routes. (Reuters)

    Crews report progress against LA-area wildfires

<div class="itemFullText">
 Firefighters reported significant gains on Wednesday against the two massive wildfires burning around Los Angeles, while also extinguishing smaller blazes set by arsonists in recent days as a final round of windy, flame-fanning weather moved through Southern California.
 <br>
  <br>
  A Particularly Dangerous Situation red-flag warning expired in the afternoon, but dry conditions and gusty winds were forecast to linger into Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  So much of the nation’s second-most populous metropolitan region remained on alert for new outbreaks and flare-ups from the fires, which have killed at least 25 people and destroyed thousands of homes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier on Wednesday, gusts whipped up to 80 kph in the mountains, though many areas saw relatively light winds late in the morning, according to the National Weather Service.
  <br>
  <br>
  Better conditions expected in the coming days should help fire crews make even more headway and allow residents to return to their neighbourhoods to begin rebuilding.
  <br>
  <br>
  Still, firefighters and police faced new challenges. Since the beginning of the wildfire outbreak last week, authorities have arrested about half a dozen people accused of setting new, small fires that were quickly knocked down.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities have not determined a cause for the major blazes in what is on track to become the nation’s costliest fire disaster.
  <br>
  <br>
  More manageable winds on Tuesday allowed firefighters to make gains on the two most destructive fires. Almost half of the Eaton Fire just north of LA was contained, and one-fifth of the fire that destroyed much of the seaside neighbourhood of Pacific Palisades was surrounded.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both of those broke out on January 7. (AP)

    Biden warns dangerous oligarchy taking shape in US

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Joe Biden urged Americans on Wednesday to "stand guard" against threats from oligarchs, disinformation and AI in a future under Donald Trump as he delivered a dark farewell address ahead of stepping down next week.
 <br>
  <br>
  Biden, who will be succeeded by Trump on Monday, touted his achievements in steering the US economy out of the deep crisis inflicted by the Covid-19 pandemic, and said he had made the nation's alliances abroad stronger.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, in his brief Oval Office speech on live television, the Democrat quickly turned to painting a series of dangers facing the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  Clearly referring to Trump's close ties to the world's richest man Elon Musk and other tech tycoons, Biden said an "oligarchy is taking shape in America" - and "a dangerous concentration of power."
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the ultra-rich around Trump represented a concentration of "extreme wealth, power and influence that literally threatens our entire democracy."
  <br>
  <br>
  Biden recalled the stark warning issued by president Dwight Eisenhower in his own farewell address in 1961 about the dangers of an out-of-control military industrial complex.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm equally concerned about the potential rise of a tech industrial complex," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  And a "crumbling" media means Americans are increasingly vulnerable.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Americans are being buried under an avalanche of misinformation and disinformation, enabling the abuse of power," the outgoing president said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Also clearly referring to Trump's plans to roll back environmental protections and withdraw from a major international global accord on combating global warming, Biden said "powerful forces want to wield their unchecked influence to eliminate the steps we've taken to tackle the climate crisis, to serve their own interest for power and profit."
  <br>
  <br>
  Naming another increasingly global challenge, Biden said artificial intelligence "is the most consequential technology of our time" that could bring huge benefits but also poses "risks for our economy and our security, our society." (AFP)

 UK patients are "coming to harm" as nurses say they are having to treat people in corridors and unsuitable places because of a "collapse in care standards", a report said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  In the latest indictment of Britain's beleaguered state-funded National Health Service, nine in 10 NHS nurses surveyed by the country's nurses union said "patient safety is being compromised".
  <br>
  <br>
  Nearly seven in 10 said they were delivering care in "overcrowded or unsuitable places" on a "daily basis", including in corridors, converted cupboards, car parks and even bereavement rooms.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The experiences of over 5,000 nursing staff across the UK highlight a devastating collapse in care standards, with patients routinely coming to harm," said the Royal College of Nursing (RCN).
  <br>
  <br>
  The report condemns the "normalisation" of so-called "corridor care", with nurses unable to access life-saving equipment in cramped spaces and patients even dying in corridors.
  <br>
  <br>
  One nurse in east England said corridor care in their hospital trust was "not an exception, it's the rule".
  <br>
  <br>
  Last month, some 54,000 patients in emergency departments in England had to wait over 12 hours until a hospital bed was available, up 23 percent from December 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among the RCN report testimonies are accounts of nurses treating up to 40 patients waiting in a corridor, as well as reports of pregnant women miscarrying in corridors.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some reported overcrowded corridors impeding them from giving life-saving resuscitation (CPR). One nurse recalled a patient dying after a cardiac arrest "by the male toilet".
  <br>
  <br>
  Another alleged having to treat cardiac arrests "with no crash bell, crash trolley, oxygen, defibrillator... straddling a patient doing CPR while everyone watches on".
  <br>
  <br>
  There are some 7.5 million people on the NHS waiting list, with more than three million having faced delays longer than 18 weeks for treatment. (AFP)

    Indonesia to push social media protections

<img alt="Nearly 50 percent of children under 12 in tech-savvy Indonesia use the internet. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1787715_1_20250115215818.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Indonesia is planning to impose interim child protection guidelines on social media companies while the government carves out a law to set a minimum age for users of the platforms.
 <br>
  <br>
  Communications minister Meutya Hafid has said the government plans to issue a regulation to set a minimum age for social media users, after discussing the proposal to protect children online with President Prabowo Subianto.
  <br>
  <br>
  It follows Australia's decision to ban children under 16 from accessing social media, with fines for tech giants from Instagram and Facebook owner Meta to TikTok, owned by China's ByteDance, if they fail to prevent children from accessing their platforms.
  <br>
  <br>
  "What the minister means is that the government is headed for the direction of a stronger regulation on age limit, which is through the formation of a law," said Alexander Sabar, a senior official at the communications and digital ministry.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the meantime, he said the government will issue a regulation for digital platforms, including social media companies, to adhere to child protection guidelines.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The emphasis for the government regulation is child protection - how they are protected from physical, mental, or moral perils," he said, adding that the regulation would not totally limit children's access to social media.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nurmayanti, a 46-year-old mother of three, said she agreed with the plan to curtail social media content, particularly content promoting pornography or discrimination.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They now can freely open social media so that is concerning to us as parents," she said, adding the law must be strict and clear.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, Anis Hidayah, a commissioner at Indonesia's main human rights body, said that limiting the internet for children was important but the government must be careful not to curb their right to information.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nearly 50 percent of children under 12 in tech-savvy Indonesia use the internet, with some respondents of that age group using Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok, according to a survey by the Indonesia internet service providers' association. (Reuters)

    Thousands across Gaza celebrate ceasefire deal

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Crowds of Gazans chanted and embraced on Wednesday as news spread that a ceasefire and hostage release deal had been reached between Israel and Hamas aimed at ending more than 15 months of war in the Palestinian territory.
 <br>
  <br>
  After a US official and a source close to the negotiations first revealed the agreement, Israel cautioned that several points "remain unresolved" that it hoped would be addressed.
  <br>
  <br>
  But celebrations were already underway in Gaza, where journalists saw crowds of people hugging and taking photos to mark the announcement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I can't believe that this nightmare of more than a year is finally coming to an end. We have lost so many people, we've lost everything," said Randa Sameeh, a 45-year-old who was displaced from Gaza City to the Nuseirat Camp in the centre of the territory.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We need a lot of rest. As soon as the truce begins, I will go to the cemetery to visit my brother and family members. We buried them in Deir el-Balah cemetery without proper graves. We will build them new graves and write their names on them."
  <br>
  <br>
  Outside Deir al-Balah's Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital, where so many of the war's casualties have been taken, hundreds of Palestinians gathered to chant, sing and wave flags, AFPTV footage showed.
  <br>
  <br>
  At one point, a member of the crowd and a journalist in body armour were raised on people's shoulders to conduct an interview above the mass of elated Palestinians.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, The "final details" of the Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal are still being worked on, the office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in the early hours of Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke to US President Joe Biden and President-elect Donald Trump on Wednesday to thank them for helping to secure a deal for the release of hostages held in Gaza, his office said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gaza's civil defence agency said at least 20 people were killed in Israeli strikes after a ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas was announced on Wednesday. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Arsenal reignited their Premier League title challenge with a stirring fightback to beat Tottenham 2-1 in the north London derby.
 <br>
  <br>
  Mikel Arteta's side were rocked by Son Heung-min's early opener at the Emirates Stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  But they seized the bragging rights against their bitter rivals thanks to Dominic Solanke's own goal and Leandro Trossard's strike just before half-time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal's first win in four games in all competitions lifted them within four points of leaders Liverpool, who were held to a 1-1 draw by Nottingham Forest on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool's game in hand on Arsenal still makes them title favourites, but the Gunners are at least applying some pressure on Arne Slot's men.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beaten 2-0 by Newcastle in the League Cup semi-final first leg last week and eliminated from the FA Cup third round by 10-man Manchester United on penalties on Sunday, Arsenal were desperate for a response and Tottenham once again proved their ideal opponents.
  <br>
  <br>
  Questions have been asked of Arteta's ability to add more silverware to the 2020 FA Cup, which remains the only trophy of a reign that started in 2019.
  <br>
  <br>
  With Bukayo Saka already sidelined due to hamstring surgery, Gabriel Jesus's potentially season-ending knee injury had added to Arteta's woes.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Arsenal have now won seven and drawn one of their last eight league games against Tottenham.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mikel Arteta's team are now on 43 points after 21 matches, four points behind Liverpool.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We had some big chances and big situations. At the end we had to suffer more than we wanted," he said. "When you have opportunities to close the gap, you have to take them. We are on a really consistent run in the Premier League."
  <br>
  <br>
  But it was another painful blow for under-fire Tottenham boss Ange Postecoglou, whose team are just eight points above the relegation zone.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We let Arsenal dictate the game," Postecoglou said after the match. "Second half was a little better but nowhere near good enough – not acceptable."
  <br>
  <br>
  Postecoglou must find a solution to the inconsistency that saw them beat Liverpool 1-0 in the League Cup semi-final first leg before needing extra-time to see off fifth tier Tamworth in the FA Cup third round.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tottenham are without a win in their last five league games, losing four of those to drop to 13th place.
  <br>
  <br>
  Raheem Sterling wasted a golden opportunity to put Arsenal ahead in the opening moments when his heavy touch allowed Djed Spence to clear after the winger raced through on goal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Looking wracked with nerves, Tottenham keeper Antonin Kinsky was fortunate not to gift a goal to Arsenal on his Premier League debut after taking too long to clear, with Kai Havertz unable to apply the finishing touch.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Alexander Isak fired Newcastle into the Premier League's top four after scoring twice in a 3-0 cruise against Wolves.
  <br>
  <br>
  Red-hot Isak found the net for the eighth league match in a row as the Magpies leapfrogged faltering Chelsea into fourth spot in the table.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Swedish international put the home side ahead in the 34th minute when his shot took a huge deflection off Wolves defender Rayan Ait-Nouri, leaving Jose Sa wrong-footed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Isak doubled Newcastle's lead shortly before the hour mark, controlling Bruno Guimaraes' pass before firing home for his 15th league goal of the season and Anthony Gordon added a third.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eddie Howe's men, who have now won six straight league games, have recovered strongly from a lengthy poor spell to make a powerful case for a Champions League spot next season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Taking advantage of the faltering form of Manchester City and Chelsea, they are just three points behind third-placed Nottingham Forest.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere, David Moyes' return as Everton manager failed to muster a response from the toothless Toffees in a 1-0 home defeat to Aston Villa on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ollie Watkins' winner early in the second half lifted Villa up to seventh, just three points off the Premier League's top four.
  <br>
  <br>
  By contrast, 16th-placed Everton are looking over their shoulders, just one point above the relegation zone.
  <br>
  <br>
  A run of no wins and just one goal in his last five games in charge cost Sean Dyche his job as Everton boss. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 US stocks jumped on Wednesday, reversing a recent decline as traders responded enthusiastically to strong bank earnings and data indicating a slowdown in underlying inflation.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 1.7 percent at 43,221, while the broad-based S&P 500 jumped 1.8 percent to 5,949.
  <br>
  <br>
  The day's largest gains came in the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index, which surged by 2.5 percent to end the day at 19,511.
  <br>
  <br>
  US financial heavyweights including JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs reported soaring profits Wednesday propelled by strength in trading and financial advisory services.
  <br>
  <br>
  And fresh data showed headline inflation rose in the 12 months to December, but actually eased once volatile food and energy prices were stripped out, fueling optimism in the markets.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There's a lot of relief from the (inflation) data this morning," Angelo Kourkafas from Edward Jones told AFP, noting there had been a positive reaction in the markets to the decline in the so-called "core" inflation measure.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yields on long-dated US Treasurys including the popular two- and 10-year notes dropped sharply as investors piled back into bonds and pushed up prices, which move inversely to yields.

  Among individual firms, Tesla's shares soared by 8.0 percent, as did those of Bank of New York Mellon after it reported strong quarterly earnings results. (AFP)

    Drake sues Universal over Kendrick diss track

<img alt="Last year the two superstar rappers exchanged a litany of increasingly vitriolic diss tracks. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1787739_1_20250116055306.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Rapper Drake on Wednesday filed suit against his own label, saying Universal Music Group's release and promotion of a Kendrick Lamar track dissing him amounted to defamation and harassment.
 <br>
  <br>
  UMG, which is behind both Drake and Lamar, adamantly denied the accusations, saying "the notion that we would seek to harm the reputation of any artist -- let alone Drake -- is illogical" given the company's longtime investment in helping him "achieve historic commercial and personal financial success."
  <br>
  <br>
  Last year the two superstar rappers exchanged a litany of increasingly vitriolic diss tracks, with Lamar delivering the major blow with his chart-topping, Grammy-nominated song "Not Like Us."
  <br>
  <br>
  In his suit, Drake said Universal betrayed him in favor of profits by promoting the song with punchlines that accuse him of pedophilia.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the documents filed in Manhattan's federal court, Drake says Universal "approved, published, and launched a campaign to create a viral hit out of a rap track" that was "intended to convey the specific, unmistakable, and false factual allegation that Drake is a criminal pedophile, and to suggest that the public should resort to vigilante justice in response."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Canadian artist born Aubrey Drake Graham, 38, says the record company chose "corporate greed over the safety and well-being of its artists."
  <br>
  <br>
  The lawsuit cited the track's promotion as causing a "physical threat to Drake's safety" as well as a "bombardment of online harassment."
  <br>
  <br>
  It cited a pre-dawn shooting last May that saw a gunman wound a security guard at the superstar rapper's estate in Toronto, and described subsequent break-in attempts.
  <br>
  <br>
  "These events were not coincidental," the suit said, before detailing the defamation allegations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Drake, the reigning highest-grossing rapper, is not taking legal action against Lamar, and he is not suing over the lyrics themselves. (AFP)

    Israel and Hamas agree to Gaza ceasefire deal

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Israel and Hamas agreed to a deal to halt fighting in Gaza and exchange Israeli hostages for Palestinian prisoners, an official briefed on the deal told Reuters on Wednesday, opening the way to a possible end to a 15-month war that has upended the Middle East.
 <br>
  <br>
  The agreement follows months of on-off negotiations brokered by Egyptian and Qatari mediators, with the backing of the United States, and came just ahead of the Jan. 20 inauguration of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israeli troops invaded Gaza after Hamas-led gunmen broke through security barriers and burst into Israeli communities on Oct. 7, 2023, killing 1,200 and kidnapping more than 250 people.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel's campaign in Gaza has killed more than 46,000 people, mostly women and children, and left the narrow coastal enclave a wasteland of rubble, with hundreds of thousands surviving the winter cold in tents and makeshift shelters.
  <br>
  <br>
  As his inauguration approached, Trump repeated his demand that a deal be done swiftly, warning repeatedly that there would be "hell to pay" if the hostages were not released. His Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff worked with President Joe Biden's team to push the deal over the line.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Israel, the return of the hostages may ease some of the public anger against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his right-wing government over the Oct. 7 security failure and not securing a hostage deal until now.
  <br>
  <br>
  The conflict spread across the Middle East, with groups in Lebanon, Iraq and Yemen attacking Israel in solidarity with the Palestinians. (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The SAR’s footballers had to settle for a 1-1 draw against Guangdong in the first leg of the Guangdong-Hong Kong Cup on Wednesday evening.
 <br>
  <br>
  The only goal for the SAR, playing away at Yuexiushan Stadium in Guangzhou, came in the 38th minute from captain Stefan Pereira.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SAR team made a run down the left flank and the ball was eventually crossed to Lau Ka-kiu in the penalty area.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Lee Man forward then passed it to Pereira, who took a shot that deflected off a defender, and found its way to the back of the net.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong side had another chance to score after the break, as Alexander Jojo headed the ball from a corner kick but was denied by the post.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trying to respond, the home side ramped up their attacks in the second half and it paid off.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jojo was penalised for a handball in the box in the 74th minute, and Guangdong substitute Jiang Zhipeng nailed the penalty to equalise.
  <br>
  <br>
  Neither team managed to score any more goals.
  <br>
  <br>
  The return leg will be played at Hong Kong Stadium next Wednesday to decide the aggregate winner. RTHK will broadcast that match live.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last year marked the return of the competition for the first time since 2019, and Guangdong won it in a penalty shootout.

 Police on Wednesday said they arrested a man for attempted snatching, after the 39-year-old allegedly tried to take a police officer’s gun at the Tsim Sha Tsui police station.
 <br>
  <br>
  A statement said officers subdued the man, who was held at the station for an investigation in another case.
  <br>
  <br>
  The force said the arrested person is an off-duty officer who had earlier been arrested on suspicion of voyeurism.
  <br>
  <br>
  The man, along with two officers who subdued him, sustained injuries and was taken to hospital.

    China 'firmly opposes' new US tech curbs on smart cars

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Beijing on Wednesday said it "firmly opposes" a US move to effectively bar Chinese technology from smart cars in the American market, saying alleged risks to national security were "without any factual basis".
 <br>
  <br>
  "Such actions disrupt economic and commercial cooperation between enterprises... and represent typical protectionism and economic coercion," Foreign Ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun said, adding: "China firmly opposes this."
  <br>
  <br>
  Tuesday's announcement in the United States, which also pertains to Russian technology, came as the Biden administration wrapped up efforts to increase American tech curbs, and after a months-long regulatory process.
  <br>
  <br>
  US Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said that modern vehicles contain cameras, microphones, GPS tracking and other technologies connected to the Internet.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Cars today aren't just steel on wheels -- they're computers," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Guo slammed the move, telling journalists in Beijing that China would "take necessary measures" to safeguard its legitimate rights and interests.
  <br>
  <br>
  "What I want to say is that the US, citing so-called national security, has restricted the use of Chinese connected vehicle software, hardware, and entire vehicles in the United States without any factual basis," said Guo.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China urges the US to stop the erroneous practice of over generalising national security and to stop its unreasonable suppression of Chinese companies." (AFP/Xinhua)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police in Hong Kong on Wednesday said they had arrested and charged a woman after two people from the SAR were lured to Southeast Asia and forced to take part in scams, with the victims' families paying ransoms to have them freed.
 <br>
  <br>
  The announcement came as SAR officials vowed to work with Bangkok to try to rescue a dozen Hongkongers being held captive in countries neighbouring Thailand.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police said a beauty worker, 32, had been charged with conspiracy to defraud and was due to appear at Shatin Magistrates' Courts on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a press conference, officers said she was suspected of enticing two women, aged 21 and 23, to Thailand in late December. The women were driven to a "scam hub" in Myanmar where they were forced to take part in fraudulent activities, officers said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The pair returned to Hong Kong this month after their families paid ransoms, police said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The women told officers there were armed guards at the site where they were held and the area was surrounded by a barbed wire fence.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chief Inspector Yu Pok-hon said the arrested woman is believed to have socialised with the two victims to gain their trust, before offering them free travel and job opportunities in Thailand.
  <br>
  <br>
  The force urged people to be wary of online adverts promising jobs with large salaries, and not to put too much trust in friends they have made only recently.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Security Secretary Chris Tang said he has been briefed by a government task force sent to Thailand over reports of other Hongkongers being held in dangerous locations after being tricked into travelling to Bangkok.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tang said the administration will continue to liaise with Thai authorities to bring home 12 SAR residents being held prisoner in Myanmar and Cambodia.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than a dozen other victims have already returned to Hong Kong, officials said on Tuesday.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Ukrainian authorities in the west of the country on Wednesday said that critical infrastructure facilities had been targeted in a "massive" Russian missile attack.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Critical infrastructure facilities were targeted in Prykarpattia," the regional governor of the western Ivano-Frankivsk region wrote on social media.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Air defence forces were working in the region," the official, Svitlana Onyshchuk, said, adding there were no casualties and that the situation was "under control."
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities in the western Lviv region, which borders EU and Nato member Poland, said two critical infrastructure facilities had been hit in the Drogobych and Stryi districts, without elaborating.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Fortunately, there were no casualties, but there was damage," governor Maksym Kozytsky wrote on social media.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Ukrainian national grid operator meanwhile announced it was introducing emergency blackouts in seven regions including the eastern Donetsk region.
  <br>
  <br>
  The apparent barrage came just one day after Ukraine said it had carried out its largest aerial attack on Russian territory, hitting factories and energy hubs hundreds of miles from the front line.

  Russia's Defence Ministry confirmed the attack on Tuesday, accusing Ukraine of using US- and British-made long-range missiles and drones.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement on Wednesday, the ministry said that its forces had "carried out a group strike with precision-guided weapons and attack drones against critical gas and energy infrastructure supporting the work of Ukraine's military-industrial complex." (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Wednesday said that Hong Kong saw 44.5 million tourist arrivals in 2024, in part boosted by Beijing's relaxation of visa rules for Shenzhen residents.
 <br>
  <br>
  Tourism minister Rosanna Law said the figure represented a near one-third increase from the year before, and was in line with estimates.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since the start of December, Shenzhen residents with the visas have been allowed to visit the SAR for as many times as they like, compared to a previous restriction of one trip per week.
  <br>
  <br>
  Law said last month, there were more than 3.1 million mainland visitor arrivals, or an average of more than 100,000 a day.
  <br>
  <br>
  That was a 17-percent rise from the daily average in November.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The government will make good use of the various measures benefiting Hong Kong to promote the all-round development of Hong Kong’s tourism industry," the minister said in a written reply to the legislature.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said officials will maintain communication with different ministries of the central government, with a view to enable more travellers from the mainland to visit the SAR in a flexible and convenient manner.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Tourism Board, meanwhile, noted that for the annual number of visitors, more than 10 million were from places outside the mainland, representing a 44 percent jump year on year.
  <br>
  <br>
  It noted that out of the 44.5 million arrivals, half of them spent at least one night in Hong Kong, and they stay for around three nights here on average.
  <br>
  <br>
  DAB lawmaker Brave Chan asked if the government would get the United Nation's culture agency, Unesco, to include Hong Kong on its list of "World Cities of Gastronomy".
  <br>
  <br>
  Law said there are now 50 such cities, with Macau, Chengdu, Shunde, Yangzhou, Huaian and Chaozhou the six Chinese places on the list.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said officials will study the matter with reference to the experience of cities on the list.

    EV charging providers urged to improve transparency

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Consumer Council on Wednesday urged charging service providers to improve transparency following complaints about electric vehicle (EV) charging facilities across Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  The watchdog received 179 complaints last year on issues such as unstable power supply, insufficient charging spots and fee disputes.
  <br>
  <br>
  In one case, an EV owner found his overnight charging sessions had been interrupted and his vehicle was left without sufficient power.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another complainant reported she was charged HK$150 in idle fees without being notified – nearly ten times the actual charging cost.
  <br>
  <br>
  The council’s chief executive, Gilly Wong, said service providers should explain the way they set fees.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is a free market, they can charge according to different business models. It could be charged by kilowatts, it could be charged by time, or it could be charged by a monthly plan,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We urge the service providers to align and standardise the unit that they use."
  <br>
  <br>
  The council reminded EV owners to carefully review charging plans and pricing details before use, and to promptly vacate charging spots to avoid idle fees.

    'Some tumblers have lower capacity than advertised'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Some brands of tumblers and travel mugs have a lower capacity than is claimed, the Consumer Council said on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The watchdog also found that plastic mugs are not as effective in keeping drinks hot or cold.
  <br>
  <br>
  The council tested 18 models of tumblers and travel mugs, which claimed a capacity from 350ml to 900ml.
  <br>
  <br>
  But only four models had the actual capacity that was stated. The rest of them held less liquid than claimed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Five mugs or tumblers, from Muji, 24Bottles, Decathlon, National Geographic, and PoleBear, were found to have a discrepancy in capacity of more than 10 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The Council reminds manufacturers that their product design must take into consideration the actual usage by consumers and clearly and accurately state on the product label the actual capacity,” said convenor of the council’s advisory group on digital economy and information technology Jack Poon.
  <br>
  <br>
  The watchdog also passed the results to the Customs and Excise Department for potential follow up actions.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the thermal insulation efficacy test, two stainless steel tumblers from NOC and Stanley performed well as they were able to keep the water temperature at over 60 degrees Celsius after six hours.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thirteen models could maintain the water temperature at above 40 degrees Celsius, but the water temperature in three plastic mugs or tumblers, dropped significantly to between 29 and 26.3 degrees.
  <br>
  <br>
  For cold drinks with temperatures from five degrees to minus one degree Celsius, temperatures from three plastic models rose to as much as 22 degrees after six hours.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two-thirds of samples showed a satisfactory performance in the leak-proof test.
  <br>
  <br>
  The council reminded people to clean their tumblers or mugs as often as they could and recommended they use tools like small brushes to wash narrow bottles.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It's better for you to clean it thoroughly because you never know when the pathogenic bacteria will breed in your container. So the cleaner it is, the better for your food safety,” the council’s chief executive Gilly Wong said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “When you buy this kind of tumbler, check out how many parts they have so that you know you have to open it up and how to clean it and put it back, ensure that you know it performs as well as its original,” she said.

    HK may import halal food for Muslim tourists: minister

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong may need to import halal food for all the Muslim tourists it aims to entice to the city, a minister said on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Plans for new measures to attract visitors from the Middle East and Southeast Asia were announced in last year's chief executive policy address.
  <br>
  <br>
  On RTHK's Overview Policy programme, Deputy Chief Secretary Warner Cheuk said as Hong Kong develops into a Muslim-friendly tourist destination, halal food could be brought in from abroad.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong may not have many Muslims, but we need to make a lot of halal food. There are many Muslim countries in Asean, and we can attract restaurants and import food from these nations," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other government moves aimed at attracting more visitors from Muslim nations include encouraging hotels to set up worship facilities, and persuading taxi drivers to provide information in Arabic.

    'Alimony mediation helps divorcees reach settlement'

<div class="itemFullText">
 A pilot scheme which helps separating or divorcing couples from low-income families handle spouse maintenance has processed nearly 40 cases in the first two months since its introduction, taking less than a month on average to close a file.
 <br>
  <br>
  In October last year, authorities introduced a programme through the Community Care Fund to offer free mediation services.
  <br>
  <br>
  The initiative, set to last for three years, aims to process a total of 1,200 cases and help 2,400 people who are going through a separation or divorce.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alice Mak, secretary for home and youth affairs, said the scheme handled 38 cases relating to alimony as of the end of November.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Sixty percent of the cases have either reached an agreement or partially made an agreement, meaning there's an outcome from the mediation. For those completed cases, it takes roughly 24 days from opening to closing a file," she said during an exclusive interview with RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We can see that these mediation services have indeed helped some divorcees to reach maintenance agreements. Some of the participants told us that they found it helpful and they would recommend programme to those in need around them."
  <br>
  <br>
  As for the remaining 40 percent, Mak said the administration would look into possible follow-up actions after collecting more data.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, the minister said her bureau and the Family Council will jointly organise the "Hong Kong Excellent Family Awards" in the second quarter, with participants being judged on a number of areas.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said families must show how well they support each other and whether they have experiences on educating the next generation which are worthy of being referenced, among other criteria.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Last year's runner-up Zheng Qinwen was knocked out of the Australian Open in the biggest shock of the tournament so far, while defending champion Aryna Sabalenka had to battle serve jitters to make the third round.
 <br>
  <br>
  Fifth seed Zheng was sent packing 7-6, 6-3 at the John Cain Arena by World No. 97 Laura Siegemund of Germany, the second-oldest player in the draw at age 36.
  <br>
  <br>
  Over on centre court Sabalenka dropped her serve three times and faced 11 break points before overcoming Spain's Jessica Bouzas Maneiro 6-3, 7-5, rattling off the last five games in a row.
  <br>
  <br>
  "She played incredible tennis today and it was a really tough one. I expected this tennis from her, I'm really glad I was able to win this match," said Sabalenka.
  <br>
  <br>
  The win kept the Belarusian World No. 1 on course for a rare hat-trick of consecutive Australian Open titles, a feat last achieved 26 years ago by Martina Hingis and only matched by four other women in history.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Olympic champion Zheng's attempt to become only the second Chinese player to win a Grand Slam singles title after Li Na is over, after being out-thought by the powerful Siegemund.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I knew I just had to play more than my best tennis. I had nothing to lose so I just told myself to swing free," said the German. (AFP)

<img alt="Miachel Cheuk accepted a petition from Kelvin, whose brother is among those detained in Southeast Asia. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1787597_2_20250115102627.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Undersecretary for Security Michael Cheuk said he hopes 12 Hong Kong residents who remain unlawfully detained in Southeast Asia can come home before Chinese New Year, as a six-member task force he led concluded their two-day trip to Thailand.
 <br>
  <br>
  Cheuk was also pleased with the progress made by the task force, and expressed gratitude to their Thai counterparts for attaching great importance to the matter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters upon landing at Hong Kong airport on Tuesday evening, the former assistant police commissioner confirmed that 11 of the trapped SAR residents are in Myanmar, while the remaining one is in Cambodia.
  <br>
  <br>
  He described their locations as chaotic and not safe, while armed forces are also present.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cheuk pointed out that all of the victims fell for job scams, and were lured by the syndicates to Bangkok and picked up at the airport.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So far, none of the 72 people who sought assistance were abducted. In this regard, Thailand remains a very safe place," he said, although he cautioned against visiting regions bordering Myanmar, Laos or Cambodia.
  <br>
  <br>
  SAR authorities will now reach out to their counterparts in Myanmar, but admitted the situation was quite complicated.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cheuk also quoted Thai officials as saying that safety measures will be rolled out this week to enhance the safety of tourists.
  <br>
  <br>
  These include a 24-hour hotline that supports eight languages, and a mobile app that allows users to share their real-time location to law enforcement in emergency situations.
  <br>
  <br>
  The number two security official in Hong Kong also explained why the task force embarked on a visit to Thailand when the SAR residents are held elsewhere.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said Thailand has a lot of exchanges with neighbouring countries both historically and culturally, and Thai officials have numerous ways to talk to people in the region, including unofficial means.
  <br>
  <br>
  Before he left the airport, Cheuk received a petition letter from a man whose brother is among those unlawfully detained.
  <br>
  <br>
  The man, who gave his name as Kelvin, hopes to meet the task force soon and receive the latest update on the situation.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police will begin using rapid test kits to detect a regulated sedative from Saturday to tackle the emerging use of the space oil drug.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chief Inspector of the narcotics bureau Kelvin Cheung said the test will serve as an aid during operations when officers suspect products could contain etomidate, a short-acting anaesthetic normally used as an ingredient for the narcotic.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The officers will conduct the stop-and-search in an ordinary manner. When they find the vapes, they will conduct enquiries, they will ask questions, and they will also conduct observations before conducting the interception," Cheung said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If they, after conducting all the necessary enquiries at the scene, are still unable to form the reasonable belief, and they still suspect that the vapes actually contain etomidate... they will use the test kit."
  <br>
  <br>
  The kit contains a testing strip used to swab samples of alternative smoking products. It will then be mixed with a solution that can show a positive or negative result in less than a minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  The accuracy of the test can reach up to 99 percent, Cheung said, adding that the force has procured a sufficient amount of testing kits.
  <br>
  <br>
  Etomidate is a controlled drug that is prescribed by a doctor and is currently classified as a Part 1 poison.
  <br>
  <br>
  The number of arrests relating to the controlled drug skyrocketed from eight in 2023 to 206 in the first 11 months of last year. Nearly 23 percent of those arrested last year were people aged below 21, with the youngest being only 12 years old.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sky, who is said to be about 20 years old, first got a taste of the space oil drug at a bar. Speaking at a police press event, Sky said it looked like a normal e-cigarette. Sky later became addicted to the drug and started experiencing memory loss.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Sometimes I forgot what I did. I also had errors in my judgement. When my friends saw the traffic light was red, I thought it was green and walked out onto the road," Sky said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Leo Man, from the Hong Kong Federation of Youth Groups, told the same event that etomidate is very addictive. He said there has been a case where someone taking the drug died after mistaking a window for a door.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government is planning to list etomidate as a dangerous drug on February 14.
  <br>
  <br>
  Once listed, those illegally possessing or consuming space oil drugs containing the sedative would face a maximum of seven years in prison and a fine of HK$1 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  And those trafficking or illegally importing the drug would be liable to a maximum penalty of life imprisonment and a fine of HK$5 million.

<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korean authorities arrested impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol on Wednesday over insurrection accusations related to his December 3 martial law declaration, investigators said.
 <br>
  <br>
  A motorcade was seen leaving the gates of his hillside residence where Yoon has been holed up for weeks behind barbed wire barriers and a small army of personal security.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 3,000 police officers and anti-corruption investigators had gathered there before dawn, pushing through throngs of Yoon supporters and members of his ruling People Power Party who protested attempts to detain him.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon's lawyers have argued attempts to detain Yoon are illegal and are designed to publicly humiliate him. The warrant investigators secured for his arrest is the first-ever issued against an incumbent South Korean president.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon has justified his declaration of martial law as a legitimate act of governance against an "anti-state" opposition employing its legislative majority to thwart his agenda.
  <br>
  <br>
  The anti-corruption agency is leading a joint investigation with police and the military over whether Yoon's martial law declaration amounted to an attempted rebellion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Law enforcement officers had sought to bring him into custody after he ignored several summons for questioning. (Agencies)

    New wildfire warnings issued as winds rise in LA

<div class="itemFullText">
 Millions of Southern Californians faced new wildfire warnings on Tuesday, and tens of thousands saw their power shut off as strong winds blew across the parched landscape around Los Angeles where two massive blazes have been burning for a week.
 <br>
  <br>
  Santa Ana winds that began gusting over the mountains before sunrise were forecast to continue until Wednesday morning with enough force to carry fire-sparking embers for miles and stoke new outbreaks in a region where at least 25 people have already been killed.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Life threatening and destructive and widespread winds are already here,” LA city fire chief Kristin Crowley told a news conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  Much of Southern California was under elevated fire risk, with crews on high alert from the Mexican border to Central California, far north of Los Angeles.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nearly 90,000 households lost electricity as utilities shut off power to prevent their lines from sparking new blazes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Weary and anxious residents were told to be ready to flee at a moment’s notice.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police announced roughly 50 arrests, for looting, flying drones in fire zones, violating curfew and other crimes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The biggest worry remained the threat from intense winds predicted to reach nearly hurricane force in some areas. Tuesday's forecast included a rare warning: The winds, combined with severely dry conditions, have created a “Particularly Dangerous Situation,” the National Weather service said, meaning that any new fire could explode in size.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gusts were forecast to pick up strength in the evening and into Wednesday before decreasing, and red-flag warnings from Central California to the Mexican border were to remain through most of Wednesday, weather service meteorologist Ariel Cohen said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Planes doused homes and hillsides with bright pink fire-retardant chemicals while crews and fire engines deployed to particularly vulnerable spots with dry brush.
  <br>
  <br>
  Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass and other officials - who were criticised over their initial response - expressed confidence that the region was ready to face the new threat.
  <br>
  <br>
  With almost no rain in more than eight months, the brush-filled region has had more than a dozen wildfires this year, mostly in the greater Los Angeles area.
  <br>
  <br>
  Just under 90,000 people in the county remained under evacuation orders, half the number from last week. (AP)

    Elon Musk sued over late disclosure of Twitter stake

<div class="itemFullText">
 Elon Musk was sued on Tuesday by the US Securities and Exchange Commission, which accused the world's richest person of waiting too long to disclose in 2022 he had amassed a large stake in Twitter, the social media company he later bought.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a complaint filed in Washington, DC federal court, the SEC said Musk violated federal securities law by waiting 11 days too long to disclose his initial purchase of five per cent of Twitter's common shares.
  <br>
  <br>
  An SEC rule requires investors to disclose within 10 calendar days, or by March 24, 2022 in Musk's case, when they cross a five per cent ownership threshold.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SEC said that at the expense of unsuspecting investors, Musk instead bought more than US$500 million of Twitter shares at artificially low prices before finally revealing his purchases on April 4, 2022, by which time he owned a 9.2 percent stake.
  <br>
  <br>
  Twitter's share price rose more than 27 per cent following that disclosure, the SEC said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tuesday's lawsuit seeks to force Musk to pay a civil fine and disgorge profits he didn't deserve.
  <br>
  <br>
  Musk eventually purchased Twitter for US$44 billion in October 2022, and renamed it X.
  <br>
  <br>
  Musk has also been sued in Manhattan federal court by former Twitter shareholders over the late disclosure.
  <br>
  <br>
  In that case, Musk has said it was implausible to believe he wanted to defraud other shareholders, and that "all indications" were that his delay was a mistake. (Reuters)

    US TikTok users flock to Chinese app Xiaohongshu

<div class="itemFullText">
 As the threat of a TikTok ban looms in the United States, users there are flocking to the Chinese social media app Xiaohongshu - making it the top downloaded app in the US.
 <br>
  <br>
  Some of the “TikTok refugees,” as they call themselves, say the TikTok alternative, a Chinese app, is being chosen in protest of the TikTok ban.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US Supreme Court is due to rule on a law that stipulates TikTok must be divested from its Chinese parent company ByteDance by January 19 or face a ban in the US over national security concerns.
  <br>
  <br>
  After the justices seemed inclined to let the law stand, masses of TikTok users began creating accounts on Xiaohongshu, including hashtags such as #tiktokrefugee or #tiktok to their posts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since Monday, Xiaohongshu has become the top downloaded free app on Apple’s App Store in the US.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xiaohongshu, which in English means “Little Red Book”, is a Chinese social media app that combines e-commerce, short video and posting functions.
  <br>
  <br>
  The app has gained traction in China and other regions and countries with a Chinese diaspora, racking up 300 million monthly active users, a majority of whom are young women who use it as a de-facto search engine for product, travel and restaurant recommendations, as well as make-up and skincare tutorials.
  <br>
  <br>
  The #tiktokrefugee topic has racked up over 160,000 posts on Xiaohongshu, many of which are videos of American users introducing themselves and asking for tips on how to navigate the app, which they are calling “RedNote”.
  <br>
  <br>
  An American user with the handle Definitelynotchippy made a video addressed to the Chinese users of Xiaohongshu, explaining why Americans are downloading the app.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The reason that our government is telling us that they are banning TikTok is because they’re insisting that it’s owned by you guys, the Chinese people, government, whatever,” she said. “And they’re trying to make us think that you guys are bad.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Chinese users on Xiaohongshu have so far welcomed American users, with some offering to teach them Chinese. Others have offered tips on navigating the Chinese internet. In some cases, Chinese students have asked the Americans for help with their English homework. (AP)
