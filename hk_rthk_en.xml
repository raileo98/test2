<div class="itemFullText">
 Three members of the same family have died in Yuen Long in what police say is a suspected murder-suicide case.
 <br>
  <br>
  A man, 93, and his son, 69, were found with multiple stab wounds inside a flat in Chun Hing New Village after police were called at around 8pm on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  A 19-year-old man, who was the grandson and son of the deceased, visited the flat before later falling to his death from Yuet Ping House at Long Ping Estate, officers said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The deceased inside the flat had a lot of injuries, and they also bled a lot, so it was difficult to conduct forensic inspections at the scene because it required a lot of cleaning work to determine the cause of death and even the number of injuries," Assistant District Commander Johnathan Kwan told the media.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The direction of our investigation includes the background of the three deceased, their family relationships, and whether they were involved in any disputes or property disputes."

    Team removed over Greater Bay Airlines cancellations

<img alt="The report said a new Greater Bay Airlines team of managers had failed to observe the firm's protocol for cancellation decision making. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1791324_1_20250212142901.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Greater Bay Airlines on Wednesday said it had removed a team of commercial and planning managers, which oversaw the allocation of aircraft resources, due to the recent flight cancellations by the carrier.
 <br>
  <br>
  In the airline's report to the Civil Aviation Department, it said a lack of internal communication and insufficient customer service support exacerbated the low-cost carrier's scheduling failures.
  <br>
  <br>
  Around 5,500 passengers were believed to have been affected by the cancellation of 128 flights in February and March.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to details released on Wednesday, four of the cancellations were by a charterer which put on extra flights following the deadly plane crash in South Korea's Muan in December.
  <br>
  <br>
  The airline also assured the move had "no impact on the safety" of its operations.
  <br>
  <br>
  The report said the new team – comprising experienced personnel as part of a reform – had failed to observe the company's protocol for cancellation decision making, and also "took excessive time to make decisions" and "communicated the decision poorly".
  <br>
  <br>
  It noted the team did not consider the airline's customer service response capability, which did not have sufficient resources to handle "such a significant number of customer interactions at one time".
  <br>
  <br>
  "[The airline] remains committed to assuring a reliable service to our passengers. The new team concerned has been removed from the company," the report said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Also in the report, the airline put forward a number of measures such as strengthening internal procedures for flight scheduling, boosting communication, and ensuring fleet and manpower stability and reliability.
  <br>
  <br>
  Transport minister Mable Chan expressed hope the budget carrier had learned a lesson, adding it has to regularly report on its operations to the authorities.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[The Air Transport Licensing Authority] has asked the airline to submit regular reports on a monthly basis. If the airline is planning to cancel flights in future, it will have to provide a written report to the authority and list out the facts and information of the arrangements," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The airline initially cited a delay in new aircraft delivery and the need for plane inspections for the cancellation, but the report later revealed "a lack of internal communication and a lack of co-operation from customer service operations" as a contributing factor.
  <br>
  <br>
  "From the time when [the airline] shared information at the time of the incident, to now when there's been a detailed report outlining what happened, I believe this is a process," Chan said when asked if the carrier had given an inaccurate explanation at first.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister stressed the administration would consider an airline's operations and performance when making arrangements on flight allocations and air traffic rights.
  <br>
  <br>
  In response, the low-cost carrier again apologised to affected passengers and said it had put in place a number of measures to prevent similar incidents from happening again.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will maintain close contact with the Transport and Logistics Bureau regarding the company's operations, and continue to strive to provide safe and reliable services to our customers," the airline said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 National sporting events staged in Hong Kong later this year are expected to draw more than 100,000 spectators, the government said on Wednesday, as the SAR is set to co-host the National Games with Guangdong and Macau for the first time.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Games, the nation's highest-level multi-sports event, will be held from November 9 to 21.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong will host track cycling, fencing, rugby sevens, beach volleyball, golf, triathlon, men's handball and men's under-22 basketball. Bowling will also be held as a mass participation event.
  <br>
  <br>
  In addition to the National Games, the city will also host several events as part of the 12th National Games for Persons with Disabilities and the 9th National Special Olympic Games in December.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rosanna Law, the secretary for culture, sports and tourism, said officials are working on competition schedules with Guangdong and Macau counterparts.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Macau are discussing the ticketing plans and sales arrangements... The three places will adopt the same sales platform," she said in a written reply to the Legislative Council.
  <br>
  <br>
  There will be about 1,800 athletes taking part in the eight National Games events held in the SAR, with 700 others participating in the December competitions, Law said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is estimated that the events in Hong Kong will attract more than 100,000 spectators from Hong Kong, the mainland and other regions," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[The bureau] is, in collaboration with the relevant departments... conducting a detailed assessment on the traffic and transport arrangements to and from the venues having regard to the transport facilities and capacity of the venues, their past experiences in staging competitions, and the number of participating athletes and spectators for each event."

<img alt="US President Donald Trump welcomes back released American schoolteacher Marc Fogel, who had been held in Russia since 2021, at the White House. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1791305_1_20250212123250.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump said that another detainee would be freed on Wednesday, as he met Marc Fogel, who was released after being held in Russia since 2021.
 <br>
  <br>
  Describing the prisoner deal with Russia as "very fair, very reasonable," Trump said "somebody else is being released tomorrow" without providing details.
  <br>
  <br>
  Schoolteacher Fogel, freed by Russia after three and a half years in prison, got a flag-waving welcome from Trump after a flight home from Moscow.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I feel like the luckiest man on earth right now," said Fogel, an American flag draped around his shoulders.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm a middle-class school teacher who’s now in a dream world."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump, standing alongside Fogel in the White House Diplomatic Reception Room, said: "To me he looks damned good."
  <br>
  <br>
  The release of 63-year-old Fogel, who had been detained in Russia since August 2021 and was serving a 14-year sentence, came as Trump seeks to improve relations with Moscow as part of an effort to secure an end to the Ukraine conflict.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump and Fogel both thanked Russian President Vladimir Putin for his release.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We just wanted to get him back home," Trump said, and said he would take Fogel on a tour of the Lincoln Bedroom upstairs in the White House.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fogel was released into the custody of Trump's Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, who made an unannounced stop in Moscow on Tuesday to pick him up.
  <br>
  <br>
  On a plane home, Fogel, who is from Pennsylvania, was shown with a raised glass, a cheese plate and his US passport in a photo posted on social media by Trump's chief hostage envoy Adam Boehler.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked what the United States gave up in exchange for Fogel, Trump told reporters earlier: "Not much" and called the release a show of good faith from the Russians.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We were treated very nicely by Russia. Actually, I hope that's the beginning of a relationship where we can end that [Ukraine] war and millions of people can stop being killed," Trump said. (Reuters)

    E.coli may have spread in hospital washroom: expert

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A suspected E. coli outbreak at Princess Margaret Hospital that is thought to have claimed the life of a doctor and sickened two others could have spread in a washroom, a microbiologist said on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong University's Yuen Kwok-yung told RTHK that this is because the bacteria survives longer in humid conditions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Because they would use the same toilet in their department and that of course could be a place of transmission," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "After using the toilet it would be humid, therefore it is possible that the virus was spread there."
  <br>
  <br>
  Yuen added, however, that since the washroom in question would have been sanitised before samples were taken, the likelihood of finding E.coli there is slim.
  <br>
  <br>
  Three oncologists at the hospital are thought to have caught E. coli. While one died last Friday, the other two only had mild symptoms.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yuen said the deceased oncologist was young and was not known to have been suffering from chronic illnesses, so work was still ongoing to find out why the doctor may have succumbed to such an infection.

    White House bars AP over its 'Gulf of America' style

<img alt="The White House reportedly blocked an AP reporter from several events due to the news agency's insistence of using " src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1791300_1_20250212121655.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The White House Correspondents' Association protested a decision by the White House on Tuesday to bar an Associated Press (AP) reporter from an event with US President Donald Trump over the news agency's decision to continue referring to the Gulf of Mexico.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump signed an executive order in January directing the Interior Secretary to change the name to the Gulf of America.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The White House cannot dictate how news organisations report the news, nor should it penalise working journalists because it is unhappy with their editors' decisions," Eugene Daniels, president of the association, said on Tuesday in a statement posted on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The move by the administration to bar a reporter from the Associated Press from an official event open to news coverage today is unacceptable," Daniels said.
  <br>
  <br>
  AP Executive Editor Julie Pace said in a statement earlier that its reporter had been blocked from attending an Oval Office event after being informed by the White House it would be barred unless it aligned its editorial standards with Trump's order.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is alarming that the Trump administration would punish AP for its independent journalism," Pace said, adding that limiting access violated the First Amendment of the US Constitution guaranteeing freedom of the press.
  <br>
  <br>
  The AP says in its stylebook that the Gulf of Mexico has carried that name for more than 400 years and, as a global news agency, the AP will refer to it by its original name while acknowledging the new name Trump has chosen.
  <br>
  <br>
  Most news organisations, including Reuters, call it the Gulf of Mexico although, where relevant, Reuters style is to include the context about Trump's executive order. (Reuters)

 Donald Trump on Tuesday pressed Jordan's King Abdullah to take in Palestinians who would be permanently displaced under the president's plan for the US to take over the Gaza Strip, even as the king said his country was firmly opposed to the move.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking alongside the Arab country's ruler in the White House, Trump implied he would not budge on his idea that involves moving the Gaza Strip's residents and transforming the war-ravaged territory into what he billed a "Riviera of the Middle East."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has infuriated the Arab world by saying that Palestinians would not be able to return to their homes under his proposal to redevelop the enclave, which has been devastated by an Israeli offensive.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're going to take it. We're going to hold it, we're going to cherish it. We're going to get it going eventually, where a lot of jobs are going to be created for the people in the Middle East," Trump said in the Oval Office, saying his plan would "bring peace" to the region.
  <br>
  <br>
  King Abdullah said later that he reiterated to Trump Jordan’s "steadfast position" against the displacement of Palestinians in Gaza, as well as in the occupied West Bank that borders his country.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is the unified Arab position," he said in a post on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Rebuilding Gaza without displacing the Palestinians and addressing the dire humanitarian situation should be the priority for all."
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite the views of his Jordanian counterpart, Trump said Jordan, as well as Egypt, would ultimately agree to house displaced residents of Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both countries rely on Washington for economic and military aid.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I believe we'll have a parcel of land in Jordan. I believe we'll have a parcel of land in Egypt," said Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We may have some place else, but I think when we finish our talks, we'll have a place where they're going to live very happily and very safely." (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China and around 60 other countries on Tuesday signed the final statement of a French-hosted artificial intelligence summit that said AI should be inclusive, open, ethical and safe.
 <br>
  <br>
  The United States and Britain did not sign the agreement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The signatories agreed that the two-day summit laid out an open, multi-stakeholder and inclusive approach that will enable AI to be human rights-based, human-centric, ethical, safe, secure and trustworthy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vice Premier Zhang Guoqing told the summit that China was willing to work with other countries to safeguard security and share achievements in the field of artificial intelligence to build "a community with a shared future for mankind".
  <br>
  <br>
  Zhang said AI has become an important driving force for the new round of scientific and technological revolution and industrial transformation, and Beijing has always participated in global cooperation and governance on AI with a highly responsible attitude.
  <br>
  <br>
  US Vice President JD Vance said "massive regulations" by the European Union on AI could strangle the technology.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We believe that excessive regulation of the AI sector could kill a transformative industry," Vance told the summit of CEOs and heads of state in Paris.
  <br>
  <br>
  A source close to organisers said they were not surprised that the US had not signed, considering their stance on regulation.
  <br>
  <br>
  A UK government spokesperson said the final statement did not sufficiently address "harder questions around national security".
  <br>
  <br>
  "We felt the declaration didn't provide enough practical clarity on global governance, nor sufficiently address harder questions around national security and the challenge AI poses to it," the spokesperson said. (Agencies)

    Altman dismisses Musk's OpenAI takeover bid

<img alt="The feud between Sam Altman (L) and Elon Musk (R) has become one of the bitterest rivalries in business history. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1791266_1_20250212091345.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has dismissed a US$97.4 billion takeover bid led by rival Elon Musk, but the unsolicited offer could complicate Altman's push to transform the maker of ChatGPT into a for-profit company.
 <br>
  <br>
  "We are not for sale,” Altman said on Tuesday at an artificial intelligence summit in Paris.
  <br>
  <br>
  Musk’s bid, announced on Monday, is the latest in a bitter years-long battle with Altman over control of the AI startup they both helped found a decade ago as a non-profit and is now a leading force in the global boom surrounding generative AI technology.
  <br>
  <br>
  Created as a counterweight to Google's dominance in artificial intelligence, OpenAI got its initial funding from Musk, who invested US$45 million. Three years later, Musk departed OpenAI.
  <br>
  <br>
  Subsequent lawsuits revealed that OpenAI claimed Musk left after his attempts to become CEO or to merge the company with Tesla were rejected.
  <br>
  <br>
  After November 2022, when OpenAI released ChatGPT and created a global technology sensation, Musk began criticising the company, trolling it on social media for keeping its source code private and signing a widely publicised manifesto calling for a pause in AI development, even as he pursued his own AI projects.
  <br>
  <br>
  In August 2024, Musk refiled a lawsuit against OpenAI and its backer Microsoft, claiming the ChatGPT maker had betrayed its founding mission of benefiting the public good in favour of pursuing profits.
  <br>
  <br>
  Musk later updated the lawsuit to prevent OpenAI's conversion to a for-profit company - a change Altman considers crucial for the company's development.
  <br>
  <br>
  RTHK's San Francisco correspondent, Mark Niu, said Musk's bid appeared designed to disrupt the company's fundraising efforts.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The latest reports are that the OpenAI board hasn't even seen that proposal. So it's hard to know what's going on. But there is a real feeling that among investors that Musk is really trying to... tie up things in the courts," said Niu. (AP, additional reporting RTHK)

    'SAR working to make renminbi trading more convenient'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Christopher Hui, says the administration is working to make renminbi trading more convenient in the SAR.
 <br>
  <br>
  In last year’s Policy Address, the chief executive stated the government wants to promote the global use of renminbi and solidify the city's position as an offshore renminbi business hub.
  <br>
  <br>
  Currently, 24 securities listed on the Hong Kong stock exchange have adopted the dual-counter model, meaning they can be traded in either the Hong Kong dollar or renminbi.
  <br>
  <br>
  On RTHK's Overview Policy programme, Hui noted the next step is to make the model accessible to investors in the Greater Bay Area.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I feel that one very obvious trend after the pandemic is that, even though globalisation has been somewhat affected, regionalisation is very practical and is happening," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Trade between different countries in Asia has increased. When trade increases, there's really no need to use other currencies. I can use a currency that everyone is using."
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister also mentioned that the government is trying out different scenarios to expand the use of digital renminbi.
  <br>
  <br>
  "On one hand, of course, if mainland residents come to Hong Kong, how does our system here accommodate them? If they want to use the digital renminbi, they can do so," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "On the other hand, if I want to use the digital renminbi on the mainland, how do I do that? These are the two areas we are working on."
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister added Hong Kong needs to strengthen its role as a financial services hub, saying this is what makes the city appealing to investors.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A motorcyclist has been hospitalised in a traffic accident also involving a truck on Lung Cheung Road on Wednesday morning.
 <br>
  <br>
  Police received a report at 6:27am about a collision near Tai Po Road.
  <br>
  <br>
  The truck driver allegedly lost control and mounted a slope, causing the vehicle to flip to its side and fall onto the motorcyclist.
  <br>
  <br>
  The motorcyclist was eventually freed by firefighters and rushed to Queen Elizabeth Hospital with leg injuries.
  <br>
  <br>
  The truck driver has since been arrested on suspicion of dangerous driving causing grievous bodily harm.
  <br>
  <br>
  At least one eastbound lane of the major thoroughfare had to be sealed off, creating a tailback which stretched several kilometres to Kwai Chung at one point.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another accident in the opposite direction on Lung Cheung Road, near So Uk Estate, at around 8am saw Tsuen Wan-bound traffic pushed back all the way to Diamond Hill.

    Xpeng, Geely shares fall after BYD offers new features

<img alt="BYD on Monday put on sale 21 models equipped with its " src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1791219_1_20250211204647.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Shares in Chinese automakers Xpeng and Geely Auto tumbled on Tuesday on concern they will struggle to compete against BYD's move to offer free smart driving features on almost all of its models.
 <br>
  <br>
  Xpeng's shares fell as much as 9.2 percent and Geely's dropped as much as 11.4 percent, each enduring their biggest one-day percentage decline since October 8, 2024. BYD's Hong Kong-listed shares rose 4.5 percent to reach a record high before closing 0.7 percent lower.
  <br>
  <br>
  BYD on Monday put on sale 21 models equipped with its "God's Eye" advanced driver-assistance system (ADAS) similar to that offered by rival Tesla, at no additional cost. The cheapest model the Chinese electric vehicle giant is offering is the Seagull, priced at US$9,555.
  <br>
  <br>
  BYD's move far undercuts rivals, and analysts said it could start a new price war in an already hyper-competitive market, comparing it to how Chinese artificial intelligence startup DeepSeek recently roiled the global AI sector with its low-price offering.
  <br>
  <br>
  The "era of smart driving popularisation has come," Nomura analysts wrote in a note.
  <br>
  <br>
  BYD is deploying three different versions of the "God's Eye" ADAS across most of its line-up. All three offer automated parking and lane-keeping features, in the scope of conventional level 2 technologies.
  <br>
  <br>
  The basic version, from the Seagull to models costing up to 219,800 yuan (US$30,078), will enable autonomous driving on highways though the driver must keep their hands on the wheel and take control when necessary.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two higher-end versions, which will be installed on more expensive BYD-branded cars and its premium Denza and Yangwang brands, will enable the car to drive autonomously – though also under human supervision – in more complex urban traffic.
  <br>
  <br>
  BYD had previously only offered such features in models priced from US$30,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tesla has these features available in China in its EVs priced from US$32,000. It charges US$8,000 for its Full Self-Driving (FSD) driver assistant software in the United States, or US$99 a month on a subscription basis. FSD is not yet available in China.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xpeng declined to comment, instead referring to comments its founder He Xiaopeng made online on Monday, ahead of BYD's event.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We welcome the official upcoming announcement by a leading automaker I respect extremely for its smart driving strategy that will bring about the popularisation of smart driving not only in China but also globally," He said. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chinese battery giant CATL started the application process on Tuesday to be listed in Hong Kong and named seven banks as overall coordinators, according to stock exchange filings.
 <br>
  <br>
  CATL, which produces more than a third of the EV batteries sold worldwide, filed a 527-page document to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange with offer-related information redacted.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is the first step in what analysts say could be a jumbo initial public offering that could boost Hong Kong's fortunes as a listing hub.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This Application Proof is in draft form," the firm said in the document, which includes financial information and corporate details with redactions.
  <br>
  <br>
  CATL said in another exchange filing dated Tuesday it has "appointed... overall coordinators" and listed seven financial institutions.
  <br>
  <br>
  The company is publicly traded in Shenzhen and its plans to seek a secondary listing in Hong Kong were announced in an exchange filing in December.
  <br>
  <br>
  Founded in 2011 in the eastern coastal Chinese city of Ningde, CATL has grown into the world's largest EV battery maker and supplies firms including Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Volkswagen, Toyota, Honda and Hyundai. (AFP)

    Real Madrid secure 3-2 Champions League win over City

<img alt="Jude Bellingham's late winner helped lift Real Madrid over Manchester City in the first leg of their play-off tie. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1791253_2_20250212063303.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Jude Bellingham scored the winner in stoppage time as Real Madrid twice came from behind to inflict more misery on Manchester City with a 3-2 Champions League play-off, first leg win at the Etihad.
 <br>
  <br>
  Erling Haaland twice put City in front with his first goals in five games against Madrid.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the holders hit back through Kylian Mbappé and Brahim Díaz before Bellingham stroked home in the 92nd minute on his return to England.
  <br>
  <br>
  City now have a monumental task ahead to progress to the last 16 when the sides meet again in the Spanish capital on February 19.
  <br>
  <br>
  The clubs were meeting for the fourth consecutive season in the Champions League, with the winners in each of the previous three years going on to lift the trophy.
  <br>
  <br>
  If that familiarity did not breed enough contempt, Madrid's decision to boycott City midfielder Rodri's crowning as Ballon d'Or winner last year added extra animosity.
  <br>
  <br>
  The midfielder was rewarded for his role in Spain's Euro 2024 triumph and a fourth consecutive Premier League title.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the Spanish giants took umbrage at Vinicius Junior being overlooked for the prize and pulled out all of their representatives from the ceremony in October.
  <br>
  <br>
  A huge banner before kick-off showed Rodri with the Ballon d'Or trophy alongside the lyric "Stop crying your heart out" from City-supporting band Oasis.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rodri's absence since September with a season-ending knee injury has played a major role in City's decline this season as the English champions sit 15 points off the pace in the Premier League.
  <br>
  <br>
  In recent years Madrid have been pegged back on the ropes at the Etihad, twice conceding four times in three visits.
  <br>
  <br>
  This time the visitors had a series of early chances to sow more doubt in City minds.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vinicius' every touch was booed and the home fans were delighted when he had a penalty ruled out for straying offside before he was wiped out by Ederson. The City goalkeeper then made a vital save from Mbappé and Nathan Ake deflected Ferland Mendy's shot wide with the goal gaping.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pep Guardiola's men hit the visitors with a sucker punch on 19 minutes thanks to a brilliant team goal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jack Grealish's dinked cross was chested down by Josko Gvardiol into Haaland's path, who stayed millimetres onside before stroking home his 26th goal of the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Real came roaring back as Vinicius' effort came back off the bar.
  <br>
  <br>
  City also hit the woodwork through Manuel Akanji and Thibaut Courtois was forced into a spectacular save from Phil Foden.
  <br>
  <br>
  Haaland remained a constant threat to Madrid's injury-ravaged defence. Ancelotti was forced to name midfielders Federico Valverde and Aurelien Tchouameni in his backline alongside the inexperienced Raul Asencio.
  <br>
  <br>
  Haaland's deflected effort that came back off the crossbar seconds into the second half proved a turning point as Madrid again took control. Bellingham headed wide and Ederson denied Mbappé as the pressure built before it finally told on the hour mark.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mbappé's finish was far from his cleanest but his mishit from Dani Ceballos' cross deceived Ederson and looped into the net.
  <br>
  <br>
  Madrid smelt blood and went for the kill. Valverde drilled inches wide before Bellingham should have scored when he shot low into the legs of Ederson.
  <br>
  <br>
  But it was City who got the third goal when Foden was brought down by Ceballos as he weaved a way into the penalty area and French referee Clement Turpin pointed to the spot.
  <br>
  <br>
  Haaland sent Courtois the wrong way for his 49th goal in 48 Champions League appearances.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yet, by full-time the Norwegian was a disconsolate figure as City's poor campaign took another turn for the worse.
  <br>
  <br>
  Díaz had only been on the pitch a matter of seconds when he fired in against his old club after Ederson parried Vinicius' effort into his path.
  <br>
  <br>
  Moments later the Brazilian goalkeeper was caught in no man's land as Vinicius ran through and, even as his attempt was heading wide, Bellingham stole in for a simple finish. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared on Tuesday the ceasefire in Gaza would end and the military would resume fighting Hamas until it was defeated if the Palestinian militant group did not release hostages by midday on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Following Netanyahu's ultimatum, Hamas issued a statement renewing its commitment to the ceasefire and accusing Israel of jeopardising the ceasefire.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Israeli announcement came after Netanyahu met with several key ministers, including defence, foreign affairs and national security, who he said gave the ultimatum their full support.
  <br>
  <br>
  After nearly 16 months of war, Hamas has gradually been releasing hostages since the first phase of a ceasefire began on January 19, but on Monday said it would not free any more until further notice over accusations Israel was violating the deal.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If Hamas does not return our hostages by Saturday noon – the ceasefire will end and the IDF (military) will return to intense fighting until Hamas is finally defeated," Netanyahu said.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was not immediately clear if Netanyahu meant Hamas should release all hostages held in Gaza or just the three who had been expected to be released on Saturday under the ceasefire.
  <br>
  <br>
  So far, 16 of 33 hostages have been freed as part of the ceasefire deal's first phase that is due to last 42 days. Five Thai hostages were also let go in an unscheduled release.
  <br>
  <br>
  In exchange, Israel has released hundreds of Palestinian prisoners and detainees, including prisoners serving life sentences for deadly attacks and others detained during the war and held without charge.
  <br>
  <br>
  There are thought to be 76 hostages still held in Gaza, more than 35 of them believed to be dead, according to Israeli media. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks finished mixed on Tuesday following a choppy session as markets weighed the latest White House tariff actions and Federal Reserve commentary.
 <br>
  <br>
  US trading partners expressed dismay and vowed retaliation to President Donald Trump's latest move – a plan to enact 25 percent tariffs on imported aluminium and steel from March 12.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Fed Chair Jerome Powell reiterated in congressional testimony that the US central bank was in no hurry to adjust monetary policy, leaving a cloudy outlook for additional interest rate cuts.
  <br>
  <br>
  All three of the major US indices had opened lower, but the Dow Jones finished up 0.3 percent at 44,593.
  <br>
  <br>
  The S&P 500 was essentially flat at 6,068, while the Nasdaq declined 0.4 percent to 19,643.
  <br>
  <br>
  LBBW's Karl Haeling said the market's ability to avoid a major selloff amid the tariff uncertainty reflected "underlying optimism" about economic conditions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among individual companies, Coca-Cola jumped 4.7 percent after reporting an 11 percent increase in profits to US$2.2 billion in results that topped estimates.
  <br>
  <br>
  Apple gained 2.2 percent following a report that it partnered with Alibaba on artificial intelligence in China. Alibaba rose 1.3 percent.

  Wednesday's calendar includes US consumer price figures for January. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 South China on Tuesday won the local top division basketball championship in dramatic fashion.
 <br>
  <br>
  Guard So Pak-hin made a last-second shot as the Caroliners defeated Winling 81-79 in Game Four, for a three-one series win at the Southorn Stadium in Wan Chai.
  <br>
  <br>
  South China entered the final period with a 20-point deficit, but they managed to erase it to take a one-point lead with a minute and a half to go.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bench players led the rally, with Anson Lam scoring 13 points in the final period.
  <br>
  <br>
  With the score tied in the final seconds, So, 23, hit a turnaround jumper with 0.3 seconds left to seal the classic victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Most Valuable Player of the Finals belonged to guard Kelvin Tsang from South China, who became Hong Kong champions for the third time in the past four seasons.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm so glad we listened to the coach and didn't quit," Tsang told RTHK in a post-game interview.

    'US steel tariffs may have limited impact on China'

<img alt="The volume of China's steel and aluminium exports are much lower when compared to 2018. File photo: Xinhua" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1791212_1_20250211193225.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An analyst on Tuesday said while United States president Donald Trump's steel and aluminium tariffs are expected to have a limited direct impact on China, countries such as the US' neighbours of Canada and Mexico will feel the pinch.
 <br>
  <br>
  The comment came after Trump on Monday announced a 25-percent import tax on all steel and aluminium entering the US "with no exception". The measures take effect on March 4.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vivian Yang, senior analyst at Chinese steel data provider, MySteel, told RTHK that the move will have limited impact on China's steel sector, as Beijing has already shifted away from the US market.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said the volume of China's steel and aluminium exports are much lower when compared to 2018 when Trump announced an earlier round of steel tariffs. Only some 891,000 tonnes of steel were exported to the US from China last year, accounting for 0.8 percent of the nation's total steel exports in 2024, according to MySteel.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yang said nations including Canada, Mexico and Brazil will be hit the hardest as they are currently the US’ top suppliers of the two metals.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Canada may face greater economic recursion as the tariffs could lead to increased production costs and potential job losses in the Canadian steel and aluminium sectors," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the Shanghai-based analyst warned that the new tariffs will still have an impact on China's "indirect" steel exports, such as automobiles, ships, and machinery.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The White House had already imposed a 10 percent additional on all Chinese goods imports. And if Trump's targeted tariffs of up to 60 percent on all Chinese imports he claimed earlier is to be realised, the impact on Chinese manufactured goods would be huge, because almost all Chinese exported products would lose their price advantage and have no export profit," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Although China is exporting very little steel to the US directly nowadays, some Chinese steel products do make their way into the US by other channels, for example, some are purchased by foreign countries and re-shipped to the US, [so] these transshipment practices will be impacted," she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mainland steel-related shares declined following the latest tariff announcements, with iron and steel manufacturing conglomerates Hesteel Group and Angang Steel's stocks falling over two percent.

<img alt="The Centre for Health Protection and microbiologists from the University of Hong Kong are searching for the origin of the E. coli infection. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1791210_1_20250211192202.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Health officials on Tuesday confirmed that an oncologist at Princess Margaret Hospital died last Friday of a suspected E. coli infection involving hospital staff.
 <br>
  <br>
  Two other oncologists showed symptoms such as fever, stomach pain and diarrhoea. They are in stable condition, and one of them has been discharged.
  <br>
  <br>
  One faeces sample tested positive for Shiga toxin-producing E. coli, while the other two samples, including from the deceased oncologist, came up negative for the bacteria.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Centre for Health Protection and microbiologists from the University of Hong Kong are searching for the infection’s origin.
  <br>
  <br>
  Albert Au, the head of the centre's communicable disease branch said food is one possible source of infection, but the three doctors did not eat the same food or visit the same restaurant.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, they ate in the same staff lounge.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Another possibility would be human-to-human transmission in an infectious environment,” Au said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We have collected over 40 environmental samples from the Department of Oncology office and toilets. We are waiting for the results to confirm whether there was a cross infection due to the environment,” he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  University of Hong Kong microbiologist Yuen Kwok-yung said it is rare to see an adult die from Shiga toxin-producing E. coli, and pointed out that the deceased doctor was healthy with no underlying illnesses.
  <br>
  <br>
  He called on other hospital staff who felt unwell not to take medicine without proper guidance, especially antibiotics, as it could worsen their condition.
  <br>
  <br>
  The hospital has sanitised possible areas of infection, and asked its staff to seek a doctor if they feel unwell.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Secretary for Health Lo Chung-mau expressed sadness over the oncologist’s death.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement released late on Tuesday, Lo said the doctor “was still taking care of patients in the ward right before the onset of symptoms”.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I am deeply moved by the doctor's professionalism, passion for work and care for patients,” Lo said, describing the young doctor as a role model for the healthcare profession.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The Centre for Health Protection…is conducting epidemiological and environmental investigations into the incident at full strength, and will submit a report and give an account to the public as early as possible," he added.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The eventful journey of the Hong Kong, China men's ice hockey team at the Harbin Asian Winter Games came to an end on Tuesday, after they were dumped out of the quarter-finals 24-0 by top-seeded Kazakhstan.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Kazakhs are four-time gold medallists in the competition and are so far unbeaten in this year's tournament after six games.
  <br>
  <br>
  The players from Hong Kong were outmatched early and often, trailing 8-0 after the first period.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Kazakhs continued their strong play in the second by putting seven in the net, followed by another nine in the last period.
  <br>
  <br>
  Four players scored a hat-trick against the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong goalies Cheung Chi-ho and David Lam did manage 56 saves between them.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SAR team made headlines after three of their players were injured in an altercation with Turkmenistan players following a group match on Sunday.

<div class="itemFullText">
 LIV golf is returning to Hong Kong in March, after the SAR hosted the tournament for the first time last year in Fanling.
 <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong will be the third stop of the tournament, following Riyadh, Saudi Arabia and Adelaide, Australia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Patrick Reed, who won the Hong Kong Open last November, is among the players who are slated to take part.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to the press on Tuesday, Reed said he could not wait to return to the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I can't wait to come back. Coming back to the place where I got my 10th win, and also at the same time, to go out and shoot my first 59. It means a lot. I think the biggest thing is the spectators, the fans, the people at the golf course is just spectacular," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Also participating in the team matches, Reed said all his team members are motivated and are ready to give their best.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Everyone out here I feel like is motivated to go out and play well. We're playing for huge prize purses, but at the same time we're playing for bragging rights over not only the other teams, but all the other players," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another LIV player Max Lee, who won the tournament promotion game in Riyadh and previously won a BMW car at the 2023 Hong Kong Open, said the Fanling golf course suits his game.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Fanling golf course, it requires accuracy despite not being that far away, and there are different kinds of valleys. This is similar to where I usually practice. Also, the trees in Fanling are very tall, the wind directions varies. I am the kind of player that excels in hitting low golf shots, and my performance at the venue in the past few years have been satisfactory," he said.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Academy of Medicine on Tuesday said it would introduce a set of guidelines in the first quarter of this year, for doctors to better carry out advance medical directives.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Advance Decision on Life-sustaining Treatment Ordinance was gazetted in November last year, allowing patients to refuse life-sustaining treatments under specific medical conditions when they become mentally incapable of making a decision.
  <br>
  <br>
  Its president Philip Li announced the academy would launch a set of practice guidelines, helping doctors better understand their roles in executing advance directives.
  <br>
  <br>
  The convenor of the academy's advance directives task force, Doris Tse, said most doctors are unfamiliar with the topic.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We'll offer some practical tips on how to discuss the advance care planning with patients and family members and also advise on how to assess the mental capacity," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Then, we will have some instructions on how to sign or complete advance directives and, of course, all these have to be supplemented with case scenarios."
  <br>
  <br>
  Tse added the guidelines help establish a consensus before patients become unable to make a decision, and it can avoid possible disputes.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said the academy would hold three seminars before the legislation officially takes effect in May next year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The academy said people can also save an electronic version of their advance directive on the eHealth system, so doctors at both public and private hospitals can access the documents.

    Scams fuelled rise in crime last year: police chief

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Scams made up nearly half of the 94,000 crimes recorded in Hong Kong over the past year, the police chief said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Delivering an annual roundup to lawmakers, Police Commissioner Raymond Siu said the total number of crimes recorded last year was a five percent rise over the figure for 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  The force logged more than 44,000 scam cases, up about 12 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 10,000 suspects in total were held over offences relating to scams and money laundering, Siu said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He conceded that it is not easy to solve such crimes, with the detection rate at 10.6 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Many of these deception cases happened online or they involved phone scams. A majority of fraudsters rang from somewhere outside Hong Kong. Once the victim became aware of the situation, we're talking about weeks or months after the commission of the crime, so by the time we received the report, it would be too late," Siu said.
  <br>
  <br>
  At the Legislative Council panel meeting, the police chief and a number of lawmakers brought up the problem of mainland students at universities in Hong Kong falling victim to scams.
  <br>
  <br>
  Siu said Hong Kong and mainland officials have discussed how to boost education on scams among students and parents.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said 80 percent of the mainland students falling prey to scams were in their first year in the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  "These students got a call from scammers before the school year started," Siu said. "After the school year started, the students might already be exposed to scam awareness information, so these students would become harder to be scammed."
  <br>
  <br>
  On other crime figures, the police chief said more than 2,000 mainland tourists were arrested last year, with almost half of them picked up over scams and money laundering offences.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a press conference following the meeting, Siu said the force recorded more than 300 cases last year where mainland students were reportedly scammed, involving more than HK$230 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  Looking ahead, the police chief said the force in the coming year would focus on safeguarding national security, fighting crime, especially scam-related ones, and making sure November's National Games will be held in an orderly, safe and secure manner.

 Team China continued their dominance at the Harbin Asian Winter Games by snatching six golds on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  They also grabbed five silvers and five bronzes on day four of the action.
  <br>
  <br>
  At the conclusion of all the speed skating races, China took 11 out of 14 possible golds, as the day's top prizes in the sport all went to the national team.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ning Zhongyan took the 1,000-metre men's gold, while Han Mei topped the podium for the corresponding women's event, her second individual gold in Harbin.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ning set a new Asian and Games record of 1 minute and 8.81 seconds.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sidney Chu from Team Hong Kong, China finished 18th, 10.5 seconds behind the men's winner.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the women's race, Nicole Law finished 19th.
  <br>
  <br>
  The team pursuit golds for men and women both went to China as well.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere, the pair of Feng Junxi and Wang Xue topped the podium in the women's synchronised aerials after a spectacular display.
  <br>
  <br>
  In women's freeski slopestyle, Chinese skiers took all the medals as Liu Mengting came out on top, followed by Yang Ruyi and Han Linshan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the SAR's men's curlers improved to 3-1 after beating Qatar 10-2 in group play.
  <br>
  <br>
  The women's curlers, however, suffered a 9-3 defeat at the hands of the national team and dropped to 1-3 in their group.
  <br>
  <br>
  Overall, China has 70 medals - 27 golds, 23 silvers and 20 bronzes so far. Second-placed South Korea has 12 golds, while Japan has five.

    'Tax cuts needed to help individuals and businesses'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong should provide more tax concessions to individuals and businesses in the coming fiscal year, according to the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce (HKGCC).
 <br>
  <br>
  It made suggestions across nine categories about the Budget, which is set to be released later this month, including suggestions on expenditure control and attracting foreign investment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last December, officials said the deficit would be near HK$100 billion, more than double the original estimate of HK$48 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  The chamber’s chairwoman, Agnes Chan, said the public should not worry though, as the city's economy is gradually recovering from the pandemic.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The budget deficit at that time was caused by two major factors -- we have the employment subsidy, the e-consumption voucher. Both took the government [to] over a hundred billion [dollars in deficit]. So that contributed to that year's substantial budget deficit. Then the second year, 2023-24, and the border reopened in February, but we are recovering and the government had adopted a loose monetary policy," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This year, the financial secretary is already saying it's going to be a smaller deficit because we are in a fiscal consolidation year. The measures include raising taxes on the high income earners, and having the double-tier property tax," she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The HKGCC proposed a one-time exemption on salaries tax, personal assessment tax and corporate tax, with an upper limit of HK$3,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  For small and medium sized enterprises, or SMEs, it suggested the government provide a long-term fixed-rate mortgage.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said both measures could reduce the burden towards taxpayers and stabilise the operation costs of SMEs.
  <br>
  <br>
  In terms of managing expenditure, she said a review of the government's structure would be needed, such as merging organisations with overlapping duties to cut costs.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said an example would be the Office for Attracting Strategic Enterprises (Oases) and InvestHK, in which both offices aim to attract foreign investment.
  <br>
  <br>
  The chamber also said the government could consider setting up a digital services tax, in which foreign telecommunication companies providing entertainment or consumption services in the city would have to pay up to five percent in tax per year.
  <br>
  <br>
  As for foreign investment, it said a three-year tax exemption period could be granted to companies that relocate their headquarters back to Hong Kong.

    Govt stands by idea of windows in all subdivided flats

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A proposal that all subdivided flats must have a window for ventilation purposes to comply with new minimum standards has met with opposition, the government said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  A public consultation exercise on a planned regulatory regime for subdivided flats ended on Monday, with thousands of submissions received.
  <br>
  <br>
  Housing Secretary Winnie Ho told Commercial Radio that many of the submissions included concerns about the proposed window requirement, with some people suggesting that exhaust fans could be installed instead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho said such a compromise would not be ideal.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If there are no windows, would it feel like living in a cupboard?" she questioned.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Even though we received suggestions during the consultation period saying 'let's not have windows and just install exhaust fans instead', I think windows are important to many people."
  <br>
  <br>
  The government has suggested that windows that face an area enclosed on all four sides would not be good enough.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Hayson Chan, who chairs a concern group for subdivided flat owners, said such windows could be complimented with an exhaust fan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho said if the enclosed space is big enough or has good air quality, this restriction could be eased.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said other feedback on the plans includes calls for a proposed 12 to 24-month grace period for owners to get their flats up to scratch to be extended to 36 months.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Spain's former football federation chief Luis Rubiales gives his highly-anticipated version of events on Tuesday in the trial over his forced kiss on Jenni Hermoso that sparked global outrage.
 <br>
  <br>
  The case has riveted the country since opening on February 3 and has turned Hermoso into an icon of the fight against macho culture and sexism in sport.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rubiales was forced to resign in disgrace in 2023 after kissing Hermoso on the lips following Spain's triumph at that year's Women's World Cup in Australia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prosecutors are seeking two-and-a-half years in prison for Rubiales, one year for sexual assault for the forced kiss and 18 months for allegedly coercing Hermoso, 34, to downplay the incident.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rubiales, 47, has called the kiss a "peck between friends celebrating" and denied any coercion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Up to now he has attended hearings without intervening as a slew of witnesses testified at the National Court near Madrid.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hermoso told the opening day of the trial she felt "disrespected" after a non-consensual kiss that "should not happen in any social or work setting".
  <br>
  <br>
  Her teammates have described how she cried and felt "overwhelmed" following the incident, while her brother Rafael Hermoso has said she came under pressure to downplay the incident to save Rubiales.
  <br>
  <br>
  Former women's team manager Jorge Vilda and two ex-federation officials, Ruben Rivera and Albert Luque, are also due to take the stand on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  They are accused of trying to coerce Hermoso with prosecutors seeking 18 months' jail against them.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rubiales minimised the importance of the kiss on Hermoso at the time and defied calls for his resignation at an emergency federation meeting in August 2023, railing against "false feminism".
  <br>
  <br>

    SAR opposes higher US tariffs: Eric Chan

<div class="itemFullText">
 Acting Chief Executive Eric Chan on Tuesday spoke out against higher US tariffs on Chinese goods, including those from the SAR.
 <br>
  <br>
  US President Donald Trump earlier signed an executive order imposing an additional 10 percent tariff on all Chinese imports, and the Hong Kong government said last week it would file a complaint with the World Trade Organization (WTO).
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is absolutely inconsistent with WTO rules... and also they have totally disregarded that Hong Kong is a separate customs territory," Chan said ahead of the weekly Executive Council meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SAR has been calling on the US to take immediate action "to rectify its wrongdoing".
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan also described American policies as "constantly changing", causing inconvenience to people who wanted to send parcels to their relatives and friends in the US.
  <br>
  <br>
  Parcel services to the US resumed on Tuesday after Washington confirmed it would not impose additional duty on mail items containing goods from Hongkong Post.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hongkong Post had temporarily stopped accepting US-bound parcels, as the United States Postal Service last week suspended inbound parcels from mainland China and the SAR and then reversed the decision in less than a day.

    Corruption charges dropped against New York mayor

<img alt="The US Justice Department ordered federal prosecutors to drop corruption charges against New York Mayor Eric Adams. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1791145_1_20250211115242.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The US Justice Department on Monday ordered federal prosecutors to drop corruption charges against New York City Mayor Eric Adams, arguing in a departure from long-standing norms the case was interfering with the mayor’s ability to aid the president’s crackdown on illegal immigration.
 <br>
  <br>
  Acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove told prosecutors in New York they were “directed to dismiss” the bribery charges against Adams immediately.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bove said the order was not based on the strength of evidence in the case, but rather because it had been brought too close to Adams re-election campaign and was distracting from the mayor’s efforts to assist in the Trump administration’s law-and-order priorities.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The pending prosecution has unduly restricted Mayor Adams’ ability to devote full attention and resources to the illegal immigration and violent crime,” Bove wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  The memo also ordered prosecutors in New York not to take “additional investigative steps” against the Democrat until after November's mayoral election, though it left open the possibility that charges could be refiled after that following a review.
  <br>
  <br>
  The intervention and reasoning — that a powerful defendant could be too occupied with official duties to face accountability for alleged crimes — marks a striking deviation from long-standing justice department norms.
  <br>
  <br>
  An attorney for Adams, Alex Spiro, said the justice department’s order had vindicated the mayor’s claim of innocence.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Now, thankfully, the mayor and New York can put this unfortunate and misguided prosecution behind them," said Spiro, who has also represented Elon Musk.
  <br>
  <br>
  The case against Adams was brought under the previous US attorney for the district, Damien Williams, who stepped down before Trump became president.
  <br>
  <br>
  The memo follows months of speculation that Trump would take steps to end the case against Adams, who was charged in September with accepting bribes of free or discounted travel and illegal campaign contributions from foreign nationals seeking to buy his influence. (AP)

    Google complies with orders to rename 'Gulf of Mexico'

<img alt='Google Maps users in the United States will see the "Gulf Mexico" renamed as "Gulf of America" in compliance with White House executive orders.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Google on Monday changed the name of the Gulf of Mexico to "Gulf of America" for those using its Maps platform inside the United States, complying with an executive order by President Donald Trump.
 <br>
  <br>
  The tech giant wrote in a blog post that users outside the United States will continue to see both the original and new name for the Gulf of Mexico, as is the case for other disputed locations.
  <br>
  <br>
  "People using Maps in the US will see 'Gulf of America,' and people in Mexico will see 'Gulf of Mexico.' Everyone else will see both names," Google wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  Google said the change aligns with its policy of following official US government geographic designations through the Geographic Names Information System.
  <br>
  <br>
  Upon taking office, Trump signed executive orders not only changing the name of the Gulf of Mexico but also reverting the name of Denali, America's highest peak, to its former moniker Mt. McKinley.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2015, then-president Barack Obama officially recognised the Alaska mountain as Denali, the name used by Alaska Natives for centuries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's renamings sparked criticism from indigenous groups in Alaska, who have long advocated for maintaining the Denali name, and raised diplomatic concerns with Mexico.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has cheekily suggested calling the United States "Mexican America," pointing to a map from before one-third of her country was seized by the United States in 1848. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Beijing's top official overseeing Hong Kong and Macau affairs has directed SAR officials to better integrate the city into the country's development in areas such as finance, the acting chief executive said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Xia Baolong, director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, earlier made an inspection trip to Shenzhen, during which he was briefed on plans to boost Hong Kong's economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Acting Chief Executive Eric Chan, who was there with the top mainland official, said it was a "very good occasion" to communicate and understand the central government's thoughts on the territory.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Director Xia is very, very concerned about Hong Kong. He highly recognised the work of the Hong Kong SAR government under the leadership of the chief executive," Chan told reporters ahead of the Executive Council meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He also directed that we should try our very best to integrate into the mainland's national policies, especially the Greater Bay Area initiative. This is very important to Hong Kong."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan also said authorities would work with their Guangdong counterparts to make good use of the Northern Metropolis and the Hetao Shenzhen-Hong Kong Science and Technology Innovation Co-operation Zone.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked if Xia had mentioned ways to tackle a budget deficit such as cutting or freezing civil servants' pay, Chan said there is a mechanism to adjust the salaries of public workers every year.
  <br>
  <br>
  A host of factors would be considered before the Executive Council decides whether to approve an adjustment proposal, he noted.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Acting Chief Executive Eric Chan on Tuesday said an opening ceremony would be held at the Kai Tak Sports Park on March 1, marking its official commencement.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking ahead of the weekly Executive Council meeting, Chan said the 90-minute ceremony would start at 6.30pm, featuring large-scale dance and sports performances by local and mainland performers.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said there would be four themes, showcasing Hong Kong's role in sports and cultural exchanges in different eras.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said the opening of the park would be an historic moment, and authorities would seize the opportunity to unleash the potential of the facility.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Kai Tak Sports Park, as Hong Kong's largest sports infrastructure ever, will bring new experiences [in terms of] sports, leisure, dining and shopping for Hong Kong people, as well as mainland and overseas tourists," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I have high expectations and confidence [in] the opening of the sports park. I believe more large-scale sports, cultural and recreational events will be held in Hong Kong, promoting the development of sports and other industries."
  <br>
  <br>
  He said more than a dozen of test events had been held at the sports park, and expressed confidence the facility would be ready for its opening in March.

<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump said he had spoken to his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping since taking office on January 20, but did not offer details on the topics of their conversation.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump made the comments in an interview aired on Fox News on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Yeah... I have talked to him and I have talked to his people, too," Trump said when asked if he has spoken to President Xi since his inauguration last month.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have a very good personal relationship," Trump added.
  <br>
  <br>
  He did not provide details on when exactly the call happened or what was discussed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last week, Trump said he was in no hurry to speak to Xi to try to defuse a new trade war between the world's two largest economies.
  <br>
  <br>
  A conversation between Xi and Trump is seen as crucial to a potential easing or delay of trade tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  China imposed targeted tariffs on US imports last week and put several companies, including Alphabet's Google, on notice for possible sanctions, in a measured response to Trump's across-the-board 10 percent duties, which had come on top of prior tariffs. (Reuters)

    Trump declares paper straws 'don't work'

<img alt='US President Donald Trump said that paper straws favoured by environmentalists "explode" in a "matter of minutes". Photo: AFP' src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1791118_1_20250211093009.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump is moving to reverse a federal push away from plastic straws, declaring that paper straws don't last very long.
 <br>
  <br>
  “It’s a ridiculous situation. We’re going back to plastic straws,” Trump said on Monday as he signed an executive order to review federal purchasing policies that restrict plastic straws.
  <br>
  <br>
  The move by Trump - whose 2019 re-election campaign sold Trump-branded re-usable plastic straws - targets a Biden administration policy to phase out federal purchases of single-use plastics, including straws, from food service operations, events and packaging by 2027, and from all federal operations by 2035.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump declared President Joe Biden’s policy “DEAD!” in a social media post over the weekend.
  <br>
  <br>
  While plastic straws have been blamed for polluting oceans and harming marine life, Trump said he thinks "it's okay” to continue using them.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I don’t think that plastic is going to affect the sharks very much as they’re... munching their way through the ocean,'' he said at a White House announcement.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also complained that paper straws "don't work".
  <br>
  <br>
  "I've had them many times, and on occasion, they break, they explode. If something's hot, they don't last very long, like a matter of minutes, sometimes a matter of seconds." Trump said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The plastic manufacturing industry applauded Trump's move.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Straws are just the beginning,” Matt Seaholm, president and CEO of the Plastics Industry Association, said in a statement. "Back to Plastic is a movement we should all get behind.”
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 390 million straws are used every day in the United States, mostly for 30 minutes or less, according to advocacy group Straws Turtle Island Restoration Network.
  <br>
  <br>
  Straws take at least 200 years to decompose and pose a threat to turtles and other wildlife as they degrade into microplastics, the group says.
  <br>
  <br>
  Every year, the world produces more than 400 million tonnes of new plastic. About 40 per cent of all plastics are used in packaging, according to the United Nations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Globally, nations are creating a treaty to address plastic pollution. Leaders met for a week in South Korea last year but didn’t reach an agreement. (Agencies)

    US slaps 25 percent tariffs on steel, aluminum

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump substantially raised tariffs on steel and aluminium imports on Monday to a flat 25 percent "without exceptions or exemptions", although he agreed to consider an exemption on Australia.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a telephone call with Australia’s prime minister on Tuesday that took place before the tariff rise, Trump said the US trade surplus with Australia was one of the reasons he was considering an exemption.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We actually have a surplus," Trump told reporters in the Oval Office about trade with Australia. “It’s one of the only countries which we do. And I told (Albanese) that that’s something that we’ll give great consideration to.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Australia had an exemption from such tariffs during Trump’s first administration.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump signed proclamations raising the US tariff rate on aluminium to 25 percent from his previous 10 percent rate and eliminating country exceptions and quota deals as well as hundreds of thousands of product-specific tariff exclusions for both metals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump also will impose a new North American standard requiring steel imports to be "melted and poured" and aluminium to be "smelted and cast" within the region to curb US imports of minimally-processed metals.
  <br>
  <br>
  As he signed the order at the White House, Trump said he would follow Monday's action with announcements about reciprocal tariffs on all countries that impose duties on US goods over the next two days, and said he was also looking at tariffs on cars, semiconductor chips and pharmaceuticals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked about threats of retaliation by other countries against his new tariffs, Trump said: "I don't mind."
  <br>
  <br>
  Monday's tariffs almost immediately drew criticism from Canada, the largest source of steel imports.
  <br>
  <br>
  Candace Laing, president and CEO of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, called Trump a destabilising force in the global economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Before the proclamations, shares in US steel and aluminium makers jumped, while shares in European and Asian steelmakers fell. The largest sources of US steel imports are Canada, Brazil and Mexico, followed by South Korea and Vietnam, according to government and industry data. (Agencies)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Crystal Palace booked an FA Cup fifth round clash with south London rivals Millwall after a 2-0 win against fourth tier Doncaster.
 <br>
  <br>
  Oliver Glasner's side avoided a potential fourth round upset at the Eco-Power Stadium as Daniel Muñoz netted in the first half before Justin Devenny struck after the interval.
  <br>
  <br>
  Palace will play second tier Millwall in the last 16 after the Lions won 2-0 at Championship leaders Leeds on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is the second time in three years that Palace have faced their hated neighbours in the FA Cup, with the Eagles winning 2-1 at The Den in the third round in 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  The local derby offers Palace forward Romain Esse a reunion with his former club after his US$14 million move from Millwall to Selhurst Park in January.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I am told it will be a big derby. The game happened a few years ago? But it is good playing at home and it will be a great game for our fans," Glasner said of facing Millwall.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They will be very aggressive but playing at home to a Championship side means we have to win. I want to go to Wembley," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Palace, who finished as FA Cup runners-up in 2016 and 1990, are 12th in the Premier League and were beaten by Arsenal in the League Cup quarter-finals earlier this season.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Eagles won 2-0 at Doncaster in the FA Cup fifth round six years ago and they repeated the scoreline on their latest visit.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We could have decided it a bit earlier perhaps, but it was difficult circumstances with the pitch. The players did well most of the time and we scored nice goals," Glasner said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Doncaster, currently third in League Two, kicked off as the lowest ranked team left in the FA Cup.
  <br>
  <br>
  Grant McCann's team threatened an early opener when Billy Sharp picked out Ethan Ennis in the penalty area, but his shot lacked the power to beat Palace keeper Matt Turner.
  <br>
  <br>
  Palace struggled to find any rhythm in the opening stages, but their superior quality finally shone through in the 31st minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  Daichi Kamada's clever free-kick found Jean-Philippe Mateta beside the Doncaster wall and he fired against the post before Muñoz tapped in the deflected rebound.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kamada tested Doncaster keeper Teddy Sharman-Lowe with a long-range blast as Palace hit their stride.
  <br>
  <br>
  Luke Molyneux, with 13 goals for Doncaster this season, nearly added to his tally as he cut in from the right flank and drilled just wide.
  <br>
  <br>
  England left-back Ben Chilwell came on for his Palace debut at half-time following his loan move from Chelsea last week.
  <br>
  <br>
  Devenny squandered a golden opportunity to double Palace's lead when he blazed wide from Mateta's pass.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the 21-year-old midfielder made amends to kill off Doncaster in the 55th minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  Will Hughes's superb lofted pass sent Devenny scampering clear on goal and he guided a delicate chip over Sharman-Lowe from 12 yards. (AFP)

    Trump pauses work at US consumer protection agency

    <![CDATA[<div>
<img alt="Elon Musk (right) and Republicans have long accused the independent agency of overreach. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1791097_1_20250211035951.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump's administration has informed staff at the country's consumer protection agency that it is temporarily shuttering its headquarters and pausing all work, according to an email shared on Monday with AFP.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) was set up in the wake of the 2008 global financial crisis and is tasked with protecting American consumers from corporate misconduct.
  <br>
  <br>
  It serves as a watchdog over a variety of consumer issues ranging from mortgages to credit cards to debt collection, and has long been a target of Republican lawmakers and industry.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the message to staff, acting CFPB director Russell Vought said the agency's Washington office would be closed this week, and told employees not to show up.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Please do not perform any work tasks," said Vought, Trump's new director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, and a key architect of the conservative plan known as Project 2025 to reform the federal government.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vought added that staff would need to seek written permission from him before doing any urgent work going forward, and should otherwise "stand down from performing any work task."
  <br>
  <br>
  Republicans have long accused the independent agency of overreach, with some of Trump's most ardent supporters, including the tech billionaire Elon Musk, calling for its closure.
  <br>
  <br>
  The union representing CFPB employees filed two lawsuits against Vought on Sunday, accusing him of trying to shut down the agency -- which was created by Congress, and of giving the Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) access to employees' personal information.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vought's actions reflected "an unlawful attempt to thwart Congress's decision to create the CFPB to protect American consumers," the National Treasury Employees Union argued in one of the lawsuits.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CFPB "has long functioned as another woke, weaponized arm of the bureaucracy that leverages its power against certain industries and individuals disfavored by so-called 'elites,'" the White House said in a statement published on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Under the administration of President Donald J. Trump, the weaponization ends right now," it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The decision to pause all work at CFPB and close down its offices appears to be an attempt to curtail its oversight powers without shuttering it entirely, something that would require congressional approval.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Congress built the CFPB, and no one other than Congress, not the president, not Musk, not Vought, can shut it down," Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren, who helped create the agency, said in a video message.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a separate statement, Democrats including Warren announced plans for a protest outside the CFPB's Washington offices for Monday, to "sound the alarm" against Musk and Vought's "attempt to kill" the agency. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Palestinian group Hamas said it will delay the release of more Israeli hostages planned for Saturday until further notice, according to a statement by the group’s spokesperson on Telegram.
 <br>
  <br>
  Abu Obeida, spokesman for the Qassam Brigades, said, “During the past three weeks, the resistance leadership has monitored the enemy’s violations and failure to abide by the terms of the agreement, including delaying the return of the displaced to the northern Gaza Strip, and targeting them with shelling and gunfire.”
  <br>
  <br>
  “We affirm our commitment to the terms of the agreement as long as the occupation commits to them.”
  <br>
  <br>
  On Saturday they completed their fifth hostage-prisoner exchange, with three Israeli hostages and 183 Palestinian prisoners released.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz called the announcement by Hamas a "complete violation" of the Gaza ceasefire agreement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump said Palestinians would have no right of return to Gaza under his US takeover plan, describing his proposal in excerpts of an interview released on Monday as a "real estate development for the future."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump told Fox News Channel's Bret Baier that "I would own it" and that there could be as many as six different sites for Palestinians to live outside Gaza under the plan, which the Arab world and others in the international community have rejected. (Agencies)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office director Xia Baolong was briefed by Financial Secretary Paul Chan on his plan to boost the economy during his inspection trip to the tech zones in Hetao and Qianhai on Sunday, according to a government statement.
 <br>
  <br>
  The statement said Xia told the SAR to "continue to be bold in reform, dare to break new ground, and to innovate continuously".
  <br>
  <br>
  The top mainland official was accompanied by Acting Chief Executive Eric Chan and the financial secretary in his visit to the Hong Kong Park of the Hetao Shenzhen-Hong Kong Science and Technology Innovation Co-operation Zone.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xia listened to officials’ presentations on the latest development progress and the focus of work for the park.
  <br>
  <br>
  He later visited the Qianhai cooperation zone and hosted a four-hour discussion session, in which Paul Chan told Xia on what he will do to boost the economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xia and SAR officials also discussed how Hong Kong could accelerate reforms to foster progress, enhance cooperation with Guangdong and better integrate into the Greater Bay Area.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xia said he hopes the SAR government would thoroughly implement the spirit of the important speeches by President Xi Jinping in Macau and the third plenary session of the 20th Central Committee of the Communist Party.
  <br>
  <br>
  Paul Chan said the SAR government is determined to undertake reforms, dare to be innovative, and actively integrate into the national development and align with national development strategies.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also said Hong Kong will co-ordinate development and security, as well as maintain financial and economic security, while promoting the acceleration of economic progress amid a complex external environment.

    Hongkong Post to accept US-bound parcels again

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hongkong Post said it will resume parcel services to the United States from Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Authorities said they made the announcement after the US confirmed it would not impose additional duty on mail items containing goods from Hongkong Post.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last week, Hongkong Post stopped accepting US-bound parcels, as the United States Postal Service (USPS) suspended inbound parcels from mainland China and the SAR and then reversed the decision in less than a day.
  <br>
  <br>
  The suspension by the USPS followed President Donald Trump's order for an additional 10 percent levy on Chinese imports, alongside an elimination of a duty-free exemption for low value packages.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hongkong Post reminds members of the public that the United States government is constantly changing policies and may further change its policies at any time. There may also be backlogs for mail items destined to the United States and delay of delivery, which may cause inconvenience or even losses to the public," a statement read.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government also reiterated its strong disapproval of additional US duty imposed on Hong Kong products, and urged Washington "to take urgent actions to rectify its wrongdoing".

    'Flavoured tobacco ban will further hit bar business'

<img alt="The Long-term Tobacco Policy Concern Group said a ban on flavoured tobacco and shisha would drive customers away. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1791056_1_20250210185326.jpg&q=60">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A smoking policy concern group on Monday said a government proposal banning flavoured cigarettes and shisha products would greatly affect the business of local bars.
 <br>
  <br>
  This came a day after health minister Lo Chung-mau said the government aims to table an amendment to the anti-smoking law at Legco in April, which will include a ban on e-cigarettes and flavoured tobacco, among other measures.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Long-term Tobacco Policy Concern Group said according to its survey of 514 bar customers in Lan Kwai Fong and Knutsford Terrace last month, four out of five said they would go to bars less often if the government pushes ahead with the ban, while 70 percent said they will consider visiting bars on the mainland instead.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Licensed Bar and Club Association of HK echoed that view, saying "extreme" tobacco-control measures would deal a further blow to the nighttime economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  In response, the Health Bureau said shisha is only allowed in 10 percent of the city's bars, so it won't have a strong impact.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bureau also said the government will consider offering a grace period to bars and patrons before the new law takes effect.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Foreign Minister Wang Yi will visit Europe and the United Nations before attending a Group of 20 meeting in South Africa later this month.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Foreign Ministry announced on Monday that Wang will visit the UK and Ireland, and attend the Munich Security Conference, from February 12 to 17.
  <br>
  <br>
  He will co-chair the 10th China-UK Strategic Dialogue during his stay in Britain, and speak about Beijing's position on major international issues at the conference in Munich.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang will then be in New York to chair a high-level United Nations Security Council event held by China on February 18 under the theme of "Practicing Multilateralism, Reforming and Improving Global Governance".
  <br>
  <br>
  China is the rotating Security Council president for the month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang will next travel to South Africa and attend a G20 foreign ministers' meeting in Johannesburg on February 20 and 21.
  <br>

  US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has said he would skip the G20 talks over an "anti-American" agenda.

  <br>
  "The G20 should promote the spirit of partnership, work together to promote world economic growth, guide global governance in a more just and reasonable direction," Foreign Ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun said in a regular briefing. (Xinhua/AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Political and tech industry leaders descended on Paris on Monday for a two-day summit on artificial intelligence, hoping to find common ground on the revolutionary technology set to remake business and society across the world.
 <br>
  <br>
  Co-hosted by French President Emmanuel Macron and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the summit aims to lay the groundwork for governing the nascent sector, as global powers race to play leading roles in the fast-developing technology.
  <br>
  <br>
  Monday's meeting of around 1,500 guests in the French capital's opulent Grand Palais will feature lectures and panel discussions outlining the promises of and challenges posed by AI.
  <br>
  <br>
  Political leaders, including US Vice President JD Vance and Vice Premier Zhang Guoqing, are set to rub shoulders with the likes of OpenAI boss Sam Altman and Google chief Sundar Pichai.
  <br>
  <br>
  A largely suit-wearing crowd of men and women speaking languages from all over the world gathered under the glass-and-steel dome of the great hall, built for the 1900 Universal Exhibition.
  <br>
  <br>
  Selected companies, academics and non-profit groups were showing off their work with AI at stands around the cavernous space decked out with screens and geodesic domes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two years on from the emergence of OpenAI's ChatGPT chatbot, able to respond to all kinds of natural-language prompts, "artificial intelligence fuels both immense hopes and, at times, exaggerated fear," Macron's AI envoy Anne Bouverot told guests as she opened the summit.
  <br>
  <br>
  She promised a "turning point" that would bring more countries on board with AI development that until now has been restricted to a few advanced economies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Also on the agenda is "sustainable development" of the resource- and energy-hungry technology.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We know that AI can help mitigate climate change, but we also know that its current trajectory is unsustainable," Bouverot said. (AFP)

<img alt="The Consumer Council received over 40,000 complaints last year, up 20 percent from 2023. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1791030_1_20250210162013.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A football legend's no-show at an exhibition match and the sudden closure of a local gym chain have mostly contributed to the rise of complaints filed to Hong Kong's consumer watchdog over the past year.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Consumer Council on Monday said it received 40,839 complaints in total last year, up 20 percent from 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  Excluding complaints regarding mainland online shopping platforms, the figure stood at 37,590 in 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The increase was mainly due to two disputes during the year which raised widespread public concern and affected many consumers, including [Lionel] Messi's controversial non-appearance at an exhibition match in February, as well as the abrupt closure of the Physical Fitness chain in September," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Complaints arising from the two incidents involved about HK$210 million, the watchdog said.
  <br>
  <br>
  There were 1,476 complaints relating to Messi and another 5,619 about the fitness chain.
  <br>
  <br>
  The council said "food and entertainment services" remained the category that received the most complaints for the third straight year, with 5,810 cases involving over HK$15.2 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  Food and entertainment-related complaints "still accounted for the lion's share" overall even after excluding certain incidents like Messi's no-show and Physical Fitness' closure, the body added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Overall, the watchdog noted the SAR was affected by a number of factors such as the global economic downturn, the boom in the digital economy, the trend of northbound travel, and the resumption of the multi-entry visa scheme for Shenzhen residents.
  <br>
  <br>
  "While new traders entered the market, industries were faced with unprecedented opportunities and challenges, and some businesses made the difficult decision to close down, resulting in a surge in related consumer complaints," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The council urged businesses to "promptly improve the quality of services and goods" to be more competitive and appealing, to stimulate people's desire to spend.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The chef de mission of the Hong Kong, China delegation to the Harbin Asian Winter Games, Kenneth Fok, on Monday said the international governing body for ice hockey has suspended four Turkmenistan players involved in an altercation with SAR players.
 <br>
  <br>
  Three Hong Kong players were injured in a post-match scuffle after defeating Turkmenistan 5-1 in a match on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fok said the Sports Federation and Olympic Committee of Hong Kong, China (SF&OC) welcomed "the quick and fair response" from the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF).
  <br>
  <br>
  "We were notified on Monday afternoon that the IIHF has suspended with immediate effect the four Turkmen athletes, who had intentionally assaulted the Hong Kong team," he said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fok said the Turkmenistan players wouldn't be able to play in their final game of the tournament, a matchup for ninth place against Kuwait in Monday evening.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also confirmed that the three SAR players only suffered light injuries and would be ready to play in the quarter-finals on Monday night.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I want to emphasise that our Team Hong Kong China's players had always stayed respectful and friendly when competing, even when facing disrespectful and threatening actions," Fok said in a video released to the press before the suspension announcement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our players definitely did not retaliate or do anything reckless. This is worthy of our praise and recognition."

    HKU introduces new blood-cancer treatment

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The University of Hong Kong Faculty of Medicine has unveiled a new oral formulation of arsenic trioxide for the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukaemia, otherwise known as APL.
 <br>
  <br>
  APL is a blood cancer that occurs suddenly with a high fatality rate, leading to bone marrow dysfunction and increased risk of infections and bleeding.
  <br>
  <br>
  The new treatment, called Oral-ATO, obviates the need for chemotherapy and bone marrow transplant, which decreases the relapse rate.
  <br>
  <br>
  Clinical Associate Professor at HKU, and the study's lead investigator, Dr Harinder Gill, said that with all abnormal cells gone, around one percent of patients under this treatment experience a relapse.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So most of these patients are essentially cured with this oral formulation," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Moreover, patients who take this new treatment do not need to be hospitalised and can just go to an out-patient clinic to collect medications after the initial diagnosis, allowing them to retain a normal life.
  <br>
  <br>
  The production cost for this new oral formula is also much lower than traditional treatments, hence it is currently free and available at all hospitals in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But since this is an uncommon form of acute leukaemia, we would have this treatment centralised at Queen Mary Hospital and the University of Hong Kong where these patients would receive meticulous initial supportive care to reduce the early death rate," Dr Gill added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Oral-ATO has obtained orphan drug designation from US Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency.
  <br>
  <br>
  The research was done in collaboration with experts from around Asia, as well as teams from the UK and the US.

    Do more to get tourists on HK hiking trails: lawmaker

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lawmaker Vincent Cheng on Monday called for the government to develop more facilities around Hong Kong's hiking trails as a way to attract more tourists.
 <br>
  <br>
  This came after a charity chaired by Cheng polled more than 380 people from late January to early February. Around half of the respondents agreed there was a lack of water fountains, and almost one-third were concerned about the safety of trails.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cheng said the government could provide more comprehensive information on different trails.
  <br>
  <br>
  "One of our suggestions is we do have more professionals to evaluate all trails in Hong Kong, classify them into different difficulties, so we can provide more beginner-friendly trails as well," he said at a press briefing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cheng added that as well as increasing the number of water fountains and toilets, the administration should set up stations for hikers to get replenishments, taking reference from Japan's mountain houses and Nepal's tea houses.
  <br>
  <br>
  In terms of promoting trails globally, Cheng said Hong Kong could participate in international travel exhibitions and invite celebrities such as actor Chow Yun-fat or snooker star Ronnie O'Sullivan to become ambassadors.
  <br>
  <br>
  When asked how to strike a balance between tourism and environmental protection, Cheng said a clear classification of trails will be needed.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have so many trails in Hong Kong. Different people have different needs. If we target one or two trails for tourism, we can promote that trail more. Some of the trails, maybe they are for locals, then we can meet local needs," he said.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Sunday's fight involving ice hockey players from Turkmenistan and Hong Kong, China may have escalated due to the physical nature of the sport.
 <br>
  <br>
  That's according to Education University physical education lecturer Lobo Louie.
  <br>
  <br>
  "During the ice hockey game, it is quite violent. So in terms of our philosophy and sports development, there is a debate for games that have physical contact. If you play table tennis, you are separated [from your opponent] by the table. But for [contact] games like rugby, boxing, and ice hockey, how do we handle the emotions of athletes, that should be part of the game," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Louie added the incident would serve as a lesson for athletes to learn how to control their stress levels during and after competitions.
  <br>
  <br>
  He made it clear that contact sports often have stricter rules to protect athletes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The athletes have to stand out for a couple of minutes, or may be they are suspended for a few games or are even [given] a more serious penalty," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Louie hoped the incident would not affect the performance of the Hong Kong, China team in later matches at the Asian Winter Games in Harbin, and urged more promotion of professional sports ethics among athletes.

 Chief Executive John Lee on Monday paid a visit to ice hockey players who were injured during a post-game fight between players from Hong Kong, China and Turkmenistan at the Winter Asian Games in Harbin.
 <br>
  <br>
  SAR sports officials are demanding action from relevant authorities and have condemned the "deliberate attack and injury" by Turkmenistan athletes after Sunday's game.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee, who's in Harbin, went to the athletes' village to meet three Hong Kong players hurt in the brawl.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the trio were fine and should be able to play in Monday night's quarter-final clash against Kyrgyzstan.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CE praised the players for staying calm and showing restraint during the incident, saying they showed professionalism and displayed sportsmanship.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I encourage them to maintain the best mental condition and play with a professional attitude, not to be affected by any incident," Lee wrote on social media.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I also expressed the support of Hong Kong people for the ice hockey team, and encourage the team members to keep it up and focus on the upcoming games."
  <br>
  <br>
  The chief executive also called on the Sports Federation and Olympic Committee of Hong Kong, China, and the Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau to follow up on the matter, and ensure the safety of the SAR's athletes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee was flanked by sports minister Rosanna Law and Chief Executive's Office director Carol Yip as he met the ice hockey team.

 Commerce chief Algernon Yau has expressed hope for Radio Television Hong Kong (RTHK) to be flexible and innovative, saying the broadcaster would continue to work with counterparts across the border and in Belt and Road countries to showcase the SAR.
 <br>
  <br>
  The secretary for commerce and economic development on Monday said RTHK would also promote and broadcast this November's National Games, during a Lunar New Year event organised by the broadcaster.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I look forward to seeing RTHK strengthen cooperation and exchanges with broadcasters on the mainland and in Belt and Road countries, to demonstrate Hong Kong as a global metropolis where the East meets the West with vibrancy and diversity, to continue to tell the story of Hong Kong," Yau said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Director of Broadcasting Angelina Kwan said the broadcaster would promote the city's advantages and characteristics to the rest of the world in the coming year, while jointly introducing a number of programmes with the government.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another focus for RTHK would be on the use of technology such as artificial intelligence, which Kwan said could break barriers on production.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ecuador will choose its next president in a presidential run-off election after conservative incumbent Daniel Noboa and leftist lawyer Luisa González garnered enough votes on Sunday to beat 14 other candidates.
 <br>
  <br>
  The contest will be a repeat of the October 2023 snap election that earned Noboa a 16-month presidency.
  <br>
  <br>
  The runoff election is set for April 13.
  <br>
  <br>
  Addressing supporters in Quito, Gonzalez hailed her stronger-than-expected showing against the conservative incumbent as a "victory" for the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  Figures released by Ecuador’s National Electoral Council after 66 percent of ballots were tallied showed Noboa received more than 3.09 million votes, or 44.7 percent, while González earned over 3.02 million votes, or 43.8 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  All of Sunday's candidates promised voters to reduce the widespread crime that has plagued the country in recent years.
  <br>
  <br>
  The spike in violence across the South American country is tied to the trafficking of cocaine produced in neighbouring Colombia and Peru.
  <br>
  <br>
  So many voters have become crime victims that their personal and collective losses were a determining factor in deciding whether a third president in four years can turn Ecuador around or if Noboa deserves more time in office.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ecuador’s National Electoral Council reported that more than 83 percent of the roughly 13.7 million eligible voters cast ballots. Voting is mandatory in Ecuador. (Agencies)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China is further relaxing its visa-free programmes by allowing tour groups from Asean members to visit Xishuangbanna in Yunnan province for up to six days.
 <br>
  <br>
  The National Immigration Administration said the measure came into effect on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tour groups from Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, the Philippines, Singapore, Brunei, Vietnam, Laos, Myanmar and Cambodia will be allowed to enter and exit the region visa-free via Xishuangbanna Gasa airport, the Mohan Railway or the Mohan Highway.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tourists must remain in the Xishuangbanna administrative region during their visit.
  <br>
  <br>
  The administration said the move is an important step in expanding the opening up of the country in a structured manner, while bolstering Yunnan's role as a regional hub for South Asia and Southeast Asia.
  <br>
  <br>
  It added that the initiative will help promote tourism development, facilitate exchanges between people from China and other countries, and strengthen China-Asean strategic cooperation.

    Trump at Super Bowl in first for sitting US president

<img alt="" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790989_1_20250210120317.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Super Bowl extravaganza was watched by a star-studded 65,719 crowd bristling with celebrities and VIPs headed by Donald Trump, who became the first sitting US president to attend the event after jetting into New Orleans from Florida on Air Force One earlier in the day following a round of golf with Tiger Woods.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump has had an uneasy relationship with the NFL over the years, triggering uproar in 2017 after attacking players for kneeling in protest against racial injustice during renditions of the US national anthem.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the US leader was given a broadly positive reception at the Superdome after arriving at the venue shortly before kick-off.
  <br>
  <br>
  Soon after arriving, Trump met with first responders and family members of victims of the January 1 attack in New Orleans that left 14 people dead and dozens wounded.
  <br>
  <br>
  Later, loud cheering could be heard among the crowd when the Superdome's giant screen showed Trump saluting during the national anthem.
  <br>
  <br>
  That warm applause was in stark contrast to the booing that rang around the venue early in the first quarter when the same screen showed pop icon Taylor Swift sitting in the VIP seats.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump, meanwhile, expressed hope the nation could come together for the Super Bowl, which is by far the biggest annual event on the American sporting calendar.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Football is America's most popular sport -- for good reason -- it fosters a sense of national unity, bringing families, friends, and fans together and strengthening communities," Trump said in a statement released by the White House.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This annual tradition transcends our differences and personifies our shared patriotic values of family, faith, and freedom," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Swift, watching boyfriend and Chiefs ace Travis Kelce, was among a galaxy of stars crowded into the venue, with the likes of Beatles legend Paul McCartney rubbing shoulders with Hollywood actors Kevin Costner, Paul Rudd and Anne Hathaway and soccer star Lionel Messi.
  <br>
  <br>
  The catcalls for Swift -- who backed Trump's opponent Kamala Harris in last year's election -- were not lost on the US President.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump later shared a post on his TruthSocial network which read: "Trump gets massive cheers at the Super Bowl while Taylor Swift gets booed - the world is healing!" (AFP)

    Lamar entertains at Super Bowl with dig at Drake

<img alt="Kendrick Lamar was the main performance during the Super Bowl halftime show. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790985_1_20250210113933.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Rapper Kendrick Lamar entertained a packed stadium crowd and audiences around the world watching the Super Bowl on Sunday, teasing and then delivering his ubiquitous, Grammy-winning diss track "Not Like Us."
 <br>
  <br>
  At the Superdome in New Orleans, Lamar was introduced by actor Samuel L Jackson dressed in a top hat as Uncle Sam.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dancers in all white, all red and all blue piled out of a Buick Grand National GNX, the car that inspired the name of Lamar's recent album "GNX."
  <br>
  <br>
  The 37-year-old Lamar spun through "Squabble Up," "DNA" and other hits before telling a group of female dancers: "I want to perform their favourite song, but you know they want to sue."
  <br>
  <br>
  A few beats of "Not Like Us" played, but Lamar switched to a duet of "Luther" with R&B singer SZA.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Not Like Us" is part of a long-standing feud between Lamar and Canadian musician Drake, and there had been speculation that Lamar might skip the song at the Super Bowl.
  <br>
  <br>
  Drake filed a defamation lawsuit against Universal Music Group, saying the song's false accusation that he is a paedophile has put him and his family in danger.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Lamar went for it. At one point, he omitted the word "paedophiles" - opting instead for a scream - but included a line about seeking "A minor" in which the crowd sang along.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Not Like Us" won five Grammy Awards a week ago, bringing Lamar's lifetime total to 22.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lamar's appearance on the biggest stage in music followed big names from Beyonce to Prince, Madonna, Lady Gaga and the Rolling Stones.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Super Bowl typically draws more than 100 million live US viewers, the largest TV audience of the year. (Reuters)
