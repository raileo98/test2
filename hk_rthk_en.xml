<div class="itemFullText">
 The authorities will hold their first test event at the Kai Tak Arena within the sports park on Saturday, with two basketball games in the afternoon.
 <br>
  <br>
  Gates will open for the 2,000 spectators from 1.30pm, with the games tipping off at 3pm and 5pm.
  <br>
  <br>
  Spectators are advised to use the MTR to get there. No tickets will be sold at the venue.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sports Commissioner George Tsoi said officials will set up six to eight security check counters for the drill.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Long umbrellas and food and beverages, including empty bottles, are not allowed. If you do not have a bag, you can [go through] a dedicated corridor to speed up the security checking," he told reporters on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tsoi added that the arena will host a concert on December 20 and test events for the 50,000-seater Kai Tak Stadium will begin next month.
  <br>
  <br>
  The park's director, Tang King-shing, said the arena is an international-level multi-purpose venue with 10,000 seats.
  <br>
  <br>
  When there are no special events, he said, the arena will be open to the public, noting that it can house up to 40 badminton courts at one time.
  <br>
  <br>
  There will be another stress test for the arena and the youth sports ground next to it on Sunday afternoon, involving 12,000 participants.
  <br>
  <br>
  The authorities said those taking part will include Kai Tak residents, youth uniformed group members and civil servants.
  <br>
  <br>
  As part of the drill, officials will arrange dozens of buses and taxis to take participants to a drop-off area at Sung Wong Toi MTR Station.
  <br>
  <br>
  There will also be a fire drill at the youth sports ground.

    New appointments will improve governance: Lau Siu-kai

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A senior member of a leading national think tank on Thursday said he thinks the reshuffle of the SAR cabinet will serve as a stimulus for better governance.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lau Siu-kai, a consultant to the Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macau Studies, told RTHK that he's not surprised by the new appointments.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Under the principal officials' accountability system, it is quite normal for the chief executive to replace ministers from time to time so that he can get his job done better, get his government more popular, and to be seen as accountable to the public," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The replacements will also push existing officials to do a better job to "avoid being replaced by new ministers" and to improve overall government performance, Lau added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I would say the public... expect them to do a much better job than their predecessors, given their two predecessors have done something which has been quite controversial before. The new ministers should be able to elicit new expectations from the public or the government."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lau said the new culture and transport chiefs are expected to outperform their predecessors, and ensure smooth sailing of important projects like the Kai Tak Sports Park and next year's National Games.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the next couple of years, the chief executive must be very concerned that the Kai Tak Sports Park and the national sports event will be held very successfully, and no mistake will be committed.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If that is the case, it is not surprising that he is going to replace two officials. He will be more comfortable with the new ministers and be confident that they can get the job done and to enhance the popularity and the authority of the government."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lau added that he thinks the two new ministers are hardworking and willing to face the media, and will work closely with professionals in their bureaus.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Newly appointed Secretary for Transport and Logistics Mable Chan on Thursday said she was confident she could bring impetus to the bureau and lead her team to push forward various transport policies and plans.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chan replaces Lam Sai-hung who vacated his position in the first cabinet reshuffle of Chief Executive John Lee.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters, Chan said the government was working on different railway projects, including the Tung Chung Line Extension, Tuen Mun South Extension and the Northern Link.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Transport and railway development is pivotal to the economic development of Hong Kong. We have promulgated a transport and traffic blueprint which lists out a number of railway and road projects," Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the coming years, I will be leading my bureau in taking forward, steadfastly, in order to make sure that these projects are implemented and constructed on time, within budget."
  <br>
  <br>
  She added that with the implementation of the three-runway system, the government would continue to work on raising Hong Kong's status as an international aviation hub.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked about bus fare hikes, Chan said authorities must consider what the public could afford, but pointed out the importance of bus operators having a stable financial situation, in order to ensure their quality of services.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan had previously served as the commissioner for transport, before becoming the permanent secretary for transport and logistics in 2020.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Newly appointed Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism Rosanna Law on Thursday said her bureau will be well prepared for the official opening of Kai Tak Sports Park and for the 15th National Games next year.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Opportunities are everywhere. And so my priority would be to learn the latest development of my bureau's work and then to meet old friends, make new friends, have candid, useful, constructive discussions with all stakeholders, with a view of bringing culture, sports and tourism to new heights," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meeting reporters for the first time after stepping into her new role, Law said she is confident in her new position, saying her experience in various bureaus has helped her learn fast and adapt to changes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Well, no one knows everything. I have been an administrative officer and what is unique for this job is that every few years I change to a new field, I take up a new post. But as always, we do our best in getting our hands on a job as quickly as possible," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I remember about 16 months ago, I was deployed to the Housing Bureau. Although I did not have any experience in housing, I became the director of housing and I just learned what I had to do as quickly as possible. And I'm sure that my colleagues will continue to give me the best support they can."
  <br>
  <br>
  Law said she would not comment on the work of her predecessor, Kevin Yeung, saying her colleagues have been making an all-out effort and working tirelessly.
  <br>
  <br>
  She joined the government in 1989 and had held various positions, including deputy commissioner for tourism, deputy secretary for constitutional and mainland affairs and commissioner for transport, before becoming permanent secretary for housing and director of housing last year.

<img alt="Posters featuring the face of President Yoon Suk-yeol are displayed at a bus stop near Yeouido National Assembly Station in Seoul. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1782210_1_20241205125603.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korean police have begun investigating President Yoon Suk-yeol for alleged "insurrection" over his declaration of martial law, a senior police officer said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Woo Jong-soo, head of the National Investigation Headquarters of the National Police Agency, told lawmakers that "the case has been assigned," footage showed
  <br>
  <br>
  President Yoon's office said there would be no public statements on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "President Yoon will not make any statements today," a presidential official told reporters, as the opposition set an impeachment vote for 7pm on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier, Yoon accepted the resignation of his defense minister as opposition parties moved to impeach both men over the stunning yet short-lived imposition of martial law that brought armed troops into Seoul streets.
  <br>
  <br>
  The main opposition Democratic Party and other small opposition parties submitted a joint motion to impeach President Yoon on Wednesday over his martial law declaration the previous night.
  <br>
  <br>
  Martial law lasted about six hours, as the National Assembly quickly voted to overrule the president, forcing his Cabinet to lift it before daybreak Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Thursday, Yoon’s office said he replaced Defence Minister Kim Yong-hyun with Choi Byung-hyuk, a retired four-star general who is South Korea’s ambassador to Saudi Arabia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vice Defence Minister Kim Seon-ho will be the acting minister until Choi assumes the job after a parliamentary hearing.
  <br>
  <br>
  The hearing is seen as a formality as the president holds the power to appoint ministers outside of the prime minister without the approval of lawmakers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon hasn’t made any public appearances since he announced in a televised address that his government was lifting the martial law declaration.
  <br>
  <br>
  The opposition parties earlier submitted a separate motion to impeach Kim, alleging he recommended Yoon impose martial law.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Wednesday, Kim offered to resign and apologised for causing disruption and concern to the public.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kim said “all troops who performed duties related to martial law were acting on my instructions, and all responsibility lies with me,” according to the Defence Ministry.
  <br>
  <br>
  The impeachment motion on Yoon was introduced at a parliamentary plenary session early Thursday, meaning it can be put to a vote between Friday and Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  By law, the motion will be scrapped if it isn’t voted within 72 hours of its parliamentary introduction.
  <br>
  <br>
  Opposition parties can submit a new impeachment motion if the current one is scrapped or voted down, according to National Assembly officials. (Agencies)

<img alt="Bitcoin broke US$100,000 for the first time as traders cheered Donald Trump's decision to pick a crypto fan to head the US securities regulator.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Bitcoin topped the US$100,000 mark as a massive rally in the world's most popular cryptocurrency sparked by the election of Donald Trump as US president rolls on.
 <br>
  <br>
  The milestone comes just hours after the president-elect signalled a lighter regulatory approach to the crypto industry with his choice of Paul Atkins to be the next chair the Securities and Exchange Commission.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said on Wednesday that he intends to nominate Atkins, a former SEC commissioner during the presidency of George W. Bush.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the years since leaving the agency, Atkins has made the case against too much market regulation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bitcoin has soared to unprecedented heights since Trump won the election on November 5.
  <br>
  <br>
  The cryptocurrency has climbed dramatically from US$69,374 on Election Day and rose as high as US$101,512 Wednesday, just two years after dropping below US$17,000 following the collapse of crypto exchange FTX.
  <br>
  <br>
  How long bitcoin will stay above the coveted US$100,000 mark is uncertain.
  <br>
  <br>
  As with everything in the volatile cryptoverse, the future is impossible to predict. And while some are bullish on future gains, other experts continue to warn of investment risks. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 New People's Party lawmaker Regina Ip said it's an appropriate time for the government to appoint two "young and energetic" ministers, saying the bureaus they head serve important roles.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a reshuffle announced by the government on Thursday, Mable Chan, formerly the Permanent Secretary for Transport and Logistics, is succeeding Lam Sai-hung as transport minister, and Director of Housing Rosanna Law has replaced Kevin Yeung as Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ip said both the Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau and the Transport and Logistics Bureau have a lot of work ahead.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Tourism promotion is a priority for this administration. Moreover, we are launching the Kai Tak sports complex, we will be hosting the National Games, and the blueprint for tourism, recreation and sport has just been unveiled. So there's a lot of work to be done," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The same with the Transport and Logistics Bureau. We are launching the third runway, we need to strengthen and broaden our aviation network and set up a new maritime services and harbour development board."
  <br>
  <br>
  The DAB also welcomed the appointment of the two new ministers, hoping that they will strive to make breakthroughs in their respective policy portfolios.
  <br>
  <br>
  Roundtable lawmaker Michael Tien said he has high expectations for Law, saying she has demonstrated her vision for the future while working as the commissioner for transport and director of housing in the past.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If you look at the Cross-Harbour Tunnel today, it's basically an exercise from bottom-up. They ran years and years of modelling, looked at all the possible scenarios and then came up with something and that's it. It turned out quite well.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Her stint at the Housing Department... there was a lot of abuse of public housing privileges, and she responded very aggressively to our Roundtable demand to clamp down on the abuse."
  <br>
  <br>
  The lawmaker representing the sports and culture sector, Kenneth Fok, said he is looking forward to working with Law, saying that the government has been highly concerned about sports and cultural development.

 Police in New York City have launched a manhunt for a gunman who killed UnitedHealthcare’s CEO on Wednesday outside a Manhattan hotel where the health insurer was holding its investor conference.
 <br>
  <br>
  Brian Thompson, 50, was shot around 6.45am as he walked alone to the New York Hilton Midtown from a nearby hotel, police said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The shooter appeared to be “lying in wait for several minutes” before approaching Thompson from behind and opening fire, New York City Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police had not yet established a motive.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Many people passed the suspect, but he appeared to wait for his intended target,” Tisch said, adding that the shooting "does not appear to be a random act of violence.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Surveillance video reviewed by investigators shows someone emerging from behind a parked car, pointing a gun at Thompson’s back, then firing multiple times from several feet away.
  <br>
  <br>
  The gunman continues firing, interrupted by a brief gun jam, as Thompson stumbles forward and falls to the pavement. He then walks past Thompson and out of the frame.
  <br>
  <br>
  “From watching the video, it does seem that he’s proficient in the use of firearms as he was able to clear the malfunctions pretty quickly,” NYPD Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thompson was shot at least once in the back and once in the calf, Tisch said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The shooter, who wore a jacket, face mask and large backpack, fled through midtown on foot before pedalling an electric bike into Central Park a few blocks away, police said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The assailant remained at large Wednesday afternoon, sparking a search that included police drones, helicopters and dogs. (AP)

    New tolls to drive Tai Lam Tunnel capacity: official
   </title>

<img alt="Leung Sai-ho says Tai Lam Tunnel is heavily used by truck and van drivers. File photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1782188_1_20241205104029.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Plans to impose time-varying tolls at Tai Lam Tunnel could help it reach full capacity, an official said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on an RTHK programme, the Transport Department’s Assistant Commissioner Leung Sai-ho noted that if the tolls for the tunnel connecting Ting Kau and Yuen Long stay at their current levels, there would still be about 15 percent capacity untapped by 2026.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said authorities hope the adjusted tolls would attract drivers to use the tunnel and help disperse traffic flow on alternative routes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We were thinking about how we might utilise remaining capacity and help spread traffic for different routes. People may be familiar with Tuen Mun Road and Tolo Highway. If we adjust the tolls, we hope to attract more drivers to use the Tai Lam Tunnel, which is the most crucial factor in our consideration," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The proposed changes will include three tiers of charges for “peak”, “normal” and “non-peak” hours, similar to the system used for the cross-harbour tunnels.
  <br>
  <br>
  Instead of the present fixed toll of HK$58, private vehicles would pay HK$45 during peak hours, HK$30 during normal hours, and HK$18 during non-peak hours.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked whether there was room to further lower the charges during peak hours, Leung said authorities had been very careful in setting toll levels, warning that if tolls are lowered again congestion may occur.
  <br>
  <br>
  The official also mentioned that the fall in tolls for commercial vehicles - down from current level of between HK$64 and HK$79 to HK$43 throughout the day - is quite high.
  <br>
  <br>
  He stressed that data shows that Tai Lam Tunnel is heavily used by vans and trucks, indicating that the logistics industry relies on it to travel between the northwestern New Territories and urban areas.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Thursday made his first cabinet reshuffle at the mid-point of his five-year term, replacing transport minister Lam Sai-hung and tourism chief Kevin Yeung.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lam was replaced by the former Permanent Secretary for Transport and Logistics Mable Chan, while Rosanna Law moves on from her former position as housing director to take up the culture, sports and tourism portfolio.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I appreciate the leadership the articulation skill, and also the proactiveness of Ms Chan and Ms Law because this is exactly what I need in the years to come to ensure that we will reap the best results and also to ensure good governance,” Lee told a press conference unveiling his new ministers.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said while he believes the majority of the community largely agrees with his administration’s policy aims and strategies, Hong Kong has “lost time” due both to the Covid pandemic and the 2019 riots, and he wants to “chase back the results and time.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan and Law, the CE said, will help him realise his policy objectives, work closely with him and unite to further improve governance and serve the best interests of Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I am pleased with the team I have now with the two newly appointed secretaries joining us,” Lee said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “All the team members now are able people who will be implementing my governance philosophies and aims and are willing to take up challenges, make tough decisions, build the teams, and lead the officials to do what will be in alignment with my governance philosophy and aims.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee did not say where the two former ministers were found wanting, and expressed his appreciation for their past efforts.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I really think that they have contributed their best [and have given] their best efforts for Hong Kong. So I thank them sincerely and I hope that they will have a good life, happy life after their departure,” Lee said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “But I want to do more in these two and a half years. I want to get the people who will fit my criteria in building more results and ensuring the community understand and appreciate government policies. And I think I've got the best choices,” the CE added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The new ministers vowed to work hard to bring the best results to the people of Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said she was determined to cement Hong Kong's status as a transport and logistics hub.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I am honoured to be nominated by the chief executive and the appointment of the central people's government to become the Secretary for Transport and Logistics," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I will lead my bureau and four departments to strive for opportunities to change and take forward various infrastructure projects."
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Law said culture and tourism were important to the fabric of the city and were essential to many people's livelihoods.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is my honour and I feel there is a lot of responsibility on my shoulder. I thank the chief executive for his trust in me. I am going to be fully dedicated to supporting the chief executive and I will also stay united with principal officials, as well as the civil service."
  <br>
  <br>
  Law said top of her agenda would be to prepare for the introduction of the pandas to the public at Ocean Park, ensuring the smooth implementation of the multi-entry visa scheme for Shenzhen residents and preparing for next year's National Games.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, Lam described serving various government positions in his 40-year public service career as "the greatest honour of my life".
  <br>
  <br>
  He said he's grateful for the trust of the central government, the support of the CE as well as help from his government colleagues and friends in the industry over the years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeung thanked his colleagues at the Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau for working alongside with him.
  <br>
  <br>
  He believes his successor will continue to work towards the betterment and improvement of Hong Kong's future.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A 121st-minute Dejan Ljubicic penalty took Cologne to a 2-1 win over 10-man Hertha Berlin and a spot in the German Cup quarter-finals on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Hertha took the lead early when Ibrahim Maza converted a penalty after Derry Scherhant was felled in the box.
  <br>
  <br>
  Berlin's hopes took a hit soon after when Deyovaisio Zeefuik was red carded for a headbutt in the 25th minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  The visitors equalised five minutes later when Florian Niederlechner scored an own goal from a Cologne corner.
  <br>
  <br>
  With scores locked at 1-1, the match went to extra time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ljubicic missed a sitter inches from goal on the 100th-minute mark but made good on his error, sending the goalkeeper the wrong way, with penalties looming, to book Cologne's place in the last eight.
  <br>
  <br>
  2015 winners Wolfsburg beat Hoffenheim 3-0 at home thanks to three goals in 22 second-half minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Scoreless at half-time, Denis Vavro and Jonas Wind scored within four minutes of each other midway through the second half, before Yannick Gerhardt added a third to seal the game in the dying stages.
  <br>
  <br>
  The win continues Wolfsburg's improvement under former Southampton and RB Leipzig manager Ralph Hasenhuettl, with the Wolves now unbeaten in seven games.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Lois Openda scored a brace as RB Leipzig roared back into form with a 3-0 home win over Eintracht Frankfurt in the German Cup last 16.
  <br>
  <br>
  Leipzig and their coach Marco Rose came into the game under pressure, after five losses and a draw during a winless November, against a Frankfurt side sitting second in the league.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bayer Leverkusen, who eliminated 20-time winners Bayern Munich on Tuesday, have already booked their spot in the quarter-finals along with Stuttgart, Werder Bremen and Arminia Bielefeld, who are the sole third-division side in the final eight. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Kylian Mbappé said he will take full responsibility for a "big mistake" after the striker missed another penalty in champions Real Madrid's 2-1 defeat at Athletic Bilbao in La Liga on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  A week after the French superstar failed from the spot in the Champions League against Liverpool, he endured further misery from 12 yards as Los Blancos allowed league leaders Barcelona to retain their four-point advantage.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alejandro Berenguer fired Bilbao ahead early in the second half, with Jude Bellingham levelling for Madrid after Mbappé's penalty miss.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, substitute Gorka Guruzeta snatched fourth-place Athletic victory in the 80th minute after a Fede Valverde error.
  <br>
  <br>
  The defeat and Mbappé's penalty miss will heap further pressure on to the former Paris Saint-Germain striker's shoulders after plenty of criticism in recent weeks.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A big mistake in a match where every detail counts – I take full responsibility for it," said Mbappé in a post on social media network Instagram. "A difficult moment but it's the best time to change this situation and show who I am."
  <br>
  <br>
  Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti said the forward was downhearted after goalkeeper Julen Agirrezabala saved his penalty.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Obviously (Mbappé) is sad, disappointed, but he has to continue," the Italian told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mbappé has scored 10 goals in his first 20 games for Madrid across all competitions but is struggling for consistency.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He's not at his best level but we have to give him time to adapt, he's scored 10 goals, he can do better and he's working to do that," said Ancelotti.
  <br>
  <br>
  Madrid were hoping to build on three consecutive wins in La Liga, despite missing Vinicius Junior and other injured stars, with Ancelotti bringing French midfielder Aurelien Tchouameni back into the starting line-up. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Liverpool's Premier League lead was cut to seven points by Arsenal and Chelsea after the Reds conceded a 90th-minute equaliser in a thrilling 3-3 draw at Newcastle on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chelsea thrashed 10-man Southampton 5-1 to go second on goal difference ahead of Arsenal, who beat Manchester United 2-0.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mohamed Salah's second-half double was not enough to extend Liverpool's seven-game winning run in all competitions as they failed to win for just the third time in 21 games under Arne Slot.
  <br>
  <br>
  The league leaders were forced to come from behind at St James' Park twice, as Alexander Isak blasted Newcastle into a 1-0 half-time lead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Curtis Jones levelled before Anthony Gordon restored Newcastle's lead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Salah twice converted Trent Alexander-Arnold assists to turn the game around, taking his tally for the season to 15 goals.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, there was a late sting in the tale as a rare error from Liverpool goalkeeper Caoimhin Kelleher allowed Fabian Schar to squeeze in a late equaliser for the Magpies.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He has done remarkably well for us and even today he was good. Unfortunately, he misjudged the situation," Liverpool boss Slot said of Kelleher's blunder.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Arsenal took full advantage by inflicting Ruben Amorim's first defeat as Manchester United boss. Once again, the Gunners were able to rely on their prowess from set-pieces to get the job done.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jurrien Timber broke the deadlock, heading in Declan Rice's corner nine minutes into the second half.

  <br>
  William Saliba did not know much about the second, as he diverted in Thomas Partey's header from Bukayo Saka's corner, but the Frenchman did not care as Arsenal had the breathing space they craved.
  <br>
  <br>
  A fourth consecutive win in all competitions confirmed Arsenal's return to form and applied a little pressure on Liverpool.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A special day – it's a joy to play in this stadium with that energy, it's something incredible," Arteta said. "We scored two set-pieces, but we could've scored from open play many more."
  <br>
  <br>
  Amorim, meanwhile, said those set-pieces are what ultimately killed the game for United.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They can put a lot of players near the goalkeeper, and it's almost impossible to fight for the ball," he said. "We already know we have to be better." (AFP)

    Man City thump Forest to snap seven-game winless run

<div class="itemFullText">
 Pep Guardiola said Manchester City had to break the habit of losing after snapping a seven-game winless streak by beating Nottingham Forest 3-0 on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The English champions' barren run included six defeats, the worst run of Guardiola's managerial career.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, victory came at a cost as defenders Nathan Ake and Manuel Akanji had to be replaced due to injuries.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We needed it. The club, the players needed to win – but it is just one game," said Guardiola. "The problems continue with Manu and Nathan."
  <br>
  <br>
  "In general, the most important thing was to break this routine of not winning games and finally we won," he added."But we have to continue."
  <br>
  <br>
  Injury woes have been at the heart of City's struggles in recent months with Ballon d'Or winner Rodri out for the season due to a serious knee problem.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kevin De Bruyne's return to the starting line-up for the first time in nearly three months showed what City have been missing as he helped restore order for Guardiola's men.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Belgian teed up Bernardo Silva for an early opener and then fired home himself to double City's lead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jeremy Doku rounded off the scoring in the second half as the home side did not suffer a repeat of last week's collapse from 3-0 up to draw 3-3 against Feyenoord in the Champions League.
  <br>
  <br>
  Guardiola dismissed suggestions before the game that there had been a rift with De Bruyne, as he has been carefully managed back from injury problems.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Last season he out injured for many months, and this season as well – I'm so happy he's back," added Guardiola.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He fought a lot," he went on to say. "In respect to his physicality and minutes against Feyenoord was not good, and that's why I decided not to play against Liverpool for the rhythm they play."
  <br>
  <br>
  Neither Akanji or Ake are expected to be fit to face Crystal Palace on Saturday, but Phil Foden could return after missing the Forest match due to bronchitis. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks surged to fresh records on Wednesday, extending a post-election rally on optimism about more interest rate cuts and an artificial intelligence boom after strong Salesforce results.
 <br>
  <br>
  All three major indices scored records, led by the Dow Jones, which finished above 45,000 for the first time.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The market at this point is looking for excuses to go up, and there's not really anything that might work against that narrative," said Steve Sosnick of Interactive Brokers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Over the last couple of days, it's managed to ignore all sorts of inconvenient things," Sosnick said of the market's shrugging response to political upheaval in France and South Korea.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones finished up 0.7 percent at 45,014.
  <br>
  <br>
  The S&P 500 gained 0.6 percent to 6,086, its fourth straight record, while the Nasdaq jumped 1.3 percent to 19,735, its third straight record.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wednesday's gains came after payroll firm ADP said US private-sector hiring in November came in at a lower-than-expected 146,000 jobs, while a survey from the Institute for Supply Management showed weaker sentiment than expected in the services sector.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the lacklustre data boosts expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates later this month.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a New York conference, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell refrained from tipping his hand, but he "didn't say anything that would scare the market," said Briefing.com analyst Patrick O'Hare.
  <br>
  <br>
  O'Hare noted that Wednesday's gains were led by large tech names such as Nvidia and Microsoft, which are major AI players.
  <br>
  <br>
  The boost followed strong results from Salesforce, which was the biggest gainer in the Dow with an 11 percent jump. (AFP)

<img alt="Prime minister Michel Barnier will now have to submit his resignation to President Emmanuel Macron. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1782146_1_20241205051654.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 French lawmakers on Wednesday voted to oust the government of Prime Minister Michel Barnier after just three months in office, an historic move which hurled the country further into political uncertainty.
 <br>
  <br>
  For the first time in over sixty years, the National Assembly lower house toppled the incumbent government, approving a no-confidence motion that had been proposed by the hard left but which crucially was backed by the far-right headed by Marine Le Pen.
  <br>
  <br>
  Barnier's rapid ejection from office comes after snap parliamentary elections this summer which resulted in a hung parliament with no party having an overall majority and the far-right holding the key to the government's survival.
  <br>
  <br>
  President Emmanuel Macron now has the unenviable choice of picking a viable successor with more than two years of his presidential term left.
  <br>
  <br>
  He is to address the nation at 1900 GMT on Thursday, the Elysee said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The National Assembly debated a motion brought by the hard left in a standoff over next year's austerity budget, after the prime minister on Monday forced through a social security financing bill without a vote.
  <br>
  <br>
  With the support of the far-right, a majority of 331 MPs in the 577-member chamber voted to oust the government.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaker Yael Braun-Pivet confirmed Barnier would now have to "submit his resignation" to Macron and declared the session closed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Macron flew back into Paris just ahead of the vote after wrapping up his three-day state visit to Saudi Arabia, an apparent world away from the domestic crisis.
  <br>
  <br>
  He strolled earlier on Wednesday through the desert sands of the Al-Ula oasis, an iconic tourist project of the kingdom, marvelling at ancient landmarks. After landing, he headed direct to the Elysee Palace.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are now calling on Macron to go," Mathilde Panot, the head of the parliamentary faction of the hard-left France Unbowed (LFI) party told reporters, urging "early presidential elections" to solve the deepening political crisis.
  <br>
  <br>
  But taking care not to crow over the fall of the government, Le Pen said in a television interview that her party – once a new premier is appointed – "would let them work" and help create a "budget that is acceptable for everyone."
  <br>
  <br>
  Laurent Wauquiez, the head of right-wing deputies in parliament, said the far-right and hard-left bore the responsibility for a no-confidence vote that will "plunge the country into instability."
  <br>
  <br>
  Macron on Tuesday had rejected calls to resign, saying such a scenario amounted to "political fiction."
  <br>
  <br>
  With markets nervous and France bracing for public-sector strikes against the threat of cutbacks, action that will shut schools and hit air and rail traffic, there is a growing sense of crisis.
  <br>
  <br>
  The unions have called for civil servants, including teachers and air traffic controllers, to strike on Thursday over separate cost-cutting measures proposed by their respective ministries this autumn.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Macron is due to host a major international event on Saturday, with the reopening of the Notre-Dame cathedral after the 2019 fire, with guests including Donald Trump on his first foreign trip since he was elected to be the next US president. (AFP)

<img alt="Authorities held a meeting on Tuesday to discuss transportation arrangements ahead of the arrival of the Spectrum of the Seas. Photo courtesy: Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1782129_1_20241204215527.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Wednesday has announced a series of measures to boost public transport capacity to and from the Kai Tak cruise terminal this weekend, when a major cruise ship is set to sail into Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Spectrum of the Seas, the largest cruise liner in Asia, will make eight port calls in the SAR in December and January. The first call is happening this Friday, when the ship arrives from Shanghai with about 4,900 passengers.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The government welcomes the ship to choose Hong Kong as its homeport, and looks forward to working with the trade to better prepare to receive cruise passengers,” a government statement read.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau confirmed that two new express bus routes will be ready to take visitors to the nearby Kai Tak MTR station, and West Kowloon high speed rail station via Tsim Sha Tsui.
  <br>
  <br>
  The cruise passengers can also opt for free and paid shuttle buses to various tourist hotspots.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Transport Department has communicated with the taxi trade on the possible demand surge on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The cruise terminal will provide HK$100 gas coupons to each taxi which picks up passengers, if an “exceptionally strong demand” is anticipated.
  <br>
  <br>
  That’s double the previous offer of HK$50 voucher per taxi.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tourism Commissioner Angelina Cheung hoped the arrangements can offer cruise passengers with a better travelling experience, and consolidate Hong Kong's position as a major homeport in Asia and attract more ship calls.

    South Korean lawmakers begin Yoon impeachment push

<img alt="Thousands of protestors call for the resignation of South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1782131_2_20241204224300.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korean lawmakers on Wednesday accused President Yoon Suk Yeol of declaring martial law to stop criminal investigations into himself and his family, as they kick-started a push to impeach him.
 <br>
  <br>
  Yoon's declaration of South Korea's first martial law in over four decades was swiftly overturned by lawmakers in a night of drama, but has plunged the country into political turmoil and alarmed its close allies.
  <br>
  <br>
  The future of Yoon, a conservative politician and former star public prosecutor who was elected president in 2022, now looks highly uncertain.
  <br>
  <br>
  After jumping fences and tussling with security forces to get into parliament and vote down the martial law overnight, South Korea's opposition lawmakers have filed a motion to impeach Yoon.
  <br>
  <br>
  The motion says Yoon "gravely and extensively violated the constitution and the law" and accuses him of imposing martial law "with the unconstitutional and illegal intent to evade imminent investigations... into alleged illegal acts involving himself and his family".
  <br>
  <br>
  Lawmakers could vote on the motion as soon as the early hours of Friday morning and Yoon's prospects look bleak.
  <br>
  <br>
  The opposition holds a large majority in the 300-member parliament and needs only a handful of defections from the president's party to secure the two-thirds majority needed to pass the motion.
  <br>
  <br>
  The main opposition Democratic Party has also filed a complaint of "insurrection" against the president, some of his ministers and top military and police officials - which can carry a penalty of life imprisonment or even death.
  <br>
  <br>
  Even the leader of Yoon's own ruling party described the attempt as "tragic" while calling for those involved to be held accountable.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a show of public anger with the president, thousands of protesters converged around his office in central Seoul on Wednesday evening after staging a rally in Gwanghwamun Square, demanding Yoon quit.
  <br>
  <br>
  In his late-night television announcement imposing martial law on Tuesday, Yoon cited the threat of North Korea and "anti-state forces".
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 280 troops, some flown in by helicopters, arrived at parliament to lock down the site.
  <br>
  <br>
  But 190 lawmakers defied rifle-carrying soldiers to force their way into parliament to vote against the move.
  <br>
  <br>
  The constitution says martial law must be lifted when a parliamentary majority demands it, leaving Yoon with little choice but to retract his decision and call off the military in another television address six hours later.
  <br>
  <br>
  By evening, Yoon had yet to publicly reappear. (AFP)

    HK students excel in maths and science in global study

<img alt="Professor Hau Kit-tai, who led the research in Hong Kong, said local students have remained stable in terms of their competitiveness in maths and science. Photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1782128_1_20241204215311.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong pupils remain competitive among their worldwide peers in mathematical and scientific literacy, finishing among the top 10 in a major international research which is conducted every four years.
 <br>
  <br>
  The latest results for the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study, or TIMSS, was released on Wednesday. The study aims to help jurisdictions identify strengths in their education systems, as well as areas for improvement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Education Bureau commissioned the Chinese University of Hong Kong for the citywide assessment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Around 8,600 students from more than 270 primary and secondary schools took part in computer-based tests from May to July last year
  <br>
  <br>
  Primary four pupils came back fourth out of 58 economies in maths, down from second in the previous survey in 2019. But the cohort jumped six places to ninth in science.
  <br>
  <br>
  Secondary two students, meanwhile, retained fifth place among 44 economies in maths. There was a significant improvement in science, as they improved from 17th to eighth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Singapore topped the chart in all four categories.
  <br>
  <br>
  "From the previous few cycles starting from 1997, Hong Kong students’ math performance has been quite outstanding, which is within the first few economies among some 50 or 40 participating economies,” said Professor Hau Kit-tai, who coordinated the research in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But for science, our improvement is slightly on a broad trend but not so obvious. In terms of ranking, as compared to the last cycle in 2019, we have improved quite a lot," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Education Bureau has recently amended the primary curriculum so that science will become an independent subject, instead of being part of general studies.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We don’t know if that is a direct effect of such action that led to the improvement in science results as compared to last cycle," Hau said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He predicted schools will continue to place more emphasis on science, which in turn could attract more science graduates into the education sector and improve teaching quality.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hau also noted the performance gap between boys and girls is shrinking, with girls gradually catching up with their peers in recent cycles.
  <br>
  <br>
  The only exception is the primary four cohort, in which boys outperformed girls by 14 points in maths, and 10 points in science.

 The Hong Kong Biodiversity Expert Group on Wednesday called on the government and developers to minimise the impact of development on the city's wildlife.

  The group said the authorities' approach of prioritising development and then attempting to mitigate environmental damage has been ineffective in protecting marine and terrestrial ecosystems.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a press briefing, Simon Ng, a member of the group and the CEO of the Business Environment Council, urged the government to give a policy signal to the business sector, as it has recognised the importance of wildlife conservation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They see nature and biodiversity potentially as a risk management issue. So, on the one hand, some business operations actually rely [on] and are dependent on ecological services and nature, providing resources and support," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But on the other hand, biodiversity loss actually will cost the business sector dearly in terms of their operations, in terms of the supply chain."
  <br>
  <br>
  The group also recommended the government start large-scale restoration of terrestrial and marine ecosystems, as well as strengthen protection for Hong Kong's most endangered species.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The China Coast Guard (CCG) on Wednesday warned Manila to stop its infringements, provocations and actions, saying that a Philippine vessel intentionally rammed into a CCG ship around the Huangyan Dao, also known as the Scarborough Shoal.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Otherwise, the Philippines will be held accountable for all consequences arising from this," CCG spokesperson Liu Dejun said.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Wednesday, the CCG said the Philippines deployed coast guard vessels, official ships and fishing boats into waters around Huangyan Dao in the South China Sea as the Chinese fleet responded in accordance with the law and regulations.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CCG said that Philippine ships "came dangerously close", adding that a Philippine vessel ignored multiple warnings, made a sharp turn, reversed and deliberately rammed into a CCG ship.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liu added the Philippine side was the party at fault.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Philippines said the CCG had fired water cannon and "sideswiped" a government vessel during a maritime patrol.
  <br>
  <br>
  Manila also released a video appearing to show a Chinese coast guard ship firing a jet of water at the Philippines fisheries department vessel.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CCG accused Manila of making "bogus accusations in an attempt to mislead international understanding".
  <br>
  <br>
  China said Huangyan Dao has always been its territory.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tensions between Manila and Beijing escalated last month when Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos signed two laws defining the country's sea waters and imposing fixed lanes for foreign ships, prompting China to summon the Philippine ambassador.
  <br>
  <br>
  And ties frayed further when the Philippines and the United States signed a security deal allowing both sides to share classified information. (Xinhua/AFP)

    'HK children struggle to get resilience training'

<img alt="A survey by Outward Bound Hong Kong found that a majority of young people find it difficult to get resilience training at school.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Outward Bound Hong Kong on Wednesday said a survey it's carried out suggests most children in Hong Kong lack confidence in their resilience and are unsure how to develop this skill.
 <br>
  <br>
  The outdoor education provider surveyed more than 700 parents and students between May and June, finding that both groups consider resilience a crucial life skill.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, 80 percent of the 337 young people polled said they find it difficult to get resilience training at school.
  <br>
  <br>
  Announcing the findings at a forum, the group's executive director Nick Cotton said it's important for youngsters to learn from failure.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We need to be prepared to let young people fail. Because through failure you learn, and through learning that's where you develop that resilience because you know that failing is not the end of the world,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “And that process then of reflecting and thinking how you can improve, that's what resilience really is. Because next time you're faced with a challenge, you're able to tackle it head on.”
  <br>
  <br>
  At the same event, Paralympic boccia gold medallist Ho Yuen-kei encouraged young people to pursue their dreams and never give up.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The study said that nowadays youngsters lack resilience. But I suggest try to do something you like and join the activity in our community. You can try something that you may not be familiar with. Don't be afraid of being unsuccessful," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jack Wong, who chairs Clearwater Bay Golf and Country Club, said it's a reality that less resourceful students may have less opportunity to access resilience training.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong added that his organisation is working with NGOs to empower youngsters through sports tournaments.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong’s top-ranked tennis player Coleman Wong on Wednesday said he is ready for the thrills that come with competing on home turf, as he gears up for his return to the Hong Kong Tennis Open at the end of the month.
 <br>
  <br>
  Four of the world’s top 20 players have been announced as new additions to an already star-studded line-up, with Lorenzo Musetti of Italy, France’s Arthur Fils and Russia’s Karen Khachanov set to join defending champion Andrey Rublev on Victoria Park Centre Court from December 29 to January 5.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Wong, 20, remains unfazed by the prospect of competing among such star power, saying this has encouraged him to elevate his performance, and he's counting on the support of home fans.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I really like playing in front of a huge crowd,” Wong said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I’m really looking forward to it, because last year I already had this experience and it was amazing – I recall the stadium being full when I played, so I’m really excited to be out there again.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The world number 170 enters the tournament coming off a rollercoaster of a season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Starting the year with an ATP ranking of 253, Wong qualified for his first Masters 1000 event in Miami back in March, and came within reach of the Hangzhou Open quarterfinals in September.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong rose to achieve the highest ever ranking recorded by a player from Hong Kong, at 128, on September 30.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said he is confident in his ability and level of play ahead of the competition in Hong Kong – including the opportunity to compete against Rublev.
  <br>
  <br>
  “He’s such a good player,” said Wong. “He’s one of those guys I’ve watched videos of, and I’ve seen him quite a few times in other tournaments from outside Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  “So I’m looking forward to hopefully playing against him in one of these rounds this coming competition.”

<div class="itemFullText">
 A French cultural and educational organisation is launching an immersive augmented reality experience of Notre-Dame de Paris in Hong Kong on Sunday, coinciding with the cathedral's reopening after its devastating fire in 2019.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lydie Blandeau, co-founder and CEO of Visionairs, said the exhibition at the West Kowloon cultural hub aims to showcase the cathedral's 850-year history through innovative technology and artefacts, fostering cultural exchange between France and Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  She also said the AR exhibition will enable people of all ages to explore the iconic landmark without the need for travel.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This experience, it's a mix of history and what has happened in the 21st century when the cathedral was on fire, so they will enjoy the new constructions, but all of these new constructions are based on real strong work from people, we can say like craftsmanship people, who rebuilt the cathedral to what it was, including by using the stone they used 800 years," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's a very interesting combination of 360 degrees of augmented reality, so you can turn around and you can see from the bottom to the top different aspects and visuals of the cathedral."
  <br>
  <br>
  Visitors will receive a portable touch-screen tablet that guides them on an interactive tour of grand historical events, including the wedding of King Henry IV, Napoleon Bonaparte's coronation, and the construction of Viollet-le-Duc's spire in the 19th century.
  <br>
  <br>
  This exhibition has travelled the globe, from Paris to Dubai and Montreal to Shanghai, attracting over 750,000 visitors across 19 locations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Blandeau said she hopes to create a similar exhibition showcasing Hong Kong's landmarks for a global audience in the future.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We hope we can work with different Hong Kong museums and especially culture here because Hong Kong, it's really a place in Asia where everything comes true regarding arts and culture. I think Hong Kong people, they appreciate art and history," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We hope we can create more content from here to exhibit also in our next venue we want to do in Paris and Arab countries where we have different offers to enlarge different locations like this."

    Significant rise in airplane theft cases in 2024: govt

<img alt="The Security Bureau said there's been a significant increase in theft cases on board Hong Kong-bound flights this year. File photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1782061_1_20241204143235.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government said the number of thefts on board Hong Kong-bound aircraft for the first 10 months of the year reached a seven-year high, involving property worth more than HK$4.3 million.
 <br>
  <br>
  Security minister Chris Tang on Wednesday said there were 169 such cases recorded through October, with most of them involving short-haul flights from Southeast Asia.
  <br>
  <br>
  The figure compares to 147 cases for the whole of 2019, and 103 the year before that.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a written reply to the legislature, the minister described the rise in the number of cases as significant, saying items stolen included cash, credit cards, jewellery and watches.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[The increase] might be due to the fact that the police have stepped up publicity to encourage more people to report crimes, or the overall economic situation," he wrote in response to DAB lawmaker Kennedy Wong.
  <br>
  <br>
  Four people have been arrested - one of them on remand pending trial, with another released on bail.
  <br>
  <br>
  Charges for two others were dropped because of a lack of evidence, or because witnesses refused to come to Hong Kong to testify.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister said the government had no plans to install surveillance cameras or arrange security personal in airplane cabins for now, citing privacy reasons, manpower and the principle of proportionality.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Currently, there are no international policies regulating the installation of CCTV or arrangements of security staff on duty inside cabins, nor are these common practices generally adopted by airlines," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Tang said officials would work with airlines to engage in more educational and publicity campaigns.

 South Korea's opposition parties on Wednesday said they had tabled a motion to impeach President Yoon Suk-yeol.
 <br>
  <br>
  A member of the opposition told reporters the vote to impeach President Yoon could happen as early as Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon is facing mounting legislative and public pressure to leave office or be forced out, hours after he ended a short-lived martial law that prompted troops to encircle parliament overnight before lawmakers voted to lift it.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon’s senior advisers and secretaries offered to resign collectively and his Cabinet members, including Defence Minister Kim Yong-hyun, were also facing calls to step down, as the nation struggled to make sense of what appeared to be a poorly-thought-out stunt. (Agencies)

<img alt="Frankie Yick backed the decision not to allow toll-free journeys during non-peak hours. File photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1782050_1_20241204132256.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government’s plan to charge time-varying tolls for the Tai Lam Tunnel has been welcomed by transport sector lawmaker Frankie Yick who describes the proposed new tolls as “acceptable”.
 <br>
  <br>
  Yick told RTHK on Wednesday that he understands people want to see lower tolls, but they have to realise the priority is to ease traffic congestion.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Well, of course, I think everybody wants the government to lower down the toll to make it even more affordable. But I think we have to look at the numbers. So, if we believe the numbers are correct, I think the most important thing is after the introduction of the new toll, we have to make sure the Tai Lam Tunnel will not be congested. Otherwise, it will defeat the whole purpose,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yick also backed the decision not to allow toll-free journeys during non-peak hours, saying the charges are affordable and it is reasonable to make people pay for the maintenance costs.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I think I would agree that we should maintain some charges, but of course the most important thing is whether it's affordable by the driving public. If you look at the non-peak hours fee right now at HK$18 [for private cars], I think it's quite reasonable in a sense.”
  <br>
  <br>
  “And of course the government, after taking over the management of the tunnel, they do have the maintenance costs and future investment costs, upgrade of services, that sort of stuff. I think they still need money to do that,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  DAB lawmaker Ben Chan, the chairman of Legco's panel on transport, expressed hope that the government would consider further reducing the tolls for taxis and commercial vehicles.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The government has provided us data and told us it hopes to avoid congestion in the tunnel. This is also in the public's interest. We hope that if the new toll system is implemented, there will be a review after about a year to assess the actual transport situation and see if these tolls are necessary,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Federation of Trade Unions lawmaker Michael Luk, meanwhile, said he thinks the charges during peak hours will still be high, urging authorities to shorten the peak hours period and further reduce fees during other times of day.

    Govt reviewing scheme to help traffic accident victims

<img alt="Chris Sun said officials are looking into making changes to a scheme offering help to traffic accident victims." src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1782041_1_20241204124607.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Labour and welfare minister Chris Sun on Wednesday said officials were looking at lowering the maximum amount of sick leave allowed under a subsidy scheme for people involved in traffic accidents.
 <br>
  <br>
  Last month, the police said they had arrested 275 people on suspicion of "staging" accidents to obtain the allowance.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister told lawmakers the scheme currently allows for 180 days of leave, and officials are inclined to cut that down.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Currently, the maximum sick leave allowed is roughly half a year. We think this should be subject to review. We'll see if we should give so much, and whether we should lower the number.....and by how much? We will have a look," Sun said at a Legislative Council meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Another thing is that there are quite a number of subsidy items on offer. One is for those injured, another is for those who cannot go to work. We think there are too many forms of subsidies. The aim is mainly to weather the storm for the recipient. So we'll think of ways to consolidate these, to simplify things."
  <br>
  <br>
  Sun said officials also have to implement the scheme under the principle of keeping expenditures within the limits of revenues.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added the money for the subsidies comes from transport-related fees such as licensing and vehicle registration.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister hoped the review could be completed before the end of the year, for tabling the proposed changes to the legislature for discussion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sun also said following the arrests, social welfare officials have reviewed their workflow, and made extra efforts to check the documents submitted by subsidy applicants, especially those who were making repeated claims.

    CUHK invents non-invasive way to find bowel disease

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chinese University researchers on Wednesday said they have invented non-invasive technology to identify bowel disease, reducing the need for endoscopies.
 <br>
  <br>
  The university made use of faecal samples from about 6,000 people from different regions, and found about 20 types of bacteria associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).
  <br>
  <br>
  Francis Chan, professor of medicine and therapeutics, said droplet digital PCR technology can be used to test stool samples and determine whether a patient has IBD or a different gut disorder.
  <br>
  <br>
  “IBD, at least early stage, their symptoms are no different from our common functional gut problems like irritable bowel syndrome,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “That's the reason why when many patients present with these recurrent symptoms related to the gut, they go to see the doctor, and then they have no choice but to undergo endoscopy, just to make sure that they are not suffering from IBD.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said traditionally, it takes up to 12 months for a patient with IBD to be diagnosed, and delayed treatment can lead to serious complications like bleeding and bowel cancer.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said results from the stool test are available in a week, allowing for earlier diagnosis.
  <br>
  <br>
  Researchers said the technology can also assess the risk of bowel cancer among IBD patients, adding that the test is expected to be ready for clinical use in Hong Kong in 2027.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Wednesday said it is important to uphold the Constitution when making legislative and policy changes, to ensure reform is in the right direction.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a seminar on Constitution Day, Lee said the Constitution is the country's supreme law and provides the legal framework for policy formulation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In further deepening reform comprehensively, we must regard the Constitution as our country's fundamental law by upholding and implementing the Constitution's requirements, principles, and spirit," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Only then can we ensure our reform stays on the right track and proceeds in the right way at a steady pace."
  <br>
  <br>
  The CE added that constitutional education and implementation must go hand in hand to ensure that people respect and comply with the law.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is because a solid grasp of the Constitution's substance and spirit among the entire populace is crucial to a healthy atmosphere of respect for the law and compliance," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee said Hong Kong can play its role by maximising its unique strengths under the "One Country, Two Systems" framework.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zheng Yanxiong, director of the liaison office, told the same seminar that the SAR should continue to pursue high-quality development and deepen reform under the rule of law.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We must also embark on innovations. We have accumulated new experience, and we have also designated a Constitution Day and other measures. So all these have been taken under our new innovative spirit, and this is a result of the rule of law and reform," he said.

    Govt urges HK residents to be careful in South Korea

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong tourists heading to South Korea on Wednesday said they were not fazed about the short-lived martial law in the country as the government called on residents to remain cautious.
 <br>
  <br>
  South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol ended martial law hours after the declaration last night.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Hong Kong, flights for South Korea were operating as usual.
  <br>
  <br>
  A woman surnamed Wong was heading to South Korea alone.
  <br>
  <br>
  She admitted she was a bit worried when martial law was declared, but noted that it was short-lived.
  <br>
  <br>
  She believed the situation in the country should be fine.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I plan to check the news before I head out," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I will also try to avoid places with crowds, as my friends told me that if I see people gathering, I should not get close."
  <br>
  <br>
  A woman surnamed Cheung told RTHK that she's not too concerned about the situation, adding that whatever happens, happens.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another Hongkonger, surnamed Law, believed she will be safe as long as she stays away from protests.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said if anything happens, she will stay in the hotel.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some Koreans in the SAR said they were shocked about the declaration of martial law.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mr Park, who's in the region with a friend for a taekwondo competition, said he and his pal were sceptical about the news when it broke.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We [thought] that it's not real situation. [We thought] it's fake. We talked to each other that it's fake news. But it's a real situation. So we are very surprised. About 40 years ago, you know that Korea is under the military government, but Korea is very developed economically and politically," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And democracy, we Korean people made democracy. So we believe that this kind of situation cannot be real and cannot stay [for long]. So we are very happy to see that the situation is over."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Travel Industry Council said around 400 people from 26 tours groups are in South Korea.
  <br>
  <br>
  Their trips have not been affected and there are no plans for them to return to Hong Kong earlier than scheduled.
  <br>
  <br>
  The council has not received any requests for assistance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Still, the SAR government urged Hong Kong residents who are in the country or plan to go to South Korea to remain cautious.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[They should] monitor the situation, exercise caution, attend to personal safety, avoid large gatherings of people and pay attention to local announcements on the latest situation."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Security Bureau said social order in South Korea is normal for now, and it would closely monitor the situation.
  <br>
  <br>
  So far, no one has asked for assistance from the Immigration Department.

    Time-varying tolls proposed for Tai Lam Tunnel
   </title>

<img alt="The morning rush hour at the Tai Lam Tunnel will be from 7.15am to 9.45am, while the evening peak period will be from 5.15pm to 7pm. File photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1782036_1_20241204122011.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government says it plans to charge time-varying tolls for the Tai Lam Tunnel after it takes control of the infrastructure in the New Territories on May 31 next year.
 <br>
  <br>
  Currently, private car and taxi drivers pay HK$58, while commercial vehicle drivers pay between HK$64 and HK$79 for using the tunnel connecting Ting Kau and Yuen Long.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under the new tolling system, there will be three levels of charges for “peak”, “general” and “non-peak” hours, similar to the system used for the cross-harbour tunnels.
  <br>
  <br>
  The morning rush hour will be from 7.15am to 9.45am, while the evening peak period will be from 5.15pm to 7pm.
  <br>
  <br>
  For private cars, the proposed toll during peak hours is HK$45, HK$30 for normal periods of the day, and HK$18 for non-peak hours.
  <br>
  <br>
  Motorcyclists will pay HK$18 during peak hours, HK$12 during normal periods and HK$7.2 at non-peak hours.
  <br>
  <br>
  Taxis will be charged a fixed toll of HK$28 and commercial vehicles HK$43 throughout the day.
  <br>
  <br>
  A fixed charging scheme will apply to all vehicles on Sundays and public holidays.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government also explained that it hasn't considered toll-free journeys in non-peak hours because it believes the best approach is to have users cover the infrastructure costs, emphasising this has nothing to do with the higher-than-expected government deficit this fiscal year.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said the scheme will ease traffic on alternative routes such as Tuen Mun Road and the Tolo Highway.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tuen Mun Road is expected to see 300 fewer private cars during the busiest hour of the day.
  <br>
  <br>
  There will be a mechanism in place to adjust the tolls, with any changes capped at no more than HK$3.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government said it plans to table a bill on the plans to Legco for a first reading next Wednesday, and hopes to see it passed in the first quarter of next year.

    Bank of Korea to provide liquidity to support markets

<img alt="The Bank of Korea reassured investors it would take all necessary steps to stabilise the markets. File photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1782037_1_20241204122024.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korea said it would provide "sufficient liquidity" to support its financial markets on Wednesday after the country was rocked by President Yoon Suk-yeol's brief imposition of martial law overnight.
 <br>
  <br>
  Equities sank more than two percent in Seoul and the won initially plunged to a two-year low against the US dollar after the dramatic move, which stunned traders already concerned about the state of the economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a bid to limit the fallout from the crisis, the country's central bank and finance ministry moved to reassure markets.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As announced together with the government, it has been decided to temporarily supply sufficient liquidity until the financial and foreign exchange markets stabilise," the Bank of Korea said.
  <br>
  <br>
  It added that "the range of securities eligible for (repo) transactions and the target institutions will be expanded".
  <br>
  <br>
  Deputy Prime Minister Choi Sang-mok, who is also the Minister of Economy and Finance, said financial authorities will keep international partners informed about developments.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In order to ease concerns about our economic situation, we will closely communicate with international credit rating agencies, major countries such as the US, domestic economic organisations and financial markets, and share the situation," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In addition, we will operate a 24-hour economic and financial situation inspection task force to operate a real-time monitoring system to prevent a real-time economic shock, and we will thoroughly monitor with relevant organisations to prevent any disruptions in exports."
  <br>
  <br>
  He added "the government will also do its best to ensure that the uncertainty facing our economy is quickly resolved".
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon said he had made the shock decision, which took Seoul's global allies by off guard, "to safeguard a liberal South Korea from the threats posed by North Korea's communist forces and to eliminate anti-state elements plundering people's freedom and happiness".
  <br>
  <br>
  However, he backed down hours later when lawmakers voted to oppose the declaration, while thousands of protesters took to the streets and the nation's largest umbrella labour union called an "indefinite general strike" until Yoon resigned.
  <br>
  <br>
  Analysts warned that while the U-turn meant the impact of the night's extraordinary events would be tempered, the country could still face further turmoil in the economy, with worries about US President-elect Donald Trump trade policy also causing concern.
  <br>
  <br>
  "From a macro perspective, South Korea was already one of the more vulnerable countries to the impact of Trump's proposed tariffs," said MUFG's senior currency analyst Michael Wan.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This recent development could raise some further risk premium on the currency at least until we get clarity on political stability." (AFP)

    Charity hopes OSC funding can help educate refugees

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A charity group which helps the refugee community is seeking support to boost its efforts to educate the needy, particularly to make recipients more tech-savvy.
 <br>
  <br>
  Grassroots Future is among 11 beneficiaries of this year's Operation Santa Claus (OSC). It was founded four years ago during the pandemic to help refugees and asylum seekers in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  The charity now focuses on helping the recipients with their education, mental well-being and community building.
  <br>
  <br>
  Its director, Tegan Smyth, said with many things getting more expensive, such as textbooks, one of her group's initiatives is to relieve the financial stress of parents.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's called TE(A)CH at the Grassroots and it's covering an IT program for refugee and asylum seeker children and their parents over a two-year basis. It's also covering textbook expenses, which is a really pressing need for the community," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Smyth said education is a major barrier for refugee children in the SAR, because their parents are unable to work, making it hard for them to pay upfront for textbooks and other school expenses.
  <br>
  <br>
  She added that her charity has been helping around 30 children a year, and she hopes the number will keep rising.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jointly organised by RTHK and South China Morning Post, OSC funds charitable projects that focus on children and youth, the elderly, the community, those with physical and mental disabilities, medical projects, and those concerning the environment.
  <br>

    HK must reform amid economic transformation: CE

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee said the time is ripe for various sectors in Hong Kong to speed up reform, and there is no exception for the government especially after the country adopted a resolution on further deepening reform to advance Chinese modernisation.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a new season of the RTHK programme
  <i>
   Overview Policy
  </i>
  , Lee said he has been trying to push for reform since he took office in 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  "At that time, I used milder words, such as 'change'. That's because everybody will interpret the reform differently," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CE said reform is never easy, as it often affects people with vested interests or forces people to leave their comfort zone, so it's necessary to convince the public why reform is necessary.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Some of the elements of success Hong Kong rode on in the past may not work anymore... Mainland cities are improving very quickly, with new technologies and systems. They have a stronger social basis and are more receptive to reform."
  <br>
  <br>
  He said businesses must adapt amid the city's economic transformation and changes in consumption patterns for locals and visitors alike.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If [businesses] don't carry out reform, they'll be phased out," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The chief executive said society has reached a consensus on the need for reform.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Now, we only have to tell people the disadvantages of not carrying out reform and the advantages of reform. Society already knows about it."
  <br>
  <br>
  The CE said the government needs to embrace reform as well, and that he's told senior staff to be more proactive.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You have to strike first. Before a problem surfaces, it's best that you foresee the problem and correct it... if there are ambiguous situations, just step in, instead of wasting time to debate who should take responsibility," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee also said principal officials have been ordered to face the public more by disseminating messages regularly on social media, so the public knows the government is tackling problems whenever they arise.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Justice Secretary Paul Lam on Wednesday said the Constitution provides the fundamental legal protection for the "One Country, Two Systems" framework, and people should start learning about the Constitution from a young age.
 <br>
  <br>
  Addressing the flag-raising ceremony on Constitution Day, Lam said the event was established to promote constitutional spirit and the rule of law.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Given the fundamental importance of the Constitution in implementing 'One Country, Two Systems' in Hong Kong, we must strengthen constitutional awareness. The prerequisite is to deepen public understanding and knowledge of the Constitution," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The activities on Constitution Day serve to promote and propagate the Constitution. It's also a good opportunity to promote rule of law awareness through public education."
  <br>
  <br>
  The SAR should make full use of the unique advantages under "One Country, Two Systems" and safeguard national sovereignty, security and development interests, Lam added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The justice chief also called it an "important mission" to teach youngsters about what the Constitution is and why it matters, adding that disciplinary services officers should stand at the forefront as guardians of the Constitution.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 100 members of the disciplined services took part in the flag-raising ceremony led by the Security Bureau at the Hong Kong Customs College.

<img alt="People take part in a rally in downtown Seoul to demand South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol's removal from power. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1782017_1_20241204104617.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korea's main opposition party on Wednesday said it would initiate impeachment proceedings against President Yoon Suk-yeol unless he immediately resigned, after his short-lived declaration of martial law overnight.
 <br>
  <br>
  If Yoon "does not resign immediately, the Democratic Party will immediately initiate impeachment proceedings in line with the will of the people," it said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  A coalition of lawmakers from opposition parties said they planned to propose a bill to impeach Yoon on Wednesday which should be voted within 72 hours.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The parliament should focus on immediately suspending the president’s business to pass an impeachment bill soonest,” Hwang Un-ha, one of the MPs in the coalition, told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon's chief of staff and senior secretaries offered to resign en masse, a presidential official said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon told the nation in a TV address that martial law was needed to defend the country from nuclear-armed North Korea and pro-North anti-state forces, and protect its free constitutional order, although he cited no specific threats.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chaotic scenes ensued as helmeted troops climbed into the parliament building through smashed windows and military helicopters hovered overhead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Parliamentary aides sprayed fire extinguishers to push the soldiers back, and protesters scuffled with police outside.
  <br>
  <br>
  The military said activities by parliament and political parties would be banned, and that media and publishers would be under the control of the martial law command.
  <br>
  <br>
  But within hours of the declaration, South Korea's parliament, with 190 of its 300 members present, unanimously passed a motion requiring martial law be lifted, including all 18 members present from Yoon's party.
  <br>
  <br>
  The president then rescinded the declaration.
  <br>
  <br>
  Protesters outside the National Assembly shouted and clapped. “We won!” they chanted, and one demonstrator banged on a drum.
  <br>
  <br>
  More protests are expected on Wednesday with South Korea's largest union coalition, the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions, planning to hold a rally in Seoul and vowing to strike until Yoon resigns. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Seoul stock exchange fell 2 percent at the opening on Wednesday before limiting its losses in early trading, after President Yoon Suk Yeol briefly declared then lifted martial law overnight.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Kospi composite index tumbled to 2,450 points as trading opened while shares in the country's biggest company Samsung Electronics slid 3 percent before paring losses about half an hour later to 1.12 percent down.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Korean won lost 2.5 percent against the greenback overnight to 1,444.09 against the dollar, its weakest level in two years.
  <br>
  <br>
  It later regained ground at the start of Asian trading, ahead of an extraordinary meeting called by the South Korean central bank to "discuss the situation related to the declaration of martial law and market stabilisation measures."
  <br>
  <br>
  At 0030 GMT, it was trading at 1,414.49 won against the dollar.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tokyo's stocks started the day cautiously, with blue-chip Nikkei down 0.11 percent to 39,205 points at the open. (AFP)

    Bayern knocked out of German Cup, Neuer sees first red

<div class="itemFullText">
 Bayern Munich were dumped out of the German Cup by holders Bayer Leverkusen as Nathan Tella's second-half goal secured a 1-0 win for the Bundesliga champions on Tuesday, after Manuel Neuer saw the first red card of his 866-game career.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 38-year-old rushed out of the box in typical fashion 18 minutes in to the German Cup last-16 clash, taking out an advancing Jeremie Frimpong and seeing a straight red.
  <br>
  <br>
  Neuer's sending-off brought Israel goalkeeper Daniel Peretz on for his Bayern debut, 18 months after joining the club.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bayern, who were already without the injured Harry Kane, dug deep despite the one-man disadvantage and dominated the ball.
  <br>
  <br>
  The visitors eventually broke through in the 69th minute, though, with Tella heading in an Alex Grimaldo cross.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tella had only been on the field for eight minutes having come on for injured striker Patrik Schick, who himself was subbed on at half-time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Home winger Michael Olise lashed inches wide in the fourth minute of stoppage time but Leverkusen held on to inflict a first domestic defeat on Vincent Kompany since he became Bayern coach.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We were too hectic and tried to go forward too quickly," Leverkusen captain Jonathan Tah said. "At half-time, we said we need to be patient – and we did it.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The red card decided the game," Neuer told reporters after the match. "It hurt us, and I'm sorry."
  <br>
  <br>
  Xabi Alonso's Leverkusen, who won an unbeaten league and cup double last season, are through to the last eight.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bayern have won the German Cup a record 20 times – 14 more than the next best – but have not made it past the quarter-finals since 2020, when they defeated Leverkusen 4-2 in the final. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ruud van Nistelrooy savoured his first match in charge of Leicester with a 3-1 Premier League win over West Ham, while Crystal Palace edged Ipswich 1-0 on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Jamie Vardy, Bilal El Khannouss and Patson Daka got the goals as Van Nistelrooy enjoyed a dream start to his new role shortly after his departure from Manchester United.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dutchman said he had been "astonished" by the number of offers he received after a four-game spell as interim United boss, which included two wins over Leicester.
  <br>
  <br>
  A lethal finisher in his playing days, Van Nistelrooy watched on approvingly as Vardy opened the scoring after just 99 seconds at the King Power.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 37-year-old had initially been flagged offside, but a VAR review showed he was clearly on for his fifth goal of the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Defeat ramps up the scrutiny of Hammers boss Julen Lopetegui after a seventh defeat in 14 Premier League games.
  <br>
  <br>
  The visitors enjoyed the majority of possession and had 31 shots to Leicester's eight but failed to make it count.
  <br>
  <br>
  West Ham did have a goal controversially ruled out when Leicester goalkeeper Mads Hermansen punched the ball into his own net and was relieved to be awarded a foul due to minimal contact from Tomas Soucek.
  <br>
  <br>
  Conor Coady also cleared off the line from Crysencio Summerville in the second half.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Leicester remained a threat on the counter-attack and doubled their lead when El Khannouss coolly stroked home Kasey McAteer's pass.
  <br>
  <br>
  Daka then blasted in to make it 3-0 before Niclas Fuellkrug netted a late consolation with his first West Ham goal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Victory lifts Leicester up to 15th, four points above the relegation zone, and within two points of 14th-placed West Ham.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Jean-Philippe Mateta scored the only goal at Portman Road as Palace won the battle of two more sides at the bottom end of the table.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Frenchman produced a classy finish from Eberechi Eze's pass on the hour mark to secure the Eagles' first away win of the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Palace pull three points clear of the bottom three, while Ipswich remain second from bottom and winless at home on their return to the top flight. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The S&P 500 and Nasdaq closed at fresh records with narrow gains on Tuesday as markets reacted to mixed labour market data that kept alive the possibility of another Federal Reserve interest rate cut.
 <br>
  <br>
  Major indices have been notching regular records following the US presidential election, spawning talk that markets are now overvalued.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There's not a whole lot of natural drivers of new money coming into the market at this point," said Kim Forrest of Bokeh Capital Partners, adding that markets appear "biased to the upside" in light of a benign 2025 financial outlook.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones finished down 0.2 percent at 44,705.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the S&P 500 added 0.1 percent at 6,049, a third straight record, while the Nasdaq climbed 0.4 percent to 19,480, scoring its second straight record.
  <br>
  <br>
  A closely-watched labour market report showed an increase in job openings in October, but also a decline in new job postings during the month, a less upbeat sign.
  <br>
  <br>
  Samuel Tombs, chief US economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the data overall provides "good grounds" for the Fed to lower interest rates again this month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Futures markets lifted the odds of another rate cut by the US central bank on December 17.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among individual companies, AT&T jumped 4.6 percent as it announced US$40 billion in shareholder give-backs at an investor day where it projected revenue and operating earnings growth over the next three years.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Raphinha and Lamine Yamal inspired Barcelona to a first win in four La Liga outings as they beat Mallorca 5-1 on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The comprehensive victory brings the Catalans to 37 points at the top of the league table, four ahead of second-placed Real Madrid, but with two extra matches played.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carlo Ancelotti's Spanish and European champions will have the chance to cut that lead back to one point on Wednesday when they travel to Athletic Bilbao.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mallorca stay sixth in La Liga, still two points behind Athletic Bilbao in the final Champions League spot.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ferran Torres gave Barcelona the lead, before Vedat Muriqi equalised to ensure the sides were level at half-time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Raphinha and Yamal lit up the second half as the away side ran riot with the Brazilian scoring a double, followed by strikes from Frenkie de Jong and Pau Victor.
  <br>
  <br>
  Barcelona were boosted by the return of teenage starlet Yamal, who started the match after recovering from an ankle problem.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hansi Flick's side dropped points in the two league outings Yamal missed, and were also defeated last time out at home to lowly Las Palmas when he was only fit enough to start on the bench.
  <br>
  <br>
  The hosts gifted Barca the lead in the 12th minute when panicked defending resulted in Torres being presented with a golden opportunity when there seemed to be no danger.
  <br>
  <br>
  As a trio of Majorcan defenders shepherded the ball back to their goalkeeper, full-back Johan Mojica suddenly decided to try to lash it away, only to smash the ball straight into Antonio Raillo and it fell perfectly to the feet of the Barcelona forward, who duly stroked home the opener.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Catalans' high defensive line caught Mallorca out on several occasions as they tried to spring their attackers with passes over the top.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mallorca were, however, starting to build pressure on Barcelona, though the visitors remained dangerous on the counter with their fleet-footed attacking quartet of Yamal, Dani Olmo, Raphinha and Torres.
  <br>
  <br>
  A second goal in the match did not seem far away, for either side, and it came for the hosts in the 43rd minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  Inigo Martinez was deeper than the rest of the Barcelona line and Pablo Maffeo timed his run onto Sergi Darder's pass to perfection, before rolling the ball across to Muriqi to tap into an open net. (AFP)

    South Korea president says will lift martial law

<img alt="South Korea's National Assembly Speaker Woo Won-shik passes a resolution demanding the immediate lifting of martial law. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1781974_1_20241204052609.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korea's President Yoon Suk Yeol said on Wednesday he would lift martial law, just hours after imposing it in a bid to quell what he called "anti-state forces."
 <br>
  <br>
  Yoon backed down after lawmakers voted to oppose the unexpected declaration, which caught even South Korea's closest allies around the world off guard.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier the National Assembly was sealed and troops entered the building for a short time, while hundreds of protesters gathered outside and faced off with security forces.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Just a moment ago, there was a demand from the National Assembly to lift the state of emergency, and we have withdrawn the military that was deployed for martial law operations," Yoon said in a televised address around 4:30 am (1930 GMT Tuesday).
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will accept the National Assembly's request and lift the martial law through the Cabinet meeting."
  <br>
  <br>
  Yonhap news agency reported that Yoon's cabinet approved the motion to lift the order.
  <br>
  <br>
  The U-turn prompted jubilation among protesters outside parliament who had braved freezing temperatures to keep vigil through the night in defiance of Yoon's martial law order.
  <br>
  <br>
  Demonstrators waving banners and South Korean flags and chanting "Arrest Yoon Sul Yeol" outside the National Assembly erupted in cheers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lim Myeong-pan, 55, said that Yoon's decision to rescind martial law did not absolve him of wrongdoing.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Yoon's act of imposing it in the first place without legitimate cause is a serious crime in itself," said Lim.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He has paved his own path to impeachment with this."
  <br>
  <br>
  Some 190 lawmakers had managed to get into the assembly in the early hours of Wednesday, where they unanimously voted in favour of a motion to block the martial law declaration and call for its lifting.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under the constitution, martial law must be lifted when a majority in parliament demands it.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon had given a range of reasons to justify martial law – South Korea's first in more than 40 years.
  <br>
  <br>
  "To safeguard a liberal South Korea from the threats posed by North Korea's communist forces and to eliminate anti-state elements plundering people's freedom and happiness, I hereby declare emergency martial law," Yoon said in a live televised address late on Tuesday night.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon did not give details of the North's threats, but the South remains technically at war with nuclear-armed Pyongyang.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our National Assembly has become a haven for criminals, a den of legislative dictatorship that seeks to paralyse the judicial and administrative systems and overturn our liberal democratic order," Yoon said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon described the imposition of martial law as "inevitable to guarantee the continuity of a liberal South Korea," adding that it would not impact the country's foreign policy.
  <br>
  <br>
  He described the current situation as South Korea "on the verge of collapse, with the National Assembly acting as a monster intent on bringing down liberal democracy." (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The South Korean won dropped to a more than two-year low against the US dollar on Tuesday, while exchange traded funds linked to South Korean stocks fell after President Yoon Suk Yeol declared martial law in an unannounced late-night address live on YTN television.
 <br>
  <br>
  The South Korean unit fell to as low as 1,430.82 won per dollar, the lowest since October 2022. It was last down 1.9 percent at 1,430.60.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's uncertainty driven.. one of those 'shoot first, ask questions later' (moves)," said Christopher Wong, FX and rates strategist at OCBC in Singapore. "Given the lack of information, the uncertainty may still keep Korean won under pressure in the interim."
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon said he had no choice but to resort to such a measure in order to safeguard free and constitutional order, saying opposition parties have taken the parliamentary process hostage to throw the country into a crisis.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stocks listed overseas swooned. The MSCI South Korea ETF fell 4.5 percent, while the Franklin FTSE South Korea ETF slid 3.2 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  With losses of more than 9 percent so far this year, the won is one of Asia's worst performers and has been persistently under pressure as the Bank of Korea cut rates aggressively to support the economy and as investors fled a market they see as exposed heavily to exports and to US trade tariffs on China.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Korean won is already under pressure from the looming threat of tariffs and their detrimental impact on export-driven economies," said Rong Ren Goh, a portfolio manager in the fixed income team at Eastspring Investments in Singapore.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This latest development is likely to exacerbate the currency’s weakness, encouraging speculators to use the won as a high-beta proxy for expressing tariff-related risks." (Reuters)

 South Korea's President Yoon Suk-yeol on Tuesday declared emergency martial law, saying the measure was necessary to protect the country from "communist forces".
 <br>
  <br>
  "To safeguard a liberal South Korea from the threats posed by North Korea's communist forces and to eliminate anti-state elements... I hereby declare emergency martial law," Yoon said in a live televised address to the nation.
  <br>
  <br>
  He declared the step as critical for defending the country's constitutional order. It wasn't immediately clear how the steps would affect the country's governance and democracy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon since taking office in 2022 had struggled to push his agendas against an opposition-controlled parliament.
  <br>
  <br>
  The president's conservative People Power Party had been locked in an impasse with the liberal opposition Democratic Party over next year’s budget bill. He has also been dismissing calls for independent investigations into scandals involving his wife and top officials, drawing quick, strong rebukes from his political rivals.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Democratic Party reportedly called an emergency meeting of its lawmakers following Yoon's announcement. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 King Charles and Keir Starmer welcomed Qatar's emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, for a state visit to Britain on Tuesday that the prime minister hopes will help build on the Gulf state's investment in the country.
 <br>
  <br>
  The emir and wife Sheikha Jawaher bint Hamad bin Suhaim Al Thani arrived by car at Horse Guards Parade in London with Prince William and his wife Kate, who was marking her return to formal state visit duties after undergoing preventative chemotherapy for cancer.
  <br>
  <br>
  Charles, who is continuing his own treatment for cancer, and the emir inspected the 1st Battalion Welsh Guards while a military band played.
  <br>
  <br>
  The morning of pageantry was to be followed by a trip to Westminster where the emir will address both chambers of the Houses of Parliament.
  <br>
  <br>
  Britain is seeking deeper ties with the wealthy Gulf state, and Starmer hopes to use the visit to secure "tangible benefits" for the country on security and the economy, his spokesperson said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Starmer was elected in July on a promise to lift economic growth and is looking to potential wealthy investors such as Qatar to help fund his plans for new infrastructure and energy developments.
  <br>
  <br>
  Qatar is already a big investor in Britain through the Qatar Investment Authority which owns the Canary Wharf business and entertainment district in east London, the Shard landmark skyscraper in central London, and stakes in bluechip names such as Barclays and Heathrow Airport.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You can expect them to discuss how we can build further on our two countries' thriving trade and investment partnership," the prime minister's spokesperson said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two royal families departed by horse-drawn carriage for Buckingham Palace where they were due to have lunch with Queen Camilla, who was absent from the outdoor event as she continues to recover from a chest infection. (Reuters)

    Ideas for Ocean Park to cut costs and raise revenues

<img alt="Lawmakers looked at ways Ocean Park could cut costs and raise revenues during a Legco panel meeting on Tuesday. File photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1781940_1_20241203204442.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lawmakers on Tuesday discussed ways to help Ocean Park improve its finances after it posted a deficit of more than HK$71 million for the financial year ending in June, despite revenue and visitor numbers hitting five-year highs.
 <br>
  <br>
  At a Legco panel meeting on economic development, the theme park disclosed that its water park, or Water World, lost over HK$200 million last financial year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ocean Park chairman Paulo Pong explained Water World had only been running for two years and was still in its growth phase, promising lawmakers the theme park would work hard to reduce losses.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lawmakers voiced concerns Ocean Park might struggle to stay financially sustainable, urging it to use the opportunities created by its six pandas.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tourism sector lawmaker Perry Yiu noted that following the resumption of multiple-entry visas for Shenzhen residents, Ocean Park could consider giving them more discounts to boost visitor numbers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Benson Luk from the Business and Professionals Alliance, suggested Ocean Park lease out its outdoor areas to host major events to increase revenue.
  <br>
  <br>
  Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism Kevin Yeung noted Ocean Park has been thinking of different ways to find more sources of income.

  <br>
  “Ocean Park will make use of the resources available to try to increase revenue, for example concerts can be held in the park. This will also help solve the problem of not having enough venues in Hong Kong,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Roundtable lawmaker Michael Tien suggested the Leisure and Cultural Services Department (LCSD) take over the water park's operations to reduce losses.
  <br>
  <br>
  “[Ocean Park’s] current loss last year is strictly due to one project, which is the water park. The loss of the water park, which is in excess of HK$200 million, is about the same as the government subsidy,” he said
  <br>
  <br>
  “So basically, the government is not subsidising the other activities of Ocean Park, and that is unfair to Ocean Park and is tying up the hands of the entire team. So my suggestion is to spin off the water park, and give it to LCSD,” he said.

    EU pushes for outdoor vaping and smoking ban

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 EU countries agreed on Tuesday on a push for stricter anti-smoking rules, backing bans on smoking and vaping in many outdoor areas including playgrounds and cafe patios.
 <br>
  <br>
  A recommendation inviting member states to crack down on second-hand smoke and vapour was adopted by health ministers from the bloc's 27 nations meeting in Brussels.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Today's agreement is a crucial step towards our goal of a tobacco-free generation in Europe, and is critical in protecting our children and young people from the harmful effects of second-hand smoke," said the EU's health commissioner, Oliver Varhelyi.
  <br>
  <br>
  The recommendation is non-binding, as health is a competence of individual member states.
  <br>
  <br>
  But it gives an indication of the policies governments could pursue in the future as they seek to reduce smoke-related deaths and ailments.
  <br>
  <br>
  It passed with all countries voting in favour apart from Germany and Greece, which abstained, underscoring some political divisions on the issue.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last week, the European Parliament voted against a similar text.
  <br>
  <br>
  The document approved on Tuesday calls on EU countries to extend restrictions in place for cigarettes to cover "emerging products", such as heated tobacco devices and electronic cigarettes that are increasingly popular with young people.
  <br>
  <br>
  Governments should "provide effective protection" from aerosols emitted by these in indoor environments such as offices and public buildings.
  <br>
  <br>
  Following an initial proposal put forward by the European Commission in September, the text says such protection should also be granted in some outdoor areas.
  <br>
  <br>
  This in practice entails that all smoking should be banned in locations including swimming pools, beaches, zoos, rooftop bars and restaurant terraces.
  <br>
  <br>
  The push comes as the EU is aiming to reduce its smoking population from around 25 percent now to less than five percent of the total by 2040, as part of its "Beating Cancer Plan".
  <br>
  <br>
  Tobacco use is estimated to kill more than eight million people globally each year, including about 1.3 million non-smokers who are exposed to second-hand smoke, World Health Organization (WHO) statistics show.
  <br>
  <br>
  Emissions from electronic cigarettes also typically contain nicotine and other toxic substances that are harmful including to second-hand smokers, according to the WHO.
  <br>
  <br>
  But treating smoking and vaping the same way is contentious.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a joint declaration ahead of the vote, Italy and Romania said calls for a ban on outdoor vaping lacked scientific basis and should have not been included in the recommendation. The two countries nevertheless backed the text.
  <br>
  <br>
  Germany abstained saying that the issue fell within the competences of its regions -- not the central government -- and some opposed a ban on smoking in outdoor terraces and patios.
  <br>
  <br>
  Greece similarly voiced scepticism about the effect of such rules, saying more scientific data was needed on the effects of e-cigarettes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The European Parliament last week voted against a resolution on the same subject, after lawmakers on the right passed amendments to differentiate between traditional tobacco products and electronic devices.
  <br>
  <br>
  This drew the ire of the left, which had supported the original text but rejected its watered down version.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We see the outdoor smoking ban as a violation of individual freedom," Pietro Fiocchi, a lawmaker with the hard-right ECR group, said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The parliamentary resolution, which would have had only symbolic value, was turned down with 378 votes against and only 152 in favour. (AFP)

    China imposes export curbs on chipmaking against US

<div class="itemFullText">
 Beijing said on Tuesday it would restrict exports to the United States of some key components in making semiconductors, after Washington announced curbs targeting China's ability to make advanced chips.
 <br>
  <br>
  Among the materials banned from export are metals gallium, antimony and germanium, the Commerce Ministry said in a statement that cited national security concerns.
  <br>
  <br>
  Exports of graphite, another key component, will also be subject to "stricter reviews of end-users and end-uses", the ministry said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "To safeguard national security interests and fulfil international obligations such as non-proliferation, China has decided to strengthen export controls on relevant dual-use items to the United States," Beijing said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Any organisation or individual in any country or region violating the relevant regulations will be held accountable according to the law," it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  In its own latest curbs, Washington on Monday announced restrictions on sales to 140 companies, including Chinese chip firms Piotech and SiCarrier, without additional permission.
  <br>
  <br>
  They also impact Naura Technology Group, which makes chip production equipment, according to the US Commerce Department.
  <br>
  <br>
  The move expands Washington's efforts to curb exports of state-of-the-art chips to China, which can be used in advanced weapons systems and artificial intelligence.
  <br>
  <br>
  The new US rules also include controls on two dozen types of chip-making equipment and three kinds of software tools for developing or producing semiconductors.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing swiftly vowed to defend its interests, saying the United States "abuses export control measures" and has "hindered normal economic and trade exchanges".
  <br>
  <br>
  And on Tuesday, China said Washington had "politicised and weaponised economic, trade and technological issues" as it unveiled its own export curbs.
  <br>
  <br>
  The moves also restrict the exports of "dual-use items to United States military users or for military purposes", Beijing said. (AFP)

<img alt="Hong Kong schoolchildren picked up bad habits during the Covid pandemic, researchers say. Photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1781914_1_20241203171234.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A new study shows that most schoolchildren in Hong Kong are not doing the 60 minutes of moderate to vigorous exercise each day recommended by the World Health Organisation.
 <br>
  <br>
  Professor Patrick Ip from the University of Hong Kong’s department of paediatrics said research he carried out for the InspiringHK Sports Foundation found less than eight percent of more than 1,000 primary and secondary students studied met the exercise standard over the past year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ip blamed this on poor habits developed during the Covid pandemic.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We have observed a very alarming situation that during non-school days and public holidays, children actually did not go out with their friends, their family members to play sports or do any activities under the sunshine,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “This turns out to be a very bad habit. If that habit continues, our next generation will be at a much worse physical activity level, as well as having a poor shape in both physical and mental health.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The foundation said it hopes that by 2030, 16 percent of Hong Kong schoolchildren will reach the 60 minutes per day recommendation, adding that it will launch a scheme next year aimed at promoting physical activity among schoolchildren.

<img alt="Security chief Chris Tang says authorities have received 23 requests for assistance so far this year of Hongkongers allegedly being detained in Southeast Asia to work illegally." src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1781904_1_20241203162256.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Security minister Chris Tang has warned against a resurgence of cases involving Hong Kong residents allegedly being held captive in Southeast Asia to work illegally.
 <br>
  <br>
  A number of Hongkongers fell for employment scams and were detained in various Southeast Asian countries in 2022, prompting the government to set up a task force to coordinate follow-up actions.
  <br>
  <br>
  So far this year, authorities received 23 requests for assistance. Eleven of them returned to the SAR, while the others were discovered safe even though their movements were reportedly restricted.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Since the second quarter of 2024, there have been signs of a resurgence of cases of Hong Kong residents being suspected to have been lured to Southeast Asian countries and detained to engage in illegal work," Tang told a Legislative Council panel on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister said immigration officials have been following up on the cases through foreign ministry representatives in Hong Kong as well as diplomatic and consular missions elsewhere.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked if the government had learned about what happened from those who had returned to Hong Kong, Tang said none of the Hongkongers suspected to be detained against their will were taken away while on holiday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For each case, once the citizen has returned to Hong Kong, we would interview them, ask them why they were lured overseas and how they were released," Tang told lawmakers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But let me say this, most of the individuals went voluntarily and then they were detained there illegally. There was never a case that an individual was abducted."
  <br>
  <br>
  The security chief said authorities would continue to monitor online communications and strengthen cooperation with their international counterparts, while stepping up calls for people to be more alert to job scams.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The death toll from flooding in southern Thailand has risen to 25, officials said on Tuesday, with days more heavy rain forecast.
 <br>
  <br>
  Twelve provinces in southern Thailand have been hit by flooding since late November, affecting more than 410,000 people, the country's disaster agency said on its Facebook page.
  <br>
  <br>
  The agency's announcement raises a previous death toll of nine reported on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 22,000 people have been displaced from their homes due to flooding in Pattani, Narathiwat, Songkhla and Yala provinces, the Thai government's public relations department said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Suwas Bin-Uma, a chicken farm owner in Songkhla, told state broadcaster Thai PBS that the floods had wiped out his entire flock of more than 10,000 chickens.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I've lost at least three million baht (US$87,000)," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Thai weather agency on Tuesday warned of continued heavy rain until December 5.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government has deployed rescue teams to assist affected residents and designated 50 million baht in flood relief for each province.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Tuesday the Thai cabinet approved a 9,000 baht payment per family to support those affected.
  <br>
  <br>
  In neighbouring Malaysia, south of the Thai border, disaster officials said on Tuesday that more than 94,000 people were yet to return to their homes after being evacuated to shelters due to the floods, with at least five people reported dead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Maalaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim said five days of heavier-than-expected rain that battered the country's east coast last week was equal to the rainfall over the past six months, wreaking havoc in the northeastern state of Kelantan and neighbouring Terengganu.
  <br>
  <br>
  The heavy downpours damaged roads and houses in Kelantan and other parts of Malaysia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rescue workers used boats to distribute food to victims trapped in their homes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Anwar said it would cost the government an estimated 1 billion ringgit (US$224 million) to repair infrastructure damaged by the floods.
  <br>
  <br>
  The rain eased over the weekend, but the Meteorological Department forecast heavy rains later on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Anwar said the government is bracing for another monsoon surge that is expected to hit on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Scientists say climate change is causing more intense weather patterns that can make destructive floods more likely. (Agencies)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China lifted trade restrictions on two Australian meat processing facilities, allowing the full resumption of red meat exports to the country, the Australian government said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Beijing has now removed restrictions from all 10 Australian abattoirs it banned between 2020 and 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bans were imposed around the time that China blocked imports of commodities including coal, barley and wine from Australia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Almost all those restrictions have been removed since a new government won power in Canberra in 2022, with trade in lobster, the final banned product, set to restart by the end of the year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is great news for Australian exporters, producers and farmers," Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Since we were elected we've worked tirelessly to resume trade and that's exactly what we are seeing. It's a win for trade and a win for Australian jobs."
  <br>
  <br>
  China is the second largest market for Australian beef and veal after the United States, receiving around 200,000 metric tonnes a year worth around US$1.5 billion in recent years, Australian trade data showed. (Reuters)
