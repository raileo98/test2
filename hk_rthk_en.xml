<div class="itemFullText">
 Chinese property giant Country Garden, which previously defaulted on its debt repayment obligations, expects to reach agreeable terms with creditors next month, the firm's lawyer told a Hong Kong court on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The court hearing, which was held to measure progress in reaching an agreement with creditors, was then adjourned until May 26 by High Court judge Linda Chan after a request from Country Garden's lawyers to extend the date from May 19.
  <br>
  <br>
  Country Garden said earlier this month it has proposed to creditors a debt restructuring that would cut its offshore debt worth US$16.4 billion by 70 percent, and it had reached an "understanding" with a lender group.
  <br>
  <br>
  Once China's biggest property developer, Country Garden defaulted on US$11 billion in offshore bonds in late 2023, deepening a debt crisis in the sector that had already experienced defaults by many developers, including China Evergrande Group.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ever Credit Limited, a unit of Hong Kong-listed Kingboard Holdings, filed a petition against Country Garden in February last year for non-payment of a US$205 million loan. (Reuters)

    SKorea central bank cuts forecasts due to Yoon crisis

<img alt="South Korea's central bank cuts its 2025 growth forecast due to the country's ongoing political crisis. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1788281_1_20250120120734.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korea's central bank on Monday said it had slashed its 2025 growth forecast because of the political crisis triggered by President Yoon Suk-yeol's declaration of martial law last month.
 <br>
  <br>
  Yoon briefly suspended civilian rule on December 3, sending soldiers to parliament but lawmakers voted the measure down and later impeached the president, who is now being held for a criminal probe on insurrection charges.
  <br>
  <br>
  He initially resisted arrest and has refused to cooperate with investigators and, when his detention was extended, his die-hard supporters attacked a court building on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The unexpected declaration of martial law in early December, coupled with the ongoing political turmoil and the Jeju Air passenger plane disaster, significantly dampened economic sentiment," the Bank of Korea said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  A Jeju Air Boeing 737-800 crashed on December 29 in southwestern Muan airport, killing 179 people in the worst ever aviation disaster on South Korean soil.
  <br>
  <br>
  The political turmoil and crash "led to contractions in domestic consumption and construction investment, likely causing the fourth-quarter growth rate to fall well below the November projection", the bank said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Consumption, which had shown improvement in the third quarter, appeared to weaken again in the fourth quarter," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  As a result, the bank's Monetary Policy Committee revised down its estimate for the last quarter of 2024, from 2.2 percent to a range of 2.0-2.1 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  It had projected 1.9 percent growth for 2025, but "the forecast has been revised downward to 1.6-1.7 percent", it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This adjustment is primarily attributed to the impact of political uncertainty triggered by the declaration of martial law last December, which has dampened economic sentiment," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is estimated to reduce this year's growth rate by approximately 0.2 percentage points, particularly affecting domestic consumption and other areas of domestic demand," it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon is the first sitting South Korean president ever to be arrested.
  <br>
  <br>
  With Yoon behind bars, prosecutors are due to formalise a criminal indictment for insurrection.
  <br>
  <br>
  He could be jailed for life or executed if found guilty.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon refused to attend questioning on Monday, his lawyers said, with the Corruption Investigation Office -- the body in charge of the probe -- saying it was looking at whether to compel him to attend.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon has also been absent from the parallel probe at the Constitutional Court, which is considering whether to uphold his impeachment.
  <br>
  <br>
  If that court rules against him, Yoon will formally lose the presidency and elections will be called within 60 days. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Vice President Han Zheng on Sunday told American Vice President-elect JD Vance that there is a lot of room for China-US cooperation, in a meeting ahead of Donald Trump’s presidential inauguration.
 <br>
  <br>
  Han told Vance that Beijing is willing to work with Washington to "implement the important consensus reached between President Xi Jinping and US president-elect Donald Trump", Xinhua news agency reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  Han, who is in the US for the inauguration ceremony, also told Vance that the nation is ready to promote the stable, healthy and sustainable development of China-US relations.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to state media, Han also said both sides could make contributions to world peace and development, as long as they adhere to the principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence, and win-win cooperation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Economic and trade relations are important issues of common concern to both sides. While there are differences and friction between China and the US, there are many common interests, and the space for cooperation between the two nations is huge. The two sides should strengthen dialogue and negotiations on this front," Han was quoted by Xinhua as saying.
  <br>
  <br>
  The meeting came a day before Trump and Vance will be sworn in.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xinhua also reported that Han met Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who became a key Trump ally during his campaign, and other representatives of the business community in the US.
  <br>
  <br>
  In his meeting with Musk, Han said Beijing welcomes US companies, including Tesla, "to seize the opportunity and share the fruits of China's development" while making greater contributions in promoting China-US economic and trade relations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Musk, according to Xinhua, told Han that his company is ready to increase its investments in and cooperation with China and play a role in promoting bilateral economic and trade exchanges.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Josh Allen scored two touchdowns as the Buffalo Bills punished a slew of mistakes to defeat the Baltimore Ravens 27-25 and set up a blockbuster NFL playoff clash with the Kansas City Chiefs.
 <br>
  <br>
  Bills quarterback Allen barged over for two first-half rushing touchdowns at a snowy Highmark Stadium in New York as Ravens opposite number Lamar Jackson and the Bills were left ruing a string of costly errors.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Ravens had a golden chance to tie the game with less than two minutes remaining, but tight end Mark Andrews fluffed a simple catch attempting a two-point conversion to effectively seal the Bills win.
  <br>
  <br>
  "How about that Buffalo Bills defence?" Allen said afterwards. "All year we heard this team has no talent, we're too small, we can't stop the run? We're not good enough to compete?"
  <br>
  <br>
  "We just put our head down and worked hard," he added. "I'm so proud of our defence."
  <br>
  <br>
  The AFC divisional round battle had been hyped as a duel between two of the most dynamic quarterbacks in the NFL, pitting this season's Most Valuable Player front-runner Allen against the Ravens' reigning MVP Jackson.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the quarterback shoot-out largely failed to materialise in a gritty contest that ultimately pivoted on the Ravens' mistakes at key times. A Jackson fumble following a sack by Damar Hamlin led to Allen's opening touchdown in the second quarter that put the Bills 14-7 ahead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Allen then scored his second rushing touchdown in the closing moments of the first half to help put the Bills 21-10 up at the break.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Ravens threatened a comeback with a field goal and a Derrick Henry touchdown in the third quarter that cut the Bills lead to three points. But another Ravens turnover in the fourth quarter, Andrews fumbling under pressure led to a Bills field goal that stretched the hosts lead to 27-19.
  <br>
  <br>
  Baltimore hit back with a superb Isaiah Likely touchdown from Jackson's 24-yard bullet pass, but with overtime looming, Andrews botched the two-point conversion attempt.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Bills will now meet Patrick Mahomes and Kansas City in next week's AFC Championship game, with the winner advancing to the February 9 Super Bowl in New Orleans.
  <br>
  <br>
  It will be the latest instalment of a fierce rivalry between the two teams, who have met three times in the playoffs since 2021 – the Chiefs winning them all. The Bills, however, were one of only two teams to beat the Chiefs in the regular season this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're going to enjoy this tonight and then turn our attention to the Chiefs tomorrow," said Allen. "They're the perennial of what you want to be in the NFL – you've got to beat them to get past them."
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, running back sensation Saquon Barkley rushed for two long-range solo touchdowns as the Philadelphia Eagles beat the Los Angeles Rams 28-22 to reach the NFC Championship game.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Eagles will host NFC East divisional rivals the Washington Commanders next week for a place in the Super Bowl.
  <br>
  <br>
  Philadelphia's power in the running game proved decisive in a game played in heavy snow with Barkley, a candidate for the league's Most Valuable Player, putting up 205 yards on 26 carries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Even before the snow began to fall late in the first quarter, the Eagles exposed the Rams' run defence, opening the scoring on the opening drive of the game when quarterback Jalen Hurts broke out and sprinted 44 yards for the touchdown.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Rams fought back quickly though with quarterback Matthew Stafford leading a 13-play, 67-yard drive which ended with a four-yard touchdown pass to tight-end Tyler Higbee.
  <br>
  <br>
  Los Angeles will have spent all week preparing for the threat of Barkley, but they were still unable to stop him when he found a gap and sprinted 62 yards to put the Eagles up 13-7 at the end of the first quarter.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Eagles extended their lead with two field goals in the fourth before Barkley turned on the turbo chargers again with just over four minutes left, with the snow showing no obstacle to his power and speed as he burst 78 yards for his second touchdown.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Rams threatened a remarkable comeback with a quick Colby Parkinson touchdown, but a last gasp drive for a go-ahead touchdown faltered. (AFP)

    'Set up scam-reporting hotline at universities'

<img alt="Chow Man-kong suggests student affairs offices at universities set up a scam-reporting hotline to better protect students. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1788275_1_20250120111514.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A lawmaker has proposed that the student affairs offices of universities set up scam-reporting hotlines to better protect students from falling prey to swindles.
 <br>
  <br>
  The University of Hong Kong and City University has asked students to complete anti-scam quizzes as soon as possible, after dozens reported being conned online.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on an RTHK radio programme, Chow Man-kong said these anti-scam offices should reach out to the police once students report they have been swindled.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said that anti-scam education was crucial in raising their awareness.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Mainland students, in particular, they are not familiar with everything in Hong Kong, or they might not have anyone to rely on," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Under such situations, when there's an incoming phone call pointing out their identities and personal information, they will fall prey very easily."
  <br>
  <br>
  Campus TV - HKU's student news outlet - has reported that students who fail to complete the quizzes by February's deadline will be barred from certain facilities, including the library.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chow, who is also the chairman of Legco's panel on education, welcomed HKU's decision to roll out the quiz, adding the university's intention was good.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another lawmaker, Johnny Ng, told the same programme the quizzes were relatively easy, noting that questions for similar tests on the mainland were harder.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he said that anti-scam quizzes are necessary, as fraudsters are rampant.

    Trump vows to end 'American decline' at rally

<img alt="US President-elect Donald Trump speaks during a rally the day before his inauguration as Tesla CEO and X owner Elon Musk gestures. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1788274_1_20250120110649.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Donald Trump pledged a blitz of presidential actions to end "American decline," telling a fired-up inauguration eve rally on Sunday he would crack down on woke ideology and immigration.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a raucous campaign-style gathering in Washington, the 78-year-old Republican promised cheering supporters that he would act with "historic speed" from day one of his White House comeback.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Tomorrow at noon, the curtain closes on four long years of American decline, and we begin a brand new day of American strength and prosperity," Trump told a packed sports arena.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I will act with historic speed and strength and fix every single crisis facing our country."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump was joined on stage by Elon Musk -- the tech tycoon who will lead a major cost-cutting drive in his administration -- and who vowed to make America strong "for centuries."
  <br>
  <br>
  Then at the end the rally Trump danced alongside the disco band Village People as they performed their 1970s hit "YMCA" which became the unofficial anthem of his election campaign.
  <br>
  <br>
  Much of Trump's hour-long speech focused on immigration, driving home one of the dark messages that helped spur his remarkable victory in November's presidential election over Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're going to stop the invasion of our borders," added Trump, who has pledged to launch raids targeting undocumented migrants within days of taking office.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he also promised "lots" of executive orders from his first day back in the Oval Office, including one to ban "transgender insanity" and critical race theory from schools and to keep trans athletes out of women's sports.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump also reiterated a promise to release files on the assassinations of former president John F Kennedy, his brother Bobby Kennedy and civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr.
  <br>
  <br>
  Long lines of Trump supporters formed outside the arena despite snowy conditions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier, the future US commander-in-chief paid a highly symbolic visit to Arlington National Cemetery, the resting place of America's war dead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump laid a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, followed by Vice President-elect JD Vance.
  <br>
  <br>
  The sombre ceremony contrasted with Trump's last trip to the cemetery as a presidential candidate in August, when the US army criticised his staff for pushing a cemetery employee.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Trump's hopes for a huge crowd to see his inauguration at the US Capitol on Monday took a blow, however, when forecasts of below freezing weather prompted organisers to move the ceremony indoors.
  <br>
  <br>
  Instead of being sworn in on the steps of the Capitol, Trump will now take the oath under the massive dome of its Rotunda, last used for the ceremony 40 years ago during the inauguration of Ronald Reagan. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Kylian Mbappé struck twice and produced a brilliant performance to power Real Madrid to a 4-1 win over Las Palmas and take the reigning champions top of La Liga.
 <br>
  <br>
  Los Blancos enjoyed a perfect weekend, overtaking Atlético Madrid by two points after their neighbours slipped up with a shock defeat at Leganes on Saturday, while Barcelona, third, could only draw at Getafe.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mbappé has hit top form in recent weeks after an inconsistent start to life at Real Madrid following his dream switch from Paris Saint-Germain last summer.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 26-year-old reached 12 league goals with his brace, becoming the Spanish league's second top-scorer behind Barcelona's Robert Lewandowski, with Brahim Díaz and Rodrygo Goes also on target.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was a very important game because we knew what had happened yesterday, with Atletico and Barca, we wanted to win and we did," Mbappé said. "We started badly, letting in a goal so early – but the reaction was top."
  <br>
  <br>
  "We got the ball forward, quickly, attacking the spaces and with quality, we scored a lot of goals," he added. "We're happy because we're leaders."
  <br>
  <br>
  Mbappé has 18 goals for the season in 30 appearances across all competitions, and is looking increasingly crucial for his side in attack.
  <br>
  <br>
  With Vinicius Junior suspended, the spotlight was on the French forward at the Santiago Bernabeu and he delivered with a sparkling performance.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I am very happy, I have adapted to the team and I can play how I want, with my team-mates, with personality," continued Mbappé. "I think that we are all enjoying it."
  <br>
  <br>
  Madrid were thrashed by Barcelona last week in the Spanish Super Cup final, leading to some whistles for the team when they played at home in midweek in the Copa del Rey.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mbappé posted on social media network Instagram to encourage the fans to stick together and support the team.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think we have to be united, and like that, we can go for all the trophies," he explained.
  <br>
  <br>
  Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti was questioned over his positioning of Mbappé earlier in the season, using the striker through the middle instead of on the left, where Vinicius plays and Mbappé often did at PSG.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He's the best central striker in the world," said Ancelotti. "He's a great forward, he's very comfortable in the middle, more than on the wing, his ability to get away from players is unique and inside he can take better advantage of that." (AFP)

<img alt="US President-elect Donald Trump arrives to speak at a MAGA victory rally at Capital One Arena in Washington, DC. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1788251_1_20250120072644.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President-elect Donald Trump vowed a blitz of emergency actions on Sunday at a huge victory rally on the eve of his inauguration, starting with a crackdown on an "invasion" of immigrants at the border with Mexico.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Starting tomorrow, I will act with historic speed and strength and fix every single crisis facing our country," Trump told a cheering crowd at a Washington arena the day before he is sworn in for a second term.
  <br>
  <br>
  Republican Trump was joined on stage by Elon Musk, the tech tycoon who is set to lead a major cost-cutting drive in his administration, and who vowed to do "great things" and make America strong "for centuries."
  <br>
  <br>
  The 78-year-old Trump focused on immigration in his campaign-style speech, driving home the messages that helped spur his victory in November's presidential election.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're going to stop the invasion of our borders," added Trump, whose administration has indicated that it plans to launch raids targeting undocumented migrants within days of taking office.
  <br>
  <br>
  The billionaire also lashed out at the "failed administration" of outgoing Democratic President Joe Biden.
  <br>
  <br>
  Long lines of Trump supporters formed outside the arena despite snowy conditions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said he will immediately sign a record number of executive orders, undoing many of Biden's policies including on drilling for oil in offshore sites and on federal land.
  <br>
  <br>
  The "Trump effect" has already been on display, with TikTok crediting his "clarity" for being able to restore service in the United States after briefly going dark due to a ban on national security grounds.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have to save TikTok," Trump told the rally. (AFP)

<img alt="Manchester United's 3-1 defeat to Brighton was their 10th loss of the season. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1788244_1_20250120054447.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Manchester United slumped to a 3-1 defeat at home to Brighton as Old Trafford remembered the legendary Denis Law, while Tottenham's troubles also persist after they lost 3-2 at Everton.
 <br>
  <br>
  Nottingham Forest maintained an unlikely title challenge with a 3-2 victory over Southampton to take Nuno Espirito Santo's men level with second-placed Arsenal and within six points of Liverpool.
  <br>
  <br>
  United, by contrast, are 24 points adrift of the leaders and focused on mere survival after Brighton stormed Old Trafford for the third consecutive season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ruben Amorim's men looked to have turned a corner after a thrilling 2-2 draw at Liverpool was followed by knocking Arsenal out of the FA Cup earlier this month.
  <br>
  <br>
  But after Amad Diallo's late hat-trick papered over the cracks in a 3-1 win over bottom-of-the-table Southampton in midweek, Brighton exposed the glaring holes in the foundations of Amorim's United project.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kaoru Mitoma squared for Yankuba Minteh to open the scoring inside five minutes. Bruno Fernandes' penalty levelled for United before the break.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mitoma restored Brighton's lead on the hour mark before Andre Onana dropped a cross into the path of Georginio Rutter to rifle in a third.
  <br>
  <br>
  Victory lifts Brighton up to ninth and within four points of the top four. United remain 13th but enjoy a 10-point cushion over the bottom three.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We can't be comfortable in thinking that this is okay, because it is not," said Fernandes. "I'm not here to lose games and be in the position we are in at the moment."
  <br>
  <br>
  Before kick-off, tributes were paid to one of the club's greats in Law, who passed away on Friday aged 84.
  <br>
  <br>
  The only Scot ever to win the Ballon d'Or, Law is the third top scorer in United's history, with 237 goals in 404 appearances.
  <br>
  <br>
  A piper played Scottish national anthem "Flower of Scotland" as the teams walked out, with United legends Alex Ferguson, Brian Kidd, Paddy Crerand and Alex Stepney on the pitch as a eulogy was read out over the tannoy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Tottenham are now winless in six league games after Everton boosted their survival chances with the first victory of David Moyes' second spell in charge.
  <br>
  <br>
  The goal-shy Toffees had failed to score in nine of their previous 11 league games but struck three times before the break.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dominic Calvert Lewin's first goal since September opened the scoring before a brilliant individual run and finish from Iliman Ndiaye. Archie Gray's own goal compounded Tottenham's misery.
  <br>
  <br>
  Late goals from Dejan Kulusevski and Richarlison reduced Spurs' deficit, but could not avoid a 12th defeat in 22 games.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is a challenging situation for sure, when you are losing players the amount we are at the moment," said under-fire Tottenham boss Ange Postecoglou, who was without 10 first-team regulars. "It's up to me to get us out of it and I've got to be good enough to do that."
  <br>
  <br>
  Everton pull four points clear of the bottom three and within four points of 15th-placed Tottenham.
  <br>
  <br>
  Forest were also rampant in the first 45 minutes to cut the gap at the top and consolidate their lead in the race for a place in the Champions League next season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elliot Anderson, Callum Hudson-Odoi and Chris Wood netted before the break.
  <br>
  <br>
  Southampton salvaged some pride in the second period through Jan Bednarek and Paul Onuachu but they remain on course for an immediate return to the Championship, 10 points adrift of safety.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere, Pep Guardiola claimed Manchester City are back to their best after Phil Foden starred in a 6-0 rout of struggling Ipswich.
  <br>
  <br>
  Foden netted either side of Mateo Kovacic's eye-catching goal as City blew Ipswich away with three first-half goals at Portman Road. Jeremy Doku, Erling Haaland and James McAtee scored after the interval to give fourth-placed City their biggest league win this season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Guardiola's side have won three of their last four league games as they begin the long climb back to respectability after a dismal start to the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are really pleased, we are back in many things that have defined this team in the last decade, the last years," Guardiola said. "Really pleased for the players, they deserved it a lot. We recovered some identities that we lost in this path."
  <br>
  <br>
  Sterner tests lie in wait for City, including a vital Champions League trip to Paris Saint-Germain on Wednesday and looming Premier League clashes with Chelsea and Arsenal. But this was the kind of confident display City used to make look routine during their march to four successive English titles.
  <br>
  <br>
  Winning is almost certain to prove beyond them as they trail leaders Liverpool by 12 points.
  <br>
  <br>
  Guardiola will settle for restoring City's pride this term as he rebuilds a team that suddenly grew old and inconsistent before his eyes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The most important thing is that the players, they saw themselves recognise what we are, so that is the best thing I can say," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Haaland, who has scored 112 goals in just 127 appearances for City, this week committed himself to the club until 2034 when he signed a new nine-and-a-half year deal. (AFP)

    Freed Israeli hostages reunited with mothers

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Palestinians burst into streets to celebrate and began returning to the rubble of bombed-out homes on Sunday after a ceasefire deal halted fighting in Gaza, while three female hostages freed by Hamas were reunited with their mothers inside Israel.
 <br>
  <br>
  Hamas fighters drove through the southern city of Khan Younis with crowds cheering and chanting. In the north of the territory, bombed into oblivion in the war's most intense fighting, people picked their way on narrow roads through a devastated landscape of rubble and twisted metal.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I feel like at last I found some water to drink after being lost in the desert for 15 months," said Aya, a displaced woman from Gaza City who has been sheltering in Deir Al-Balah in the central Gaza Strip for over a year.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Tel Aviv, hundreds of Israelis in a square outside the defence headquarters watched a live broadcast from Gaza showing the hostage release on a giant screen.
  <br>
  <br>
  The crowd cheered, embraced and wept as three female hostages could be seen getting into a Red Cross vehicle surrounded by armed Hamas fighters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Soon after, the Israeli military said Romi Gonen, Doron Steinbrecher and Emily Damari had been reunited with their mothers at a meeting point inside Israel, close to the kibbutz and nearby music festival where they had been abducted in the October 7, 2023 Hamas raid.
  <br>
  <br>
  The three appeared in good health in a video later released by the military. Damari, who lost two fingers when she was shot the day she was abducted, could be seen smiling and embracing her mother as she held up a bandaged hand.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I would like you to tell them: Romi, Doron and Emily – an entire nation embraces you. Welcome home," Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told a commander by phone as the hostages were driven across the border.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the Israeli-occupied West Bank, buses awaited the release of Palestinian prisoners from Israeli detention. Hamas said the first group to be freed in exchange for the hostages includes 69 women and 21 teenage boys.
  <br>
  <br>
  The first phase of the truce in the 15-month-old war between Israel and Hamas took effect following a three-hour delay during which Israeli warplanes and artillery pounded the Gaza Strip.
  <br>
  <br>
  That last-minute Israeli blitz killed 13 people, according to Palestinian health authorities. Israel blamed Hamas for being late to deliver the names of hostages it would free, and said it had struck terrorists. Hamas said the holdup in providing the list was technical.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Today the guns in Gaza have gone silent," US President Joe Biden said on his last full day in office, welcoming a truce that had eluded US diplomacy for more than a year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was a long road," Biden said. "But we've reached this point today because of the pressure Israel built on Hamas, backed by the United States."
  <br>
  <br>
  The truce calls for fighting to stop, aid to be sent in to Gaza and 33 of nearly 100 Israeli and foreign hostages to go free over the six-week first phase in return for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails. (Reuters)

    TikTok restores service in US, thanking Trump

<img alt='TikTok said on Sunday that it is "in the process of restoring service" in the United States. Image: Reuters' src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1788237_1_20250120034419.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 TikTok said on Sunday it was restoring its service after US President-elect Donald Trump said he would revive the app's access in the United States when he returns to power on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  "As a result of president Trump's efforts, TikTok is back in the US," the platform said in a message to users.
  <br>
  <br>
  TikTok also issued an earlier statement after US users reported being able to access the Chinese-owned service's website, while the far more widely used TikTok app itself began coming back online for some users with just a few basic services.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In agreement with our service providers, TikTok is in the process of restoring service," TikTok said in the earlier statement that also thanked Trump for "providing the necessary clarity and assurance to our service providers that they will face no penalties (for) providing TikTok to over 170 million Americans and allowing over 7 million small businesses to thrive."
  <br>
  <br>
  TikTok stopped working for US users late on Saturday before a law shutting it down on national security grounds took effect on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said he would "extend the period of time before the law's prohibitions take effect, so that we can make a deal to protect our national security."
  <br>
  <br>
  "I would like the United States to have a 50 percent ownership position in a joint venture," he wrote on Truth Social.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said the executive order would specify there would be no liability for any company that helped keep TikTok from going dark before his order.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump had earlier said he would most likely give TikTok a 90-day reprieve from the ban after he takes office, a promise TikTok cited in a notice posted to users on the app. (Reuters)

 The University of Hong Kong and City University on Sunday asked students to complete anti-scam quizzes as soon as possible. The call came after dozens of students were reportedly scammed.
 <br>
  <br>
  HKU's student news outlet Campus TV has reported that more than 60 students have been scammed in recent months, resulting in a monetary loss of HK$60 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  The University of Hong Kong says it has sent a kit offered by the police to students to raise awareness of scams.
  <br>
  <br>
  The kit includes the latest information on how to identify scams and multiple-choice questions.
  <br>
  <br>
  At City University, the institution said it had received 30 scam reports from students, involving a total of HK$15 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  The university says it has requested all students to finish the anti-scam survey this semester.

    Palestinians return to their homes as ceasefire begins

<div class="itemFullText">
 Thousands of Palestinians burst into the streets across Gaza as a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas began on Sunday, some in celebration, others to visit the graves of relatives, while many rushed back to see what remained of their homes.
 <br>
  <br>
  "I feel like at last I found some water to drink after getting lost in the desert for 15 months. I feel alive again," Aya, a displaced woman from Gaza City, who has been sheltering in Deir Al-Balah in the central Gaza Strip for over a year, told Reuters via a chat app.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the north of the territory, where some of the most intense Israeli airstrikes and battles with the militants took place, hundreds of people picked their way through a devastated landscape of rubble and twisted metal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Armed Hamas fighters drove through the southern city of Khan Younis, with crowds cheering and chanting, despite an almost three-hour delay in the implementation of the ceasefire agreement, which follows 15 months of devastating conflict.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamas policemen, dressed in blue police uniform, deployed in some areas after months of trying to keep out of sight to avoid Israeli airstrikes.
  <br>
  <br>
  People who had gathered to cheer the fighters chanted "Greetings to Al-Qassam Brigades" - the armed wing of Hamas.
  <br>
  <br>
  "All the resistance factions are staying in spite of (Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin) Netanyahu," one fighter told Reuters, referring to the armed wing.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is a ceasefire, a full and comprehensive one God willing, and there will be no return to war in spite of him."
  <br>
  <br>
  The ceasefire deal took effect after a nearly three-hour delay, pausing a war that has brought seismic political change to the Middle East and giving hope to Gaza's 2.3 million people, many of whom have been displaced several times.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Palestinian Civil Emergency Service said Israeli military strikes killed at least 13 people in attacks across the enclave during the delay. No more attacks were reported after it took effect at 11.15 am.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are now waiting for the day when we head back to our home in Gaza City," Aya said. "Damaged or not, it doesn't matter, the nightmare of death and starvation is over."
  <br>
  <br>
  The streets in the shattered Gaza City in the north of the territory were already busy with groups of people waving the Palestinian flag and filming the scenes on their mobile phones. Several carts loaded with household possessions travelled down a thoroughfare scattered with rubble and debris.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gaza City resident Ahmed Abu Ayham, 40, sheltering with his family in Khan Younis, said the scene of destruction in his home city was "dreadful", adding that while the ceasefire may have spared lives it was no time for celebrations.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are in pain, deep pain and it is time that we hug one another and cry," Abu Ayham said via the same app.
  <br>
  <br>
  The highly anticipated ceasefire deal could help usher in an end to the Gaza war, which began after Hamas, which controls the tiny coastal territory, attacked Israel on October 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, according to Israeli authorities.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel's response has reduced much of Gaza to rubble and killed nearly 47,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza-based health officials.
  <br>
  <br>
  Long lines of trucks carrying fuel and aid supplies queued up at border crossings in the hours before the ceasefire was due to take effect. The World Food Programme said they began to cross on Sunday morning.
  <br>
  <br>
  The deal requires 600 truckloads of aid to be allowed into Gaza every day of the initial six-week ceasefire, including 50 carrying fuel. Half of the 600 aid trucks would be delivered to Gaza's north, where experts have warned famine is imminent.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The war ended, but life isn't going to be better because of the destruction and the losses we suffered," Aya said. "But at least there will be no more bloodshed of women and children, I hope." (Reuters)

    Israel says truce with Hamas begins, after delay

<div class="itemFullText">
 Israel on Sunday said a truce with Hamas began in Gaza at 5.15pm Hong Kong time, nearly three hours after initially scheduled, following a last-minute delay on the orders of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
 <br>
  <br>
  Netanyahu had said the ceasefire could not take effect until Hamas gave the names of the hostages up for release on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gaza's civil defence agency said at least eight Palestinians died from Israeli attacks that occurred between the period when the ceasefire was meant to begin until it actually took effect.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamas, which ultimately published the names of three Israeli women to be released, attributed the delay in producing the names to "technical reasons", as well as the "complexities of the field situation and the continued bombing".
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel then confirmed it had received the list, adding that four other living female hostages would be freed in seven days.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, thousands of displaced Gazans carrying tents, clothes and personal belongings began heading to their homes after the ceasefire took effect following more than 15 months of war.
  <br>
  <br>
  Palestinians were seen travelling by truck, donkey cart and on foot back to their homes through devastated swathes of Gaza, particularly in the northern parts of the Palestinian territory. (Reuters/AFP)

    Only 10pc of subdivided flats meet new standards: Soco

<img alt="Soco has called on the government to solve the resettlement issue and impose rent controls. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1788206_1_20250119161812.jpg&q=60">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A community group on Sunday said a survey they conducted found just one-tenth of subdivided flat residents feel their homes meet the standards of the government’s proposed basic housing units.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Society for Community Organisation (Soco) said resettlement arrangements should be provided as soon as possible before tenants in substandard subdivided flats are kicked out by landlords.
  <br>
  <br>
  From December last year, the survey polled 211 tenants who are currently living in subdivided flats, bedspace apartments or cubicle apartments.  It comes as the government conducts its public consultation of the new regulatory framework for basic housing units, which runs until February 10.
  <br>
  <br>
  In October, Chief Executive John Lee outlined plans to replace substandard subdivided units with basic housing units. Landlords will face criminal liability if they rent out units that fail to meet the basic housing unit standards, which state that a unit must not be smaller than eight-square metres, and have at least one window with an individual toilet.
  <br>
  <br>
  Soco said only 10 percent of respondents say their homes fulfill these requirements, while almost 60 percent believe landlords will have to revamp their units. Another 30 percent of respondents said they have no idea whether their homes will need renovation.
  <br>
  <br>
  The community group also called on authorities to solve the resettlement issue as nearly 40 percent of the respondents said the government should provide rehousing arrangements if they are kicked out of their homes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Additionally, Soco said the government should impose rent control measures as nearly 32  percent of respondents are worried about not being able to pay the rent for basic housing units. They suggested that the median rent should be set at about HK$2,000.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Security minister Chris Tang on Sunday said the government did not raise Thailand's travel alert to red because the government needed to reflect the situation accurately.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a TVB programme, Tang explained that victims were not kidnapped in Thailand, but rather lured there before being transported elsewhere.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last Friday, the government raised its travel alert for southeastern Myanmar to red, but the alert level for other parts of Myanmar, Thailand and Cambodia remains at amber – the lowest level of the three-tier outward travel alert system.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The victims were basically lured to Thailand before being transported to scam farms in Myanmar. There hasn't been a single case of someone being kidnapped within Thailand," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Certain areas in Myanmar are being used as scam farms, guarded by military police and armed personnel. That's where the danger lies," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister was also asked about the government's role in rescue efforts and reports of victims being released after a ransom was paid.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Some people were able to return without paying ransom. Of course, when faced with these situations, our priority is to bring people back safely," he responded.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tang stressed that officials will pursue all means to secure the safe return of stranded Hongkongers.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A long-awaited ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war was delayed on Sunday after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said at the last minute that it would not take effect until the Palestinian militant group provided a list of the hostages to be released.
 <br>
  <br>
  Hamas, while "affirming its commitment" to the terms of the ceasefire, said: "The delay in providing the names of those to be released in the first batch is due to technical reasons."
  <br>
  <br>
  A statement from Netanyahu's office, issued less than an hour before the truce was to start, said he had "instructed the IDF (military) that the ceasefire... will not begin until Israel has received the list".
  <br>
  <br>
  The initial exchange was to see three Israeli hostages released from captivity in return for a first group of Palestinian prisoners.
  <br>
  <br>
  If the ceasefire goes ahead, a total of 33 hostages taken by militants during Hamas's October 7, 2023 attack on Israel will be returned from Gaza during an initial 42-day truce.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under the deal, hundreds of Palestinian prisoners will be released from Israeli jails.
  <br>
  <br>
  The truce is intended to pave the way for an end to more than 15 months of war sparked by the October 7 attack, the deadliest in Israeli history.
  <br>
  <br>
  It follows a deal struck by mediators Qatar, the United States and Egypt after months of negotiations, and takes effect on the eve of Donald Trump's inauguration as US president.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a televised address on Saturday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel had US support to return to war if necessary.
  <br>
  <br>
  Calling the 42-day first phase a "temporary ceasefire", he said: "If we are forced to resume the war, we will do so with force."
  <br>
  <br>
  Fighting continued right up to the eve of the truce, with Gaza's civil defence agency saying that at least five members of one family were killed when an Israeli strike hit their tent in the southern city of Khan Yunis. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Sunday said he will promote Hong Kong's advantages as a super connector and super value-adder on his upcoming trip to Davos, Switzerland, where he will attend the World Economic Forum.
 <br>
  <br>
  Writing on his weekly blog on Sunday, Chan said business leaders are keen to learn more about developments in Hong Kong, and added that he will introduce policies that the SAR has adopted.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that Vice Premier Ding Xuexiang will also attend the conference to deliver a speech, and noted that "the economic conditions and development of the mainland has become one of the important highlights in annual conferences in recent years".
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said that the central government will continue to support the SAR's capital market development by significantly increasing the proportion of its national foreign exchange reserves and asset allocation in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Chan said the Asian Financial Forum held in Hong Kong earlier had facilitated exchanges between leaders from Europe, the United States, and new markets along the Belt and Road Initiative.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said finance leaders from Western countries have reaffirmed Hong Kong's role in bridging markets across the world with those on the mainland.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Whereas the global South hopes Hong Kong can diversify its fundraising capabilities to support their projects, including infrastructure, economic development, and green transition," he wrote.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Constitutional and Mainland Affairs Bureau and RTHK on Sunday announced they have jointly produced a series of programmes to promote patriotism and the rule of law.
 <br>
  <br>
  The initiative follows last year's establishment of the Working Group on Patriotic Education, which aims to strengthen education about national history and Chinese culture.
  <br>
  <br>
  The working group's convenor Starry Lee, who is also Hong Kong's sole delegate to the National People's Congress Standing Committee, said there are four major programmes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The purpose of [these programmes], as a combination of other tasks and events, is to help to build up the cultural awareness of Hong Kong people and their understanding towards our country," she told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee added that the working group will cooperate with different government departments and community stakeholders to organise events this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a launch ceremony on Sunday, Under Secretary for Constitutional and Mainland Affairs, Clement Woo, said the programmes will explain the Basic Law and the Constitution through everyday scenarios.
  <br>
  <br>
  Woo said the government has been working hard to help people understand these two documents better through diverse channels and innovative ways.
  <br>
  <br>
  Director of Broadcasting Angelina Kwan, working group member and National People's Congress deputy Cally Kwong, and Basic Law Committee member Simon Lee also attended the ceremony.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The head of respiratory medicine at the Chinese University of Hong Kong on Sunday warned that the SAR’s winter flu season has not peaked, and that occupancy rates at hospitals are continuing to rise.
 <br>
  <br>
  David Hui said those who have been hospitalised for the flu included children aged up to 5 and people who are 65 or older.
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted that there were 37 severe cases among adults who needed intensive care in the second week of the month. Fifteen of these patients died. The professor pointed out that 25 of these people had not received the influenza vaccine, and recommended that residents get vaccinated as soon as possible.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on Commercial Radio, Hui said that a general vaccination rate of 70 percent to 80 percent is ideal.
  <br>
  <br>
  But as of last month, he said the rate for infants and young children was 48 percent, and those aged 50 to 64 was only 20 percent, while the rate was 45 percent for those aged 65 or above.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hui also said that influenza cases in most northern hemisphere regions are on the rise, and that most of them involve H1N1 influenza A.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that the current flu season is expected to peak early next month, and decline around mid-March.

    'Transportation to airport will remain smooth'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Airport Authority on Sunday gave assurances that transportation services to and from the airport will not be affected by the development of SKYTOPIA.
 <br>
  <br>
  Earlier, the authority revealed the new expansion of Hong Kong's Airport City, which will include an arts hub, aimed at attracting visitors from both home and abroad.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have developed an autonomous vehicle system that would link from the border point and also from 11 Skies all the way to the MTR station in Tung Chung, which means that in [the] future, for the people from Hong Kong who want to go to SKYTOPIA, they don't actually have to use the Airport Express link," the authority's chairman Fred Lam told reporters after attending a Commercial Radio show.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the vehicle system will connect Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge's Hong Kong port with the Airport City by the start of 2026, and be extended to Tung Chung station by 2028. This, he explained, would relieve pressure on the Airport Express line.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are also developing two autonomous car parks at the restricted area of the border control area. Very soon, cars from Macau and Guangdong will be able to use the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge to reach the airport and also the SKYTOPIA area, this will also alleviate traffic problems in the future," Lam added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Airport Authority chief also said the development will see the construction of the city’s largest yacht bay, that would provide at least 500 docking spaces, as well a jet fresh market.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I hope the majority of parking spaces will be for yachts from around the Greater Bay Area and even other regions in Asia. We also hope to accommodate larger yachts, such as those longer than 70 metres, so yachts from further away can also come. Our positioning is towards those with better economic conditions, allowing them to drive their yacht and spend a few days in the city," Lam said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that the jet fresh market would allow visitors to enjoy the best fruits, meat and seafood from around the world due to the city's strong aviation network, import control and food safety standards.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Airport Authority had said the project would cost about HK$100 billion, including HK$30 billion for infrastructure.

    <![CDATA[<div>
<img alt="Under a law passed last year, the platform has until Sunday to cut ties with its China-based parent ByteDance or shut down its US operation. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1788182_1_20250119110315.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 TikTok stopped working in the United States late on Saturday and disappeared from Apple and Google app stores ahead of a law that takes effect on Sunday requiring the shutdown of the app used by 170 million Americans.
 <br>
  <br>
  President-elect Donald Trump said earlier in the day he would "most likely" give TikTok a 90-day reprieve from the ban after he takes office on Monday, a promise TikTok cited in a notice posted to users on the app.
  <br>
  <br>
  TikTok, which is owned by China's ByteDance, told users attempting to use the app around 11.45am Hong Kong time on Sunday: "A law banning TikTok has been enacted in the US.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Unfortunately, that means you can't use TikTok for now. We are fortunate that President Trump has indicated that he will work with us on a solution to reinstate TikTok once he takes office. Please stay tuned."
  <br>
  <br>
  Other apps owned by ByteDance, including video editing app Capcut and lifestyle social app Lemon8, were also offline and unavailable in US app stores as of late Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The 90-day extension is something that will be most likely done, because it's appropriate," Trump told NBC. "If I decide to do that, I'll probably announce it on Monday."
  <br>
  <br>
  It was not clear if any US users could still access the app, but it was no longer working for many users and people seeking to access it through a web application were met with the same message that TikTok was no longer working.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under a law passed last year and upheld on Friday by a unanimous Supreme Court, the platform has until Sunday to cut ties with its China-based parent ByteDance or shut down its US operation to resolve concerns it poses a threat to US national security.
  <br>
  <br>
  The White House reiterated on Saturday that it was up to the incoming administration to take action.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We see no reason for TikTok or other companies to take actions in the next few days before the Trump administration takes office on Monday," press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Chinese embassy in Washington on Friday accused the US of using unfair state power to suppress TikTok.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China will take all necessary measures to resolutely safeguard its legitimate rights and interests," a spokesperson said.

    Lukaku gets win for Napoli, Juve sink Milan

<img alt="Romelu Lukaku of SSC Napoli celebrates after a goal during the football match against Atalanta BC in Bergamo, Italy. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1788167_1_20250119083319.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Romelu Lukaku fired Napoli six points clear at the top of Serie A with the decisive goal in Saturday's thrilling 3-2 win at title rivals Atalanta, as Juventus beat AC Milan 2-0 to move into the Champions League spots.
 <br>
  <br>
  Belgium striker Lukaku nodded home his eighth Napoli goal from Andre-Frank Zambo Anguissa's perfect cross in the 78th minute to give Antonio Conte's team a statement win in Bergamo.
  <br>
  <br>
  Matteo Politano and Scott McTominay also scored for Napoli who have 50 points from 21 matches and have made it clear that they are now the team to beat in this year's title race after scoring three times from their only shots on target.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I can't say whether it's my most important goal (for Napoli) but the win is important. We showed tonight that we're a top team," said Lukaku to Sky.
  <br>
  <br>
  Napoli are gunning for a second Scudetto in three seasons and await the response from champions and closest challengers Inter Milan, who also have a game in hand, against struggling Empoli on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  A sixth straight win is the perfect boost Napoli need for another massive clash with Conte's old team Juventus, in Naples, this time next week.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's another test for us, to see where we are," added Lukaku.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere, goals in five second-half minutes from Samuel Mbangula and Timothy Weah gave Juventus a deserved win in Turin which pushed Thiago Motta's side up to fourth, a point ahead of Lazio who are at Verona on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Unbeaten Juve snapped a run of three straight draws which had taken their tally of league stalemates to 13, with Saturday's win just their eighth in 21 fixtures in Italy's top flight.
  <br>
  <br>
  Substitute Weah emulated his father in the 64th minute by netting in a Juventus match with Milan 25 years after Ballon d'Or-winner George Weah did the same - for Milan against Juve.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The boys are growing, match after match, and getting to the point that they can put in a performance like the one they did tonight," said Motta.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That's because they all work really hard every day... today's win is the reward." (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A South Korean court extended the detention of impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol on Sunday over concerns he could destroy evidence linked to his martial law declaration, enraging his supporters who attacked the court building.
 <br>
  <br>
  Hundreds of pro-Yoon protesters smashed windows and broke down doors to enter the court after the decision was announced, chanting the name of the president, who plunged South Korea into its worst political chaos in decades with his bid to suspend civilian rule.
  <br>
  <br>
  The president's December 3 martial law declaration lasted just six hours, with lawmakers voting it down despite him ordering soldiers to storm parliament to stop them. He was impeached soon after and suspended from duties.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon was detained in a dawn raid on Wednesday on insurrection charges after he refused investigators' summons and went to ground in his residence, using his presidential security detail to resist arrest.
  <br>
  <br>
  South Korea's first sitting president to be detained, Yoon had also refused to cooperate during the initial 48 hours detectives were allowed to hold him.
  <br>
  <br>
  The disgraced leader, who attended court for the first time on Saturday over his case, will now remain in custody, with the new warrant allowing investigators to keep him for up to 20 days.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon's lawyer Seok Dong-hyeon slammed the court decision, but also warned the president's supporters not to escalate the situation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is likely not what President Yoon desires," he said in a statement, adding violence could also "create burdens" for the president's future trials. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A ceasefire in the Gaza war begins on Sunday morning, mediator Qatar said, as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vows to bring back "all the hostages" held in the Palestinian territory.
 <br>
  <br>
  The truce is intended to end more than 15 months of fighting and devastating bombardment, but in a televised address on Saturday evening, the hawkish premier stressed Israel had US support to return to war if necessary.
  <br>
  <br>
  During an initial 42-day ceasefire, Palestinian militant groups will hand over 33 hostages, three of them on Sunday, and Israel will release hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, some of whom will be deported.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since mediators Qatar and the United States, which brokered the deal along with Egypt, announced the details on Wednesday, Israeli strikes on Gaza have continued.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Saturday, Gaza's civil defence rescue agency said at least five members of one family were killed when a strike hit their tent in Khan Yunis, in southern Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  Explosions were heard over Jerusalem as Yemen's Huthi rebels launched a barrage of missiles at Israel in a show of support for the Palestinians ahead of the truce.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Huthis said they targeted the defence ministry in Tel Aviv and also fired two missiles at the Red Sea port city of Eilat.
  <br>
  <br>
  Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al-Thani told Sky News the framework signed this week was the same as one agreed in December 2023, adding it amounted to 13 months of "waste".
  <br>
  <br>
  The truce is to take effect on the eve of Donald Trump's inauguration for a second term as US president.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump told US network NBC on Saturday that he had told Netanyahu that the war "has to end". "We want it to end, but to keep doing what has to be done," he said. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police in the central Indian state of Chhattisgarh on Saturday detained a second person suspected of involvement in a knife attack in which Bollywood actor Saif Ali Khan was wounded.
 <br>
  <br>
  Khan, 54, was stabbed six times by an intruder during a burglary attempt at his home in Mumbai early on Thursday. He had surgery after sustaining stab wounds to his spine, neck and hands, and is out of danger, doctors said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We got information from Mumbai Police that a suspect is travelling by Jnaneswari Express train," Sanjeev Sinha, a representative of the Railway Protection Force, told the ANI news agency.
  <br>
  <br>
  "...Mumbai Police officials were contacted through video call and the suspect's identity was confirmed. He has been detained," Sinha said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police in India's financial capital of Mumbai had on Friday detained another key suspect in the knife attack.
  <br>
  <br>
  The attack on Khan, one of Bollywood's most bankable and well-known actors, shocked the film industry and Mumbai residents, with many calling for better policing and security. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Two judges were killed in a shooting attack on Saturday at the Supreme Court building in Tehran, state media reported.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Three judges of the Supreme Court were targeted. Two of them were martyred," the Judiciary's Mizan Online website reported, adding that the "assailant killed himself."
  <br>
  <br>
  State news agency IRNA also reported that one other person was injured in the attack.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mizan identified the two slain judges as Ali Razini and Mohammad Moghisseh, adding that they worked on cases "fighting crimes against national security, espionage and terrorism."
  <br>
  <br>
  The motive behind their killing was not immediately clear, but Mizan said the assailant was not involved in any cases before the Supreme Court, without providing further details on the attacker's identity.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities said an investigation into the incident was launched, Mizan added.

  Veteran judge Moghisseh, 68, was sanctioned in 2019 by the United States for having "overseen countless unfair trails, during which charges went unsubstantiated and evidence was disregarded," according to the US Department of the Treasury.
  <br>
  <br>
  Razini, 71, held several important positions in Iran's judiciary and was previously targeted in a 1998 assassination attempt by assailants "who planted a magnetic bomb on his vehicle," according to Mizan.

  <br>
  In August 2005, renowned Iranian judge Hassan Moghaddas was murdered by two gunmen who climbed into his car in the middle of a busy business district in Tehran.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two men convicted over his killing were publicly executed by hanging two years later. (AFP)

 Temperamental Russian Daniil Medvedev was on Saturday fined US$76,000 over his behaviour at the Australian Open, where he destroyed a net camera, threw his racquet and skipped a post-match press conference.
 <br>
  <br>
  The world number five was penalised US$10,000 for a meltdown during his five-set first-round win against Thailand's Kasidit Samrej, when he mangled his racquet and ruined the camera.
  <br>
  <br>
  He faced an even bigger penalty – US$66,000 – over his antics in the next round when he crashed out to 19-year-old qualifier Learner Tien.
  <br>
  <br>
  During the match he threw his racquet toward the sidelines, skidding across the court until it reached an advertising panel near his bench.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also argued with the umpire after being called out for repeated foot faults, then skipped his obligatory post-match press conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  Medvedev had reached three of the last four Australian Open finals, including in 2024 when he imploded after leading by two sets, losing to Jannik Sinner. (AFP)

<img alt="A crowd of protesters are demanding he be given the death penalty. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1788134_1_20250118181325.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An Indian court on Saturday found a 33-year-old man guilty of the rape and murder of a doctor, a crime that sparked nationwide protests and hospital strikes last year.
 <br>
  <br>
  The discovery of the victim's bloodied body at a government hospital in the eastern city of Kolkata last August once again highlighted the chronic issue of violence against women in the world's most populous country.
  <br>
  <br>
  It led to demands by doctors at government hospitals for additional security, with thousands of citizens in Kolkata and elsewhere in India joining the doctors' protests in solidarity.
  <br>
  <br>
  The trial of defendant Sanjoy Roy was fast-tracked through India's normally glacial legal system and arguments in the case concluded a little over a week ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The sentence will be delivered on Monday," presiding judge Anirban Das said after finding Roy, a civic volunteer in the hospital, guilty of rape and murder.
  <br>
  <br>
  Roy has consistently maintained his innocence and again told the court that he was not guilty.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I have been framed," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Roy was brought to court by a prison van and greeted by a crowd of protesters, held at bay by police officers, demanding he be given the death penalty.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hang him, hang him," they chanted.
  <br>
  <br>
  The sentiment was echoed by the victim's family, none of whom have been identified in keeping with Indian law around the reporting of sexual violence cases.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The common man will lose faith in the judiciary if he is not handed down the death penalty," said the victim's mother, seated just a few metres from Roy when the verdict was read out.
  <br>
  <br>
  Her father added: "He brutally snuffed out the life of our daughter. He deserves the same fate."
  <br>
  <br>
  The trainee doctor was found raped and murdered in a seminar room of the hospital last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The crime led to nationwide outrage and prolonged protests by doctors across the state, demanding justice for the victim and stronger security measures in government hospitals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Roy was arrested a day after the victim's body was discovered.
  <br>
  <br>
  India's Supreme Court set up a national task force after the protests that suggested ways to enhance safety measures in government hospitals.
  <br>
  <br>
  The gruesome nature of the attack drew comparisons with the 2012 gang rape and murder of a young woman on a Delhi bus, which also sparked weeks of nationwide protests. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Impeached South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol was in court for the first time on Saturday for a crucial hearing that will decide whether to extend his detention as investigators probe his failed martial law bid.
 <br>
  <br>
  Yoon's supporters rallied outside the court and scuffled with police as he arrived in a blue van, weeks after throwing the nation into chaos by attempting to suspend civilian rule.
  <br>
  <br>
  The president's December 3 martial law bid lasted just six hours, with lawmakers voting it down despite him ordering soldiers to storm parliament to stop them.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon was subsequently impeached by parliament and resisted arrest for weeks, holed up in his guarded residence until he was finally detained on Wednesday in a dawn raid.
  <br>
  <br>
  South Korea's first sitting president to be detained, Yoon refused to cooperate during the initial 48 hours detectives were allowed to hold him.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the disgraced president remains in custody after investigators requested a new warrant on Friday to extend his detention.
  <br>
  <br>
  He decided to appear in court "with the intention of restoring his honour," the president's lawyer Yoon Kab-keun said before the hearing.
  <br>
  <br>
  A spokesperson for Seoul Western District Court later confirmed that the hearing commenced with the president in attendance.
  <br>
  <br>
  After reviewing the request to extend Yoon's detention, a judge is expected to announce her decision on Saturday night or early on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Outside the court, crowds of Yoon's backers waving flags and holding "release the president" placards.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police officers formed a chain to prevent them reaching the court entrance, which has been closed to the public since Friday evening over safety concerns.
  <br>
  <br>
  If approved, as expected, the new warrant would likely extend Yoon's detention by 20 days.
  <br>
  <br>
  This would give prosecutors time to formalise an indictment for insurrection, a charge that could see him jailed for life or executed if found guilty.
  <br>
  <br>
  If indicted, the president would probably be detained for the duration of the trial. (AFP)

<img alt="Mavericks guard Kyrie Irving drives to the basket on his way to 25 points. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1788126_1_20250118161554.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Kyrie Irving scored 25 points as the Dallas Mavericks brought the high-flying Oklahoma City Thunder down to earth with a 106-98 victory over the Western Conference leaders on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Oklahoma City, riding high after their rout of Eastern Conference pace-setters Cleveland on Thursday, suffered just their seventh defeat of the season in a roller-coaster duel against a fired-up Mavericks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Irving was at the heart of the Mavs win, rattling in 17 points in a 41-point second quarter that allowed Dallas to open up a 64-43 half-time lead.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Thunder, who were missing Shai Gilgeous-Alexander with a wrist injury, came roaring back to draw level in the third quarter before edging into a single-digit lead.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the Mavs, who are still without the injured Luka Doncic, regrouped superbly to close out the win, outscoring the Thunder 29-22 in the fourth quarter to seal victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dallas improved to 23-19 while Oklahoma City remain top of the West with a 34-7 record.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dallas coach Jason Kidd saluted his team's resilience in securing victory after watching a 20-point lead evaporate in the third quarter.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We were flat in that third quarter," Kidd said. "We said on the bench we needed to stay the course, and stay together and in the fourth quarter we did.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We feel like we have a talented team, and they have a talented team. So I thought tonight was a really good test for our group."
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere on Friday, Jimmy Butler returned for Miami after serving a seven-game in-house suspension but was powerless to prevent the Heat from slumping to a 133-113 loss to the Denver Nuggets.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nikola Jokic bagged his 17th triple-double of the season, finishing with 24 points, 12 rebounds and 10 assists in a comfortable victory for the 2023 NBA champions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jamal Murray led the Denver scoring with 30 points on a night when seven Nuggets players finished in double figures.
  <br>
  <br>
  Butler, who was suspended by Miami after indicating he wished to leave the club earlier this month, finished with 18 points.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Boston, Jayson Tatum scored 30 points as the NBA champion Celtics shrugged off their heaviest loss of the season to outclass the Orlando Magic 121-94.
  <br>
  <br>
  Boston, dominated 110-97 by lowly Toronto on the road on Wednesday, showed no signs of a hangover to complete a comfortable home victory at the TD Garden.
  <br>
  <br>
  Orlando took a short-lived lead early in the first quarter but once Tatum, Kristaps Porzingis and Jaylen Brown found their range, the result was never in doubt.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tatum's 30-point haul came from 12-of-21 shooting with four three-pointers, six rebounds and four assists.
  <br>
  <br>
  Porzingis finished with 23 points and Brown added 20, including a perfect 9-of-9 from the free-throw line.
  <br>
  <br>
  Boston improved to 29-12 with the victory to remain in second place in the Eastern Conference behind leaders Cleveland.
  <br>
  <br>
  Orlando's scoring was led by Cole Anthony with 23 points while Paolo Banchero continued his return from injury with 21 points.
  <br>
  <br>
  In New York meanwhile, Anthony Edwards erupted for 36 points as the Minnesota Timberwolves romped to a 116-99 victory over the Knicks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Edwards was on fire from outside the arc, making 8-of-13 three-pointers while Naz Reid also caught the eye with 6-of-6 threes in a 23-point cameo shift off the bench.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Milwaukee, the Bucks handed Toronto a reality check following their upset of Boston on Wednesday, with a 130-112 blowout at the Fiserv Forum.
  <br>
  <br>
  Milwaukee swept to their third-straight win thanks to 35 points from Giannis Antetokounmpo and 26 points from Damian Lillard. The Bucks improved to 23-17 with the victory and remain in the fourth spot in the Eastern Conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  In San Antonio, Santi Aldama scored 29 off the bench as the Memphis Grizzlies overwhelmed Victor Wembanyama and the Spurs 140-112.
  <br>
  <br>
  Spurs star Wembanyama produced another big defensive performance with six blocks and a steal with 12 rebounds. But the Grizzlies' balanced offence proved too strong for the home side, with six players finishing in double figures. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Former Manchester United and Scotland striker Denis Law has died at the age of 84, his family announced on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  "It is with a heavy heart that we tell you our father Denis Law has sadly passed away. He fought a tough battle but finally he is now at peace," said the star's family in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Law scored a total of 237 goals in 404 appearances during an 11-year spell at Old Trafford until 1973, which places him third behind Wayne Rooney and Bobby Charlton on United's all-time list.
  <br>
  <br>
  He played 55 times for Scotland after making his debut at just 18 in 1958 and he remains his country's joint all-time leading scorer with 30 goals alongside Kenny Dalglish.
  <br>
  <br>
  During his time at United, Law won the first division title in 1965 and 1967.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, a cartilage injury forced him to miss the famous 4-1 thrashing of Benfica in the European Cup final at Wembley – a triumph that made United the first English winners of the trophy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Manchester United said the club was mourning the loss of "the king of the Stretford End" – the stand at Old Trafford where there is a statue of Law.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He will always be celebrated as one of the club's greatest and most beloved players," United added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The ultimate goalscorer, his flair, spirit and love for the game made him the hero of a generation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our deepest condolences go out to Denis' family and many friends. His memory will live on forever more."
  <br>
  <br>
  Law was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia in 2021.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We would like to thank everyone who contributed to his wellbeing and care, past and much more recently," his family said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We know how much people supported and loved him and that love was always appreciated and made the difference. Thank you." (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Israel's cabinet voted to approve a Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal on Saturday, the office of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said, ending days of uncertainty about whether the truce would go into effect this weekend.
 <br>
  <br>
  The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip will take effect at 0630 GMT on Sunday morning, Qatar, which helped mediate the deal, said on Saturday, and would halt the fighting and bombardment in Gaza's deadliest-ever war.
  <br>
  <br>
  It would also enable the release of hostages held in the territory since Hamas's October 7, 2023 attack on Israel in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The government has approved the hostage return plan," Netanyahu's office said early on Saturday morning after the cabinet held its vote.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel's justice ministry has said 737 prisoners and detainees will be freed as part of the first phase of the deal – none before 4:00 pm local time (1400 GMT) on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israeli strikes have killed dozens since the ceasefire deal was announced, with the military saying on Thursday it had hit about 50 targets across Gaza over the previous 24 hours.
  <br>
  <br>
  The truce is to take effect on the eve of the inauguration of Donald Trump, who claimed credit for working with outgoing US President Joe Biden's team to seal the deal.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was earlier approved by Israel's security cabinet, with Netanyahu's office saying it "supports achieving the objectives of the war."
  <br>
  <br>
  Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas said the Palestinian Authority has completed preparations "to assume full responsibility in Gaza" after the war.
  <br>
  <br>
  Even before the truce begins, displaced Gazans were preparing to return home.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I will go to kiss my land," said Nasr al-Gharabli, who fled his home in Gaza City for a camp further south. "If I die on my land, it would be better than being here as a displaced person."
  <br>
  <br>
  In Israel, there was joy but also anguish over the remaining hostages taken in the Hamas attack.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kfir Bibas, whose second birthday falls on Saturday, is the youngest hostage.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamas said in November 2023 that Kfir, his four-year-old brother Ariel and their mother Shiri had died in an air strike, but with the Israeli military yet to confirm their deaths, many are clinging to hope.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think of them, these two little redheads, and I get shivers," said 70-year-old Osnat Nyska, whose grandchildren attended nursery with the Bibas brothers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two far-right ministers had voiced opposition to the deal, with one threatening to quit the cabinet, but US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said before the vote he believed the ceasefire would proceed.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I am confident, and I fully expect that implementation will begin, as we said, on Sunday," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gaza's civil defence agency said Israel pounded several areas of the territory, killing more than 100 people and wounding hundreds more since the deal was announced on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamas's armed wing, the Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades, warned that Israeli strikes were risking the lives of hostages and could turn their "freedom... into a tragedy."
  <br>
  <br>
  The October 7, 2023 attack on Israel resulted in the deaths of 1,210 people, mostly civilians, according to a tally of Israeli official figures.
  <br>
  <br>
  Of the 251 people taken hostage, 94 are still in Gaza, including 34 the Israeli military says are dead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel's retaliatory campaign has destroyed much of Gaza, killing 46,876 people, most of them civilians, according to figures from the Hamas-run territory's health ministry that the UN considers reliable.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ceasefire agreement followed intensified efforts by mediators Qatar, the United States and Egypt after months of fruitless negotiations.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the days of talks, Biden pointman Brett McGurk was joined in the region by Trump envoy Steve Witkoff in an unusual pairing to get the deal over the line, US officials said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If we weren't involved... the deal would've never happened," Trump said in an interview on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al-Thani, announcing the agreement on Wednesday, said an initial 42-day ceasefire would see 33 hostages released.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Friday, he said: "We seek a full implementation of the first phase, and for the second phase to be the final.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are waiting for the Security Council to issue a binding resolution to implement the agreement."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Israeli authorities assume the 33 are alive, but Hamas has yet to confirm that.
  <br>
  <br>
  Also in the first phase, Israeli forces would withdraw from Gaza's densely populated areas and allow displaced Palestinians to return "to their residences," the Qatari prime minister said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two sources close to Hamas said three Israeli women soldiers would be the first to be released on Sunday evening.
  <br>
  <br>
  The women may, in fact, be civilians, as the militant group refers to all Israelis of military age who have undergone mandatory military service as soldiers.
  <br>
  <br>
  An Israeli military official said reception points had been established at Kerem Shalom, Erez and Reim, where hostages would be joined by doctors and mental health specialists before being "transported via helicopter or vehicle" to hospitals in Israel.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel "is then expected to release the first group of Palestinian prisoners, including several with high sentences," a source said on condition of anonymity.
  <br>
  <br>
  During talks on Friday, negotiators agreed to form a joint operations room in Cairo to "ensure effective coordination" and compliance with the truce terms, Egyptian state-linked media reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  French President Emmanuel Macron said French-Israeli citizens Ofer Kalderon and Ohad Yahalomi were among the hostages due to be freed in the first phase.
  <br>
  <br>
  Biden said the second phase could bring a "permanent end to the war."
  <br>
  <br>
  In aid-starved Gaza, where nearly all of its 2.4 million people have been displaced at least once, humanitarian workers worry about the monumental task ahead.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Everything has been destroyed, children are on the streets, you can't pinpoint just one priority," said Doctors Without Borders coordinator Amande Bazerolle. (AFP)

    'Businesses need to adapt and innovate'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development, Algernon Yau, said it's important for the city's retail, catering and hotel sectors to be adaptable and innovative - to attract a broader consumer base.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on an RTHK programme on Saturday, he said the total number of visitors to Hong Kong last year surpassed 44 million, marking a 30 percent annual increase.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that despite the SAR experiencing a 7.3 percent year-on-year decline in retail sales value last November, there was a positive shift during the Christmas and New Year period, with some businesses reporting double-digit growth.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Apart from an increase in visitors from mainland China, there were also many more visitors from Southeast Asia under the new 'multiple-entry visa' scheme. I believe that, especially this year, this should greatly benefit the retail sector, particularly during holidays," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But given the overall global economic environment and changing consumer patterns, we need to adapt. The retail and catering sectors need to think about how to transform. Hong Kong has many eateries with long queues, indicating their popularity. We can look at why these eateries are so successful."
  <br>
  <br>
  He also said online shopping is going to become the dominant trend in the global retail landscape, making it necessary for businesses to revamp their business models.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yau said the Hong Kong Brands and Products Expo this year will be promoted on e-commerce platforms across mainland China and Southeast Asia.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that the SAR offers a plethora of sought-after brands and products, including food, cosmetics, and health items that hold significant popularity in mainland markets.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked if recent cases of Hong Kong residents being forced to work on illegal scams in several Southeast Asian countries would impact Hong Kong businesses' willingness to invest and operate in those areas, Yau said the two issues should not be intertwined.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong has been doing business in Southeast Asia for a long time. There are many Hong Kong businesses in Thailand, Myanmar, Cambodia, Vietnam and Laos. When I went to Cambodia, there were also many Hong Kong people who are living happily there and setting up business there. Similarly, there are Hong Kong businesses in Laos," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think these are two separate matters that should not be confused. The occurrence of such events should not affect people's willingness to do business."

    CE puts best foot forward in North Point visit

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Saturday wrapped up a visit to the harbourfront boardwalk in North Point to talk to Hongkongers – and managed to fit in an impromptu jog.
 <br>
  <br>
  The walkway – built under the Island Eastern Corridor – spans 2.2 kilometres in total.
  <br>
  <br>
  The section from Fortress Hill to North Point will open to the public on January 26.
  <br>
  <br>
  The boardwalk will have viewing platforms and shared spaces for pedestrians, joggers, cyclists, and pet owners.
  <br>
  <br>
  Movable bridges have also been installed to allow vessels access to the inner waters.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Development Bureau and the Eastern District Office invited some people on Saturday to try out the boardwalk – while Lee was there for an inspection.
  <br>
  <br>
  After an inspection of about half an hour, Lee invited some Hongkongers to join him for a jog along the boardwalk.
  <br>
  <br>
  “My personal feeling is that whether you run, jog, or cycle along the boardwalk, the scenery is amazing. It’s nice to take in the views in a busy schedule, and Hong Kong is a beautiful place to call home,” he said after the run.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Development Bureau earlier announced that the section between North Point and Quarry Bay will be opened in phases in the second half of this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  After the completion of the project, a 13-kilometre harbourfront promenade will connect Kennedy Town in the west with Shau Kei Wan in the east of Hong Kong Island.

    Children should get flu jabs 'before LNY travel'

<div class="itemFullText">
 A paediatrician has urged parents planning Lunar New Year travels with their kids to ensure their children get their flu jabs immediately, citing an increased risk of influenza-related complications following the pandemic.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters after appearing on a radio programme on Saturday, Dr Patrick Ip, from the University of Hong Kong's department of paediatrics, said severe influenza infections could result in complications such as pneumonia, pneumococcal infection or respiratory syncytial virus infection, posing a heightened risk, especially for children.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that the vaccination rate among children is still low, with more than 50 percent yet to receive their jabs.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are already entering into the winter and already entering into the peak season of influenza outbreak. We want to encourage all the parents to try to bring your children to receive influenza vaccination as quickly as possible. Now for those younger children younger than nine years old, they need to receive at least two doses of influenza vaccine separated by four weeks," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For each dose of influenza, usually after the vaccination, it takes two weeks to become much more effective in protection."
  <br>
  <br>
  He said parents have different vaccination options available for their children, which can be accessed at different locations.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The vaccination programme this year actually has been well being conducted in the different areas including by hospital clinic settings, but also with a very good outreach programme," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This year, the government ... allowed a very flexible on-site vaccination scheme to the schools. They can choose either to receive the conventional injection of inactivated vaccine or they could also choose the nasal influenza live-attenuated vaccine option."
  <br>
  <br>
  Ip added that the upward trend in influenza cases is expected to continue, predicting more severe instances in the next few weeks.

    Law change on public housing misuse on its way

<img alt="" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1788106_1_20250118105244.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Housing Winnie Ho on Saturday said the government is confident of passing a law change this legislative session making serious misuse of public housing a crime.
 <br>
  <br>
  Under the proposed amendments to the Housing Ordinance, people who break the rules - such as subletting units or using them for business without living there - can face fines of up to HK$500,000 and jail terms of up to a year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Currently, the toughest punishment for rule-breakers is eviction.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a Commercial Radio programme, Ho gave some examples of what might qualify as serious misuse.
  <br>
  <br>
  “For example, one unit had lots of mirrors installed and was used as a dance studio. And we found a unit which had fitness equipment in which the tenant was training gym-goers. In these situations, people aren't living there, and they're using public housing to make money, so we class this as serious misuse of public housing,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho said the administration would look at each instance on a case-by-case basis, and would be reasonable and compassionate in enforcing the law.
  <br>
  <br>
  For example, residents who hold small-scale tutorial classes for money, or make handcrafts for online businesses might not be seen as seriously misusing their units, the housing minister said.
  <br>
  <br>
  She added that the administration had held talks with major parties and received their support.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Legco's panel on housing is scheduled to discuss the legislation change next month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the cash reward scheme for people who want to report illegal public housing use kicked off on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho said about 200 reports had been submitted in the last two days, although one-fourth of informants didn’t want the reward, and there were some false claims.
  <br>
  <br>
  She estimated there would be about 1,300 successful reports this year, with authorities giving out more than HK$4 million in cash.

 US President-elect Donald Trump said his inauguration will be held inside the US Capitol rather than outdoors because of severe cold.
 <br>
  <br>
  "The weather forecast for Washington, DC, with the wind chill factor, could take temperatures into severe record lows. There is an Arctic blast sweeping the Country. I don't want to see people hurt, or injured, in any way," Trump said on his Truth Social platform on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Therefore, I have ordered the Inauguration Address, in addition to prayers and other speeches, to be delivered in the United States Capitol Rotunda," Trump added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump referred to the last time an inauguration was moved indoors because of the cold - former Republican President Ronald Reagan's second swearing-in in 1985.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said supporters can view the ceremony on screens inside the Capital One Arena, a sports venue in downtown Washington that holds 20,000 people. (Reuters)

  The S&P 500 rose 59.32 points, or one percent, to 5,996.66. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 334.70, or 0.8 percent, to 43,487.83, and the Nasdaq composite jumped 291.91 points, or 1.5 percent, to 19,630.20.

  The gains were driven by big tech stocks.

  All the companies in the so-called Magnificent Seven rose: Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla.

  Stocks were helped this week by an encouraging report on US inflation , which raised hopes that the Federal Reserve may deliver more interest rate cuts this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite the latest inflation data, some experts are still bearish about the prospects for more cuts. With the US economy in solid overall shape, "you shouldn't fix what's not broken," Bank of America economists Claudio Irigoyen and Antonio Gabriel said in a BofA Global Research report.
  <br>
  <br>
  They also pointed to the uncertainties created by "Trumponomics 2.0," amid fears that the new administration's policies could help push up inflation. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The US Supreme Court refused to rescue TikTok on Friday from a law that requires the popular short-video app to be sold by its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, or banned on Sunday in the United States on national security grounds — a major blow to a platform used by nearly half of all Americans.
 <br>
  <br>
  The justices unanimously ruled that the law, passed by an overwhelming bipartisan majority in Congress last year and signed by Democratic President Joe Biden, did not violate the US Constitution's First Amendment protection against government abridgement of free speech. TikTok, ByteDance, and some of the app's users challenged the measure, prompting the justices to uphold a lower court's decision.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There is no doubt that, for more than 170 million Americans, TikTok offers a distinctive and expansive outlet for expression, means of engagement, and source of community. But Congress has determined that divestiture is necessary to address its well-supported national security concerns regarding TikTok's data collection practices and relationship with a foreign adversary," the court said in the unsigned opinion.
  <br>
  <br>
  The court added, "We conclude that the challenged provisions do not violate the petitioners' First Amendment rights."
  <br>
  <br>
  The case pitted free speech rights against national security concerns in the age of social media.
  <br>
  <br>
  White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre on Friday reiterated Biden's position that "TikTok should remain available to Americans, but simply under American ownership or other ownership that addresses the national security concerns identified by Congress in developing this law."
  <br>
  <br>
  Given the timing, Jean-Pierre added, action to implement the law "must fall to the next administration."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's team did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
  <br>
  <br>
  TikTok also did not immediately respond to a request for comment. TikTok plans to shut down US operations of the app on Sunday barring a last-minute reprieve, people familiar with the matter told Reuters on Wednesday. (Reuters)

<img alt="Erling Haaland has scored 111 goals in 126 games for Manchester City. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1788067_1_20250117224045.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Erling Haaland has signed a new 9.5-year deal at Manchester City that will keep him at the Etihad until 2034, the Premier League champions announced on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 24-year-old striker's existing contract was due to expire in June 2027 but he has now committed his future to the club for the next decade.
  <br>
  <br>
  The deal is the longest in the Premier League, eclipsing the nine-year contract Cole Palmer signed with Chelsea last year and Haaland's salary will reportedly be about £500,000 (US$610,000) per week.
  <br>
  <br>
  A post on the club's X account read: "Erling's here to stay! We're thrilled to announce Erling Haaland has extended his contract at City to 2034."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Norwegian made an instant impact after joining City from Borussia Dortmund in 2022, firing 52 goals in all competitions to help the club win a Champions League, Premier League and FA Cup treble in his first season.
  <br>
  <br>
  He scored a further 38 goals last season as City won a fourth consecutive league title and his overall tally stands at 111 goals in 126 games for the club.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I am really happy to have signed my new contract and to be able to look forward to spending even more time at this great club," said Haaland.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Manchester City is a special club, full of fantastic people with amazing supporters, and it's the type of environment that helps bring the best out of everybody.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I also want to thank Pep (Guardiola), his coaching staff, my team-mates and everyone at the club as they have all helped me so much in the past couple of years. They have made this such a special place to be and now I am City no matter what."
  <br>
  <br>
  City's outgoing director of football Txiki Begiristain said: "Everyone at the club is absolutely delighted that Erling has signed his new contract.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The fact he is signed for so long demonstrates our commitment to him as a player, and his love of this club.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He has made an incredible impact already in his time here and his amazing numbers and records speak for themselves."
  <br>
  <br>
  Haaland's extension is a major boost for City in a season where they have unexpectedly struggled on the pitch, with the club sitting sixth, 12 points behind leaders Liverpool.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also appears to be a huge show of faith from the player at a time when the club is waiting to learn the outcome of a major disciplinary case.
  <br>
  <br>
  City faced an independent commission hearing last year to examine more than 100 charges from the Premier League concerning alleged breaches of its financial rules, charges the club have always strenuously denied.
  <br>
  <br>
  The new contract renewal comes two months after Guardiola's decision to sign a new two-year deal of his own. (AFP)

    IMF raises global growth outlook

<img alt="The IMF expects global growth to increase slightly this year, although still below pre-pandemic levels. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1788065_1_20250117222710.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Global growth is expected to increase slightly this year while remaining stuck below its pre-pandemic average, the IMF said on Friday, flagging the growing economic divide between the United States and European countries.
 <br>
  <br>
  In an update to its flagship World Economic Outlook report, the International Monetary Fund said it expects global growth to hit 3.3 percent this year, up 0.1 percentage point from its previous forecast in October, and to remain at 3.3 percent in 2026.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Growth is steady," IMF chief economist Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas told reporters, adding it remained below the average global growth rate in the first two decades of the 21st century of 3.7 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The IMF expects the global inflation rate to continue decelerating, reaching 4.2 percent this year and 3.5 percent in 2026, with prices cooling faster in advanced economies than in emerging markets.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Among advanced economies, the interesting development here is the strength and resilience and growth of the US economy," Gourinchas said, pointing to the IMF's decision to hike its outlook for US growth to 2.7 percent in 2025 and to 2.1 percent in 2026.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The labour market has been strong, there is strong demand, private demand is robust, there is good confidence," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The IMF expects China's growth rate to continue cooling this year to 4.6 percent, up 0.1 percentage point from the October forecast, before easing to 4.5 percent next year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The slight upgrade was due to the Chinese government's recently announced package of fiscal support to help prop up the economy, amid an ongoing property market slump and uncertainty about trade policy once Donald Trump takes office next week.
  <br>
  <br>
  The slowdown in growth in the world's second-largest economy is leading to something of a "rebalancing" among emerging markets, Gourinchas said, with countries including India -- which the IMF expects to grow by 6.5 percent this year and next -- playing a more important role.
  <br>
  <br>
  Growth in the Middle East and Central Asia is expected to pick up by less than previously forecast due largely to the effect of oil production cuts by the Opec+ group of oil-producing nations, which includes Saudi Arabia.
  <br>
  <br>
  One of the risks to the IMF's forecasts is policy uncertainty in the United States, where Trump is preparing to return to the White House and has threatened to unleash tariffs on a host of nations including China.
  <br>
  <br>
  Still, the economic picture in America stands in stark contrast to the Euro area, where a sharp downgrade for Germany has dampened expectations for a rebound in growth.
  <br>
  <br>
  The IMF now sees Euro area growth to increase slightly to 1.0 percent this year, and 1.4 percent in 2026, below its October forecasts. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The director of Beijing's Liaison Office in Hong Kong, Zheng Yanxiong, on Friday said the SAR has to strengthen its advantage of international connectivity, and not weaken it.
 <br>
  <br>
  He made the comment during the office's annual spring reception at the Convention and Exhibition Centre in Wan Chai.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zheng said Hong Kong needs to "shoulder its sacred responsibilities to the motherland" by safeguarding the constitutional order and the One Country, Two Systems principle, while being able to adapt to changes and be innovative.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said while the world is going through great changes not seen in a century, Hong Kong could seize the opportunities that came its way as it has the country's strong backing.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong can surely attract money and resources from all sides. The key is to achieve our better selves through staying upright, and continue to write the legendary story of Hong Kong in the new era," Zheng said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The director said by staying upright, he meant maintaining a business environment that is free and based on the rule of law, as well as an inclusive and multicultural environment.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We need to persist in connecting both with the mainland and with the world, while resolutely integrating into the country's overall development," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong's advantage to connect internally, is that it is an external-oriented [city.] Its international advantages can only be strengthened, not weakened."
  <br>
  <br>
  Zheng went on to stress that safeguarding security and focusing on development go hand in hand, and local officials have to always stay vigilant.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at the same event, Chief Executive John Lee said he would lead the government in uniting different sectors of society, while working hard on reforms.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said Hong Kong would focus on increasing the liquidity of offshore reminbi, in a bid to attract more mainland and international firms to list on the local stock exchange.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CE added that officials would also look into improving the mechanism of connecting local financial markets with those on the mainland, as well as signing more investment and trade pacts with different countries and regions.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Israeli security cabinet approved a Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal on Friday, recommending the wider government give its final green light, the office of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said.
 <br>
  <br>
  "After reviewing all the political, security and humanitarian aspects, and understanding that the proposed deal supports achieving the objectives of the war, (the security cabinet) has recommended that the government approve the proposed framework," the office said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ceasefire is expected start on Sunday with the first hostages released.
  <br>
  <br>
  The security cabinet meeting came after Netanyahu’s office said there were last minute snags in finalising the ceasefire agreement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel had delayed a security cabinet vote on Thursday, blaming the dispute with Hamas for holding up approval.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, a pre-dawn statement cleared the way for the deal to be voted on.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under the deal expected to begin on Sunday, 33 hostages are set to be released over the next six weeks, in exchange for hundreds of Palestinians imprisoned by Israel.
  <br>
  <br>
  The remainder, including male soldiers, are to be released in a second phase that will be negotiated during the first.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamas has said it will not release the remaining captives without a lasting ceasefire and a full Israeli withdrawal. (Agencies)

<img alt="Police stand guard at the Seoul Detention Centre where South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol is being held. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1788041_1_20250117185548.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korean investigators probing President Yoon Suk-yeol for alleged insurrection asked a Seoul court on Friday to extend his detention as the embattled leader again refused to be questioned.
 <br>
  <br>
  On Wednesday, Yoon became the first sitting South Korean president to be arrested, in a criminal probe related to his short-lived declaration of martial law in early December. He is being held at the Seoul Detention Centre.
  <br>
  <br>
  In order to hold Yoon in custody for longer, investigators at the Corruption Investigation Office for High-ranking Officials (CIO) need a court to approve a detention warrant for up to 20 days.
  <br>
  <br>
  A CIO official told a briefing on Friday that investigators had made the request due to "the gravity of the crime". Yoon's current arrest term was due to expire by Friday evening.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Seoul Central District Court struck down a challenge on Thursday from Yoon's lawyers over the legality of his arrest.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement disseminated by his lawyer, Yoon said the jail cell where he is being held was "a little uncomfortable" but that he was doing well.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also thanked his supporters, hundreds of whom gathered outside the prison in chilly conditions, saying: "I am grateful for the people's burning patriotism."
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon has stonewalled efforts by the CIO to interrogate him while his party has capitalised on political polarisation to improve its approval ratings since his arrest, polling showed.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He has fully stated his basic position on the first day (of the arrest), and we believe there is no reason or need to answer the Q&A style back-and-forth," Yoon's lawyer, Seok Dong-hyeon, said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The suspended president's legal team has denied Yoon masterminded an insurrection, a crime in South Korea punishable by life imprisonment or even, technically, the death penalty.

  South Korea is grappling with its worst political crisis in decades, sparked by Yoon's attempt to impose martial law on December 3 that stunned the nation and was swiftly voted down by parliament.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon was impeached on December 14 and he faces a Constitutional Court trial that started this week to decide whether to permanently suspend his powers or return him to office. (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Friday said the government was very cautious when considering tax reforms and that many factors had to be taken into consideration.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a forum organised by the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, Chan said the government hoped to achieve a fiscal balance in three years, but the SAR would focus more on managing costs than generating revenue.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In terms of raising taxes, first, we must consider our competitiveness, comparing to our neighbouring regions and the impact on attracting enterprises and investment," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Second, as society recovers from the pandemic, including small and medium enterprises, big corporations, and even individuals, we have to rebuild our balance sheets. We hope to provide more room for companies and individuals to strengthen their financial abilities."
  <br>
  <br>
  The government deducted one percent from the recurrent expenditure resources of government departments from the 2024/25 financial year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The finance minister said the government would look into whether there was a need to further reduce expenditures in his Budget, due to be announced next month.
  <br>
  <br>
  On whether the "affordable users pay" principle could be further implemented, he said Hong Kong has to work on it in a gradual and orderly way.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan added there were currently no plans to cut costs on infrastructure, saying the Northern Metropolis project could not be delayed.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Defending champion Aryna Sabalenka was pushed to the limit in setting up an Australian Open showdown with teenager Mirra Andreeva on Friday but Naomi Osaka's run ended with an injury retirement in round three.
 <br>
  <br>
  Women's World No. 1 Sabalenka was made to work hard behind a faltering serve before beating Denmark's Clara Tauson in the third round on Rod Laver Arena.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sabalenka was broken four straight times at the start of the match but found her groove to win 7-6 (7/5), 6-4 after more than two hours of attritional tennis.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm just super happy that I was able to just stay in the game and I was able to push myself, honestly, to the limit to get this win," said Sabalenka, who is chasing a rare third Melbourne title in a row.
  <br>
  <br>
  Her win puts her into a clash against highly rated 17-year-old Andreeva, the 14th seed, who beat Poland's 23rd seed Magdalena Frech in three sets.
  <br>
  <br>
  Russia's Andreeva announced her burgeoning talent by beating Sabalenka in the quarter-finals at Roland Garros last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, two-time Melbourne champion Osaka was on a collision course with American third seed Coco Gauff in the next round.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the former world number one needed treatment on her stomach from the trainer during the first set against Belinda Bencic and called it quits after losing the opener on a tiebreak.
  <br>
  <br>
  Osaka, who was struggling with an abdominal injury in the build-up to the tournament and retired from the final in Auckland, was in the third round of a Slam for the first time since the birth of her daughter in 2023. (AFP)

    Govt raises travel alert for parts of Myanmar to red

    <![CDATA[<div>
<img alt="The Security Bureau has raised the travel alert level for parts of Myanmar to red." src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1788030_1_20250117174108.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Friday raised its travel alert for southeastern Myanmar to red, following cases of Hongkongers being lured there and forced to work at scam farms.
 <br>
  <br>
  Red is the middle level of the government's three-tier outward travel alert system, meaning there is a significant threat of going to the place and people should avoid making non-essential trips.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Security Bureau is calling on people to avoid non-essential travel to four districts of the country, while keeping the alert level at amber for other parts of Myanmar.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Residents who plan to visit south-eastern regions of Myanmar, including Myawaddy district, Hpapun district, Hpa-An district, and Kawkareik district should adjust their travel plans and avoid non-essential travel there," the government said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said for those who are already there, they should monitor the situation, exercise caution and attend to their personal safety.
  <br>
  <br>
  While officials said they have received reports that some Hong Kong people are also trapped in Cambodia, security officials have kept the alert level for the country at amber.
  <br>
  <br>
  They said they've updated the website with new information, to remind people to exercise caution and beware of overseas job scams.
  <br>
  <br>
  Security minister Chris Tang told a HOY TV programme on Friday that the alert was raised because it is now riskier for Hongkongers to be in those districts in Myanmar.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said there are currently no plans to raise the travel alert for Thailand -- where some victims had initially gone to before being taken to scam farms.

  China's blue-chip CSI300 Index also closed up 0.3 percent, while the Shanghai Composite Index gained 0.2 percent.

    Russia jails lawyers of late dissident Navalny

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Three lawyers who once represented the late Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny were jailed on Friday in Russia.
 <br>
  <br>
  Vadim Kobzev, Igor Sergunin and Alexei Liptser were jailed from 3.5 to five years by a court in the town of Petushki, about 100 kilometres east of Moscow.
  <br>
  <br>
  They were arrested in October 2023 on charges of involvement with extremist groups, as Navalny’s networks were deemed extremist by authorities.
  <br>
  <br>
  The case was widely seen as a way to increase pressure on the opposition to discourage defence lawyers from taking political cases.
  <br>
  <br>
  At the time, Navalny was serving a 19-year prison term on several criminal convictions, including extremism.
  <br>
  <br>
  He died in a Russian prison camp in February 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  Navalny, an anti-corruption campaigner and outspoken opponent of President Vladimir Putin, was arrested in 2021 upon his return from Germany, where he was recuperating from a nerve agent poisoning he blamed on the Kremlin.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was ordered to serve 2.5 years in prison.
  <br>
  <br>
  After two more trials, his sentence was extended to 19 years.
  <br>
  <br>
  He and his allies said the charges were politically motivated and accused the Kremlin of seeking to jail him for life.
  <br>
  <br>
  In December 2023, Navalny was moved from a penal colony in the Vladimir region east of Moscow to one above the Arctic Circle, where he died in February at the age of 47 under still-unexplained circumstances.
  <br>
  <br>
  His widow, Yulia Navalnaya, and members of his team alleged he was killed on orders from the Kremlin.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Russian government has rejected the accusation. (AP)

    HK to see more opportunity than challenges in 2025: FS

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Friday said Hong Kong would see more opportunities than challenges this year.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a forum organised by the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, Chan said the city's economy saw improvements in the past year in areas like innovation and technology, while attracting enterprises and investment.
  <br>
  <br>
  The finance chief said the economic performance of Asian countries was strong, which included China recording five percent GDP growth in 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said Hong Kong should continue to leverage its unique advantages, and reinforce its connectivity with both the mainland and the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  "While consolidating traditional markets in Europe and the United States that are closely connected to Hong Kong, we have to fully explore new markets and sources of capital at the same time," Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong not only acts as a bridge for the mainland and advanced economies like Western countries and the United States, but it also serves as a link for the mainland and Global South countries, including in the Middle East, Southeast Asia and Central Asia."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said Hong Kong's economy would still undergo a structural adjustment this year, and the United States' presidential handover would bring uncertainties to the market.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he stressed that the SAR would have a "better future" through reform and change.

    Former Pakistan PM Imran Khan jailed for 14 years

<img alt="Pakistan's former prime minister Imran Khan was jailed for 14 years in a case his party says is being used to pressure him into silence. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1788006_1_20250117160807.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A Pakistan court on Friday convicted former Pakistan prime minister Imran Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi in a landmark graft case, sentencing Khan to 14 years in prison.
 <br>
  <br>
  Khan has been held in custody since August 2023 charged with around 200 cases, but his party claim the latest conviction was being used to pressure him into silence.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I will neither make any deal nor seek any relief," Khan told reporters inside the court room after his conviction.
  <br>
  <br>
  The anti-graft court convened in the jail near the capital Islamabad where Khan is being held, and convicted him along with his wife over a welfare foundation they established together called the Al-Qadir Trust.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The prosecution has proven its case. Khan is convicted," said Judge Nasir Javed Rana, announcing a 14 year sentence for Khan and seven years for Bibi.
  <br>
  <br>
  Faith healer Bibi, who was recently released on bail, was arrested at the court after the conviction, her spokeswoman said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Khan maintains the cases are politically motivated and designed to keep him from returning to power.
  <br>
  <br>
  The sentence has been delayed several times over the past month, with analysts saying the jail term was being used to pressure Khan into accepting a deal with the military to step back from politics.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since being ousted from power in 2022, Khan has launched an unprecedented campaign in which he has openly criticised the country's powerful generals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Khan had previously been handed four convictions, two of which have been overturned while the sentences in the other two cases were suspended.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he remained in prison over pending cases.
  <br>
  <br>
  A UN panel of experts found last year that Khan's detention "had no legal basis and appears to have been intended to disqualify him from running for political office".
  <br>
  <br>
  Khan was barred from standing in February's election and his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party were hamstrung by a widespread crackdown.
  <br>
  <br>
  PTI won more seats than any other party in the poll, but a coalition of parties considered more pliable to the influence of the military establishment shut them out of power. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police say an 18-year-old woman has lost around HK$9.2 million after falling for a phone scam.
 <br>
  <br>
  Sources said on Friday that the mainland woman is a University of Hong Kong student. They also said police have put five suspects on their wanted list.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police said the woman received a call almost two months ago from somebody claiming to be a mainland law enforcement officer.
  <br>
  <br>
  She reported being told she was implicated in a money laundering investigation and had to repeatedly transfer money to another bank account as part of the probe.
  <br>
  <br>
  After the transfers were made, the scammers cut off contact, police said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The force has listed the case as obtaining property by deception, with no arrests made so far.

 A concern group representing scaffolding workers on Friday said they opposed the idea of stopping the use of bamboo scaffolding in construction.
 <br>
  <br>
  A scaffolding collapse at a construction site in Kai Tak injured 11 workers earlier this week, sparking conversations about completely replacing bamboo with metal scaffolding.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a press conference on Friday, the group said they believe the many incidents involving scaffolding were caused by poor site safety management, not the safety of bamboo scaffolding structures.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho Ping-tak, from the Hong Kong and Kowloon Bamboo Scaffolding Workers Union, noted that currently more than 80 percent of sites use bamboo scaffolding and thousands of workers would be affected if it were banned.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have to think about the sustainable development of bamboo scaffolding in the construction industry. If people insist on hindering our development, it could cost some 4,000 scaffolding workers their jobs, hurting the livelihood of some 4,000 households,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He urged the government and various stakeholders to join hands and come up with a long-term plan to improve construction procedures.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the Federation of Hong Kong and Kowloon Labour Unions called for more training for safety inspectors at construction sites.
  <br>
  <br>
  The federation said more than 16 percent of 310 respondents to a recent survey said they had been injured at least once in industrial accidents.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under current regulations, one safety supervisor should be appointed to every 20 workers at a construction site.
  <br>
  <br>
  But lawmaker Lam Chun-sing, who also chairs the federation, said many supervisors receive inadequate training and were not qualified to guide workers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "From our survey, many workers believe that there's nobody to supervise them and monitor them and tell them about their occupational health and safety issues,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The supervisor may be a general worker and they do not receive professional training and so in fact they cannot play the function of the safety supervisor... So we hope that the government can strengthen their professional training and also strengthen their role.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Reacting to the Kai Tak incident, Lam said it was not optimal that a serious accident occurred just months after the government published a revised safety code.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lam said other than enhanced inspections, the government should also consider whether sites can use other materials to replace bamboo scaffolding at construction sites.

 Fond memories of travels to the mainland are likely to come flooding back for visitors to the MTR's exhibition at Hung Hom as the Kowloon-Canton Railway Through Train pulls into the station again for the first time in years.
 <br>
  <br>
  Compartments from the doubler-decker KTT trains which ran to Dongguan and Guangzhou from 1998 to 2020 have been added to the Station Rail Voyage experiential gallery which is designed to give people a behind-the-scenes glimpse of railway operations, along with a trip down memory lane.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Through showcasing the KTT compartments at the Station Rail Voyage exhibition, we bring everyone back to the days of the through train platform at Hung Hom Station," MTR CEO Jason Kam said at an opening ceremony for the revamped exhibition.
  <br>
  <br>
  "These journeys bring back memories of visiting family, meeting friends or doing business."
  <br>
  <br>
  Secretary for Transport and Logistics Mable Chan said the exhibition has proved popular with locals and tourists alike, and is also a hotspot for social media influencers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said the success of the exhibition shows that Hong Kong should make use of heritage such as the MTR when designing attractions for tourists.
  <br>
  <br>
  The revamped exhibition will be open from January 23 until the end of the year. People can book a free visit via the MTR's website.
