    Hiring all year round boosts civil service recruitment

<div class="itemFullText">
 Civil Service Secretary Ingrid Yeung on Monday said a year-round recruitment drive is proving effective in tackling a manpower crunch across various departments.
 <br>
  <br>
  The government has been continuously recruiting for three admin roles since October last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a Legislative Council panel meeting, Yeung said this allows job offers to be made more quickly compared to the previous system of only receiving applications once every one or two years.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We have shortened the time required for approval from 10 months to four months, so there has been a tangible surge in the number of acceptances,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Because in the past, the period was too long, so successful candidates accepted other job offers. With the year-round recruitment process which has been put in place for some 13 months, we do see an increase in recruitment numbers.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeung also told lawmakers that 3,000 civil servants resigned in the 2023/24 period, a rate of 1.8 percent. She said this was a fall from previous years and was “a really low percentage” compared to the private sector.
  <br>
  <br>
  “In the private sector, according to statistics, the resignation rate stands at double-digit figures in most cases. So 1.8 percent is a really low figure. Forty percent of those resigning from the service have done so before the end of their probationary period,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “You could say that perhaps the candidate chosen hasn’t been the right one, and it’s a process for the candidates as well. For the new recruit, early on, if they know that their aspirations and expectations are not met, or if they find themselves unsuited for this post, then they should leave early instead of dragging on.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Election Committee lawmaker So Cheung-wing said that out of hundreds of thousands of applicants, only around 10,000 people had been recruited, questioning whether it was a matter of quality or whether the bureau is trying to control spending.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeung said it was because many of the applicants weren't up to scratch, adding that money is available to plug the gaps in manpower.

<div class="itemFullText">
 England blew away 10-man Republic of Ireland 5-0 to wrap up promotion to the Uefa Nations League top flight, as four players netted their first international goals on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Euro 2024 runners-up England secured top spot in Group B2 in interim boss Lee Carsley's final game in charge before the arrival of Thomas Tuchel as manager.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I wanted the England team to be exciting to watch and be attacking," Carsley said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I can only do what I was in control of," he added. "It's not a gamble with some of these players – they are excellent players."
  <br>
  <br>
  England struggled to break down a resolute Ireland in the first half at Wembley, with Noni Madueke twice having efforts blocked after threatening bursts into the box.
  <br>
  <br>
  The game changed shortly after the interval when Liam Scales brought down Jude Bellingham after a fine pass from Harry Kane, conceding a penalty and being sent off for a second bookable offence.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kane stepped up to slot his spot-kick past Ireland goalkeeper Caoimhin Kelleher.
  <br>
  <br>
  England doubled their lead in the 56th minute, as Tino Livramento's deflected cross found its way to his Newcastle teammate Anthony Gordon who volleyed home his first international goal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carsley's side scored their third goal in the space of five minutes when Conor Gallagher stabbed in a Marc Guehi flick-on from a corner to also net for the first time for his country.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jarrod Bowen joined the party, sweeping home his first England goal with his first touch just seconds after coming on as a substitute.
  <br>
  <br>
  Taylor Harwood-Bellis, on as a sub for his England debut, headed in Bellingham's cross in the 79th minute to round off the scoring. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Cleveland Cavaliers, playing without top scorer Donovan Mitchell, matched the second-best start to a season in NBA history on Sunday, reaching 15-0 with a 128-114 victory over Charlotte.
 <br>
  <br>
  Mitchell took the night off to rest after averaging 24.6 points, 4.4 rebounds and 4.1 assists for the Cavs during their perfect run.
  <br>
  <br>
  The host Cavaliers, however, made up for his absence with a balanced attack as Darius Garland had 25 points and 12 assists, Ty Jerome added 24 points, Evan Mobley scored 23 points and grabbed 11 rebounds and Jarrett Allen contributed 21 points and 15 rebounds.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We've always got some fight in us no matter what," Garland said. "Everybody is ready to play. It doesn't matter, one through 15."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Everybody contributed," he added. "Everybody had a huge part in this win – that's just us. Just as a team effort."
  <br>
  <br>
  Under new coach Kenny Atkinson, the Cavaliers had become the sixth team in NBA history to start 14-0.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beating the Hornets made them only the fourth team in NBA history to open 15-0, matching the 1948-49 Washington Capitols and 1993-94 Houston Rockets for the second-best start.
  <br>
  <br>
  They now trail only the record 24-0 start by the 2015-16 Golden State Warriors.
  <br>
  <br>
  The win streak is already the longest in the Cavaliers' 55-year history, eclipsing three 13-win runs when LeBron James was with Cleveland.
  <br>
  <br>
  Charlotte's LaMelo Ball had 31 points and 12 assists in a losing cause. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A non-governmental organisation says having a hearing impairment should not be an impediment to seeking mental health support.
 <br>
  <br>
  That is why Silence Limited, one of 11 Operation Santa Claus beneficiaries this year, has launched a project titled "Finding a Way to My Heart."
  <br>
  <br>
  The NGO's Operations Director, Ken Ng, said Silence Limited would provide sign language interpretation services via the project for people with hearing loss during their consultations at public hospitals.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Mental health issues [are] not easy to diagnose by equipment or machines. Basically, the psychiatrist or the doctors have to talk or communicate with the patients to find out what the real issue is," he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But many of our clients report that it is not easy to get an in-house sign language interpreter to attend the consultation," said Ng.
  <br>
  <br>
  Established in 2008, Silence Limited aims to bring people with hearing impairments together, promote social inclusion, and foster equal development.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our projects mainly focus on trying to fill up the gaps of existing services, how to improve the mental health situation of our clients. So we will provide or acquire sign language interpreters to participate in the medical consultation sections as well as the workshops or even the activities of our programme," Ng said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jointly organised by RTHK and South China Morning Post, OSC funds charitable projects that focus on children and youth, the elderly, the community, those with physical and mental disabilities, medical projects, and those concerning the environment.

    Biden makes historic visit to Amazon rainforest

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Joe Biden became the first sitting US president to visit the Amazon rainforest on Sunday, flagging the dangers of global warming often dismissed by President-elect Donald Trump, who has vowed to scrap measures to fight climate change.
 <br>
  <br>
  Biden flew from Lima, Peru, to Manaus, Brazil, the largest city in the Amazon, to meet with local leaders working to preserve the rainforest.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dressed casually in a blue shirt and pants, the 81-year-old chatted on the tarmac with local dignitaries before boarding a helicopter to fly over the rainforest.
  <br>
  <br>
  During the helicopter tour, Biden saw severe erosion, ships grounded in one of the Amazon River’s main tributaries and fire damage. He also passed over a wildlife refuge for endangered species of monkeys and birds and the expansive waters where the Negro River tributary flows into the Amazon. He was joined by Carlos Nobre, a Nobel Prize-winning scientist and expert on how climate change is harming the Amazon.
  <br>
  <br>
  Biden met indigenous leaders - introducing his daughter and granddaughter - and visited a museum at the gateway to the Amazon where indigenous women shook maracas as part of a welcoming ceremony. He then signed a US proclamation designating November 17 as International Conservation Day.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Amazon is home to indigenous communities and 10 per cent of Earth’s biodiversity. About two-thirds of the Amazon lies within Brazil. Scientists say its devastation poses a catastrophic threat to the planet.
  <br>
  <br>
  During brief remarks from the forest, Biden sought to highlight his commitment to the preservation of the region. He said the US was on track to reach US$11 billion in spending on international climate financing in 2024, a six-fold increase from when he started his term.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The fight to protect our planet is literally a fight for humanity,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Biden is making the Amazon visit as part of a six-day trip to South America, the first to the continent of his presidency. He traveled from Lima, Peru, where he took part in the annual Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit and met with President Xi Jinping. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Kansas City Chiefs, defending Super Bowl champions, suffered their first loss of the NFL season on Sunday, falling 30-21 to the Buffalo Bills after winning their first nine games.
 <br>
  <br>
  The result ends any talk of the Chiefs matching the 1972 Miami Dolphins team with a perfect, unbeaten season and was another reminder of the class of the Bills and their quarterback, Josh Allen.
  <br>
  <br>
  With the Bills leading 23-21, Allen secured the victory in stunning fashion with a 26-yard rush on fourth down and two, demonstrating not only his footwork and speed but also his strength as he broke two tackles to power into the end zone.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We had a man play, they dropped out into zone, they had something good for it," Allen said. "I'm just trying to make a play, help our team win a football game."
  <br>
  <br>
  "There are some things we want to clean up, some throws I wish I had back," he added. "But we're going into the bye week 9-2 – we'll take it. Knowing how things usually play out, we'll probably see this team again at some point."
  <br>
  <br>
  While the Bills have beaten Kansas City in each of the past four NFL seasons, the Chiefs have eliminated the Bills from the playoffs in three of the past four seasons.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Bills opened a 23-14 lead early in the fourth when Allen found Curtis Samuel with a 12-yard touchdown pass.
  <br>
  <br>
  Patrick Mahomes responded though, finding Noah Gray with a one-yard pass to make it a two-point game.
  <br>
  <br>
  Then came Allen's inspired touchdown run, which left Mahomes in need of one of his famous comebacks. But on fourth down, his pass intended for Travis Kelce was intercepted by Buffalo's Terrel Bernard. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping says he is looking forward to having an in-depth exchange of views with Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva on further enhancing China-Brazil relations.
 <br>
  <br>
  Xi made the remarks in a written statement upon his arrival in Rio de Janeiro for the 19th G20 Summit and a state visit to Brazil.
  <br>
  <br>
  The president arrived from Lima, where he had attended the Apec Leaders' meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  People from different walks of life lined the streets of Rio de Janeiro to welcome Xi, who arrived in the Brazilian city on Sunday afternoon, local time.
  <br>
  <br>
  The welcoming crowds were seen waving Chinese and Brazilian national flags and holding banners adorned with messages offering a warm welcome, as the Chinese leader's motorcade passed by.
  <br>
  <br>
  In his statement, President Xi noted that China and Brazil were marking 50 years since the establishment of diplomatic ties and it was important to build on past achievements while forging ahead.

  <br>
  <br>

  <br>
  <br>
  He said he looked forward to attending the 19th G20 Leaders' Summit and was ready to work with all parties to jointly advocate an equal and orderly multi-polar world and inclusive economic globalisation.
  <br>

 Quarterback Jared Goff threw for 412 yards and four touchdowns as the Detroit Lions crushed the struggling Jacksonville Jaguars 52-6.
 <br>
  <br>
  The NFC-leading Lions have won eight straight and nine of their first 10 games in a season for the first time since 1934.
  <br>
  <br>
  Detroit's winning margin of 46 points was the largest in franchise history, and it handed Jacksonville its biggest-ever defeat.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Lions also set a franchise record in total yards with 645, the third most in the NFL in the past 20 years – while allowing 170 by the Jaguars – a 475-yard margin that was the third largest in league history.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We felt like we could call anything,” Goff said. “Its quite the luxury to have in the NFL to take players out – ever."
  <br>
  <br>
  Running back David Montgomery rushed for two scores for the Lions and put up 75 yards on the ground in what became a rout.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Jacksonville defence was ineffective against on the ground and in the air, with Lions receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown scoring twice and putting up 161 yards receiving.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the Pittsburgh Steelers continued their domination of AFC North divisional rivals Baltimore Ravens, enjoying an 18-16 win on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Steelers survived a late Baltimore rally as they moved to 8-2 on the season, while the Ravens fall to 7-4 with what was their eighth loss in nine games against Pittsburgh.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pittsburgh managed the win without scoring a touchdown thanks to six field goals from placekicker Chris Boswell.
  <br>
  <br>
  Boswell's successful 50-yard kick late in the fourth quarter gave the Steelers an 18-10 lead, but Baltimore quarterback Lamar Jackson found Zay Flowers with a 16-yard pass in the end zone with just over a minute remaining.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jackson, however, was unable to make the two-point conversion attempt,  and the Steelers were able to close out the game. (AP/AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Britain knocked out defending Billie Jean King Cup champions Canada as singles wins for Emma Raducanu and Katie Boulter completed a 2-0 victory in Malaga on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Former US Open champion Raducanu powered through the first set of the opening rubber against Rebecca Marino and held off the Canadian in the second set to wrap up a 6-0, 7-5 win.
  <br>
  <br>
  Raducanu saved seven break points as Marino tried to force a third set, eventually earning a break of her own in the 11th game before closing out the match.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm really pleased with how I managed to step up on those big points, big moments," said the 58th-ranked Raducanu.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think I just need to keep reminding myself those clutch situations is where I really kind of thrive and I really enjoy them for the most part."
  <br>
  <br>
  World number 24 Boulter then brushed aside Leylah Fernandez 6-2, 6-4 to send Britain through to a semi-final against Slovakia.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm really happy with me level today," said Boulter, who produced another assured display after dropping only three games in her first-round match against Germany.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I just want to say, firstly, Emma makes it very easy to come out here and have a swing a 1-0 up, so full credit to her for starting us off well," she added. "Really proud of my performance today. I just wanted to come out here and really go at the defending champs."
  <br>
  <br>
  Britain will attempt to reach the final for the first time since 1981.
  <br>
  <br>
  Slovakia, the 2002 champions, overcame Australia 2-0 earlier in the day to make the last four of the competition for the first time in 11 years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Viktoria Hruncakova and Rebecca Sramkova both won their singles ties as Slovakia backed up their victory over the United States in the first round.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's another big country which we beat, and I'm so proud for the girls, for our team members, for our country – because we are a small country," said Slovakia captain Matej Liptak.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For us, it really means so much."
  <br>
  <br>
  World number 241 Hruncakova emerged victorious against Kimberly Birrell 7-5, 6-7 (4/7), 6-3 after over two-and-a-half hours on court to give the central European country the lead over Australia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sramkova then needed just over an hour to win 6-1, 6-2 against former world number 32 Ajla Tomljanovic, who injured her knee in the third game of the first set.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have nothing to lose. That's why I think we enjoy it so much. We are doing good, and hopefully we're going to keep doing that," said Hruncakova.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Monday, five-time Grand Slam winner Iga Swiatek will lead Poland as they take on world number four Jasmine Paolini's Italy in the other semi-final. (AFP)

    Korda wins LPGA Annika for seventh title of the season

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 World number one Nelly Korda captured her seventh LPGA title of the season and 15th career crown on Sunday, firing a three-under par 67 to win the Annika tournament.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 26-year-old American, playing her first event since being sidelined by a neck injury last month, reeled off five consecutive back-nine birdies to seize the crown by three strokes at Pelican Golf Club in Belleair, Florida.
  <br>
  <br>
  "After taking some time off with an injury it was great to be back out here," Korda said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There's nothing like being in the hunt," she added. "There's nothing like the adrenaline feeling going on the back nine, being in contention – I love it so much."
  <br>
  <br>
  South Korea's Im Jin-hee, China's Zhang Weiwei and England's Charley Hull shared second on 269 with Sweden's Linn Grant and American Rose Zhang sharing fifth on 270.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was Korda's third victory in the event after taking the 2021 and 2022 titles and made her the first player since Taiwan's Yani Tseng in 2011 to win seven tournaments in a season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Annika Sorenstam, the tournament namesake from Sweden, holds the record with 11 titles in the 2002 campaign.
  <br>
  <br>
  Korda is the first American player to win seven LPGA titles in a season since Beth Daniel in 1990 and four of Korda's victories, including Sunday's triumph, came when she trailed entering the final round.
  <br>
  <br>
  The victory ensured she will be a heavy favorite at next week's season-ending Tour Championship.
  <br>
  <br>
  Korda added to a 2024 LPGA trophy haul that began in January at the Drive On Championship in her hometown of Bradenton, Florida.
  <br>
  <br>
  It continued with wins at the Pak Se-ri Championship in Los Angeles, the Ford Championship and LPGA Match Play ahead of her second major title at the Chevron Championship and the Americas Open in May, her most recent victory until this week.
  <br>
  <br>
  The neck injury kept Korda from playing in October in Asia and she had not walked a full 18 holes in nearly two months until this week.
  <br>
  <br>
  Korda struggled early with a bogey at the second hole then sandwiched a birdie between bogeys at the sixth and eighth holes.
  <br>
  <br>
  But that only set the stage for Korda's run of birdies from the 11th through 15th holes, going from two adrift to secure the lead for good.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Not a lot of happy thoughts at the beginning," Korda said. "You should have felt the nerves I was feeling on the back nine." (AFP)

    Sinner defeats Fritz to claim first ATP Finals title

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Jannik Sinner won the ATP Finals on Sunday after beating Taylor Fritz 6-4, 6-4 to claim his first title at the season-ending event in Turin.
 <br>
  <br>
  Italian Sinner's triumph on home soil was the latest moment of glory in a near-perfect year in which the 23-year-old won eight tournaments, including his debut Grand Slam victories at the Australian and US Opens.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's amazing, it's my first title in Italy and it means so much to me," said Sinner.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's something very special. I just tried to understand what works best for each opponent, trying to play my best possible tennis – that was the key," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  World number one Sinner again swept Fritz aside in straight sets just as he did in the group stage and the US Open final in September, improving his record on hard courts this year to 50-3.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sinner is the first Italian to win the Finals, doing so days after becoming the first from his nation to top the ATP's end-of-year rankings.
  <br>
  <br>
  His Tour-leading 70th win of the season made him the first player since Ivan Lendl in 1986 to win the tournament without dropping a set.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I tried to make myself better than last year, to find the keys to win this final. I'm very happy to have handled this pressure and to share this success with the Italian crowd," said Sinner.
  <br>
  <br>
  The first set went in Sinner's favour after an enthralling seventh game which lasted nine minutes and was eventually won on the fourth break point.
  <br>
  <br>
  And despite Fritz's best efforts he couldn't fight back, failing to get a single break point in the second set and succumbing to his opponent's superiority.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fritz fell short in his bid to become the event's first American champion since Pete Sampras in 1999 but will rise to a career-best of fourth in the rankings Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With the good results, it's been a great week for me," said Fritz, beaten for the fourth time in five meetings with Sinner.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I want to congratulate Jannik and his team because he plays incredible tennis, really incredible," he went on to say.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sinner has reacted to losing last year's final to Novak Djokovic by displacing the Serbian great at the top of the game, winning 26 of his past 27 matches.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, he has been dogged by controversy after twice testing positive for traces of the steroid clostebol in March.
  <br>
  <br>
  A World Anti-Doping Agency appeal against his initial exoneration has been hanging over his head since September, when WADA announced it was seeking a ban of up to two years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sinner now heads to Malaga where he hopes to lead Italy to a successful defence of their Davis Cup title. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Observatory issued a T1 at 6.40am on Monday as Tropical Cyclone Man-yi moved towards the SAR, and warned that it might issue a higher signal later in the day or early on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  "The Standby Signal, No. 1 will remain in force at least until 6pm," said the weather forecaster in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The storm is forecast to come within 800 kilometres of the city around midnight on Monday, but is expected to weaken.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Observatory said the approach of Man-yi and the northeast monsoon would bring windy conditions on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Depending on the distance between Man-yi and the Pearl River Estuary, its degree of weakening and the change in local wind conditions, the Observatory will assess the need of issuing the Strong Wind Signal, No. 3 tonight to early tomorrow," the Observatory added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Observatory warned that some low-lying areas may see minor flooding in some areas because of the combined effect of the spring tide, the northeast monsoon and Man-yi, and urged the public to take care.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Rory McIlroy won the DP World Tour Championship for the third time and claimed his sixth Race to Dubai title in the process on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 35-year-old from Northern Ireland made a crucial birdie on the par-4 16th hole to break a deadlock with Denmark's Rasmus Hojgaard.
  <br>
  <br>
  He then birdied the par-5 18th hole for a three-under-par 69 that took him to 15-under for the four days and was enough for a two-shot win.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rasmus, who was trying to follow in the footsteps of his twin brother Nicolai and take the trophy back to Denmark for a second year in a row, made a stunning 22-footer par save on the 17th hole, but could not put the pressure on McIlroy on the 18th as he settled for a par and a final round score of 71.
  <br>
  <br>
  McIlroy, who started with a bogey and then made four successive birdies, dropped a couple of shots around the turn to be tied with Hojgaard after 15 holes at 13-under.
  <br>
  <br>
  He finally edged ahead with a stunning second shot on the par-4 16th hole from 137 yards to less than a foot for his fifth birdie of the day and drained a six-footer on the final hole.
  <br>
  <br>
  Including the Zurich Classic that the world number three claimed alongside Shane Lowry, it was McIlroy's fourth worldwide win of the season and secured him the Race to Dubai crown.
  <br>
  <br>
  Australia's Adam Scott and Ireland's Lowry shot final-round 68s to tie for third place at 11-under par alongside France's Antoine Rozner. England's Tyrrell Hatton was solo 6th at 10-under.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 10 players who earned their PGA Tour cards include Hojgaard, Thriston Lawrence of South Africa, England's Paul Waring, Dane Niklas Norgaard, Swede Jesper Svensson, Antoine Rozner of France, Italy's Matteo Manassero, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark, Japan's Rikuya Hoshino and Tom McKibbin of Northern Ireland.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Strikes by the Israeli military killed dozens in Gaza on Sunday, the civil defence said, while also hitting a Hezbollah stronghold near Beirut's international airport.
 <br>
  <br>
  Israel has been fighting on two fronts since September, intensifying attacks on Lebanon's Iran-backed Hezbollah after nearly a year of cross-border clashes alongside its war on Hamas in the Gaza Strip.
  <br>
  <br>
  A year after the Gaza war was triggered by Hamas's October 7 attacks on its south, Israel vowed to stop the Islamist militants from regrouping in the north of the Palestinian territory, launching a major assault there.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the latest violence in the besieged Palestinian territory, the civil defence agency said Israeli air raids killed at least 46 people.
  <br>
  <br>
  The deadliest strike, in the middle of the night in Beit Lahia in the north, killed 26 people, including women and children, and left at least 59 others buried under the rubble, said civil defence spokesman Mahmud Bassal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another strike killed 10 people in the Bureij refugee camp in central Gaza, where a separate strike on a house claimed the life of a woman, he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  An Israeli drone strike killed five people in the southern city of Rafah, Bassal said, adding another strike killed three women and a child in the Nuseirat camp.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamas-run Gaza's health ministry on Sunday said the overall death toll in more than 13 months of war had reached 43,846.
  <br>
  <br>
  The majority of the dead are civilians, according to ministry figures, which the United Nations considers reliable.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamas's October 7, 2023 attack that sparked the war resulted in the deaths of 1,206 people, mostly civilians, according to a tally of Israeli official figures.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Israel's second front in the north, TV footage showed several strikes hit Hezbollah's south Beirut stronghold, shortly after the Israeli military warned people to evacuate.
  <br>
  <br>
  Columns of smoke were seen rising over the capital's southern suburbs, where Lebanon's only international airport is located.
  <br>
  <br>
  Further south, overnight Israeli air strikes and shelling hit the flashpoint town of Khiam, the Lebanese state-run National News Agency reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  Following the bombardment, the Israeli army said about 20 projectiles were seen crossing from Lebanon into Israel, and that some of them were intercepted. Emergency services did not immediately report any casualties.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel has escalated its bombing of Lebanon since September 23 and has since sent in ground troops, following almost a year of limited, cross-border exchanges of fire begun by Hezbollah militants in support of Iran-backed Hamas in Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  Its military on Saturday said Hezbollah had already "paid a big price," but vowed to keep fighting until tens of thousands of Israelis displaced from the north can return home.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israeli forces also shelled the southern area of Lebanon along the Litani River, the NNA said on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The news agency had earlier reported strikes on the southern city of Tyre, including in a neighbourhood near Unesco-listed ancient ruins. Israel's military said late on Saturday it had hit Hezbollah sites in the area.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Lebanon's east, the health ministry said an Israeli strike in the Bekaa Valley killed six people including three children.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hezbollah said it fired a guided missile that set an Israeli tank ablaze in the southwestern Lebanese village of Chamaa.
  <br>
  <br>
  In eastern Lebanon, funerals were held for 14 civil defence staff killed in an Israeli strike on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They weren't involved with any (armed) party... they were just waiting to answer calls for help," said Ali al-Zein, a relative of one of the dead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lebanese authorities say more than 3,452 people have been killed since October last year, with most casualties recorded since September.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel announced the death of a soldier in southern Lebanon, bringing to 48 the number killed fighting Hezbollah.
  <br>
  <br>
  A UN-backed assessment on November 9 warned famine was imminent in northern Gaza, amid the increased hostilities and a near-halt in food aid.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel has pushed back against a Human Rights Watch report this week alleging that its mass displacement of Gazans amounts to a "crime against humanity," as well as findings from a UN Special Committee pointing to warfare practices "consistent with the characteristics of genocide."
  <br>
  <br>
  A foreign ministry spokesman dismissed the HRW report as "completely false", while the United States – Israel's main military supplier – said accusations of genocide "are certainly unfounded."
  <br>
  <br>
  In Israel, police said they arrested three suspects after flares shot near the home of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the central city of Caesarea, south of Haifa, while he was away.
  <br>
  <br>
  Demonstrators in Tel Aviv on Saturday reiterated demands that the government reach a deal to free dozens of hostages still held in Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  The protest came a week after mediator Qatar suspended its role until Hamas and Israel show "seriousness" in truce and hostage-release talks. (AFP)

    Russia pounds Ukraine with 'massive' attack

<img alt="A resident of Odesa salvages what he can after a Russian strike. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1779593_1_20241117213812.jpg&q=35">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Russia on Sunday pummelled Ukraine with a "massive" aerial barrage of missiles and drones, killing at least nine people across the country in the largest attack in months that Kyiv called "hellish."
 <br>
  <br>
  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Moscow launched 120 missiles and almost 100 drones, targeting Kyiv as well as southern, central and far-western corners of the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  Civilians were killed in the Mykolaiv, Lviv, Kherson, Dnipropetrovsk and Odesa regions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A hellish night," the spokesman for Ukraine's airforce Yuriy Ignat said on social media, saying Kyiv downed "144 targets."
  <br>
  <br>
  The strikes caused massive power cuts across the country, with fears of a precarious winter to come.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials in Kyiv called it one of the biggest attacks in the almost three-year-long Russian assault.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A massive attack on our country," Zelensky said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Over the past week, the aggressor used nearly 140 missiles of various types, more than 900 guided aerial bombs, and over 600 strike drones," he said, accusing Moscow of trying to "intimidate us with cold and blackouts."
  <br>
  <br>
  The attack came just two days after German Chancellor Olaf Scholz called Russian leader Vladimir Putin for the first time in almost two years.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is war criminal Putin's true response to all those who called and visited him recently," Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andriy Sybiga said after the attack.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We need peace through strength, not appeasement."
  <br>
  <br>
  Kyiv had slammed Scholz for calling Putin, as have many in Germany itself.
  <br>
  <br>
  But on Sunday, Scholz reaffirmed his country's support for Ukraine, saying that no decision on ending the war would be taken without Kyiv.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Ukraine can count on us" and "no decision will be taken behind Ukraine's back," the chancellor said at Berlin airport before flying off to a G20 meeting in Rio de Janeiro.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ukraine has been on the back foot militarily in eastern Ukraine, where Moscow's forces have made steady advances.
  <br>
  <br>
  The election of Donald Trump in the US has raised questions about the future of the conflict, with the Republican blazingly critical of US aid to Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  Witnesses heard explosions in the early morning in Kyiv and lose to Sloviansk in the Donetsk region.
  <br>
  <br>
  Moscow, meanwhile, said it had hit all its targets, claiming it had targeted an "essential energy infrastructure supporting the Ukrainian military-industrial complex."
  <br>
  <br>
  But civilian deaths were reported across Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials in Kherson said a 51-year-old woman was killed by a drone.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the southern Mykolaiv region, local leader Vitaliy Kim said two women were killed in a night attack and that seven people – including two children – were wounded.
  <br>
  <br>
  The death toll included two employees of the state railway company Ukrzaliznytsia in the city of Nikopol, who were killed when a depot was hit, the Dnipropetrovsk region's governor Sergiy Lysak and the operator said. Three more people were wounded in the bombing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two people were also killed in the Odesa region, where a teenager was wounded.
  <br>
  <br>
  Russian drones also made their way to Zakarpattia – a mountainous region rarely hit – with officials saying fragments fell in the village of Pavshyno, near the border with Hungary and Slovakia.
  <br>
  <br>
  The head of the Lviv region, Maksym Kozytsky, said a 66-year-old woman was killed in her car in the village of Sheptytsky – some 20 kilometres from the Polish border.
  <br>
  <br>
  That prompted Nato-member Poland to scramble fighter jets and mobilise all available forces on Sunday in response.
  <br>
  <br>
  Warsaw puts its armed forces on alert whenever attacks against its neighbouring country are deemed likely to create a danger for its own territory.
  <br>
  <br>
  Russia, meanwhile, said a man was killed by a Ukrainian drone in its border Belgorod region.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ukraine's energy operator DTEK on Sunday announced emergency power cuts in the Kyiv region and two regions in the east.
  <br>
  <br>
  Russia's relentless aerial bombardment has destroyed half of Ukraine's energy production capacity, President Volodymyr Zelensky has said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier, Ukraine's Energy Minister German Galushchenko said on Telegram that Russian forces were "attacking electricity generation and transmission facilities throughout Ukraine."
  <br>
  <br>
  With the harsh Ukrainian winter fast approaching, the country is already suffering from major energy shortfalls, while its outmanned and outgunned forces have been steadily ceding ground to the Kremlin's troops for weeks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kyiv has implored its Western allies for help to rebuild its energy grid – a hugely expensive undertaking – and to supply its outgunned forces with more aerial defence weapons.
  <br>
  <br>
  But many in Ukraine fear that Western help will not be as freely given following the imminent return of Trump to the White House in January. (AFP)

<img alt="Jorge Martin celebrates with the fans after a stunningly consistent season earned him the title. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1779590_1_20241117223710.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Spanish rider Jorge Martin claimed his first MotoGP world championship title after finishing third in the season-ending Barcelona GP on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Defending two-time champion Francesco Bagnaia, who started the race 19 points behind Martin, took the chequered flag for the 11th time this season but it was not enough to wrest the title from the Spaniard.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It sounds amazing," said an emotional Martin after being addressed as a world champion for the first time.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I don't know what to say, I am completely shocked.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is for my people, for my family, for the people who are supporting me, this is for them.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I started crying at the end, it was a very emotional race. It's been a long journey, a lot of crashes, big injuries but finally we are here.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I hope we can keep improving and enjoy the moment. This is the most important thing: live the present and enjoy the moment."
  <br>
  <br>
  Martin, who will be leaving his Ducati satellite team Pramac for Aprilia next season, had made himself the favourite for the title with a remarkably consistent season.
  <br>
  <br>
  He had only won three grand prix all season, but his third place on Sunday was the 32nd time this season across the 40 sprints and grand prix that he made the podium.
  <br>
  <br>
  After finishing third in Saturday's sprint he knew he had only to finish in the top nine to secure the title.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bagnaia, however, has finished the season in blistering form, his victory in Barcelona giving him his fourth win over the final five races of the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Starting from pole, the Italian made a perfect start but was soon under pressure from Marc Marquez who slipped past Martin.
  <br>
  <br>
  Martin let them battle it out up front, guarding his track position as Aleix Espargaro and Alex Marquez toughed it out behind him.
  <br>
  <br>
  When Martin crossed the line, the celebrations began in the Pramac garage and amongst the many Spanish fans who had made the journey to the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya.
  <br>
  <br>
  The race was due to take place in Valencia but had to be moved after the region suffered its worst floods in a generation which have killed more than 220 people.
  <br>
  <br>
  The race was switched to Barcelona and has been dubbed the Solidarity GP to show support for the people of Valencia, with all proceeds of the event going to the Valencia relief fund. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The 31st edition of the Apec Economic Leaders’ Week has wrapped up with host nation Peru saying it has furthered three objectives, including fostering inclusive and sustainable economic growth.
 <br>
  <br>
  The leaders also issued a joint declaration, calling for a concerted effort in tackling issues such as climate change.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to local and international press at the end of the week-long Apec meeting, Peruvian President Dina Boluarte said she was honoured to have hosted the leaders of the bloc’s 20 other economies.
  <br>
  <br>
  She also praised the professional work of her colleagues for the past year, saying it has reaped immense rewards.
  <br>
  <br>
  Those included the signing of a free trade agreement with Hong Kong, and updating the existing one with China, its biggest trading partner.
  <br>
  <br>
  Boluarte also reiterated three thematic priorities - trade and investment for inclusive and interconnected growth; innovation and digitalisation to promote transition to a formal economy; and sustainable growth for resilient development.
  <br>
  <br>
  Just before making her concluding remarks, the Peruvian leader and her counterparts got together one final time for the family photo, a longstanding tradition for the Apec summit.
  <br>
  <br>
  The session offers a chance for the host nation to showcase their traditional attire, but Peru decided to use the occasion to promote their textile products made of alpaca fibre.
  <br>
  <br>
  Each leader was given a vicuna wool scarf from a local luxury brand. The price tag? US$1,415.
  <br>
  <br>
  A few hours after the summit concluded, the customary Leaders’ Declaration was released.
  <br>
  <br>
  The goals were similar to those in past years, including tackling climate change, reforming the World Trade Organisation, and achieving food and energy security.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A drunk man on Sunday was killed by French police outside Paris after threatening officers and shouting "Allahu akbar," an Arabic expression often shouted by Islamist attackers.
 <br>
  <br>
  According to preliminary information, the man brandished what turned out to be a dummy gun, a source close to the case said. He was "very drunk," the source said.
  <br>
  <br>
  At around 6.00 am (0500 GMT), police were called to an incident which saw an armed man bang on a door in Villeneuve-Saint-Georges in the southeastern suburbs of Paris, one of the police sources said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The man threatened the police "by pointing a handgun and shouting 'Allahu akbar'," a Muslim expression of faith meaning "God is greatest," the source added.
  <br>
  <br>
  A police officer then drew his weapon and shot the man, who died despite the intervention of the emergency services, the source said.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to another police source, the officer fired his weapon three times, and the man was hit once. The entire incident was captured by the police body camera.
  <br>
  <br>
  The man, aged 30, committed an "apology for terrorism" in 2019, according to police sources.
  <br>
  <br>
  The case has been referred to the police's IGPN internal affairs department, which is a standard procedure.
  <br>
  <br>
  The police officer who shot the man tested negative for drugs and alcohol. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Super Typhoon Man-yi slammed into the Philippines' most populous island on Sunday, with the national weather service warning of flooding, landslides and huge waves as the storm sweeps across the archipelago nation.
 <br>
  <br>
  Man-yi was still packing maximum sustained winds of 185 kilometres per hour after making its first landfall late on Saturday on lightly populated Catanduanes island.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 1.2 million people fled their homes ahead of Man-yi as the weather forecaster warned of a "life-threatening" impact from the powerful storm, which follows an unusual streak of violent weather.
  <br>
  <br>
  Man-yi uprooted trees, brought down power lines and smashed flimsy houses to pieces after hitting Catanduanes in the typhoon-prone Bicol region.
  <br>
  <br>
  No deaths have been reported, but there was "extensive" damage to structures on Catanduanes, civil defence chief Ariel Nepomuceno said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Man-yi remained a super typhoon as it hit heavily populated Luzon – the country's economic engine – forecasters said, warning of a "potentially dangerous" situation in Aurora province.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Significant weakening" was expected as it traversed the mountainous island, the weather service said.
  <br>
  <br>
  But it said severe flooding and landslides were expected as Man-yi dumped "intense to torrential" rain over provinces in its path.
  <br>
  <br>
  Forecasters also warned storm surges of up to more than three metres could swamp vulnerable coastal communities, including in Manila.
  <br>
  <br>
  Panganiban municipality in the northeast of Catanduanes took a direct hit from Man-yi.
  <br>
  <br>
  Photos and a drone video shared on the Facebook page of Mayor Cesar Robles showed fallen power lines, damaged and destroyed buildings, and trees and corrugated iron sheets strewn on the roads.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Pepito was so strong, I have never experienced a typhoon this strong," Robles said in a post, using the local name for Man-yi, as clean-up efforts got underway and people returned home.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is still a bit unsafe, there are still bursts of wind and there is much debris."
  <br>
  <br>
  Mother-of-three Marissa Cueva Alejandro, 36, who grew up in Catanduanes and sheltered with a relative during Man-yi, said typhoons were getting stronger.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Before, we would only experience (typhoon) signal number three to four, but now typhoons are getting as strong as signal number five," she said, referring to the weather service's five-tiered wind warning system.
  <br>
  <br>
  Man-yi is the sixth storm in the past month to batter the archipelago nation. At least 163 people died in the previous storms, that also left thousands homeless and wiped out crops and livestock.
  <br>
  <br>
  Climate change is increasing the intensity of storms, leading to heavier rains, flash floods and stronger gusts.
  <br>
  <br>
  About 20 big storms and typhoons hit the Southeast Asian nation or its surrounding waters each year, killing scores of people, but it is rare for multiple such weather events to take place in a small window.
  <br>
  <br>
  The weather forecaster has hoisted its highest and second-highest typhoon signals over a wide band of provinces stretching from Luzon's east coast, where Man-yi made its second landfall, across to the western side of the island where it will exit.
  <br>
  <br>
  Around 2,000 people were in emergency evacuation shelters in Dipaculao municipality in Aurora province.
  <br>
  <br>
  Others have stayed home to protect their property and livestock, or because they were sceptical of the warnings, said Geofry Parrocha, communications officer of Dipaculao disaster agency.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Some of our countrymen are really hard-headed. They do not believe us until the typhoon arrives," Parrocha said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tourists emptied out of coastal resorts ahead of the typhoon.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our facilities are deserted," said Irene Padeo, reservation officer of the L'Sirene Boutique Resort in Baler town in Aurora, as Man-yi neared.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our outdoor items have all been packed and taken indoors. We tied down all the rest."
  <br>
  <br>
  On its current trajectory, Man-yi will cross north of Manila and sweep over the South China Sea on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Man-yi hit the Philippines late in the typhoon season – most cyclones develop between July and October.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier this month, four storms were clustered simultaneously in the Pacific basin, which the Japan Meteorological Agency said was the first time such an occurrence had been observed in November since its records began in 1951. (AFP)

 The Hong Kong Observatory says it will issue a T1 between 6am and 9am on Monday as Tropical Cyclone Man-yi moves towards the territory.
 <br>
  <br>
  The storm is forecast to come within 800 kilometres of the city around midnight tonight, but is expected to weaken.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, windy conditions are likely by Tuesday, the observatory said, warning that some low-lying areas may see flooding.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There will be a spring tide in the next couple of days. The sea level will be particularly high during the high tide overnight. Under the combined effect of the northeast monsoon and Man-yi, the sea level will generally be about a further 0.3 metres above the spring tide at night on Monday and Tuesday. Minor flooding may occur in individual low-lying areas. Members of the public please take appropriate precautions," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The observatory added that depending on the storm's intensity and distance from the city, it may issue a higher warning signal on Monday night or early Tuesday.

    'Carer hotline should have emergency response team'

<img alt="SoCo urges the government to set up a team offering emergency services under its 24-hour hotline for carers. Photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1779566_1_20241117152725.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A hotline offering assistance to caregivers is failing to address the urgent needs of some callers and a special team is needed to provide emergency support, a community group says.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 182 183 hotline launched last year is staffed 24 hours a day and the government says it offers strong support to callers with a range of enquiries, including those who want counselling or details of community services.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the Society for Community Organisation (SoCo) on Sunday said a joint study with Lingnan University's Asia-Pacific Institute of Ageing Studies (APIAS) has shed light on the difficult situation many carers find themselves in.
  <br>
  <br>
  A survey carried out between March and June this year found that on average, those being looked after suffered from two chronic illnesses – as did the carers themselves.
  <br>
  <br>
  Professor Dickson Chan, the director of APIAS, said the hotline isn't enough to address the needs of some carers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They [hotline staff] may give them another phone number and ask them to call another organisation. This means that actually they cannot receive concrete and immediate support through the hotline," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our proposal is maybe the government can consider setting up a special team and the special team is attached to the hotline. So when the older people are in urgent need... the hotline can maybe pass the needs to a special team and after a brief assessment, the team can offer immediate support services for the older people."
  <br>
  <br>
  SoCo meanwhile called for the government to relax eligibility requirements so more people can get financial support under the Scheme on Living Allowance for Carers of Elderly Persons from Low-income Families.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Plumbers, electricians and specialised construction workers will be among those first invited to Hong Kong under the SAR's next scheme to bring in employees from elsewhere, the government said on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Officials say Hong Kong faces a shortfall of around 180,000 workers by 2028, but plans are already afoot to bring in 30,000 skilled technicians over three years under a new scheme starting in 2025.
  <br>
  <br>
  Labour Secretary Chris Sun told TVB that the administration will first focus on finding new blood for sectors facing the worst manpower crunches.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said their visas will tie them to the occupation they are in when they first move to the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There will surely be special arrangements for these visas, meaning that before they become Hongkongers, they will be required to stay in the job where we had a shortage. This is very clear," the minister said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But after seven years when they obtain permanent residency, you can't have so many requirements. We surely cannot lock workers down to a particular job forever."
  <br>
  <br>
  The labour chief said he believes the workers concerned will mostly choose to stay in their profession after becoming a permanent resident.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also stressed that the government remains committed to encouraging locals into work, adding that subsidies for those re-joining the workforce will remain in place.

    Thousands join 10km races on airport's third runway

<div class="itemFullText">
 Some 12,000 people on Sunday took part in special races on the airport's third runway to celebrate its opening later this month.
 <br>
  <br>
  The other two runways at Chek Lap Kok remained in use as the 10-kilometre events took place, with Hong Kong long-distance runner Virginia Lo among those on the tarmac as planes went up and down nearby.
  <br>
  <br>
  The elite athlete sponsored by the Sports Institute was the first to the finish line among local runners and she said the time was her personal best.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's quite extraordinary. Because when I was running, there was really an aeroplane next to me. Of course it wasn't very close, but when you run, when you see a plane nearby you feel very excited," Lo said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I don't think the weather affected the race much. Luckily the sun wasn't shining, this is good for runners. Also when we started, the rain had stopped. So I find the weather quite acceptable."
  <br>
  <br>
  World-renowned actor Chow Yun-fat also took part in one of the races, and he was happy with the experience.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's very....very special. You can see planes on both sides, taking off and landing, taking off and landing," he told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I was concerned I couldn't run. If it was raining heavily, I wouldn't have taken part. But when I arrived, it stopped. And when we were actually running, the wind was quite good."

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan said on Sunday that a cross-border investment programme linking Shanghai, Shenzhen and Hong Kong has boosted the SAR's attractiveness in global markets.
 <br>
  <br>
  Writing on his weekly blog, Chan said the number of eligible stocks now stands at more than 3,300 – up from about 800 when Stock Connect was launched 10 years ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said daily transactions by mainland investors buying local stocks average about HK$38 billion, or almost 17 percent of total turnover.
  <br>
  <br>
  For overseas investors buying and selling mainland stocks through Hong Kong, the average daily amount is 123 billion renminbi, or 6.7 percent of turnover.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the local stock market has a total market value of HK$35 trillion, which is a 40 percent increase from 10 years ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Chan said the government is fostering links with the Global South and aims to attract high quality companies to list in the city and roll out cross-border investment products.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said this will allow Hong Kong to better make use of its function as a testing ground for the internationalisation of the renminbi.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that the third Global Financial Leaders' Investment Summit to be held this week will involve a few hundred senior members of staff from international financial institutions, and will allow participants to get an accurate understanding of the mainland's economic development and the financial opportunities it offers.

    Peru trade pact set to take effect in six months: CE

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee says Hong Kong's new free trade agreement with Peru will take effect in about six months or so, as he urged SAR businesses to “understand and appreciate” the pact and join the government’s efforts to explore opportunities in emerging markets.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to the media at the conclusion of his trip to Lima, Lee said that as well as attending the Apec summit, the Hong Kong delegation achieved three key results, the first of which was demonstrating the city’s commitment to promoting regional economic and trade cooperation.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Second, we explored new growth areas for Hong Kong and explored market opportunities in South America,” he continued, citing the pact with Peru.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the agreement will open new doors for businesses, adding that he is confident Hong Kong people can get around the language barrier.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Hong Kong people have been doing business with different parts of the world, including the Middle East, including countries such as Korea and Japan. So obviously, language is an issue, but it's not a barrier,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I believe in the businessmen’s versatility and adaptability.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee said the government will lead promotional efforts so that the city’s businesses can better understand the Peruvian market.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another way to fast-track exchanges between the two sides, Lee said, is to establish chambers of commerce and he has already made this pitch to Peruvian officials.
  <br>
  <br>
  The third and final achievement in Lima, the chief executive went on to say, was enhancing relations with members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean).

  <br>
  He noted that he held bilateral meetings with leaders of Malaysia, Vietnam and Singapore, and said there are plans to increase direct flights between Hong Kong and several Asean destinations.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CE had two informal exchanges in Lima with Xi Jinping and Lee expressed gratitude to the president for his "care and guidance"
  <br>
  <br>
  “President Xi has always been caring about Hong Kong. I have reported to him Hong Kong's situation regarding the economy and development. He is well-versed of our development and has given me encouragement,” Lee said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Fly-half Thomas Ramos kicked 15 points to help France beat New Zealand 30-29 in a thrilling Test clash in Paris on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Romain Buros, Paul Boudehent and Louis Bielle-Biarrey were the hosts' try-scorers as they claimed a third-straight win over the All Blacks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Peter Lakai and Cam Roigard crossed for New Zealand before Damian McKenzie's contributions with the boot set-up a nervy last half an hour.
  <br>
  <br>
  France head coach Fabien Galthie recalled experienced centre Gael Fickou to the starting lineup in one of four changes from last Saturday's easy win over Japan.
  <br>
  <br>
  New Zealand boss Scott Robertson welcomed back fly-half Beauden Barrett and hooker Codie Taylor after the influential pair missed last week's win over Ireland with injuries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Before the game New Zealand captain Scott Barrett said his side lost the scrum battle with the French in their World Cup defeat 13 months ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Saturday, the set-piece proved crucial in the opening score as the visitors were penalised and Les Bleus led 3-0 after seven minutes thanks to a Ramos shot at goal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Robertson's outfit reacted almost immediately to make it 7-3 as Lakai, a second-minute replacement, crashed over for his maiden Test try and Beauden Barrett slotted the extras after nine minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The All Blacks had the upper hand after the opening quarter, profiting from a poor France lineout.
  <br>
  <br>
  Their dominance paid off even further after half an hour as scrum-half Roigard celebrated his 24th birthday by intercepting a pass destined for opposite number Antoine Dupont after a scrum to stroll over.
  <br>
  <br>
  With seven minutes of the first-half to play, France cut the score to 14-10 as full-back Buros crossed on his Test debut.
  <br>
  <br>
  By the interval, New Zealand led 17-10 as Beauden Barrett added a penalty to his earlier two conversions with the visitors in control.
  <br>
  <br>
  After the break, the tight one-pass play paid off for the hosts as they trundled up the field before flanker Boudehent found a way over from a rolling maul.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ramos kicked the conversion to bring the sides level at 17-17.
  <br>
  <br>
  Galthie had picked an extra forward on the bench by dropping fly-half Matthieu Jalibert from the matchday squad and after 47 minutes brought on four of them at once.
  <br>
  <br>
  Three minutes later, it bore fruit, as France led for the first time in the game.
  <br>
  <br>
  Winger Bielle-Biarrey dotted down after a Ramos grubber kick and with the Toulouse playmaker's extras they were 24-17 up.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite the try, the game was far from over and with 17 minutes to go McKenzie kicked two penalties either side of a Ramos effort to make it 27-23.
  <br>
  <br>
  McKenzie added a third penalty for 27-26 with 13 minutes to go and a tense final 10 minutes was set-up as Ramos and McKenzie once again traded shots at goal.
  <br>
  <br>
  The All Blacks were camped in their own territory but their attack was held up and referee Nika Amashukeli blew the full-time whistle to send the majority of the 80,000-capacity crowd delirious. (AFP)

 President Xi Jinping vowed on Saturday vowed to work with the incoming US administration of President-elect Donald Trump as he held his final talks with outgoing President Joe Biden.
 <br>
  <br>
  Biden met Xi for about two hours at a hotel where the Chinese leader was staying, on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Lima, Peru, for their first talks in seven months.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China's goal of a stable, healthy and sustainable China-US relationship remains unchanged," following the election, Xi said, acknowledging "ups and downs" between the countries. "China is ready to work with the new US administration to maintain communication, expand cooperation and manage differences."
  <br>
  <br>
  Biden told Xi that the two leaders haven't always agreed but their discussions have been "frank" and "candid."
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi also said the two countries' relationship would make "considerable progress" when both nations "treat each other as partner and friend, seek common ground while shelving differences and help each other succeed, according to a simultaneous translation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But if we take each other as rivals or adversary, pursue vicious competition, and seek to hurt each other, we would roil the relationship or even set it back," Xi said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The talks come two months before Trump assumes office. (Reuters)

<img alt="The New York Times has reported that Elon Musk met earlier this week with Iran's ambassador to the UN, Amir Saeid Iravani. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1779495_1_20241116195555.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Iran's foreign ministry spokesman on Saturday "categorically" denied The New York Times report on Tehran's ambassador to the United Nations meeting with US tech billionaire Elon Musk, state media reported.
 <br>
  <br>
  In an interview with state news agency IRNA, spokesman Esmaeil Baghaei was reported as "categorically denying such a meeting" and expressing "surprise at the coverage of the American media in this regard."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Times reported on Friday that Musk, who is a close ally of President-elect Donald Trump, met earlier this week with Iran's ambassador to the UN, Amir Saeid Iravani.
  <br>
  <br>
  It cited anonymous Iranian sources describing the encounter as "positive."
  <br>
  <br>
  Iranian newspapers, particularly those aligned with the reformist party that supports President Masoud Pezeshkian, largely described the meeting in positive terms before Baghaei's statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the weeks leading up to Trump's re-election, Iranian officials have signalled a willingness to resolve issues with the West.
  <br>
  <br>
  Iran and the United States cut diplomatic ties shortly after the 1979 Islamic revolution that toppled the US-backed shah of Iran, Mohammed Reza Pahlavi.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since then, both countries have communicated through the Swiss embassy in Tehran and the Sultanate of Oman. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 An Indian state riven by months of ethnic tensions imposed an internet shutdown and curfew on Saturday after angry protests over the recovery of six bodies of people believed to have been kidnapped by insurgents.
 <br>
  <br>
  Manipur in India's northeast has been rocked by periodic clashes for more than 18 months between the predominantly Hindu Meitei majority and the mainly Christian Kuki community, dividing the state into ethnic enclaves.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bodies were suspected to be of those belonging to the Meitei community who went missing in Jiribam district after a gunfight between Kuki insurgents and Manipur police last week.
  <br>
  <br>
  Three bodies were pulled from a river in Jiribam on Friday while three more were found on Saturday, local media reports said.
  <br>
  <br>
  News of the discovery provoked incensed mobs to attack the homes of seven local politicians, but only minor damage had been recorded.
  <br>
  <br>
  Protesters also burned tyres and blocked roads in the capital city of Imphal on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Manipur government announced a curfew was in effect in part of the city due to the "developing law and order situation."
  <br>
  <br>
  The state's home ministry also ordered all internet and mobile data services in Manipur to be shut off for two days in order to bring the latest unrest under control.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Anti-social elements might use social media extensively for transmission of images, hate speech and hate video messages inciting the passions of the public which might have serious repercussions for the law and order situation," a notice said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Internet services were shut down for months in Manipur last year during an outbreak of violence which displaced around 60,000 people from their homes, according to government figures.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thousands of the state's residents are living in emergency shelters, still unable to return home due to ongoing tensions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Long-standing tensions between the Meitei and Kuki communities revolve around competition for land and public jobs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rights activists have accused local leaders of exacerbating ethnic divisions for political gain. (AFP)

 The guitar described by Noel Gallagher as "the best in the world," which he played on the third Oasis album "Be Here Now," sold at auction on Saturday for £226,800 (US$286,000).
 <br>
  <br>
  The custom Silver Sparkle Gibson Les Paul Florentine guitar that starred on the 1997 album was one of Gallagher's primary guitars during the height of Oasis's fame.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was made for him at Gibson's custom shop and appeared in performances on The David Letterman Show and Saturday Night Live.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's not one of the best guitars. It's the best guitar," Gallagher said of the instrument in a 1997 interview with Spin magazine.
  <br>
  <br>
  The guitar was sold in a sale of entertainment memorabilia by online auction group Propstore. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Militants stormed a paramilitary checkpoint in southwestern Pakistan on Saturday, killing seven troops, the latest in a string of attacks by separatist insurgents, police said.
 <br>
  <br>
  The early-morning attack in the mountainous Kalat district, some 150 km south of Quetta, capital of the southwestern Balochistan province, continued for several hours, said police officer Habib-ur-Rehman.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another 18 wounded paramilitary soldiers, some in critical condition, were admitted to local hospitals, he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif condemned the attack.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separatist militant group the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) claimed that its fighters had attacked the checkpoint.
  <br>
  <br>
  The group has stepped up its operations recently, claiming a suicide bombing last week that targeted Pakistani army troops at a railway station minutes before they were due to board a train to return home for vacations. It killed 27, including 19 soldiers, who were in civilian clothing.
  <br>
  <br>
  The BLA and several other militant groups have been fighting for decades for a separate homeland to gain a greater share of the mineral and resource-rich Balochistan province, which borders Afghanistan and Iran. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Saturday he would like to end the war with Russia next year through "diplomatic means."
 <br>
  <br>
  He spoke a day after saying he expected the conflict to end sooner than it would otherwise have done, once Donald Trump takes office in the United States next year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For our part, we must do everything we can to ensure that this war ends next year. We have to end it by diplomatic means," Zelensky said in an interview with Ukrainian radio. "And this, I think, is very important."
  <br>
  <br>
  There have been no meaningful talks between Russia and Ukraine, but a Trump presidency raises questions about the future of the conflict, with the Republican repeatedly saying he would end the war swiftly.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have to understand what the Russians want," Zelensky said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Referring to Ukraine, he said: "You are at war with a state that does not value its people, that has a lot of equipment, that does not care how many people die."
  <br>
  <br>
  Russian President Vladimir Putin has said he will only accept talks with Ukraine if Kyiv surrenders Ukrainian territory that Moscow occupies.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Kremlin said he repeated that demand in a phone conversation with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zelensky has rejected Putin's conditions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Moscow has made steady advances in eastern Ukraine since this summer, inching closer to key hubs such as Pokrovsk and Kurakhove.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zelensky said on Saturday that Russian forces were suffering heavy losses and that the adance had "slowed down" in some areas. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 One of Donald Trump's most controversial cabinet picks just became even more so: Pete Hegseth, tapped for defence secretary earlier this week, was accused of sexual assault in 2017, according to police.
 <br>
  <br>
  No charges were filed in the case, but shocked Trump transition team officials are nonetheless reportedly weighing the next steps for the Fox News host, whose nomination took many in Washington by surprise.
  <br>
  <br>
  President-elect Trump nominated the 44-year-old National Guard veteran on Tuesday to run the world's most powerful military, despite having never managed a large organisation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police in Monterey, California confirmed on Thursday that they had investigated "an alleged sexual assault" at a hotel involving Hegseth that included bruising to the victim's right thigh, in early October 2017.
  <br>
  <br>
  News of the woman's accusations caught the Trump team off guard, according to Vanity Fair, which first reported the story.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hegseth's lawyer Timothy Parlatore told the publication that the allegation "was already investigated by the Monterey police department and they found no evidence for it."
  <br>
  <br>
  And Trump's communications director Steven Cheung said that Hegseth "has vigorously denied any and all accusations, and no charges were filed.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We look forward to his confirmation as United States Secretary of Defence so he can get started on Day One to Make America Safe and Great Again," Cheung said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hegseth's hearing in the Senate is likely to be among the more fraught, not only due to his lack of experience but also other controversies, such as his lobbying of Trump during his first term to pardon service members accused of war crimes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hegseth joined Fox News as a contributor in 2014 and now co-hosts "Fox and Friends Weekend" and serves as a host for "Fox Nation."
  <br>
  <br>
  He additionally served as an infantry officer in the National Guard, deploying to Iraq and Afghanistan.
  <br>
  <br>
  The accusations against Hegseth come as Trump's pick for attorney general, far-right former congressman Matt Gaetz, stunned many following his lengthy embroilment in sexual misconduct allegations.
  <br>
  <br>
  And Trump himself was convicted of financial wrongdoing for covering up payments to a former porn star and found liable for defaming and sexually abusing an author.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hegseth has been married three times, divorcing his first wife in 2009 following an "irretrievable breakdown" and "infidelity," according to the Washington Post.
  <br>
  <br>
  His second wife filed for divorce in September 2017, one month after he had a baby with a Fox News producer whom he subsequently married, according to US media. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Kai Tak Sports Park on Saturday hosted an international rugby match in gloomy weather as another trial event to test the site's smaller outdoor venue, with more signage and faster security checks.
 <br>
  <br>
  The match between Hong Kong and Brazil kicked off at around 4 pm at the Kai Tak Youth Sports Ground.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was the second test event at the 5,000-seat venue, which hosted a local football league game last month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Around 2,500 people turned up to the sports ground in the end, according to the government, fewer than the previous estimate of 3,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  The rugby match, which ended in pouring rain, saw the SAR team claim a 38-17 victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials including sports minister Kevin Yeung and security chief Chris Tang were spotted at the stadium, with the latter saying authorities have made improvements since the previous trial event.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have doubled the number of security screening counters, and set up fast lanes for those who did not bring any bags," Tang told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeung said after the match that the event went more smoothly than the first trial, and that the government would continue to put the sports ground to the test.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will continue to hold a series of trial events and drills until the venue's official opening in the first quarter of next year... Next Saturday, we will conduct a stress test with 5,000 people," Yeung said, adding that more details would be unveiled in the coming week.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chris Brooke, chairman of Hong Kong, China Rugby, hailed the test run's success.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's been a great opportunity for our team to come to operate an event here, in advance of the Hong Kong Sevens next March. As we build up towards the Sevens, it's been a great experience and a very good opportunity for our rugby community to come to the venue to experience the Kai Tak Sports Park, and to see what a great venue it is," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Spectators must purchase their tickets online prior to the event, and they were not allowed to bring in long umbrellas or any food and drink.
  <br>
  <br>
  But a spectator surnamed Mak said the rule was too strict.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A drawback is that we are not allowed to bring our water bottles into the venue. I wish they could be more lenient and let us bring our own water," she told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  For rugby-lover Derek, the cloudy weather posed a bit of a problem.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's quite convenient to get from the MTR station to the venue, but it's troublesome to have to carry an umbrella on rainy days," he said. "I would suggest adding some covers for walkways... My feet were completely soaked."
  <br>
  <br>
  The sports park's indoor stadium is to host a basketball match on December 7, while the first trial run at the main stadium is scheduled for January next year.

    UN climate chief urges G20 to push for COP29 deal

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The UN's climate chief urged G20 nations on Saturday to push COP29 negotiations towards a deal to raise money for developing nations, warning there was a "long way to go."
 <br>
  <br>
  Negotiators worked through the night to narrow their differences at the UN talks in Baku before ministers arrive next week for the final days of the summit, but major differences remain.
  <br>
  <br>
  UN climate chief Simon Stiell appealed for leaders of the Group of 20 nations, which includes the world's biggest economies and top polluters, to weigh in when they meet in Brazil on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As G20 Leaders head to Rio de Janeiro, the world is watching and expecting strong signals that climate action is core business for the world's biggest economies," Stiell said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some developing countries, which are least responsible for global greenhouse gas emissions, want an annual commitment of US$1.3 trillion to help them adapt to climate impact and transition to clean energy.
  <br>
  <br>
  The figure is over 10 times what donors including the United States, the European Union and Japan currently pay.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the negotiations are stuck over a final figure, the type of financing and who should pay, with developed countries wanting China and wealthy Gulf states to join the list of donors.
  <br>
  <br>
  The latest draft deal was 25 pages long, and still contained a raft of options.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Here in Baku negotiators are working around the clock on a new climate finance goal," Stiell said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There is a long way to go, but everyone is very aware of the stakes, at the halfway point in the COP," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Climate finance progress outside of our process is equally crucial, and the G20's role is mission-critical." (AFP)

    Philippines braces for impact of Super Typhoon Man-yi

<img alt="Man-yi will be the sixth major storm to batter the Philippines in the past month. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1779477_1_20241116162508.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A super typhoon sweeping towards the Philippines on Saturday was intensifying and could have a "potentially catastrophic" impact, the state weather forecaster warned, with millions of people at risk from storm surges.
 <br>
  <br>
  More than 650,000 people have fled their homes ahead of Super Typhoon Man-yi, which is expected to make landfall later on Saturday or early on Sunday, becoming the sixth major storm to pummel the archipelago nation in the past month.
  <br>
  <br>
  With wind gusts of up to 240 kilometres per hour, Man-yi was on track to slam into the sparsely populated island province of Catanduanes as a super typhoon or "near peak intensity", the weather service warned.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Potentially catastrophic and life-threatening situation looms for northeastern Bicol region as Super Typhoon 'Pepito' further intensifies," the forecaster said in its latest update, using the local name for the storm and referring to the southern part of the main island of Luzon.
  <br>
  <br>
  Up to 14-metre high seas were expected around Catanduanes, while more than 7.6 million people were at risk from storm surges of one to three metres, the forecaster said.
  <br>
  <br>
  At least 163 people died in the five storms that pounded the Philippines in recent weeks that also left thousands homeless and wiped out crops and livestock.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government urged people on Saturday to heed warnings to flee to safety.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If preemptive evacuation is required, let us do so and not wait for the hour of peril before evacuating or seeking help, because if we did that we would be putting in danger not only our lives but also those of our rescuers," Interior Undersecretary Marlo Iringan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Albay province, Legazpi City grocer Myrna Perea was sheltering with her fruit vendor husband and their three children in a school classroom with nine other families after they were ordered to leave their shanty.
  <br>
  <br>
  Conditions were hot and cramped – the family spent Friday night sleeping together on a mat under the classroom's single ceiling fan – but Perea said it was better to be safe.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think our house will be wrecked when we get back because it's made of light materials – just two gusts are required to knock it down," said Perea.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That's why we evacuated. Even if the house is destroyed, the important thing is we do not lose a family member."
  <br>
  <br>
  Scientists have warned climate change is increasing the intensity of storms, leading to heavier rains, flash floods and stronger gusts.
  <br>
  <br>
  About 20 big storms and typhoons hit the Southeast Asian nation or its surrounding waters each year, killing scores of people, but it is rare for multiple such weather events to take place in a small window.
  <br>
  <br>
  Evacuation centres were filling up on Catanduanes island in the typhoon-prone Bicol region, with the weather forecaster warning of "widespread incidents of severe flooding and landslides."
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 400 people were squeezed into the provincial government building in the capital Virac, with new arrivals being sent to a gymnasium, said provincial disaster officer Roberto Monterola.
  <br>
  <br>
  Monterola said he had dispatched soldiers to force about 100 households in two coastal villages near Virac to move inland due to fears storm surges could swamp their homes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Regardless of the exact landfall point, heavy rainfall, severe winds, and storm surges may occur in areas outside the predicted landfall zone," the forecaster said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The mayor of Naga city in Camarines Sur province imposed a curfew from midday on Saturday in a bid to force residents indoors.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Northern Samar province, disaster officer Rei Josiah Echano lamented that damage caused by typhoons was the root cause of poverty in the region.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Whenever there's a typhoon like this, it brings us back to the mediaeval era, we go (back) to square one," Echano said, as the province prepared for the onslaught of Man-yi.
  <br>
  <br>
  All vessels – from fishing boats to oil tankers – have been ordered to stay in port or return to shore.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nearly 4,000 people were stranded after the coast guard shut 55 ports.
  <br>
  <br>
  The volcanology agency also warned heavy rain dumped by Man-yi could trigger flows of volcanic sediment, or lahars, from three volcanos, including Taal, south of Manila.
  <br>
  <br>
  Man-yi will hit the Philippines late in the typhoon season – most cyclones develop between July and October.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier this month, four storms were clustered simultaneously in the Pacific basin, which the Japan Meteorological Agency said on Saturday was the first time such an occurrence had been observed in November since its records began in 1951. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Anthony Davis scored 40 points and LeBron James made more history to spark the Los Angeles Lakers over San Antonio 120-115 on Friday, launching their bid to defend the NBA Cup.
 <br>
  <br>
  James managed a triple-double in a fourth consecutive game for the first time in his 22 NBA seasons, the 39-year-old legend delivering 15 points, 15 rebounds and 12 assists over a game-high 38 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I love the game and I'm happy I'm still able to come out here and make some plays to help our ball club win," James said.
  <br>
  <br>
  James tied a Lakers triple-double record streak and became the oldest player in NBA history with four triple-doubles in a row, all in winning efforts, although his seven turnovers stung.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm just putting the work in. My teammates trust me with the ball," James said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I guess they trusted me a little too much tonight with the seven turnovers. I've got to be a lot better than that if I'm going to have the ball in my hands. I'll clean that up."
  <br>
  <br>
  Davis, who also grabbed 12 rebounds, won a battle of the big men with last season's NBA Rookie of the Year, Frenchman Victor Wembanyama, who had 28 points and 14 rebounds to lead the Spurs in the West Group B clash.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Another magnificent game by AD," James said. "We lean on AD every night. The ball goes to him not only the first option but also the second option... He has definitely been a beast this year."
  <br>
  <br>
  After Stephon Castle's basket gave the Spurs a 115-114 lead, Davis made a slam dunk with 91 seconds to play and James sank a layup, his first basket in more than 20 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Castle missed a tying 3-point attempt and James made two free throws to seal San Antonio's fate.
  <br>
  <br>
  Davis drove to the hoop and banged his right knee into the left knee of Wembanyama late in the game but both were playing at the finish.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Cleveland Cavaliers remained undefeated, downing Chicago 144-126 as games were played in all six NBA Cup groups with results also counting in the NBA regular-season standings.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cleveland improved to 14-0 as Donovan Mitchell scored 37 points to lead the East Group C rout.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's just so much fun. The vibes are right," Cleveland's Jarrett Allen said. "It just seems like everything is clicking right now."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Cavaliers are only the sixth team in NBA history to start 14-0, matching the fourth-best start in league history.
  <br>
  <br>
  In West Group A, Sacramento's De'Aaron Fox scored 60 points but the host Kings lost to Minnesota 130-126 in overtime as Anthony Edwards led the Timberwolves with 36 points.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the same group, James Harden matched Ray Allen for second behind Stephen Curry on the NBA's all-time 3-pointers list on 2,973, scoring 21 points for the Los Angeles Clippers in a 125-104 loss at Houston.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jabari Smith led the Rockets with 28 points.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shai Gilgeous-Alexander scored 28 points to lead Oklahoma City over visiting Phoenix 99-83, keeping the Thunder in the Western Conference lead at 11-2 in the Group B game.
  <br>
  <br>
  In West Group C, Brandon Ingram had 29 points as host New Orleans snapped a six-game losing skid by beating Denver 101-94.
  <br>
  <br>
  Three-time NBA Most Valuable Player Nikola Jokic, the league's rebounds and assists leader, was out for personal reasons as Denver's five-game win streak ended.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the same group, Golden State reserve Buddy Hield had 18 points and 12 Warriors scored in a 123-118 home victory over Memphis.
  <br>
  <br>
  In East Group C, Atlanta's Dyson Daniels led eight double-figure scorers with 25 points as the Hawks beat visiting Washington 129-117.
  <br>
  <br>
  In East Group A, Franz Wagner scored 31 points to lead Orlando over visiting Philadelphia 98-86.
  <br>
  <br>
  At New York, Jalen Brunson's 3-pointer with six seconds remaining gave the Knicks a 124-122 victory over Brooklyn. Brunson had 37 points while Cam Thomas hit 43 for the Nets.
  <br>
  <br>
  In East Group B, Bam Adebayo scored 30 points as Miami beat host Indiana 124-111 while Malik Beasley's 20 points led Detroit over host Toronto 99-95. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A fire at the neonatal unit of an Indian hospital killed 10 newborns, authorities said on Saturday, with another 16 clinging to life after a blaze blamed on a faulty oxygen machine.
 <br>
  <br>
  Building fires are common in India due to shoddy construction and a routine disregard for safety regulations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Friday night's fire broke out at about 10:30 pm (1700 GMT) at the Maharani Lakshmibai Medical College in Jhansi, around 450 kilometres south of the capital New Delhi.
  <br>
  <br>
  Footage from the scene showed charred beds and walls inside the ward as a crowd of anguished families waited outside.
  <br>
  <br>
  Babies rescued from the fire, all only days old, were laid side by side on a bed elsewhere in the hospital as staff hooked up their arms to intravenous drips.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Ten infants have sadly died," Uttar Pradesh deputy chief minister Brajesh Pathak told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Seven bodies have been identified. Three bodies haven't been identified as yet."
  <br>
  <br>
  Another 16 infants were in critical condition after the blaze, news outlet Times Now reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pathak said a safety audit of the hospital was carried out in February followed by a fire drill three months later.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The cause of the fire will be probed," he added. "If any lapses are found, strict action will be taken against those responsible and no one will be spared."
  <br>
  <br>
  District official Avinash Kumar said the fire had been caused by an electrical short circuit in the unit.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are providing medical care to the critically injured," he was quoted as saying by the Hindustan Times newspaper.
  <br>
  <br>
  Local media reports quoted other officials who said the fire started in a piece of machinery used to enrich the level of oxygen in the atmosphere.
  <br>
  <br>
  The high concentration of the combustible gas in the unit helped the fire spread quickly and suddenly, they said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Broadcaster NDTV reported that 54 infants in total were in the neonatal intensive care unit when the fire broke out.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prime Minister Narendra Modi called the deaths "heart-wrenching" in a post on social media platform X.
  <br>
  <br>
  "My deepest condolences to those who have lost their innocent children in this. I pray to God to give them the strength to bear this immense loss," he wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath announced compensation of 500,000 rupees (US$5,900) to bereaved families.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The district administration and concerned officials have been instructed to carry out relief and rescue operations on a war footing," Adityanath wrote on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I pray to Lord Shri Ram to provide salvation to the departed souls and speedy recovery to the injured."
  <br>
  <br>
  Friday's fire comes six months after a similar blaze at a children's hospital in New Delhi that killed six newborns. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee had his most hectic day yet in his week-long visit of Peru, signing a free trade agreement with the nation and meeting with the leaders of Malaysia, Vietnam and Singapore on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) summit.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lee also attended an informal dialogue on Friday, Lima time, briefing regional leaders on the SAR’s strengths as well as its role in China’s Belt and Road initiative and Apec development.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong leader then met Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim for the first time since July last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  He thanked Anwar for supporting the SAR’s plan to establish an Economic and Trade Office in Kuala Lumpur, the fourth in the region known as the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or Asean.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee also congratulated Malaysia for taking the chairmanship of Asean next year, and hoped the nation will continue to support Hong Kong's early accession to the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, or Rcep.
  <br>
  <br>
  After attending another Apec dialogue where he exchanged views Chilean President Gabriel Boric, Lee had two more bilateral meeting with Vietnamese President Luong Cuong and Singaporean Prime Minister Lawrence Wong.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both countries are key trading partners of Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SAR leader’s day culminated in the signing of the FTA between Hong Kong and Peru, and he got to relax by watching cultural performances at an Apec gala dinner.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Saturday, Lima time, Lee will attend the Apec Economic Leaders' meeting retreat and meet with Peruvian business sector representatives.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Mike Tyson's controversial return to boxing ended in a one-sided defeat on Friday, with Youtuber-turned-prizefighter Jake Paul cruising to victory by a unanimous decision against the heavyweight icon in Texas.
 <br>
  <br>
  Tyson, 58, barely landed a punch during the eight-round bout at the AT&T Stadium in Arlington, with Paul winning by big margins on all three cards – 80-72, 79-73 and 79-73.
  <br>
  <br>
  Paul, 27, used his superior speed and movement to dominate the ageing Tyson with ease, and had the former undisputed heavyweight champion in trouble after landing a flurry of punches in the third round.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yet the younger fighter was unable to land the knockout blow he had promised to deliver during Thursday's ill-tempered weigh-in, where Tyson slapped him across the face.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tyson, however, looked every bit of his 58 years, managing to land only a handful of meaningful punches during the fight.
  <br>
  <br>
  Final statistics showed Tyson connected with just 18 of 97 punches thrown while Paul threw some 278 punches and landed 78 of them.
  <br>
  <br>
  As the final seconds of the eighth round counted down, Paul could even afford to bow in respect to Tyson before the bell sounded. (AFP)

<img alt='President Xi Jinping has told his Japanese counterpart, Shigeru Ishiba, Beijing is ready to work with Tokyo  "in accordance with the principles and directions set out in the four political documents" between the two countries.

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping told Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba in their first meeting that China hoped Japan would "properly handle" major issues such as history and Taiwan, according to state media on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Xi called for the two Asian neighbours to safeguard the global free trade system, as well as stable and unimpeded production and supply chains, as they met on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) forum summit in Lima, Peru.
  <br>
  <br>
  He stressed that China is ready to work with Japan "in accordance with the principles and directions set out in the four political documents" between the two countries, and adhere to the important consensus that they are "cooperative partners rather than threats to each other", Xinhua reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  China and Japan are close neighbours and important countries in Asia and the world, Xi said, adding that bilateral relations bears significance beyond bilateral dimension.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ishiba told Xi that Japan's position on the Taiwan question, based on the Japan-China joint communique in 1972, remains unchanged.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Japanese prime minister also said he wanted to build a "constructive and stable" relationship, and that Tokyo has no intention of decoupling from China.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, Xi and South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol held a summit for the first time in two years on the sidelines of Apec.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi told Yoon that "the international and regional situations have undergone many changes" over the past two years, according to Xinhua.
  <br>
  <br>
  "No matter how the situation changes, China and South Korea should stick to the original intention in establishing diplomatic ties, firmly adhere to the direction of good-neighbourliness and friendship, and remain committed to the goal of mutual benefit and win-win cooperation," Xi said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon told his Chinese counterpart that their two countries should cooperate for peace in the face of North Korea and Russia's military cooperation, according to the South Korean President's office.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon expressed his hope that "South Korea and China will cooperate in promoting stability and peace in the region in response to North Korea's successive provocations, the war in Ukraine, and Russia-North Korea military cooperation", his office said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon also called for the two countries to further strengthen cooperation in the economic sector, which he called "the central axis of bilateral relations over the past 30 years", Yoon's office said. (Agencies)

    '20 used fake DSE certs to apply for Macau university'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Education minister Christine Choi on Saturday said the authorities have stepped up screening after 20 people used forged DSE certificates to apply for the Macau University of Science and Technology.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a radio programme, she said the university suspected that the documents were bogus and had contacted the Hong Kong Examinations and Assessment Authority (HKEAA).
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is outrageous. There were 20 fake DSE certificates. For anyone who has doubts about the DSE results, we can help. The HKEAA keeps a record of the DSE results and can help verify them," Choi said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister said the authorities have reported the cases to the police.
  <br>
  <br>
  Choi added that some people had used fake academic qualifications to gain admission to universities in Hong Kong, but she said applications are now being checked more closely.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, she said a task group on setting up the SAR's third medical school will hold its second meeting later this month.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Based on the expected requirements, the universities which are interested can make changes to their proposals and examine their own qualifications... So this is not a race to see who hands in their proposals fastest," she said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Transport Secretary Lam Sai-hung said on Saturday that he's confident that the shipping industry will prefer Hong Kong's bunkering facilities to those of nearby cities.
 <br>
  <br>
  He was speaking a day after the authorities unveiled plans to develop the SAR into a high-quality green maritime fuel bunkering centre.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government on Friday announced an action plan on green maritime fuel bunkering, including an aim to switch 55 percent of diesel-fuelled vessels to green maritime fuels by 2026.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on an RTHK radio programme, Lam said the demand for green maritime fuel will gradually increase in line with the target of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, and he expects Hong Kong to outperform.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In terms of traditional fuels, Hong Kong ranked seventh among global fuel bunkering ports. The other two in the GBA were not within the top ten, so we have an advantage," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Green maritime fuel bunkering is like adding a new type of fuel to a gas station, and green maritime fuel will be more widely used as vessels have to reduce their carbon footprint... This will boost business at our port."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lam said the government will look into using 11 hectares of land in Tsing Yi to store green methanol.
  <br>
  <br>
  The director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, Xia Baolong, met Hong Kong government officials together with SAR representatives of the business sector in Shenzhen last week.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister said Xia had urged Hong Kong to develop its ports in land, air and sea, and the authorities would consider tax reduction measures to attract more maritime service enterprises to expand their business in the city, strengthening the SAR's status as an international maritime hub.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping has warned that the world is entering an era of harmful "protectionism", in remarks to an Asia-Pacific summit in Lima.
 <br>
  <br>
  On the eve of what will be his final official face-to-face with outgoing US President Joe Biden, Xi raised concern about "spreading unilateralism and protectionism", Xinhua reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xinhua also quoted Xi as cautioning against "fragmentation of the world economy" in a written speech prepared for a meeting of CEOs on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) summit.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi and Biden are in the Peruvian capital for a two-day meeting of heads of state of the 21-member Apec grouping.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Saturday, the sitting leaders of the world's two largest economies will have their final official encounter before Trump takes office in January.
  <br>
  <br>
  In his prepared remarks reported by Xinhua, Xi said the world had "entered a new period of turbulence and transformation".
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi said attempts to use pretexts to block economic cooperation and to break up the interdependence of the world were nothing but back-pedalling.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We should see to it that economic globalisation generates more positive outcomes and is taken to a new phase that is more dynamic, inclusive and sustainable," Xi said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that the principles of "plan together, build together and benefit together" should be followed, the representation and voice of the Global South should be enhanced continuously, and all countries should be ensured of equal rights, equal opportunities and equal rules in conducting international economic cooperation.

 The free-trade agreement between Hong Kong and Peru will put the SAR in the global spotlight and fast-track regional trade, according to the city’s delegate to a key working group of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, or Apec.
 <br>
  <br>
  Peruvian exporters and shippers also welcomed the pact and expressed interest in expanding their businesses in Hong Kong, citing the city’s strategic location in Asia and connections with the mainland.
  <br>
  <br>
  Marjorie Yang, a Hong Kong, China, representative on the Apec Business Advisory Council, said one of the biggest features of a free-trade agreement is lowering, or abolishing, tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  But that wasn’t the case here.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Right now, this trade agreement eliminates tariffs on the Peruvian side, but Hong Kong doesn't have any tariffs to eliminate. So Peruvian business have always been welcome to come and do business in Hong Kong,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yang, who's also the head of Esquel Group, one of the world's biggest textile and apparel manufacturers, explained what the Hong Kong-Peruvian FTA is really about.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Bilateral agreements are always good because if you can't get (something) like CPTPP (Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership) going, you can get bilateral agreements and gradually push.”
  <br>
  <br>
  “So this agreement … the terms are such that if there are better terms reached in other bilaterals, we would also benefit.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Edgar Vasquez, a former minister of foreign trade and tourism in Peru, stressed that free trade deals have many facets.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The main focus of the free trade agreement is to have the possibility to cooperate with each other in many other aspects with regards to goods, because we have sanitary and phytosanitary measures, technical barriers to trade, intellectual property,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Now representing the Peruvian Association of Exporters, Vasquez believes the agreement boosts exposure of Hong Kong in Peru and vice versa.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I’m sure that with the free trade agreement, as with our experience with the United States, our exports exploded. With China also, our exports increased a lot. We signed with Thailand, with Australia, our exports are growing.”
  <br>
  <br>
  For Liverita, a Peruvian freight forwarder and consultancy firm, Hong Kong was already on its radar years ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  It set up an office in the SAR in 2020 and followed up with another outlet in Shanghai later that year.
  <br>
  <br>
  General manager Carolina Hurtado said she was extremely grateful for the assistance from InvestHK, the SAR government arm tasked to lure direct foreign Investment.
  <br>
  <br>
  “[That’s] because you really don't have an idea of how many ports or how many locals or chamber of commerce I have visited and asked for information. I mean, what do I need? What info, what documents, what is the process, how much I need to invest?” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We are pretty (good) friends right now with them (InvestHK).”
  <br>
  <br>
  Hurtado added that Hong Kong’s advanced infrastructure and robust financial sector makes it an ideal destination for investors.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I know that the financial companies in Hong Kong are pretty big, more than 100 banks, right? In Peru we don't have more than 20. They don't have a lot of bank investors or bank information for international products.”
  <br>
  <br>
  “But I know Hong Kong (has) got that.”

<div class="itemFullText">
 Ireland rebounded from defeat to New Zealand by edging Argentina 22-19 in a nailbiting one-off rugby union Test at Lansdowne Road on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Irish led by 13 points at the break but a lack of discipline and excellent play by the Pumas almost gave the visitors their first ever win in Ireland.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It went right down to the wire there," Ireland skipper Caelen Doris told TNT Sport.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We were happy with how it started. There was a good feeling through the warm-up and that carried over to the start. I felt we were in a pretty good position at half time and their quality showed in the second half."
  <br>
  <br>
  Ireland started brightly but it was the Pumas who thought they had struck first through Matias Moroni.
  <br>
  <br>
  Instead Moroni trudged off after receiving a yellow card for a head collision with Irish fly-half Jack Crowley earlier in the play.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was Crowley who was celebrating a minute later as he went over for his second Test try and converting it for 7-0 in the fourth minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  Barely a minute had passed since Crowley's try when Garry Ringrose broke through the centre and a sublime pass by Jamison Gibson-Park found Tadhg Beirne, who selflessly passed inside to Mack Hansen.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Australia-born wing touched down for his 10th Test try -- Crowley failed to convert but the Irish were 12-0 up inside six minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pumas fly-half Tomas Albornoz got his team on the board with a penalty.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Irish piled the pressure on the visitors and were denied a third try after Beirne knocked on as he went to touch the ball down.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, they lost prop Finlay Bealham to a yellow card in the 17th minute for a dangerous tackle.
  <br>
  <br>
  Andy Farrell looked rueful in the coach's box as Bealham trotted off with Albornoz knocking over the penalty for 12-6.
  <br>
  <br>
  Crowley landed a sweetly struck drop goal to make it 15-6 to the hosts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Albornoz's unerring boot added three more points shortly before Bealham returned to the fray for 15-9.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Pumas resisted waves of Irish attacks but finally cracked just after the half hour mark as Joe McCarthy powered over for his second Test try -- Crowley converted for 22-9.
  <br>
  <br>
  By contrast the Irish line somehow held out as the Pumas pressed in the final few minutes of the half.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ringrose turned the ball over and the hosts breathed easier as they headed in 22-9 up.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the Pumas responded brilliantly after the break, fullback Juan Cruz Mallia broke through from deep, Ringrose and Hansen failing to bring him down, and touched down.
  <br>
  <br>
  Albornoz converted for 22-16.
  <br>
  <br>
  Irish discipline was creaking just as it did against the All Blacks, conceding three penalties within minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Referee Paul Williams had had enough of Irish offsides and sent McCarthy to the sin bin much to Farrell's frustration.
  <br>
  <br>
  Albornoz moved past 100 points in Test rugby with a smoothly taken penalty for 22-19 and just under half an hour to play.
  <br>
  <br>
  The penalty count went to 10 as Crowley took out Albornoz in the air, but at the end of the next phase of play the Pumas' fly-half sent a drop goal attempt wide.
  <br>
  <br>
  Farrell rang the changes just after the hour including replacing Crowley with 21-year-old Sam Prendergast for his first cap.
  <br>
  <br>
  Perhaps the biggest cheer of the night came in the 67th minute as prop Cian Healy came on to equal Brian O'Driscoll's Irish record of 133 caps.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Irish were hanging on but received a huge boost when Pumas replacement Francisco Gomez Kodela was sin-binned for a head shot on Doris.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Pumas were the ones pressing right at the end and were inside the 22 when the Irish managed to turn the ball over. (AFP)

    US, European markets fall on interest rate jitters

<img alt="US markets finished lower as traders pondered comments from the head of the US central bank signalling that it was in no hurry to cut interest rates. File photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1779429_1_20241116075502.jpg&q=70">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Global stock markets ended the week on a sour note on Friday as traders digested Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's comments that the US central bank was not on a preset path to cut interest rates.
 <br>
  <br>
  After Powell indicated the Fed was in no hurry to cut rates as it monitors inflation's downward trajectory, Wall Street turned red, with all three major indices closing lower.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Certainly Powell's speech has triggered some skepticism about the path of rates, with potentially December being a skip instead of another cut," Edward Jones senior investment strategist Angelo Kourkafas told AFP.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But we do have another inflation and jobs report before that, so there is still a good sense we might see another rate cut in December," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.7 percent to 43,444.99, the S&P 500 lost 1.3 percent to 5,870.62 and the Nasdaq Composite lost 2.2 percent to 18,680.12.
  <br>
  <br>
  Leading the way down were a clutch of vaccine-makers' stocks after US President-elect Donald Trump indicated he would appoint vaccine skeptic Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as his health secretary.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Europe, London was off 0.1 percent, digesting disappointing growth data. Frankfurt and Paris also ended in the red.
  <br>
  <br>
  Disappointing US retail sales in October did not help overall sentiment as oil prices also drifted down.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a speech on Thursday, Powell said that "the economy is not sending any signals that we need to be in a hurry to lower rates."
  <br>
  <br>
  While the US central bank is expected to cut interest rates again next month, investors are scaling back their bets on how many cuts will be made next year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Investors are worried tax cuts and tariffs planned by Trump could reignite inflation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The (Trump) administration's renewed focus on tariffs could weigh heavily on currencies of trade-exposed economies, particularly those in Asia and the eurozone," said Charu Chanana, chief investment strategist at Saxo Markets.
  <br>
  <br>
  European markets stuttered as the European Commission predicted economic growth would pick up slightly and inflation would keep falling in the eurozone next year, but warned of growing risks linked to geopolitical tensions. (AFP)

    HK-Peru FTA to boost more than 150 sectors

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong has signed a free trade agreement with Peru, concluding two years of negotiations with the South American nation.
 <br>
  <br>
  While Chief Executive John Lee and Peruvian President Dina Boluarte looked on, Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development Algernon Yau and his Peruvian counterpart, Ursula Desliu Leon, inked the much-anticipated deal.
  <br>
  <br>
  The FTA will take effect after both sides have completed their respective internal procedures.
  <br>
  <br>
  This represents Hong Kong’s ninth free-trade agreement, and the 21st economy that the SAR has struck a pact with.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to the SAR government, over 150 services sectors will benefit from commitments made by Peru.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some examples include professional, transport, financial, recreational and cultural services.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee had earlier pledged to provide a transparent and favourable platform for Hong Kong investors wishing to set up shop in Peru.
  <br>
  <br>
  Peru is Hong Kong’s fifth largest trading partner in Latin America with bilateral trade reaching HK$5.2 billion last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Peruvian exports to Hong Kong accounted for only one third of that total, and producers here are keen to bump up shipments of popular products such as fruits and vegetables, as well as fish meal.

    Hamas official says 'ready' for Gaza ceasefire

<img alt="Most of Gaza has been reduced to rubble over the past 13 months. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1779374_1_20241115202323.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A senior Hamas official said on Friday that the group is "ready for a ceasefire" in Gaza and urged US President-elect Donald Trump to pressure Israel to end the war.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Hamas is ready to reach a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip if a ceasefire proposal is presented and on the condition that it is respected" by Israel, said Hamas political bureau member Bassem Naim.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We call on the US administration and Trump to pressure the Israeli government to end the aggression.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hamas informed the mediators that it is in favour of any proposal submitted to it that would lead to a definitive ceasefire and military withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, allowing the return of displaced people, a serious deal for a prisoner exchange, the entry of humanitarian aid and reconstruction," Naim added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The demands are the same ones Hamas has made in successive rounds of ceasefire negotiations since the start of the war.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the campaign trail, Trump promised peace in the Middle East and has vowed to give freer rein to Israel.
  <br>
  <br>
  Naim's comments come after Qatar said on Saturday that it had suspended its role as a key mediator for a Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal until Hamas and Israel show "seriousness" in talks.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Gulf emirate, which has hosted Hamas's political leadership since 2012 with US blessing, has been involved in months of protracted diplomacy aimed at ending the war triggered by the Palestinian group's attack on Israel on October 7 last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hamas attack resulted in the deaths of 1,206 people, mostly civilians, according to a tally of Israeli official figures.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel's retaliatory campaign has killed 43,764 people in Gaza, most of them civilians, according to figures from the Hamas-run territory's health ministry that the United Nations considers reliable. (AFP)

    Spanish regional leader admits 'mistakes' over floods

<img alt="Carlos Mazon admits he was having lunch on the afternoon of the disaster. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1779377_1_20241115203421.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The head of Spain's eastern Valencia region admitted on Friday to "mistakes" in handling the country's deadliest floods in decades that killed 216 people there and apologised.
 <br>
  <br>
  The October 29 disaster claimed 224 lives nationwide. The floods wrecked infrastructure, gutted buildings and submerged fields.
  <br>
  <br>
  The final bill is expected to soar to tens of billions of euros.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm not going to deny mistakes," Carlos Mazon told Valencia's regional parliament, adding he was "not going to shirk any responsibility."
  <br>
  <br>
  As the head of the regional government "I would like to apologise" to those who "felt" that "the aid did not arrive or was not enough," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  As he spoke, dozens of protesters gathered outside the building, jeering and chanting slogans demanding his resignation and calling him a liar.
  <br>
  <br>
  Almost half the people killed in Valencia were 70 years old or older and 26 were foreigners, including two Britons.
  <br>
  <br>
  Outrage at the authorities for their perceived mismanagement before and after the floods triggered mass protests on Saturday, the largest in Valencia city which drew 130,000 people.
  <br>
  <br>
  Several carried placards that read: "Our hands are stained with mud, theirs with blood."
  <br>
  <br>
  Critics have questioned the efficiency of the Valencia region's alert system. In some cases, residents were only contacted by telephone when floodwater was already gushing through towns.
  <br>
  <br>
  The emergency alert was only sent after 8 pm, nearly 13 hours after the state weather agency warned of the risk of "very intense" rain.
  <br>
  <br>
  The head of Valencia's emergency department admitted she did not learn it was possible to send such warnings until the evening of the first day of the floods.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under Spain's decentralised system of government, regional governments lead disaster response.
  <br>
  <br>
  Spain's Socialist-led central government has said Mazon's administration, run by the conservative Popular Party (PP), bore responsibility for not issuing the alert earlier.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mazon has also come under fire for having been missing for several critical hours on the afternoon of the disaster when it was already raining heavily.
  <br>
  <br>
  In response to repeated questions for explanations for his absence, he finally admitted he had been having lunch with a journalist to offer her the directorship of the regional television station.
  <br>
  <br>
  Many residents have complained they were left without food and water for days and had to rely on aid provided by volunteers instead of the government. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Oil executives and lobbyists descended on COP29 in Baku for "energy day" on Friday, as environmental groups denounced the presence of the fossil fuel industry at the UN climate talks.
 <br>
  <br>
  While negotiators haggled over the key goal of an increase in climate funding, a former UN chief denounced the talks as "no longer fit for purpose."
  <br>
  <br>
  The head of France's TotalEnergies, Patrick Pouyanne, said the sector is "part of the problem," but insisted it was making "continuous progress" on transition.
  <br>
  <br>
  The "Kick the Big Polluters Out" (KBPO) coalition of NGOs analysed accreditations at the annual climate confab, calculating that more than 1,700 people linked to fossil fuel interests are in attendance.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The fossil fuel industry is creating havoc in people's lives, the fossil fuel industry is responsible for destruction," said Makoma Lekalakala, a South African environmental campaigner.
  <br>
  <br>
  The presence of oil, gas and coal interests at the climate talks has long been a source of controversy, and the appointment of UAE state oil firm head Sultan Al Jaber to head last year's negotiations in Dubai stoked criticism.
  <br>
  <br>
  This year's host is energy-rich Azerbaijan, whose President Ilham Aliyev on Tuesday repeated his insistence that oil and gas are a "gift of God."
  <br>
  <br>
  Former US vice president and climate activist Al Gore warned on Thursday that "the fossil fuel industry and the petrostates have seized control of the COP process to an unhealthy degree."
  <br>
  <br>
  While the Dubai summit produced a global agreement on "transitioning away" from fossil fuels, the follow-up commitment "has been very weak" and the issue "is hardly even mentioned" at COP29, he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I have to think that one of the reasons for that is that the petrostates have too much control over the process."
  <br>
  <br>
  A group of leading climate activists and scientists including former UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon warned on Friday that the COP process was "no longer fit for purpose."
  <br>
  <br>
  They urged smaller, more frequent meetings, strict criteria for host countries and rules to ensure companies showed clear climate commitments before being allowed to send lobbyists to the talks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Michai Robertson, lead negotiator on climate change for the Alliance of Small Island States, said the talks remained crucial for vulnerable nations shut out of forums like the G20.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That is the only time that our voice can be clearly heard," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  KBPO said Japan brought employees of coal giant Sumitomo as part of its delegation, Canada included oil producers Suncor and Tourmaline and Italy brought employees of energy giants Eni and Enel.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, some of those on the NGO list work for companies that are not primarily fossil fuel-related, including Danish offshore wind champion Orsted.
  <br>
  <br>
  The top priority at the talks is a new figure for climate finance to help developing countries adapt to climate change and transition their economies away from fossil fuels.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rich nations are reluctant to spend much more than the US$100 billion a year already committed, conscious of domestic publics angry about inflation and stuttering economies.
  <br>
  <br>
  But developing countries warn they need at least US$1 trillion to defend against the ravages of climate change and meet commitments to reach net-zero emissions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Negotiators are struggling to agree on a workable draft text before ministers arrive next week.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We must be honest, we believe that the pace of their work is currently too slow," warned COP29 lead negotiator Yalchin Rafiyev on Friday afternoon.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hanging over proceedings is the question of what role the United States will play on climate action and funding after Donald Trump returns to the White House in January, given his pledge to again withdraw from the landmark Paris agreement.
  <br>
  <br>
  American officials at the talks have insisted Trump will struggle to undo the climate action already in motion.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When history is written, he will be looked at as a speed bump on the tremendous growth of this clean energy transition," the Democratic governor of Washington state, Jay Inslee, told an event on Friday. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Pakistan's most populated province of Punjab on Friday extended school closures in smog-hit major cities by a week, as the country battles record air pollution.
 <br>
  <br>
  "The schools will remain closed for another week due to the hazardous air quality. Institutes including universities would switch to online classes to ensure the safety of students," Marriyum Aurangzeb, Punjab's environment minister, told a news conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  Air quality in Lahore was deemed "hazardous," according to data from IQAir, with the concentration of deadly PM2.5 pollutants – fine particulate matter in the air that causes the most damage to health – around 30 times the level deemed acceptable by the World Health Organisation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "More than 35,000 patients have been reported in the hospitals of Lahore due to smog-related health issues in almost a month," Aurangzeb added.
  <br>
  <br>
  She also urged residents to "stop roaming around on bikes and in cars and to wear masks."
  <br>
  <br>
  The province, home to more than half of Pakistan's 240 million people, had previously closed all schools until November 17.
  <br>
  <br>
  A mix of low-grade fuel emissions from factories and vehicles, exacerbated by agricultural burning, blanket the city each winter, trapped by cooler temperatures and slow-moving winds.
  <br>
  <br>
  The UN's food agency says transport is the main cause of air pollution in Pakistan, followed by industry and agriculture.
  <br>
  <br>
  Children are often hardest hit, with Unicef noting that "prior to these record-breaking levels of air pollution, about 12 percent of deaths in children under five in Pakistan were due to air pollution." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A collection of guitars and other musical equipment owned by influential rock guitarist Jeff Beck will go on sale in London in January, Christie's auctioneers announced on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Some of the 130 guitars, amps and "tools of the trade" used by Beck during his decades-spanning career are expected to fetch hundreds of thousands of pounds (dollars) when they go under the hammer on January 22, it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  They include the rock legend's 1954 "Oxblood" Gibson Les Paul, famously depicted on the cover of his seminal 1975 solo instrumental album "Blow By Blow" and used on several tracks.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is estimated to fetch up to £500,000 (US$634,000).
  <br>
  <br>
  Beck, who rose to stardom with 1960s supergroup The Yardbirds and later enjoyed a prolific solo career, died in January last year aged 78.
  <br>
  <br>
  His widow, Sandra Beck, said it was "a massive wrench" to part with the instruments but that they needed to be "shared, played and loved again."
  <br>
  <br>
  "These guitars were his great love and after almost two years of his passing, it's time to part with them as Jeff wished," she said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I hope the future guitarists who acquire these items are able to move closer to the genius who played them."
  <br>
  <br>
  The collection includes another Gibson Les Paul from 1958, dubbed the original "Yardburst" as it was bought in 1966 while Beck was in the seminal British rock group. It is valued at up to £60,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, a Fender Telecaster and Gibson hybrid crafted by world-renowned guitar designer Seymour Duncan specifically for Beck in 1973 is predicted to sell for as much as £150,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  Highlights from the guitar haul will be on public view in Los Angeles on December 4-6.
  <br>
  <br>
  The full collection will go on show for a week at Christie's London headquarters before the January 22 sale.
  <br>
  <br>
  Christie's Amelia Walker said the auctioneers were "honoured to have been entrusted" with the sale of instruments belonging to a "rock pioneer whose influence on his peers was unmatched."
  <br>
  <br>
  She added Beck's guitars had "shared his emotion and voice" with the world and the auction would "pay tribute to his enduring legacy." (AFP)

    Tyson takes a swipe at Paul ahead of anticipated fight

<img alt="58-year-old Mike Tyson is returning to the ring for his first professional fight in 19 years. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1779365_1_20241115190345.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Mike Tyson could not wait to put on the gloves to take a shot at upcoming opponent Jake Paul, striking the social media influencer-turned-boxer in the face as they approached each other at Thursday's weigh-in at Arlington, Texas.
 <br>
  <br>
  The one-time "Baddest Man on the Planet," 58-year-old Tyson is returning to the ring for his first professional fight in 19 years against "ultimate heel" Paul in the wildly anticipated showdown at the AT&T Stadium on Friday (8 pm EST).
  <br>
  <br>
  There was no love lost between the two as Tyson, who weighed in at 228.4 pounds, approached Paul and immediately slapped the 27-year-old in the face and offered a two-word televised remark before walking off stage: "Talking's over."
  <br>
  <br>
  Paul, who gained a cult following on YouTube before turning to boxing four years ago, was far more loquacious, offering an expletive-riddled rant about his plans to demolish Tyson, who has a 50-6 record with 44 knockouts.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He's angry, he's an angry little elf," said Paul, who weighed in at 227.2 pounds. "It's personal now – he must die!"
  <br>
  <br>
  The fight is the first live boxing match that Netflix has aired, as the streamer with more than 280 million subscribers makes inroads into the sports arena.
  <br>
  <br>
  The match has drawn extraordinary global interest but also criticism, with British promoter Eddie Hearn dismissing the bout as "dangerous, irresponsible and disrespectful to boxing."
  <br>
  <br>
  Tyson, who had two stints in prison over convictions in the 1990s for rape and assault and declared bankruptcy 21 years ago, said in an interview last month that the fight was not about the payday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is not for financial reasons. My life is not going to change, not one percentage point after this fight. We will always be able to live this way," he said. "And I'm just doing it because I want to test myself."
  <br>
  <br>
  According to reports, Paul will get US$40 million for the fight, a number he mentioned at another news conference in New York in August. Tyson will get US$20 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mr Tyson's last professional fight was a loss against Kevin McBride in 2005. The fight against Paul will be shorter: eight two-minute rounds instead of the typical 10 or 12 three-minute rounds. Both boxers will also use heavier 14-ounce gloves instead of the typical 10-ounce gloves. (Reuters/AP)

    Landslide win for Sri Lanka president's coalition

<img alt="Anura Kumara Dissanayake's leftist coalition held just three seats in the outgoing assembly. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1779382_1_20241115211555.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake thanked voters on Friday for delivering his leftist coalition a landslide victory in snap parliamentary elections that repudiated establishment parties blamed for triggering an economic crisis.
 <br>
  <br>
  Dissanayake, a self-avowed Marxist, swept September presidential elections on a promise to combat graft and recover stolen assets, two years after a slow-motion financial crash imposed widespread hardships on the island nation.
  <br>
  <br>
  His decision to immediately call polls and secure parliamentary backing for his agenda was vindicated on Friday, with his National People's Power (NPP) coalition taking at least 159 seats in the 225-member assembly – exceeding a two-thirds majority.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Thank you to all who voted for a renaissance," Dissanayake said in a brief statement on social media platform X.
  <br>
  <br>
  The coalition had a monumental 61.5 percent of the vote while opposition leader Sajith Premadasa's party was well behind with only 17.6 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  "People voted to get rid of corruption and a corrupt system," said IT professional Chanaka Rajapaksha, who supported the NPP in the polls.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a sign of the magnitude of support for Dissanayake, his party won the most votes in the northern district of Jaffna, dominated by the island's minority Tamil community, for the first time since independence from Britain in 1948.
  <br>
  <br>
  Voter turnout was estimated at under 70 percent, less than the 80 percent of eligible voters who cast a ballot in September's presidential polls.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dissanayake, the 55-year-old son of a labourer, had been an MP for nearly 25 years and was briefly an agriculture minister but his NPP coalition held just three seats in the outgoing assembly.
  <br>
  <br>
  He stormed to the presidency after successfully distancing himself from successive leaders blamed for steering the country to its 2022 economic crisis.
  <br>
  <br>
  The financial crash was the worst in Buddhist-majority Sri Lanka's history as an independent nation, sparking months-long shortages of food, fuel and essential medicines.
  <br>
  <br>
  The resulting public anger culminated in the storming of then-president Gotabaya Rajapaksa's compound, prompting his resignation and temporary exile.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dissanayake's pledge to change a "corrupt" political culture has resonated with millions of Sri Lankans struggling to make ends meet following tax hikes and other austerity measures imposed to repair the nation's finances.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Very happy about this victory," said voter Nilusha Nilmini after the scale of the win became clear.
  <br>
  <br>
  "All this time, the country was governed by thieves, robbers and corrupt people. I am very happy that the crooks are out and a clean government has been established."
  <br>
  <br>
  Dissanayake's JVP party, the main constituent in the NPP coalition, led two insurrections in 1971 and 1987 that resulted in at least 80,000 deaths.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he was sworn in after presidential polls described as one of the island nation's most peaceful elections. (AFP)

<img alt="The government has revised its full-year GDP growth forecast to 2.5 percent, down from the previous range of 2.5 to 3.5 percent. File photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1779367_1_20241115191619.jpg&q=1">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government announced on Friday that it has revised its full-year economic growth forecast to 2.5 percent, compared with the previous estimated range of 2.5 to 3.5 percent.
 <br>
  <br>
  Real GDP in the third quarter grew by 1.8 percent year-on-year, slower than the 3.2 percent growth in the previous quarter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Government economist Adolph Leung said at a press conference that economic growth has been hindered by challenges in the external environment.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Increased global economic uncertainties and escalation of trade conflicts would affect the performance of our goods exports," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Leung expressed confidence that the economy will pick up steam, thanks to measures announced by the central and SAR governments to boost market sentiment.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For the outlook, while the external environment has turned more challenging recently, the Hong Kong economy is expected to maintain its growth momentum for the remainder of the year," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked about US President-elect Donald Trump's plan to slap up to 60 percent of tariffs on goods imported from China, Leung said that will have a "detrimental impact".
  <br>
  <br>
  "It will affect China's exports to the US and also Hong Kong's exports of mainland origin to the US. And I think more than that is that coming along with this kind of trade and economic policy in the US, it will also affect the interest rates outlook."
