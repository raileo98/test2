<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks tumbled on Friday, concluding the week on a sour note as a big drop in Treasury yields underscored worries about an economic slowdown.
 <br>
  <br>
  Analysts said recent data points, including lackluster US retail sales data and a tepid forecast from Walmart, raised questions about the outlook of the US economy as President Donald Trump presses on with tariffs and government job cuts that could boost unemployment.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You are starting to see some disappointment in the economic data," said Tom Cahill of Ventura Wealth Management, who tied Friday's big drop in the 10-year US Treasury note yield to economic worries.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished at 43,428, down 1.7 percent to around 750 points.
  <br>
  <br>
  The broad-based S&P 500 also dropped 1.7 percent to 6,013, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index fell 2.2 percent to 19,524.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Friday, an S&P Global reading on US services industry activity fell to a 25-month low, while a University of Michigan survey of consumer sentiment tumbled nearly 10 percent from January.
  <br>
  <br>
  LBBW's Karl Haeling said both are considered "secondary" economic reports, but they corroborate other major data points on employment and retail sales that have also pointed to weakness.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Investors ever since the election have been very bullish," he said, pointing to "all the uncertainty coming from Trump."
  <br>
  <br>
  Of the 11 sectors in the S&P 500, only consumer staples finished in positive territory, while technology, industrials, energy and consumer discretionary lost about two percent or more.
  <br>
  <br>
  A particularly big loser was UnitedHealth Group, which dropped 7.3 percent after the Wall Street Journal reported that the Justice Department is investigating allegations the company directed doctors to make patient diagnoses that would trigger higher government payments under the US Medicare Advantage program.

<img alt='The California-based multinational tech giant said it was "gravely disappointed" over the cessation of end-to-end encryption services. Photo: Reuters' src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1792699_1_20250222025738.jpg&q=90">

<div class="itemFullText">
 Apple said on Friday it could no longer offer full end-to-end encryption for British customers and iPhone users, following US media reports the UK government had asked for global data access.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Apple can no longer offer Advanced Data Protection (ADP) in the United Kingdom to new users, and current UK users will eventually need to disable this security feature," it said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  ADP means only account holders can view content such as photos and documents stored online and in the cloud through what is known as end-to-end encryption.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Washington Post reported earlier this month that the UK had demanded that Apple create a "back door" to enable the government to view any information uploaded by any Apple user around the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  Many tech platforms pride themselves on their ability to guarantee privacy through encrypted messaging channels, and providing access to law enforcement has long been seen as off-limits.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As we have said many times before, we have never built a backdoor or master key to any of our products or services, and we never will," Apple said on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The California-based multinational tech giant added it was "gravely disappointed that the protections provided by ADP will not be available to our customers in the UK given the continuing rise of data breaches and other threats to customer privacy.".
  <br>
  <br>
  Police officials worldwide say encryption can protect criminals, terrorists, and pornographers even when authorities have a legal warrant for an investigation.
  <br>
  <br>
  But civil rights and privacy advocates, along with cybersecurity professionals, advocate encrypting data to protect against wrongful snooping by authorities as well as hackers. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 South Africa on Friday concluded the G20 Foreign Ministers' Meeting, after a range of global issues having been discussed.
 <br>
  <br>
  South African Minister of International Relations and Cooperation Ronald Lamola hailed the event as "historic" when briefing the media after the meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the final day of the summit, Foreign Minister Wang Yi reiterated China's support  of the free trade system with the World Trade Organization (WTO), and called on the G20 countries to work together to build a just world of common development.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Wang met his Indian counterpart, Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, on the sidelines of the gathering.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang recalled the successful meeting between President Xi Jinping and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Kazan, Russia last year, which set the general direction for the improvement and development of bilateral relations.
  <br>
  <br>
  During the meeting, the two sides agreed that China and India, as two ancient civilisations and neighboring countries, should trust and support each other and help each other succeed. (Reuters/Xinhua)

    US Senate passes slimmed-down budget blueprint

<img alt='Donald Trump is still calling for the "big beautiful" bill that includes tax credits and other flagship measures, to be passed. Photo: AFP' src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1792688_1_20250221224727.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The US Senate passed a budget blueprint early on Friday that steamrolled past Democratic opposition, moving one step closer to unlocking the funds the Trump administration wants for border security and other priorities.
 <br>
  <br>
  The slimmed-down framework – which lacks Trump's support, as it does not include tax cuts he wants to extend – was adopted after an all-night "vote-a-rama" voting session on multiple amendments brought forward by Democrats.
  <br>
  <br>
  The pressure is now on the House of Representatives, whose Republican leaders insist they want to pass their own budget text – "one big beautiful bill," as Trump terms it, including tax cuts.
  <br>
  <br>
  If they fail to reach an agreement in the short term, however, they could fall back on the narrower budget framework adopted in the Senate on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The resolution passed overnight would allow the budget to pass through the Senate with just a simple majority, instead of needing 60 votes. Republicans control the chamber, but with only 53 votes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Any budget would still need to pass through the House, where Republicans also hold a narrow majority – before becoming law.
  <br>
  <br>
  Senate Republicans are pushing to pass the slimmed-down budget to help Trump score early political victories on issues such as migration, which has long topped his agenda.
  <br>
  <br>
  Their version would push other initiatives such as extending his tax credits – which Trump implemented in his first term, and which expire at the end of the year – down the road several months.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Republican leadership in the House of Representatives prefer the "big beautiful" bill that includes the tax credits and other flagship measures.
  <br>
  <br>
  The strategy is not without risk.
  <br>
  <br>
  Massive federal programmes such as Medicare and Medicaid, providing health insurance for millions of Americans, could be targeted by staunch conservatives in the House as they seek to offset the cost of extending Trump's tax credits.
  <br>
  <br>
  But slashing those programmes could prove wildly unpopular. With only a slim majority in the House, Republicans risk seeing their text rejected.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump thanked Senate Republicans in a post on his Truth Social platform on Thursday for working to fund his border programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he did not backtrack on his earlier comments calling for the larger House budget framework to pass.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We need both Chambers to pass the House Budget to 'kickstart' the Reconciliation process, and move all of our priorities to the concept of, 'ONE BIG BEAUTIFUL BILL,'" he wrote in a Truth Social post on Wednesday. (AFP)

    Impact of Paul Y's liquidation 'manageable': govt

<img alt="The High Court has appointed a provisional liquidator to handle Paul Y's debts and formulate a restructuring plan. Internet photo" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1792682_1_20250221212806.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A long-standing construction firm, Paul Y. Engineering Group, on Friday had its provisional liquidation application approved by the court.
 <br>
  <br>
  The High Court has now appointed a provisional liquidator for Paul Y's five subsidiaries to handle debts and formulate a restructuring plan.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government said while the 78-year-old company is undertaking a number of public works projects, the impact of the formerly-listed firm's situation should be manageable.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, the government said the company is currently working on 13 public works projects -- all but one of them were undertaken by way of joint venture with other construction companies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Paul Y is also responsible for a number of projects for other public organisations.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As the majority of the contracts are undertaken by joint ventures, regardless of whether Paul Y is liquidated eventually, the other participants of the joint venture contracts must complete the remaining works in accordance with the contract requirements," authorities said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some public sector owners, the government noted, have already replaced the main contractor of projects, for which the indebted firm was the sole undertaker.
  <br>
  <br>
  A spokesperson added that the administration has been paying close attention and taking measures to lower the impact on relevant projects and subcontractors, while helping affected workers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Paul Y had built numerous public and private housing projects, as well as landmark buildings such as The Center and the Hong Kong Club Building in Central.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Vice Premier He Lifeng expressed concerns over US tariffs and trade restrictions on China during a video call with US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Friday, state media reported.
 <br>
  <br>
  The two sides had an in-depth exchange of views on important issues in China-US economic relations, and both parties agreed to keep communicating on matters of mutual concern, according to a readout released by CCTV.
  <br>
  <br>
  He, the top trade negotiator on the Chinese side, and Bessent recognised the importance of bilateral economic and trade relations, the readout added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Friday's call came as Beijing and Washington seek to manage their relationship as the world's two largest economies stand on the precipice of a renewed trade war.
  <br>
  <br>
  US President Donald Trump said earlier this week he expected President Xi Jinping to visit the US, without giving a timeline for his trip.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Liverpool will take on Paris Saint-Germain in one of the standout ties in the last 16 of this season's Champions League after the teams were paired together in Friday's draw.
 <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool finished first in the 36-team league phase of the competition to qualify directly for this stage, while PSG had to come through a two-legged play-off tie in which they crushed fellow French side Brest 10-0 on aggregate.
  <br>
  <br>
  The first leg will take place at the Parc des Princes in Paris on March 4 or 5, with the return at Anfield a week later.
  <br>
  <br>
  The clubs last met in the Champions League in the group stage in 2018/19, when PSG won 2-1 at home after Liverpool triumphed 3-2 in England.
  <br>
  <br>
  In another eye-catching tie, reigning champions Real Madrid will play city rivals Atletico Madrid in a repeat of the finals of 2014 and 2016, both of which were won by Los Blancos.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bayern Munich will take on German rivals Bayer Leverkusen, while Arsenal face PSV Eindhoven and Inter Milan take on Feyenoord, who are fresh from knocking out AC Milan in the play-offs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Barcelona will face Benfica, who they defeated 5-4 away in Lisbon in the league phase last month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Aston Villa will face Club Brugge, having already lost away to the Belgians in the league phase.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last season's beaten finalists Borussia Dortmund will take on French side Lille. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Shares in Alibaba soared more than 14 percent on Friday, extending a blistering rally in Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index, after forecast-topping earnings added to a growing sense of optimism over Chinese tech firms.
 <br>
  <br>
  The e-commerce titan announced on Thursday that sales rose eight percent to 280 billion yuan in the three months through December, exceeding the 277 billion yuan estimated by a Bloomberg pool of analysts.
  <br>
  <br>
  The news sent its share prices rocketing 14.6 percent in Hong Kong, building on a rally that has seen it bounce nearly 70 percent higher since the turn of the year, and is now at a three-year high.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hang Seng Index finished up 3.99 percent, or 900.94 points, to 23,477.92.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hang Seng tech index surged more than six percent, with other household names making big moves higher. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong’s HK$2 subsidised bus, train, ferry, minibus and tram fares for the over 60s could be curbed, sources say, with expensive journeys costing more and a daily limit on how many discounted trips can be made.
 <br>
  <br>
  It's thought the government is mulling a daily cap of eight trips, while discounts of 80 percent will be provided when the standard fare is above HK$10.
  <br>
  <br>
  For example, a HK$20 standard fare would cost HK$4 once the subsidy is applied.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials are not thought to be planning to raise the age when people can start enjoying the cheaper fares.
  <br>
  <br>
  Financial Secretary Paul Chan said earlier that there is broad public agreement that the HK$2 scheme must be changed as it is not financially sustainable in the long run.
  <br>
  <br>
  The scheme is expected to have cost some HK$6 billion in the 2024/25 financial year, a jump of around 50 percent from the year before.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Society for Immunisations and Travel Medicine on Friday said Hong Kong people should take different jabs, in accordance with their travel destinations.
 <br>
  <br>
  The society interviewed over 100 people this month, and found that 85 percent of them would not get jabbed, even if they were going to high-risk places.
  <br>
  <br>
  Its president, Alex Leung, urged people to have a health consultation four to six weeks before their departure.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Travel health is not just about vaccination, it's about the whole package of travel health risk assessment. It's about what is the chemoprophylaxis... emergency medications," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Leung said, for example, there are currently pneumonia outbreaks in Indonesia and the Philippines, while places like Japan, South Korea and Thailand recorded outbreaks of flu.
  <br>
  <br>
  Infectious diseases expert Ivan Hung said having flu and pneumococcal infections at the same time is very common, and it may increase the possibility of hospitalisation and the death of patients.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Pneumococcal disease... which previously [was] not believed to be a traveller's disease, is now being highlighted that certain people will have this risk of acquiring this kind of infection and developing complications," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The society said people can refer to its vaccine guidelines, targeting popular destinations among Hong Kong travellers.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Pope Francis spent another night without incident, the Vatican said on Friday, marking a week in the hospital for the 88-year-old pontiff suffering from pneumonia in both lungs.
 <br>
  <br>
  "The night went well, this morning Pope Francis got up and had breakfast," the Vatican said in a regular morning update.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was the latest in a series of incrementally positive updates in recent days from the Vatican, which has regularly been publishing information -- however modest -- about the Argentine pope's state of health.
  <br>
  <br>
  Francis was admitted to Rome's Gemelli Hospital last Friday with bronchitis, but it later developed into pneumonia in both lungs, sparking widespread alarm.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the Vatican said Thursday he continued to not have a fever and his "hemodynamic (blood flow) parameters continue to be stable".
  <br>
  <br>
  Vatican sources have said the pope continues to keep up with his correspondence and has been working with his collaborators.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cardinal Matteo Maria Zuppi, the head of Italy's bishops conference, expressed confidence on Thursday that the pope was "on the right path".
  <br>
  <br>
  "The fact that the pope had breakfast, read the newspapers, received people, means that we are on the right path to a full recovery, which we hope will happen soon," Zuppi said. (AFP)

    Citybus unveils panda-themed open-top bus

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Tourists, bus enthusiasts and panda-lovers are being invited to take a ride on an open-top double-decker set to ply sightseeing routes in the city.
 <br>
  <br>
  Citybus on Friday introduced a newly re-painted vehicle featuring the six pandas living in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bus will be used on five sightseeing routes, including two new ones to be launched on March 17.
  <br>
  <br>
  For less than HK$50, travellers can go to tourism hotspots such as Repulse Bay and Aberdeen, or travel on the existing lines between Tsim Sha Tsui, Central and West Kowloon Cultural District.
  <br>
  <br>
  Transport minister Mable Chan said the bus company has worked with Southern District Council, Ocean Park and community groups to come up with the new routes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Not only will the bus take passengers around, those on board can also feel they're on a lively, cute and happy giant panda bus, which will blend into the scenery of different districts," she said at a press conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This not only puts into practice 'tourism everywhere', it's also 'pandas everywhere'. This injects a dose of vibrancy into different areas."
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister said that last year, the company's open-top bus routes carried around 560,000 passengers.
  <br>
  <br>
  The managing director of Citybus, Richard Hall, said the new routes offer stunning views around Hong Kong's shorelines.
  <br>
  <br>
  "These two new routes will run along the dramatic coastline of Hong Kong Island, including the famous Victoria Harbour, the iconic beaches surrounding Southern District, with the incredible sunsets to be seen along the shoreline," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The firm said it might paint pandas on more of its buses in future, depending on demand.

    Israel slams Hamas for not returning body of hostage

<div class="itemFullText">
 Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accused Hamas on Friday of committing a "cruel and evil" violation of the Gaza ceasefire deal by failing to return the body of hostage Shiri Bibas.
 <br>
  <br>
  "We will act with determination to bring Shiri home, along with all of our captives - both the living and the fallen - and ensure that Hamas pays the full price for this cruel and evil violation of the agreement," Netanyahu said in a video statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamas on Thursday handed over bodies it said were of four hostages, including three members of the Bibas family - Shiri Bibas and her two young sons - along with an elderly captive.
  <br>
  <br>
  While the identities of the Bibas boys and the elderly hostage were confirmed by Israeli forensic experts, the fourth body was not that of Shiri Bibas, according to Israeli officials.
  <br>
  <br>
  Netanyahu said it was, in fact, that of a Gazan woman.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The cruelty of the Hamas monsters knows no bounds," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two boys - Kfir and Ariel - had become symbols of the hostage crisis along with their mother.
  <br>
  <br>
  During their attack on October 7, 2023, that triggered the Gaza war, Hamas filmed and later broadcast footage showing the Bibas family's abduction from their home near the Gaza border.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ariel was then aged four, while Kfir was the youngest hostage at just nine months old.
  <br>
  <br>
  Their father, who was also seized during the attack, was released earlier this month. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The vice-chancellor of the University of Hong Kong (HKU) on Friday said the institution would shoulder the financial challenges with the SAR amid a potential funding cut to the education sector.
 <br>
  <br>
  Financial Secretary Paul Chan earlier hinted there was room to reduce education spending with a public deficit of HK$100 billion, pointing to substantial reserves of local universities.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a media luncheon, Zhang Xiang said he hopes any spending cuts would be moderate.
  <br>
  <br>
  “As a responsible community member, HKU will shoulder with the community, we will all together face this challenge,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We also hope that the government's financial cuts to the higher education will be moderate so we can survive.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Zhang said that while HKU has reserves which it built up over 100 years, much of this money has already been earmarked for future projects.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We are building many buildings, more than 10 buildings on campus. This itself is multi-billion dollars already earmarked for this,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The HKU head added that a large portion of reserves consist of endowment funds from donors that support professorships.

    Lawmakers support tram fare increases

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Many lawmakers on Thursday voiced support for an increase in tram fares, with Hong Kong Tramways saying it needs the rises to stay afloat.
 <br>
  <br>
  The company hopes to put up fares by 30 cents to HK$3.30 for over 12s, by 10 cents to HK$1.60 for children aged 3 to 11, and by 20 cents to HK$1.50 for senior citizens.
  <br>
  <br>
  Managing director Paul Tirvaudey told lawmakers at a transport panel meeting that the firm does not expect passenger numbers to return to pre-Covid levels because of structural changes to the population and economic activities on Hong Kong Island.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Hong Kong Tramways is at the same time very resilient, as it has been profitable in 120 years of existence. But at the same time, it is also still fragile with several critical risks which if not addressed properly, could threaten its long term viability,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “So our ambition at the moment is to keep consolidating Hong Kong Tramways in the long term, for it to contribute even more to the attractiveness of Hong Kong and to the quality of life of its residents.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Legislator Gary Zhang, who supported the fare increase proposal, asked if the company could work on "smart driving", to improve efficiency.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tirvaudey said the company has been looking into this, for example by installing more cameras on trams for investigations and training.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Regarding the most advanced technologies, we had some tests. However, the difficulty would be to extend, to generalise these kind of technologies to 165 trams,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Our fleet is quite large, and in terms of cost efficiency, it could still be very expensive compared to the benefits. So the return on investment has not been proven at the moment, but this is something that we closely monitor.”

<div class="itemFullText">
 In an ice hockey grudge match of border rivals fuelled by political tensions, "51st state" Canada defeated the United States 3-2 in overtime on Thursday to win the Four Nations Face-Off final.
 <br>
  <br>
  Canada's Connor McDavid scored the title-winning goal off a pass from Mitch Marner to deliver Canada the victory after enduring political barbs from US President Donald Trump about being the "51st state."
  <br>
  <br>
  "You can't take our country -- and you can't take our game," outgoing Canada Prime Minister Justin Trudeau -- dubbed "Governor Trudeau" by Trump -- posted on X moments after the triumph.
  <br>
  <br>
  The victory came in the hard-hitting rematch of a bruising round-robin clash Saturday between NHL stars that produced three fights in nine seconds in a 3-1 US triumph -- but Canada won when it mattered most.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Just to see the reaction, knowing what it means to us," McDavid, named the player of the game, said when asked the best part about the win.

  In the fight for bragging rights ahead of next year's Winter Olympics in Italy, Canada goaltender Jordan Binnington made several great saves early in overtime and 33 in all.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tone for a gripping contest was set when microphone-wearing referee Gord Dwyer said, "Let's get ready for an epic battle," just before dropping the puck to start the game, which went off without any brawling.

  A sellout crowd at Boston's TD Garden produced an electric atmosphere for one of the most hotly anticipated hockey games for years, an emotionally charged spectacle intensified by recent political sparring between the two North American neighbours.

 Police on Friday said they were investigating a traffic accident in Ma On Shan which left a school bus driver dead.
 <br>

  Officers said the 78-year-old man reportedly lost control of his vehicle and crashed into a railing when he was driving along Kam Ying Road towards Wu Kai Sha at around 6am.
  <br>
  <br>
  The force said the man showed no visible injuries but fell into a coma. He was pronounced dead at Prince of Wales Hospital.
  <br>

<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism Rosanna Law on Friday said a recording of the opening ceremony for Kai Tak Sports Park will be aired after editing in order to provide the best viewer experience.
 <br>
  <br>
  The opening show will be held at 6.30pm on March 1. It will be shown by four TV channels at 9.30pm.
  <br>
  <br>
  On an RTHK radio programme, Law stressed that the arrangement is not due to technical constraints, but is to coordinate the transition between different scenes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We hope to air the programme in one go, so viewers can enjoy a packed programme. After having many considerations, we think going for post-production is better," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked about claims that post-production demonstrates a lack of professionalism, the minister said there are many ways to show how magnificent and beautiful the sports park is.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have a strong performance line-up, and they have various collaborations and crossovers," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Law added that apart from the line-up already announced, including Hong Kong singers Joey Yung and MC Cheung, and fencing star Vivian Kong, special guests may also feature in the ceremony.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Foreign Minister Wang Yi told his G20 counterparts on Thursday that a "window for peace" is opening for the Ukraine crisis, days after top US and Russian diplomats met in Saudi Arabia.
 <br>
  <br>
  The top diplomat made the remarks at the G20 ministerial meeting in South Africa.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China has noted that calls for peace talks have been rising recently, and a window for peace is opening," Wang said, according to a readout of his speech at the G20 meeting in South Africa published by the Foreign Ministry.
  <br>
  <br>
  At talks in Riyadh on Tuesday, Russia and the United States agreed to establish teams to negotiate a path to ending the war that began when Russia sent its military into Ukraine on February 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  China supports all efforts to achieve peace, including this "recent consensus" reached between the United States and Russia, Wang said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We hope that all parties involved can find a sustainable and lasting solution that addresses each other's concerns," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the sidelines of the gathering in Johannesburg, Wang held meetings with his counterparts from multiple countries including Turkey and Russia.
  <br>
  <br>
  A curtain-raiser to the G20 summit in November, the meeting was attended by top diplomats, including Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, his Indian counterpart, as well as European envoys like France's Jean-Noel Barrot and Britain's David Lammy. (Agencies)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A four-day conference aimed at promoting the importance of sports law and arbitration is currently underway in Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  Organised by the Law Society, the symposium – called the 2025 Sports Law Mega Event – explores the connection between sports, law, and business.
  <br>
  <br>
  Starting from Thursday and lasting until Sunday, a number of activities will be held with the goal of facilitating exchange between lawyers and visiting guests.
  <br>
  <br>
  “This conference is all about how sports law can create opportunities for Hong Kong’s legal and sports industries,” the president of the Law Society, Roden Tong, told
  <a href="https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/news-programmes/this-episode.htm?cmsid=77" target="_blank">
   RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme
  </a>
  on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  He explained that the conference will cover a number of areas, including broadcasting rights.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We even have e-sports specialists actually in one of the sessions,” he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Deputy Secretary for Justice Horace Cheung had revealed earlier this month that the pilot scheme for sports dispute resolution will be rolled out in the latter half of this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The idea was first unveiled in the Policy Address last year with the aim of promoting sports arbitration, which Tong said is currently not a common method of solving disputes.
  <br>
  <br>
  “What we see now is the global sports market is in fact booming, and with [this], there are more disputes, whether it’s about contracts, governance issues or competition-related matters,” Tong said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We believe that a robust and efficient dispute resolution system is essential, particularly in sports.”

<div class="itemFullText">
 Premier Li Qiang has emphasised boosting consumption and improving people's livelihoods through stronger and more targeted measures, in a bid to strengthen the fundamental role of consumption in driving economic development.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a session held by the State Council, CCTV cited Li saying that, "Boosting consumption is not only an important way to expand domestic demand and stabilise growth, but also a major measure to transform the development model in the mid-to-long term."
  <br>
  <br>
  More efforts should be made to facilitate service consumption, improve the supply of education, medical care, culture, sports, tourism, elderly care and household services, and accelerate the application of artificial intelligence to unlock consumption potential of AI terminal products, he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Li also emphasised the need to relax market access in relevant industries, and boost high-quality product supply to meet emerging consumer demands.
  <br>
  <br>
  Top policymakers have pledged to try to bolster household incomes and consumption this year. (Agencies)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Paulo Dybala scored twice as Roma beat Porto to clinch a place in the last 16 of the Europa League, as Ajax clawed through in extra time despite playing a man down for 95 minutes.
 <br>
  <br>
  Spanish forward Samu Aghehowa gave Porto the lead against Roma after a 1-1 draw in Portugal last week, but two quick-fire goals from Dybala turned the tie in favour of the 2023 runners-up.
  <br>
  <br>
  Porto were reduced to 10 men when Canada midfielder Stephen Eustáquio was sent off early in the second half, and Niccolo Pisilli struck what proved to be the crucial third goal for Claudio Ranieri's men.
  <br>
  <br>
  Devyne Rensch turned into his own net deep into added time as Roma progressed 4-3 on aggregate.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Having a champion like Dybala means a lot. He's extraordinary; he says very little, but he is a leader and always says the right things," Ranieri said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Roma will find out whether they play Athletic Bilbao or city rivals Lazio in the next round when the draw for the last 16 is conducted on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have a huge opportunity in Europe. This competition can give us a lot this year," said Dybala.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, four-time European champions Ajax survived a huge scare against close neighbours Union Saint-Gilloise of Belgium, nearly squandering a 2-0 advantage from a week ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kevin Mac Allister's header halved the deficit and Promise David tucked away a penalty after Ajax captain Davy Klaassen was dismissed in the 25th minute for a deliberate handball.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Kenneth Taylor's spot-kick in extra time was enough to put Ajax through 3-2 on aggregate.
  <br>
  <br>
  José Mourinho, a former winner of the competition with Porto and Manchester United, saw his Fenerbahce side go through 5-2 overall after a 2-2 draw away to Anderlecht in a match that was delayed in the first half by crowd trouble.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere, Norwegian champions Bodo/Glimt overturned a first leg deficit against Dutch side Twente with a dramatic 5-2 win after extra time in the Arctic Circle to progress 6-4 on aggregate.
  <br>
  <br>
  The hosts were heading out before striking twice in second-half stoppage time but Twente then levelled the tie and forced extra time with a last-gasp equaliser.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sondre Brunstad Fet put Bodo/Glimt back ahead in the 111th minute, with a second own goal of the night from Twente sealing qualification for their opponents.
  <br>
  <br>
  Real Sociedad, meanwhile, thrashed Midtjylland 7-3 on aggregate after a 5-2 win in San Sebastian. The Spaniards will take on United or Tottenham in the last 16. (AFP)

    Alcaraz knocked out by Lehecka in Qatar Open quarters

<img alt="The world number three Alcaraz was dealt his second loss of the year in the quarter-final upset. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1792554_1_20250221073828.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 World number three Carlos Alcaraz was sent crashing out of the Qatar Open in the quarter-finals after losing to Jiri Lehecka, as the Spaniard headed for the exit along with second seed Alex de Minaur.
 <br>
  <br>
  Top seed Alcaraz dropped the first set before recovering to level, and then led by a break in the decider, but world number 25 Lehecka won the final four games for a 6-3, 3-6, 6-4 victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alcaraz entered the clash on a seven-match winning streak following his triumph in Rotterdam earlier this month but ran into trouble against a confident Lehecka, who won his second career title in Brisbane to start the year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Honestly, I don't know what I could have done better," said Alcaraz. "I have to give credit to him as well, because when he was down, especially in the third set, he didn't give up.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He was returning pretty well, really aggressively, no mistakes, or almost no mistakes," he continued.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 23-year-old Lehecka will play British eighth seed Jack Draper on Friday for a place in the final. The Czech is through to the last four in Doha for the second time.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I feel great," said Lehecka. "To win a match like that against a player like this is a super big achievement. I believed in myself and knew I had the level to produce this kind of tennis. I think the most important part was I believed in my game and did not back down."
  <br>
  <br>
  Draper battled back to beat Matteo Berrettini 4-6, 6-4, 6-3 in the last of the quarter-finals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Berrettini, a former world number six and Wimbledon runner-up, had knocked out Novak Djokovic in the second round.
  <br>
  <br>
  Andrey Rublev converted his eighth match point against De Minaur to take his place in the semi-finals.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Russian, a Qatar winner in 2020, had to dig deep to down the Australian 6-1, 3-6, 7-6 (10/8).
  <br>
  <br>
  Fifth-seeded Rublev let slip a 5-2 lead in the final set as De Minaur scrambled back into contention to force a tiebreak.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rublev finally got over the line, the 27-year-old saving a match point himself in a memorable quarter-final clash.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When I had my first match point, I played really well," said Rublev. "I did everything amazing and he just played an unreal rally. He made the backhand down the line and I played a good volley.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Then he makes a forehand pass down the line. In most of the matches, normally after these points, they win – it's a turning point," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I then started to get a bit more tight and more emotional, I was a bit unlucky," he went on to say. Then when I lost my serve, I said 'Okay, whatever, if I'm gonna lose, at least just try to do your best until the end'."
  <br>
  <br>
  This was his first win against a top-10 player since August last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rublev's reward for his fourth semi-final appearance in Qatar is a meeting with Felix Auger-Aliassime.
  <br>

    Macron to tell Trump to not be 'weak with Putin'

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Emmanuel Macron said on Thursday that France was entering a "new era" three years after the Russian-Ukrainian war and that he planned to tell US President Donald Trump that he could not "be weak" with Vladimir Putin.
 <br>
  <br>
  Macron also defended Volodymyr Zelensky, the embattled leader of Ukraine, speaking ahead of a planned visit to the White House to meet Trump next week.
  <br>
  <br>
  Macron has sought to coordinate a European response to Washington's policy shift in US-Russia relations, hosting this week two emergency meetings with leaders of EU and non-EU nations, including Germany, Britain, Canada, and Norway.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said he wanted the French to grasp the magnitude of the threat coming from the Kremlin, calling Russia "an existential threat to Europeans."
  <br>
  <br>
  In a Q&A session on social media on Thursday, Macron, 47, declared that France was embarking on a "new era."
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are entering an era in which each of us must ask what we can do for the French nation and the Republic," Macron said after discussing Ukraine with party leaders earlier in the day.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has sent shock waves around Europe by saying he is ready to resume diplomacy with Putin to end Russia's war against Ukraine, over the heads of European countries and Kyiv.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump will meet in Washington with Macron on Monday and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Thursday next week, the White House said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm going to tell him, 'You can't be weak with President Putin. That's not who you are, it's not your trademark, it's not in your interest," Macron said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the Kremlin said that any British plan to send troops to Ukraine as part of a potential peacekeeping mission would be unacceptable for Russia and that it was monitoring statements by Starmer with concern.
  <br>
  <br>
  Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said this week that Moscow views as a "direct threat" the idea of having Nato member troops on the ground in Ukraine, even if they operate there under a different flag. (AFP/Reuters)

    Wembanyama to miss rest of NBA regular season
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<div>
<img alt="The injury comes after Wembanyama made his first All-Star appearance this year. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1792542_1_20250221053538.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 San Antonio Spurs star Victor Wembanyama is expected to miss the rest of the NBA season after being diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis in his right shoulder, the team announced.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Spurs said in a statement that the 21-year-old French player was diagnosed with the blood clot after he returned to San Antonio following last Sunday's All-Star game in San Francisco.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Wembanyama is expected to miss the remainder of the 2024-25 regular season," the Spurs said. "The team will provide updates as appropriate."
  <br>
  <br>
  The announcement brings a premature end to another outstanding campaign by Wembanyama, who earned Rookie of the Year honours last season after being taken first overall in the NBA draft.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's tough," San Antonio's veteran point guard Chris Paul said of losing Wembanyama, who was averaging 24.3 points, 11.0 rebounds, 3.7 assists and a league-best 3.8 blocks in 46 games for the Spurs this season.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Tough more than anything, I think for all of us, knowing how much he means to our team, but more so knowing how much he means to the game and how much he loves to play," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other NBA players have dealt with similar health concerns. Chris Bosh, a two-time NBA champion with the Miami heat, was ultimately forced to retire at the age of 32 after repeatedly dealing with blood clots.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the Detroit Pistons' Ausar Thompson has returned to play 33 games this season afer he was diagnosed with a blood clot in March of last year. Brandon Ingram, now with the Toronto Raptors, recovered after being diagnosed with a blood clot in his right arm in 2019.
  <br>
  <br>
  But it's a big blow for a player who made an immediate impact on arriving in the league and whose influence is only growing in his second season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wembanyama became an All-Star for the first time when he was chosen as a reserve.
  <br>
  <br>
  Young Minnesota star Anthony Edwards noted Wembanyama's rise during All-Star weekend when he was asked if he considered himself a candidate for "next face of the league".
  <br>
  <br>
  "Not really," Edwards said, "That's what they've got Wemby for."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Spurs have reportedly indicated they expect Wembanyama to make a full recovery.
  <br>
  <br>
  While the team's announcement didn't rule out the possibility that Wembanyama could be fit for the playoffs, the chances of San Antonio reaching the post-season without him look slim.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Spurs are in 12th place in the Western Conference, two spots away from the final play-in berth now held by the Golden State Warriors.
  <br>
  <br>
  Even with the arrival of high-scoring guard De'Aaron Fox from Sacramento at the trade deadline, the Spurs will likely suffer without their centrepiece. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks dropped on Thursday following disappointing results from Walmart as banking shares fell in a move analysts attributed to profit taking.
 <br>
  <br>
  Walmart reported quarterly results that met expectations, but shares slid 6.5 percent after its forecast missed expectations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, shares of Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase fell three percent or more, dragging on major indices.
  <br>
  <br>
  The S&P 500, which finished at a record the last two days, dropped 0.4 percent to 6,117.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.0 percent to 44,176, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index declined 0.5 percent to 19,962.
  <br>
  <br>
  The drop in banking shares hit stocks that were "very overbought," said Adam Sarhan from 50 Park Investments, who noted that major US indices finished above their session lows in spite of significant geopolitical uncertainty.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Whenever there's been trouble in the market, buyers have showed up," said Sarhan, who views the dynamic as an indication of underlying bullishness.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among individual companies, Boeing slumped 2.8 percent after President Donald Trump said he was looking at "alternatives" to the company's Air Force One operation because of delivery delays.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Hasbro surged 13 percent after reporting better than expected profits. The toymaker expects 2025 revenues to be "up slightly," it said. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi met with his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov on the sidelines of the Group of 20 (G20) Foreign Ministers' Meeting in Johannesburg, South Africa, to discuss China-Russia relations.
 <br>
  <br>
  Wang, also a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, highlighted the strengthening strategic partnership between the two countries, noting significant progress in cooperation and mutual interest, particularly in global multi-polarity.
  <br>
  <br>
  China is willing to work with Russia to fully implement the important consensus reached by the two heads of state and to further advance China-Russia relations in the new year, he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lavrov expressed Russia's desire to deepen cooperation in trade, economy, and culture with China and advance their shared goals with Brics, the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, the United Nations, the G20, and other frameworks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Regarding the Ukrainian crisis, Wang reiterated China's consistent stance, emphasising the country's role in promoting peace and political resolution.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lavrov, for his part, said Russia's focus on addressing the root causes of the crisis and its commitment to a fair and sustainable peace in line with the United Nations Charter.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two sides also exchanged views and coordinated positions on other international and regional issues, including the situation in the Middle East. (Xinhua)

 The Democratic Party on Thursday evening announced its intention to disband following a central committee meeting to discuss its future.
 <br>
  <br>
  But party chairman Lo Kin-hei said a general meeting would be held at a later date and the disbandment would only move ahead if 75 percent of attending members approved.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It is a decision that we make based on our understanding of the current political situation and things like that,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lo also said he would chair a three-person working group to handle the initial preparations for the party's shutdown.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Spain's High Court has found former soccer federation boss Luis Rubiales guilty of sexual assault for kissing player Jenni Hermoso without her consent and fined him over 10,000 euros (US$10,434), the court said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  It acquitted him of charges of coercion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prosecutors had sought a prison sentence for Rubiales, 47, in a case that caused heated debate in Spain about sexism in women's football and wider Spanish society.
  <br>
  <br>
  The court said in a statement it had also acquitted Rubiales' three co-defendants who were accused of attempting to coerce Hermoso into saying the kiss, at the 2023 World Cup awards ceremony in Sydney, was consensual.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ensuing furore overshadowed Spain's victory in the tournament.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rubiales has maintained through this month's trial that Hermoso had consented to be kissed amid the celebrations.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ruling also banned Rubiales from going within a 200-metre radius of Hermoso and from communicating with her for one year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The fine was set at 20 euros a day over an 18-month period. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Two women died in a knife attack on Thursday at a shopping center in the Czech Republic, officials said.
 <br>
  <br>
  Police said they detained a teenage suspect in connection with the stabbings in a store in the city of Hradec Kralove, some 100 kilometres east of Prague.
  <br>
  <br>
  Reports initially said the victims had been injured, one of them seriously, but police later said both had died.
  <br>
  <br>
  They were not identified.
  <br>
  <br>
  A 16-year-old Czech national was detained by police about one kilometer from the scene, shortly after the attack.
  <br>
  <br>
  A knife was found nearby.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prime Minister Petr Fiala offered his condolences to the relatives of the dead.
  <br>
  <br>
  “What has happened in Hradec Kralove today is an absolutely incomprehensible and horrible act,” he posted on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  The motive for the attack was not immediately known.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police said the situation was under control and there was no danger to the public. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Department of Health has apologised for mistakenly giving pneumococcal vaccines to two children who were supposed to get hepatitis B vaccinations at the Tin Shui Wai Maternal and Child Health Centre.
 <br>
  <br>
  The department said there was no adverse reaction in the affected kids and paediatricians have assessed that the wrong vaccines do not pose any health risks to them.
  <br>
  <br>
  Seven children, between one and seven months old, were scheduled to receive hepatitis B vaccines between 4pm and 5.30pm on Monday, the department said.
  <br>
  <br>
  But a routine check of vaccination records later that day found that two fewer doses of hepatitis B vaccine had been used and two extra doses of pneumococcal vaccine had been used.
  <br>
  <br>
  The department said while investigations are ongoing it is believed the incident was due to human error, noting it had instructed the health centre to step up efforts in the training of frontline staff.
  <br>
  <br>
  It added that the nursing staff involved had been suspended from vaccination duties and disciplinary action would be taken if the probe confirms any misconduct.

<img alt="Ousted premier Han Duck-soo told Seoul's Constitutional Court he had " src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1792501_1_20250220184003.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korea's ousted premier said on Thursday that he had opposed suspended President Yoon Suk-yeol's declaration of martial law, testifying for the first time at his former boss' impeachment trial about the events of a night that threw the country into turmoil.
 <br>
  <br>
  Han Duck-soo was impeached by parliament as acting President and Prime Minister in December over alleged obstruction of the trial that would formally remove Yoon from office for his martial law decree.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Thursday, he appeared before that trial for the first time, telling Seoul's Constitutional Court he had "expressed my opposition" to Yoon's decision to suspend civilian rule on the night of December 3.
  <br>
  <br>
  Han said he and most of his fellow cabinet members "believed such a declaration would put South Korea in serious difficulty", and that he recalled them "being concerned and trying to dissuade it".
  <br>
  <br>
  Thursday's hearing was Yoon's 10th before Seoul's Constitutional Court.
  <br>
  <br>
  Once the hearings wrap up, the judges will go behind closed doors to deliberate Yoon's fate — with elections required in 60 days if he is removed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon walked out of the court just five minutes after proceedings began on Thursday, according to a pool report.
  <br>
  <br>
  His lawyer Yoon Kap-keun told reporters that the ousted president felt it was "inappropriate" for him to sit in the same court room with Han "or for the president to watch the prime minister testify".
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is not good for the nation's prestige," his lawyer quoted Yoon as saying.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon later returned to hear the testimony of former senior intelligence official Hong Jang-won, seen as a key figure in the decision to declare martial law.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong has claimed to be in possession of a memo containing a list of names of individuals Yoon ordered arrested during the night of the martial law declaration, including the leaders of the opposition and Yoon's own ruling party.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I will do my best to recount everything as I remember it," Hong told reporters before the hearing.
  <br>
  <br>
  The head of South Korea's National Police Agency, who is also on trial on insurrection charges related to the martial law decree, is another witness. (AFP)

    Remand, new prison admission numbers rise in 2024

<img alt="Correctional services chief Wong Kwok-hing says the CSD has decided against introducing legal amendments to prevent people under supervision from leaving the city.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The average daily number of people in remand reached its highest in more than two decades while the number of new admissions to correctional institutions last year also rose, prison authorities said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  New prison admissions overall stood at 18,438 last year, up seven percent from the figure in 2023, according to the Correctional Services Department.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 3,600 people were remanded in custody on average per day over the past year – the highest figure since 2000.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In response to the ever-changing penal population, especially the increasing population of those in remand, the department has deployed part of the capacity of certain correctional institutions to admit those in remand, to alleviate the overcrowding situation of reception centres," said commissioner Wong Kwok-hing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Delivering an annual round-up of the department's work, Wong also said authorities decided against introducing legal amendments to prevent people placed under supervision from leaving Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  The idea was previously floated after former student activist Tony Chung allegedly violated his supervision order and went to Britain to seek political asylum.
  <br>
  <br>
  "After discussing with the Department of Justice, we found that under current laws, we actually have enough power to impose some new supervisory conditions," Wong said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So since last year, we have implemented some arrangements for all those under supervision on applying to leave Hong Kong. They must apply to our supervisors before leaving Hong Kong, and they can only leave when we give approval."
  <br>
  <br>
  Fifteen cases had been approved so far under the new rule, Wong added.

    Slight uptick in HK bad loans seen in 2024: BEA

<img alt="The Bank of East Asia delivered a 12 percent increase in its net profits in 2024, to HK$4.6 billion. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1792489_1_20250220180623.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Bank of East Asia (BEA) on Thursday said it has been closely monitoring risks related to its exposure to the Hong Kong property sector as there was a slight uptick in so-called "bad loans" last year.
 <br>
  <br>
  At a press conference reviewing the bank's annual financial results, co-chief executive Adrian Li said about 6 percent of BEA's HK$61.4 billion Hong Kong property loans were non-performing in 2024, up from about 3 percent the year before.
  <br>
  <br>
  Much of these loans were in the commercial real estate sector, he said, adding that credit ratings for some of the bank's local clients were downgraded which in turn prompted the bank to significantly increase provision for its local property loans to over HK$1.2 billion, up from HK$380 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  The proportion of local property loans to the group's total loans, meanwhile, dropped to 11.5 percent at the end of last year, from 13.7 percent at the end of 2023, as the bank gradually reduced its exposure to Hong Kong property due to "relatively high risks" on the commercial side.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, Li struck a more optimistic tone when it comes to the mainland, saying the risk of bad loans there is stable.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The unwinding of the interest rate cycle should ease pressure on the Chinese real estate sector in the medium term, provided that rates continue their downward trajectory. With the impact of stimulus packages beginning to manifest, confidence is gradually returning improving investors, sentiment and activities," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Li's remarks came as the bank delivered a 12 percent increase in its overall net profits in the past financial year, rising to HK$4.6 billion from the HK$4.2 billion in 2023 on the back of US interest rate reductions as well as stimulus measures from Beijing and the SAR government.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bank declared a second interim dividend of HK$0.38 per share, more than double that of the year before, bringing the total annual dividend to HK$0.69 per share, up over 27 percent year-on-year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, Brian Li, the bank's co-chief executive, said the lender has seen a significant increase in demand from mainland customers for wealth management services in the SAR, with the number of mainland clients jumping 60 percent year-on-year.
  <br>
  <br>
  That, he said, helped boost revenue from relevant investment products by 28 percent year-on-year.

    8,500 tickets on offer for Kai Tak Sports Park opening

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government announced on Thursday that 8,500 tickets would be up for grabs for the opening ceremony of the Kai Tak Sports Park on March 1.
 <br>
  <br>
  Tickets will be available starting at 10am on Friday through Urbtix on a first-come, first-served basis, and they will cost HK$10 each.
  <br>
  <br>
  The figure is among the total number of 33,600 seats available for the event, with the government and park operator each responsible for the distribution of 16,800 tickets.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 8,000 tickets will be distributed for free to underprivileged families, charities and other district organisations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism Rosanna Law said while the show that starts at 6.30pm would not be broadcast live, the ceremony would be aired later in the evening by four TV channels at 9.30pm.
  <br>
  <br>
  She pointed out that overseas viewers could also enjoy the broadcast.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For overseas viewers, I think they also can [watch] through the apps or through the channels of our different free TV channels... watch it together with the Hong Kong audience at 9.30pm at home in their countries or in their areas," Law said.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said although the park is able to live stream the event, the government decided not to do that because the broadcast version would be able to showcase the park’s facilities better.
  <br>
  <br>
  Singers, celebrities and athletes from Hong Kong and the mainland were among those slated to perform at the ceremony.
  <br>
  <br>
  Law did not reveal how much the ceremony cost, but she said the government would spend its budget wisely.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I have to give special thanks to all the participating artists and also athletes and performers, most of them actually do not require us to provide a special remuneration, aside from the minimum, for example the makeup or hair-do.”

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 MTR bosses on Thursday unveiled a new "light rail sightseeing route" to take visitors on a tour of the delights of Tuen Mun.
 <br>
  <br>
  From February 22, six "Tuen Mun Voyager" trains will run in a circular route on weekends and public holidays. The journey will last about one hour and 15 minutes, although passengers can hop on and off at any of the 12 stops covered.
  <br>
  <br>
  A travel ambassador will be on board to tell passengers about the sights they can see.
  <br>
  <br>
  The railway company said it has come up with three different itineraries, one for food lovers, another for photography enthusiasts, and a third especially attractive to families.
  <br>
  <br>
  One highlight is Tuen Mun Ferry Pier, where the movie “Beyond the Dream” was filmed, while another is the seafood market near the Sam Shing stop.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jeny Yeung, MTR’s Managing Director for Hong Kong Transport Services, said she hopes the new route will attract people to visit the district as part of the "tourism everywhere" concept.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Tuen Mun is a charming place that not many Hong Kong people know. There are many beautiful landmarks, historical buildings and scenery,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Through this sightseeing route, we hope to draw in locals and tourists to come to Tuen Mun and discover the gems here.”
  <br>
  <br>
  A one-day travel pass costs HK$50 and comes with HK$150 worth of vouchers.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hamas on Thursday released the bodies of four Israeli hostages, said to include a mother and her two children who had long been feared dead and had come to embody the nation's agony following the October 7, 2023, attack on Israel which triggered the Gaza war.
 <br>
  <br>
  The remains were said to be of Shiri Bibas and her two children, Ariel and Kfir, as well as Oded Lifshitz, who was 83 when he was abducted.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kfir, who was 9 months old when he was taken, was the youngest captive.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamas has said all four were killed along with their guards in Israeli airstrikes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The militants displayed four black coffins on a stage in the Gaza Strip surrounded by banners, including a large one depicting Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as a vampire.
  <br>
  <br>
  The fighters then carried the coffins over to Red Cross vehicles, where staffers in red vests covered them in white sheets before placing them inside.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Red Cross convoy headed back to Israel, where authorities will carry out the formal identification of the remains using DNA, expected to take up to two days.
  <br>
  <br>
  Only then will the families be given the final notification. The Israeli military confirmed it had received the coffins.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thousands of people, including large numbers of masked and armed fighters from Hamas and other factions, gathered at the handover site on the outskirts of the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong official who heads an office coordinating the upcoming National Games, Yeung Tak-keung, said he expects around 1,000 spectators to attend a handball tournament serving as a test event for the Games this weekend.
 <br>
  <br>
  The two-day event will take place at the Kai Tak Arena, and comes before the SAR hosts the nationwide sporting tournament with Guangdong and Macau for the first time this autumn.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeung, who's the former sports commissioner, said on Thursday that workers at the Sports Park are ready after a series of trials in recent months.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said officials were making final adjustments for the tournament this weekend, such as making sure the changing rooms are fine as well as the lighting for the court.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Because for handball, sometimes players need to lob the ball high when they go on a fast break. That means they will look up, so we have to adjust the angle of the lights, and how bright they are," Yeung told RTHK in an interview.
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted the Hong Kong Rugby Sevens in late March would also be a test event for the National Games.
  <br>
  <br>
  But while it is the first time the mega event would take place at Kai Tak, Yeung doesn't expect much of a problem because the SAR has a wealth of experience in hosting it.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added the test event for beach volleyball would be held around Easter on the football pitches at Victoria Park, and stalls would be set up nearby to promote Hong Kong culture to spectators.
  <br>
  <br>
  But before that, Yeung said officials want to bring something different for the two-day triathlon trial races starting from March 1.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the past, such events would take place along the harbourfront. But this time, besides having the cycling and running there, a segment of the track will be inside the space for events at the Central Harbourfront," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There will also be stands for the spectators, and other areas for them, so they can be more comfortable, and get a close-up view of the athletes."
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeung said officials would also put up a giant screen in Central for a better viewing experience.

    Hospital doctors to use AI for medical reports

<div class="itemFullText">
 Public hospital doctors will start using generative AI to help them draft medical reports from next month.
 <br>
  <br>
  The technology will be used to summarise a patient's clinical data, including lab results, the Hospital Authority said on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The authority's chief executive, Tony Ko, said the introduction of AI is to save doctors time when preparing their reports.
  <br>
  <br>
  “All the reports have to be finally checked and authorised by the doctor himself, so the doctors will be responsible for the accuracy of the report that truly reflects his or her decision in terms of what the content is to be included in the report,” Ko said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The authority said it will first test the system at Caritas Medical Centre, Princess Margaret Hospital, Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Tin Shui Wai Hospital, Tseung Kwan O Hospital and United Christian Hospital.
  <br>
  <br>
  The authority also said that patients will soon be able to get copies of their medical reports via its HA Go app.

    Officials urged to let vacant public flats quicker

<div class="itemFullText">
 The city's Ombudsman has urged housing authorities to speed up the turnover of recovered public rental flats, such as by shortening the period between taking back a home and issuing a refurbishment order.
 <br>
  <br>
  A probe by the watchdog revealed that it normally took around two and a half months for a home taken back by the Housing Department to be ready for its next tenants to move in, and nearly three months when the Housing Society carries out the process.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The procedures for the recovery of flats by the Housing Department and the Housing Society, and their arrangements for refurbishment and reallocation of recovered flats need further revamping, to speed up turnover of public housing flats and ensure optimal utilisation of precious public housing resources," Ombudsman Jack Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the past five years, the Housing Department has recovered 15,700 public housing flats annually on average. The Housing Society, meanwhile, took back around 1,100 units each year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities have taken steps to expedite the refurbishment of recovered flats since the watchdog launched an investigation last year, Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted that the Housing Department would issue a refurbishment works order within three days of a public housing tenant moving out, while the Housing Society set the period to within two weeks.
  <br>
  <br>
  The watchdog said in its report that the two-week period "might raise doubts among members of the public as to whether it is reasonable".
  <br>
  <br>
  "[The Housing Society] could bring forward the time for notifying the contractors to start work in the estate," Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the Housing Department over the past five years managed to refurbish each recovered flat in 43 days, which is in line with its target.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ninety percent of renovations of homes recovered by the Housing Society met the completion target of 60 days, but Chan said the body should carry out a "comprehensive review" to cut down the refurbishment period.
  <br>
  <br>
  In response, the Housing Department pledged to review and study the recommendations in detail to allocate public housing flats to those in need as soon as possible.
  <br>
  <br>
  The department also noted that it has previously looked into introducing measures such as making sure public housing applicants can move in once the refurbishment of their new home is completed.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump said on Wednesday he expects President Xi Jinping to visit the United States, without giving a timeline for his trip.
 <br>
  <br>
  In remarks made to reporters on Air Force One, Trump also said "it's possible" for the two countries to have a new trade deal.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2020, the US had already agreed to "a great trade deal with China" and a new deal is possible, he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  A conversation or interaction between Xi and Trump is seen as crucial to a potential easing or delay of trade tariffs after the US imposed a 10 percent tariff on goods from China.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi last travelled to the US in November 2023, in his fifth visit to the country as president for a summit with then US president Joe Biden, resulting in agreements to resume military-to-military communications and curb fentanyl production.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We'll have, ultimately, President Xi, we will have everybody coming," Trump said while also speaking about others leaders visiting the US.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump also said he was talking to China about TikTok as the US seeks to broker a sale of the popular app owned by Chinese parent firm ByteDance.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two leaders had spoken just before Trump took office on January 20 and discussed issues including TikTok, trade and Taiwan. Trump said last week he had spoken to Xi since taking office as well, but did not offer details on the topics of that conversation. (Reuters/AFP)

    Legco gives green light to lower Tai Lam Tunnel tolls

<img alt="Fees for private car drivers using the Tai Lam Tunnel will vary depending on the time of day. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1792430_2_20250220130655.jpg&q=70">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lawmakers on Thursday approved plans for lower toll fees at the Tai Lam Tunnel when it comes under government control at the end of May.
 <br>
  <br>
  Instead of the present fixed toll of HK$58, private vehicles will be charged HK$45 during peak hours, HK$30 during regular periods, and HK$18 at quiet times.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tolls for commercial vehicles such as trucks and buses will fall from as high as HK$79 to HK$43 at any time of day, while taxis will be charged HK$28 – less than half the current HK$58 fee.
  <br>
  <br>
  Roundtable lawmaker Michael Tien had proposed making the tunnel free for private cars, motorbikes and commercial vehicles during non-peak hours, but this was rejected by the council, with concerns raised about lost revenue.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tunnel, which stretches between Ting Kau and Yuen Long, is currently owned by a subsidiary of Sun Hung Kai Properties. Its 30-year franchise began in 1995.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Myanmar on Thursday handed over the first batch of hundreds of Chinese scam centre workers who are set to be repatriated through Thailand in the coming days.
 <br>
  <br>
  Thousands of foreigners are expected to be freed and returned from scam compounds in Myanmar in the coming weeks, starting with 600 Chinese over the next three days.
  <br>
  <br>
  The compounds run by criminal gangs are staffed by foreigners, many of whom say they were trafficked and forced to work running internet scams swindling people around the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  Many of those involved are Chinese and Beijing has stepped up pressure on Myanmar and Thailand to shut the centres down.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Karen Border Guard Force, a militia allied with the Myanmar junta, has said it is preparing to deport 10,000 people linked to the compounds in areas it controls on the border with Thailand.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two double-decker coaches delivered a first round of returning workers to the border post in the western Thai town of Mae Sot on Thursday morning.
  <br>
  <br>
  "First group of 50 Chinese have crossed to Thailand and headed to the airport. There will be three more batches (today), each with 50 Chinese," a local border task force official has said.
  <br>
  <br>
  China has put on 16 flights over the next three days to ferry 600 of its nationals home direcly from Mae Sot.
  <br>
  <br>
  The release follows several visits by Public Security Assistant Minister Liu Zhongyi to Bangkok and the border in recent weeks to arrange the repatriation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Scam centres have proliferated across Southeast Asia in recent years, including in Cambodia and the Philippines, as the value of the industry has boomed to billions of US dollars a year. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 US airline Delta on Wednesday said it will offer US$30,000, or HK$233,395, to each passenger on a plane that crashed as it landed at Toronto airport this week.
 <br>
  <br>
  "This gesture has no strings attached and does not affect rights" of passengers, a company spokesman said.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Monday, a Delta Air Lines plane that departed from the US city of Minneapolis, Minnesota, hit the runway hard at Toronto's main airport and flipped upside down.
  <br>
  <br>
  A fireball and thick plumes of black smoke engulfed the plane as it skidded to a halt on its roof but none of the 80 people on board were killed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Delta said 21 passengers were injured in the accident but only one was still hospitalised as of Wednesday morning.
  <br>
  <br>
  Paramedic services said emergency responders dealt with various injuries among the passengers, including back sprains, head injuries, anxiety and headaches.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dramatic footage of the crash posted on social media on Tuesday showed the Bombardier CRJ-900 coming in to land before slamming into the runway, then sliding forward in a roll, with its wings sheared off before it stopped on its back.
  <br>
  <br>
  Canada's Transportation Safety Board launched an investigation, assisted by the US Federal Aviation Administration, Delta and Mitsubishi, which purchased the CRJ line of planes from Bombardier in 2019.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Toronto crash was the latest in a recent string of air incidents in North America, including a midair collision between a US Army helicopter and a passenger jet in Washington that killed 67 people, and a medical transport plane crash in Philadelphia that left seven dead. (AFP)

    Trump brands Zelensky a 'dictator' in bitter clash

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump called Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky a "dictator" on Wednesday, widening a personal rift with major implications for efforts to end the conflict triggered by Russia's military offensive three years ago.
 <br>
  <br>
  The United States has provided essential funding and arms to Ukraine, but Trump made an abrupt policy shift by opening talks with Moscow just weeks after he returned to the White House.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A dictator without elections, Zelensky better move fast or he is not going to have a country left," Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zelensky was elected in 2019 for a five-year term and has remained leader under martial law imposed as his country fights for its survival.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump savaged Zelensky, saying "he refuses to have elections, is very low in Ukrainian polls, and the only thing he was good at was playing (Joe) Biden 'like a fiddle.'"
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the meantime, we are successfully negotiating an end to the War with Russia, something all admit only 'TRUMP,' and the Trump Administration, can do."
  <br>
  <br>
  Zelensky's popularity has fallen, but the percentage of Ukrainians who trust him has never dipped below 50 percent since the conflict started, according to the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under Biden, the United States had lauded Zelensky as a hero and hammered Moscow with sanctions as Ukraine battled against advancing Russian soldiers.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Trump held a press conference on Tuesday in which he tore into the Ukrainian leader and repeated Kremlin narratives such as the claim that Ukraine started the war.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's invective drew shock from Europe where German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said it was "wrong and dangerous" to call Zelensky a dictator.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Washington, Trump's former vice president Mike Pence also issued a stinging rebuke.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Mr President, Ukraine did not 'start' this war. Russia launched an unprovoked and brutal invasion claiming hundreds of thousands of lives," Pence wrote on X. (AFP)

    Taxi, ride-hailing rivalry to intensify: expert

<img alt="Timothy Hau from the University of Hong Kong's Business School says there are more players entering the ride-hailing market. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1792395_1_20250220085201.jpg&q=40">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A transport expert on Thursday said competition between the taxi industry and other ride-hailing services will heat up, after cabbies called off a five-day strike to give authorities more time to carry out enforcement action.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong Tele-call Taxi Association had earlier threatened five days of industrial action from March 5, saying their business was seriously hurt by their unlicensed rivals.
  <br>
  <br>
  The association's chairman, Wong Yu-ting, apologised after a meeting with transport officials for causing "unease" to the public.
  <br>
  <br>
  Professor Timothy Hau from the University of Hong Kong's Business School told
  <a href="https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/news-programmes/this-episode.htm?cmsid=77" target="_blank">
   RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme
  </a>
  that the taxi drivers' “extreme" and "counterproductive” measures had angered the public.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[These measures] just make people madder and upset with them and dissatisfied with their services, which I must say is really getting increasingly worse."
  <br>
  <br>
  Hau noted that there are more players entering the ride-hailing market.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With Gaode entering the picture, and Tada more recently, we have a situation in which the government announced that within a year, they're going to regulate ride-hailing services...and so during this period, a lot of companies will come in and get their foot in the door,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “They would want to ensure that they have a place once all the regulatory policies are issued…It’s going to be a fairly crowded market,” Hau added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The taxi industry has said the government would submit a legislative proposal within this year to regulate ride hailing platforms.
  <br>
  <br>
  They also expressed the hope that authorities would require ride-hailing service providers to attend professional training beforehand, and have their vehicles undergo inspections annually.

    'Constructive' talks after China blasts tariffs at WTO

<img alt="The US, Nicaragua, Namibia, Malaysia, Trinidad and Tobago and Russia took part in the WTO discussions. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1792389_2_20250220104914.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The World Trade Organization (WTO) said on Wednesday that discussions on trade tensions were "constructive", after China accused the US of imposing "tariff shocks" that could upend the global trading system.
 <br>
  <br>
  China condemned tariffs launched or threatened by US President Donald Trump at a World Trade Organization meeting on Tuesday. Washington dismissed China's comments as hypocritical.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has announced sweeping 10 percent tariffs on all Chinese imports, prompting Beijing to respond with retaliatory tariffs and to file a WTO dispute against Washington in what could be an early test of Trump's stance towards the institution.
  <br>
  <br>
  The majority of the six countries that participated in the talks on trade turbulence, put on the agenda by China, raised concern about mounting tensions, but also called for restraint, said WTO spokesperson Ismaila Dieng in a press conference in Geneva on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The United States, Nicaragua, Namibia, Malaysia, Trinidad and Tobago and Russia took part in the discussions, which were part of broader talks on trade.
  <br>
  <br>
  The large majority "stressed the importance of upholding WTO principles and values and called for action to preserve the stability and effectiveness of the global trading system", Dieng added.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is the first time that mounting trade frictions have been formally addressed on the agenda of the watchdog's top decision-making body, the General Council.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, Commerce Minister Wang Wentao expressed strong dissatisfaction with US tariffs on Chinese goods in a letter addressed to the newly confirmed US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The move by the US to unilaterally impose tariffs undermined normal economic and trade cooperation between China and the US", Wang said in the letter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang also said Beijing was willing to work with Washington to "strengthen dialogue, manage differences, promote cooperation" and hoped to create a "fair and predictable policy environment" for the two countries' business communities to cooperate. (Reuters)

    Dead or alive: Mosquito bounty in Manila

<img alt="Enthusiasm is high among residents who carried pails, cups and other containers filled with dengue-spreading mosquitoes to exchange for cash. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1792349_1_20250219211745.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Residents in a central Manila neighbourhood lined up on Wednesday, as dengue cases spike nationwide, to collect a bounty – one peso for every five mosquitoes, dead or alive.
 <br>
  <br>
  Carlito Cernal, village captain in Addition Hills, said the awareness-raising project he initiated could have a "huge impact" on curbing the tropical disease's spread when combined with local clean-up efforts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Philippine health officials and experts were less convinced, but enthusiasm was high among residents who carried pails, cups and other containers filled with dengue-spreading mosquitoes to exchange for cash at the village hall.
  <br>
  <br>
  Iluminado Candasua brought three live specimens in a sealed plastic cup that were duly counted and transferred by village officials to their so-called death chamber, a glass-enclosed UV light machine.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's very hard to capture mosquitoes," Candasua said, explaining how he strategically chose a darkly lit fire station where he used a cup to manually trap the insects against a wall.
  <br>
  <br>
  Candasua said the peso he got for his efforts, worth little more than a US penny, would go into a piggy bank he's using to save for a cellphone for his child.
  <br>
  <br>
  The World Health Organization ranked the Philippines as the country most affected by dengue in the Western Pacific region in 2023 when it had 167,355 cases and 575 deaths.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tropical disease, while rarely fatal, carries symptoms ranging from fever and headaches to swollen glands.
  <br>
  <br>
  The country has seen an "unusual rise" in cases this year, with 28,200 patients recorded as of February 1, according to Department of Health spokesman Dr Albert Domingo, a 40 percent increase from the same period last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Five cities and municipalities have declared outbreaks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Domingo said on Wednesday it was important that local communities consult with health authorities before launching ad hoc efforts, adding that the problem was best addressed by "going back to the fundamentals".
  <br>
  <br>
  "The sooner we clean our surroundings and overturn any possible areas where stagnant water is collecting, then we will have a better fight against dengue," he said, urging residents to protect themselves with insect repellent and long sleeves.
  <br>
  <br>
  Public health expert Anthony Leachon said that while he welcomed all anti-dengue initiatives, the Addition Hills roundup would have "little or no impact at all".
  <br>
  <br>
  Some residents, he warned, might even exacerbate the problem by cultivating mosquitoes for coins.
  <br>
  <br>
  While Rachel Estoque did not intentionally breed mosquitoes, the haul she turned in on Wednesday came from a source of stagnant water in her home.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 45-year-old housewife said she woke up early to catch mosquito larvae growing in water in her flower pot. The 20 larvae earned her four pesos, enough for a tiny packet of cooking oil.
  <br>
  <br>
  But like others waiting to trade in their catch, Estoque said the money was less important than the principle involved.
  <br>
  <br>
  "My child suffered from dengue before and I know how scary and difficult that is... that's why I'm participating in this project," she said. (AFP)

    S&amp;P 500 adds to its record as US stocks drift higher

<img alt="The S&P 500 posts a second straight record following a choppy session amid lingering worries about US tariffs. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1792388_1_20250220073209.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The S&P 500 added to its record as US stock indexes drifted through a quiet Wednesday on Wall Street.
 <br>
  <br>
  The S&P 500 rose 0.2 percent after setting an all-time high the day before. The Dow Jones Industrial Average picked up 71 points, or 0.2 percent, while the Nasdaq composite inched up by 0.1 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Microsoft was the strongest force pushing the S&P 500 upward. It rose 1.3 percent after saying it had developed what it calls the world’s first “quantum processing unit,” which could lead to the development of much more powerful computers. While the gain was relatively modest, Microsoft's gargantuan size gives its stock's movements huge sway on the S&P 500 and other indexes.
  <br>
  <br>
  A 9.7 percent rally for Analog Devices also helped push the market higher. The semiconductor company reported stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected, despite what CEO Vincent Roche called a “challenging macro and geopolitical backdrop.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Elon Musk’s Tesla rose 1.8 percent. It climbed after another electric-vehicle company, Nikola, plunged 39.1 percent following its filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The electric truck maker said it would try to sell off its assets and wind down its business.
  <br>
  <br>
  The yield on the 10-year Treasury eased a bit on Wednesday and edged down to 4.53 percent from 4.55 percent late on Tuesday. It was below 3.70 percent as recently as September and approaching 4.80 percent within the past few weeks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both the bond and the stock markets have increasingly been taking US President Donald Trump’s tariffs in stride, after earlier showing much more trepidation. The hope on Wall Street is that Trump is using such threats merely as a tool to drive negotiations, and the ultimate effects won’t be as bad as they initially appeared.
  <br>
  <br>
  Minutes released for the Fed’s last policy meeting in January showed officials discussed how Trump’s proposed tariffs and mass deportations of migrants, as well as strong consumer spending, could push inflation higher this year
  <br>
  <br>
  In stock markets abroad, London’s FTSE 100 fell 0.6 percent after a report showed UK inflation accelerated to a 10-month high. That could put pressure on the Bank of England, which had been cutting interest rates to invigorate its tepid economy. (AP)

    Mbappé hat-trick dumps City out of Champions League

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Kylian Mbappé struck a brilliant hat-trick for Champions League holders Real Madrid in a 3-1 win over Manchester City, helping Los Blancos reach the last 16 with a 6-3 aggregate victory.
 <br>
  <br>
  Pep Guardiola's side, shorn of key striker Erling Haaland, suffered a painful early exit without laying a glove on the completely dominant 15-time record winners in the Spanish capital, until Nico González tapped home in stoppage time.
  <br>
  <br>
  French superstar Mbappé broke the deadlock with a lob in the fourth minute and netted a fine second after combining with his attacking partners as the English side were sliced open.
  <br>
  <br>
  The striker, in sensational form after a slow start to life at Madrid, completed his treble in the second half with a low strike from the edge of the box to reach seven goals in the competition this season in 10 appearances.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We wanted to win and go through because for us it was logical that Real Madrid would be in the last 16 of the Champions League," Mbappé said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He has scored 28 goals this season, with 18 in his last 18 games across all competitions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I said it before, I didn't come to Real Madrid to play badly," continued Mbappé. "Making my dream come true is one thing, but I want to play well here – mark an era and make history at Real Madrid."
  <br>
  <br>
  City, who won the competition in 2023, were a far cry from their best as has been the case for much of their campaign.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The best team won, they deserve to be there and we don't," admitted Guardiola. "We had a bad year in the competition – when you finish 22nd in the group, it's because we haven't been good.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's been our worst year," he added. "We've been an incredible team and this year, for many reasons, we have lost that consistency."
  <br>
  <br>
  City were dealt bad news before the game with Haaland, who netted twice in the first leg, named on the bench after a suffering a knock at the weekend against Newcastle.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carlo Ancelotti's side performed almost flawlessly from the off and took the lead in the opening stages.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mbappé shrugged off Ruben Dias and lofted the ball over City goalkeeper Ederson after young centre-back Raul Asencio played him in with a long pass.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's not easy when you concede such an early goal," said Guardiola.
  <br>
  <br>
  John Stones limped off for the visitors a few minutes later in another blow for the Premier League champions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mbappé netted his second in the 33rd minute after Madrid's "fantastic four" star players combined. Jude Bellingham fed Vinicius who rolled the ball across for Rodrygo, who nudged it to Mbappé.
  <br>
  <br>
  The former Paris Saint-Germain forward slipped inside to leave the flailing Josko Gvardiol sliding in the wrong direction and drilled home at the near post.
  <br>
  <br>
  Guardiola had claimed City only had "one percent chance" of beating Madrid and his team played like they believed him.
  <br>
  <br>
  Madrid's only blot on their copybook was a booking for Bellingham for fouling England team-mate Phil Foden, leaving him suspended for the last 16 first leg.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bellingham, who caused a stir after being sent off for dissent last weekend in La Liga, was assured in midfield but the night belonged to Mbappé.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 26-year-old completed his hat-trick just after the hour mark, opening up some space on the edge of the box and firing beyond Ederson as City's defence stood off.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mbappé departed to a standing ovation and Madrid fans marvelled at the ease of their team's victory, against an opponent with whom they have shared many close battles in the past decade.
  <br>
  <br>
  The visitors pulled a goal back in stoppage time when Omar Marmoush crashed a free-kick against the crossbar and González rolled home the rebound, but it offered scant consolation.
  <br>
  <br>
  City have now lost 13 games in their last 26 across all competitions, and face Premier League leaders Liverpool next on Sunday, with a battle to finish in the top four on their hands.
  <br>
  <br>
  Next up for Madrid the last 16 is a clash with either city rivals Atletico or German champions Bayer Leverkusen.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We played a complete game in attack, defence, possession and transition," said a satisfied Ancelotti. (AFP)

    Liverpool's title charge dented by Aston Villa draw

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Liverpool's Premier League title charge was slowed by Aston Villa after a pulsating 2-2 draw left neither side satisfied.
 <br>
  <br>
  Arne Slot's men open up an eight-point lead at the top of the table over second-placed Arsenal, but the Gunners now have a game in hand over the Reds.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool led through Mohamed Salah but were also forced to come from behind after Youri Tielemans and Ollie Watkins swung momentum in Villa's favour.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trent Alexander-Arnold's deflected shot secured a point for the visitors, but it should have been more as substitute Darwin Núñez missed a glorious chance to snatch victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You can understand there is one person in the dressing room who feels quite down," said Slot on Núñez's late miss.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If you watch the game back we created far more chances than them, we did everything we needed to do. The only thing that wasn't perfect was conceding from a set-piece."
  <br>
  <br>
  Villa, though, could also have won it in stoppage time as Morgan Rogers and Donyell Malen went close.
  <br>
  <br>
  A point does little for Villa's hope of returning to the Champions League next season as they remain in ninth.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A draw I think is fair for both teams because they had also chances to score," said Villa boss Unai Emery.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool are now 22 Premier League games unbeaten, but a second 2-2 draw in eight days offers Arsenal hope in the title race, especially as Slot's side visit Manchester City on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're happy where we are," added Slot. "A bit too much now we played games where we deserve more than we got. "We want to achieve something together this season and we have all the ingredients for it but still 12 games to go."
  <br>
  <br>
  Marcus Rashford and Marco Asensio were handed their first Villa starts by Unai Emery as he reacted to a disappointing 1-1 draw against 10-man Ipswich on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rashford nearly had a hand in the opening goal but had strayed offside before his cross was turned into his own net by Virgil van Dijk.
  <br>
  <br>
  Villa were masters of their own downfall when the opener did arrive on 29 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Andres Garcia's backpass went straight to Diogo Jota, who unselfishly squared for Salah to fire in his 29th goal of the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Villa were level within nine minutes as Liverpool failed to properly clear a free-kick into the box and the ball fell kindly to Tielemans, who produced a classy finish on the volley.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jota should have restored the visitors' advantage immediately when be blazed high and wide with just Emi Martínez to beat.
  <br>
  <br>
  Instead it was Villa who led at half-time as poor Liverpool defending allowed Watkins a free run to meet Lucas Digne's cross with a header into the far corner.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rashford's one big chance to make his mark for his new club arrived just seconds into the second half when he skipped past the onrushing Alisson Becker, but could not beat Ibrahima Konate's towering presence as the French defender headed wide.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Liverpool onslaught duly followed to extend Slot's run of never having lost an away Premier League game.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jota curled a fine effort from the edge of the box off the bar. Alexander-Arnold was a growing influence on the game when he levelled on the hour mark with the aid of a deflection off Tyrone Mings.
  <br>
  <br>
  Slot threw on Luis Díaz and Núñez off the bench in search of a winner and one of his substitutes should have delivered a vital three points.
  <br>
  <br>
  Núñez had an open goal to aim at after being picked out by Dominik Szoboszlai but fired over to the disbelief of his manager. Martínez then had to rush off his line to deny Nunez another clear run on goal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Villa, though, had the majority of the chances in a frantic finale. Jacob Ramsey's strike was ruled out for offside before Rogers and Malen's powerful drives flew just off target. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Pope Francis's heart is holding up very well despite his pneumonia, a Vatican source said on Wednesday, amid growing concerns over the hospitalised 88-year-old's condition.
 <br>
  <br>
  The pontiff was admitted to a Rome hospital with bronchitis last week after suffering breathing difficulties, but the Holy See revealed on Tuesday evening that he had developed pneumonia in both of his lungs.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The pope spent a peaceful night, woke up and had breakfast," the Vatican said on Wednesday after Francis's fifth night at the Gemelli hospital, which has a suite reserved especially for popes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The pope is breathing on his own. His heart is holding up very well," a source in the Vatican said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Francis has been speaking to friends by telephone, has been out of bed and sitting in a chair, and working on and off, the source said.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Tuesday, the Vatican had reported that Francis was in "good spirits."
  <br>
  <br>
  But in an evening medical bulletin, it warned that "the laboratory tests, chest X-ray, and the Holy Father's clinical condition continue to present a complex picture."
  <br>
  <br>
  A "polymicrobial infection" which has come on top of "bronchiectasis and asthmatic bronchitis, and which required the use of cortisone antibiotic therapy, makes therapeutic treatment more complex," the Vatican said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The follow-up chest CT scan which the Holy Father underwent this afternoon... demonstrated the onset of bilateral pneumonia, which required additional drug therapy," it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The pontiff had part of his right lung cut away when he was 21, after developing pleurisy that almost killed him.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Vatican has cancelled a papal audience on Saturday and said the pope would not attend mass on Sunday, although it has yet to announce plans for his weekly Angelus prayer, which is held on Sunday at midday. (AFP)

    Trump says auto tariffs to be around 25pc

<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump expanded his offensive against trading partners on Tuesday, threatening 25 percent tariffs on imported cars, and similar or higher duties on pharmaceuticals and semiconductors.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump has announced a broad range of levies on some of the biggest US trading partners since taking office in January, arguing that they will help tackle unfair practices – and in some cases using the threats to influence policy.
  <br>
  <br>
  He recently pledged 10 percent duties on all goods coming from China, and 25 on steel and aluminium imports.
  <br>
  <br>
  At his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, he told reporters that tariffs on the automobile industry will "be in the neighbourhood of 25 percent," with specifics to come around April 2.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked about threatened tariffs on pharmaceuticals and chips, Trump said: "It'll be 25 percent and higher, and it'll go very substantially higher over (the) course of a year."
  <br>
  <br>
  He added he wanted to give affected companies time to bring their operations to the United States, saying that he had been contacted by major firms that "want to come back."
  <br>
  <br>
  The president also said that Washington's trading partners could avoid being taxed by investing in factories in the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We want to give them time to come in," he said. "When they come into the United States and they have their plant or factory here, there is no tariff. So we want to give them a little bit of a chance."
  <br>
  <br>
  Experts have warned it is often Americans who end up paying the cost of tariffs on imports, rather than foreign exporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  About 50 percent of the cars sold in the United States are manufactured within the country. Among imports, about half come from Mexico and Canada, with Japan, South Korea and Germany, also major suppliers. (AFP)

    Man Utd spent £14.5mn on sackings including Ten Hag

<div class="itemFullText">
 Manchester United paid a total of £14.5 million (US$18.3 million) to sack manager Erik ten Hag, sporting director Dan Ashworth and other members of their football staff, according to the fallen English giants' latest accounts published on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  United, the 20-time champions of England, are currently a lowly 15th in the Premier League table following Sunday's 1-0 loss at Tottenham, with only West Ham and Wolves between them and the relegation zone.
  <br>
  <br>
  The hope for a 'bounce' in results under new manager Ruben Amorim has failed to materialise since the Portuguese boss replaced Ten Hag, who was sacked in October just 116 days after United triggered a clause to extend the Dutchman's contract until 2026.
  <br>
  <br>
  A costly decision taken by minority owner Jim Ratcliffe's INEOS group was compounded by the rapid exit from Old Trafford of Ashworth, who arrived from Newcastle on July 1 following lengthy talks only to leave on December 8.
  <br>
  <br>
  The financial expense of those decisions was laid bare in United's results for the quarter ending December 31 under 'exceptional items'.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Exceptional items for the quarter were a cost of £14.5 million," said a United press release.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This relates to costs associated with the departure of former men's first team manager Erik ten Hag and various members of football staff."
  <br>
  <br>
  United confirmed in their first quarter results that the pay-off to Ten Hag and his staff was worth £10.4 million, indicating Ashworth's departure cost some £4.1 million. (AFP)

 Emma Raducanu was targeted by "a man who exhibited fixated behaviour" during the WTA 1000 tournament in Dubai, tennis officials said on Wednesday, after the former US Open champion was reduced to tears on court.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 22-year-old Briton was down 2-0 in the first set against Karolina Muchova on Tuesday when she approached the umpire, then briefly took refuge behind the umpire's chair.
  <br>
  <br>
  Muchova went over to see what was wrong before the 2021 New York champion Raducanu reappeared, wiping away tears with her towel.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Women's Tennis Association said it would ban the man after what it called "the security incident in Dubai."
  <br>
  <br>
  "On Monday, February 17, Emma Raducanu was approached in a public area by a man who exhibited fixated behaviour," a statement said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This same individual was identified in the first few rows during Emma's match on Tuesday at the Dubai Duty-Free Tennis Championships and subsequently ejected.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He will be banned from all WTA events pending a threat assessment."
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2022, a London court issued a five-year restraining order against a man who stalked the British tennis star, including making several visits to her home.
  <br>
  <br>
  The WTA said in its statement that it "is actively working with Emma and her team to ensure her well-being and provide any necessary support."
  <br>
  <br>
  It added: "We remain committed to collaborating with tournaments and their security teams worldwide to maintain a safe environment for all players."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Czech Republic's Muchova won the second-round match 7-6 (8/6), 6-4. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Wednesday said they intercepted eight private cars in a citywide undercover operation targeting illegal ride-hailing services.
 <br>
  <br>
  The eight drivers, aged between 36 and 63, were suspected of using their cars for illegal hire or reward.
  <br>
  <br>
  Three vehicles were seized for further investigation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Police will continue to deploy manpower based on operational priorities to combat illegal vehicle hire or reward activities," said Cheng Ho-ming, a senior inspector with the force.
  <br>
  <br>
  The officer did not reveal whether the eight drivers were arrested, and which ride-hailing platforms were involved.
