<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Wednesday said he was encouraged by remarks about Hong Kong in Premier Li Qiang's work report.
 <br>
  <br>
  Addressing delegates at the Great Hall of the People, Li said Beijing will continue to fully implement the One Country, Two Systems policy and ensure Hong Kong and Macau are administered by patriots.
  <br>
  <br>
  The premier also said the central government supports the two SARs in improving their economies and the livelihoods of the people.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee, who attended the opening of the National People's Congress in the capital, said the SAR will continue to unswervingly implement One Country, Two Systems.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a Facebook post, he also said 2025 marks an important year for reforms.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This year marks the final year of the 14th Five-Year Plan, the beginning of the 15th Five-Year Plan formulation, and an important year for further comprehensive deepening of reforms, which has significant meaning for the practice of One Country, Two Systems," he wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CE said he will continue to advance the Northern Metropolis development and innovation initiatives, and strengthen Hong Kong's position as an international financial hub.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chinese companies are doubling down on innovation as part of efforts to contribute to the national drive of developing "new quality productive forces", with leaders convening in Beijing for the annual Two Sessions meetings.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a press event in the capital, Lei Jun, the chairman of Xiaomi, which was originally a smartphone maker but has entered the electric vehicle (EV) space, said technological innovation aided his firm's meteoric rise in recent years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Investment in technological innovation reached 105 billion yuan over the past five years, which helped Xiaomi to become the world's third largest largest smartphone maker, selling some 170 million mobile phones last year, Lei said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sales of its internet-based smart home devices, meanwhile, also fared well, with some 900 million such items being sold, demonstrating the popularity of Chinese tech products around the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lei, who is a deputy to the National People's Congress (NPC), said Xiaomi would continue to invest in technological research and innovation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Manufacturing is the foundation of China and the foundation of a strong country. Xiaomi, as a builder and beneficiary of the manufacturing industry, will continue to adhere to the path of striving for scientific and technological innovation as well as high-end development, ramp up the cultivation of new quality productive forces, apply the latest artificial intelligence technology to all our terminals, to let all consumers experience the wonderful life brought by technologies, and at the same time, contribute our efforts to the development of the Chinese-style modernisation," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also expressed confidence in the country's private sector, after attending a high-profile meeting with President Xi Jinping last month which indicated stronger support from Beijing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Echoing Lei, Zhou Yunjie, chairman of Chinese home appliances firm Haier, who is also an NPC deputy, said that technology helped boost the company's global ambitions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Scientific and technological innovation is a key factor for a brand whether it could stand strong in the world. If an enterprise aims to go global, it has to stick to technological innovation as its solid base, to keep on innovating - until it reaches the top, so that the brand could truly be a top leader. Haier has also been adhering to such a principle, we kept looking up to international standards until we reached breakthroughs," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zhou added that artificial intelligence was a new opportunity for China and that more Chinese firms would be able to create internationally recognised brands.

<img alt="A government work report says GDP growth is tipped to reach five percent in 2025. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1794337_1_20250305115951.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Experts on Wednesday said China's economic goals announced at the opening session of this year's National People's Congress are reasonable and attainable.
 <br>
  <br>
  The government work report delivered by Premier Li Qiang said GDP growth is tipped to reach five percent in 2025. It also said more than 12 million new urban jobs will be created and that authorities are aiming for a two percent increase in the consumer price index.
  <br>
  <br>
  Witman Hung, the Director of the Greater Bay Area Research Center of the China Silk Road iValley Research Institute, said the economic growth target is reasonable.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We should never underestimate the ability of the Chinese government to meet those targets, I mean if you look at the past, they’re pretty good at forecasting and then meeting the target,” Hung told RTHK’s Backchat programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Five percent [GDP growth] is a reasonable estimate. The inflation side, two percent is a good one, it can be anywhere up and down a little bit.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on the same programme, senior fellow at Taihe Institute and the Chairman of Asia Narratives, Einar Tangen, said China had the capacity to deliver on its jobs creation pledge.
  <br>
  <br>
  “You have to remember that China is not like the US or Europe – they’re not guessing what it can be – if they want to create 12 million jobs, they can simply take all the jobs that are being created by the private sector and then add additional jobs directly through the government or through state-owned enterprises, etcetera,” Tangen said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “And in terms of growth rate, I think it’s reasonable. As I said, people have to remember China is not like the rest of the world – they have the tools to do that. It also comes down to cost or how much debt they’re going to pile on, and things like this,” he added.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Premier Li Qiang on Wednesday said the nation will vigorously boost consumption and investment, with domestic demand becoming "the main engine and anchor of economic growth" as stated in his government work report.
 <br>
  <br>
  Among the measures outlined is the issuance of 300 billion yuan of ultra-long treasury bonds to support consumer goods trade-in programmes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Li said Beijing will adopt special measures to boost spending power, increase the supply of quality products and services, and improve the consumption environment.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will create a full range of new consumption scenarios to advance the growth of digital, green, smart, and other types of consumption. We will also introduce measures to unleash the consumption potential in culture and sports-related industries," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The premier also said Beijing will expand effective investment and create greater synergy between fiscal and financial policies.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will implement new mechanisms for public-private partnership in a well-regulated manner and guide more private investment toward major infrastructure and public well-being projects, thus creating more opportunities for the development of private capital," the report said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Li added that 735 billion yuan will be earmarked in the central government's budget for investment this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to Xinhua News Agency, observers believe government policies will not only lead to sustained growth this year but also lay the groundwork for the modernisation drive in the long run, as the country embarks on its next Five-Year Plan from 2026.

<img alt="US President Donald Trump hailed his first few weeks in office, telling Congress his administration had accomplished great things for America. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1794327_1_20250305104833.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump took a victory lap in a speech to Congress on Tuesday, exulting in a series of dramatic actions that have upended American foreign policy, ignited a trade war with close allies and slashed the federal workforce since he took office six weeks ago.
 <br>
  <br>
  "To my fellow citizens, America is back," Trump began to a standing ovation from fellow Republicans.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have accomplished more in 43 days than most administrations accomplish in four years or eight years -- and we are just getting started," Trump said to frequent chants from loyal lawmakers of "USA, USA!"
  <br>
  <br>
  "The American Dream is surging -- bigger and better than ever before. The American Dream is unstoppable, and our country is on the verge of a comeback the likes of which the world has never witnessed, and perhaps will never witness again."
  <br>
  <br>
  The primetime speech, his first to Congress since taking office on January 20, capped a second day of market turmoil after he imposed sweeping new tariffs against Mexico, Canada and China.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump spoke in the House of Representatives, where lawmakers huddled in fear for their lives a little over four years ago while a mob of Trump supporters ransacked the Capitol in an unsuccessful effort to overturn Joe Biden's 2020 victory over the then-incumbent Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  The president called his first few weeks in office "the most successful" first month of any US presidency in history.
  <br>
  <br>
  He will also defended his tariff campaign, despite concerns that it could raise consumer prices and slow economic growth.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Whatever they tariff us, we tariff them. Whatever they tax us, we tax them," Trump said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If they do non-monetary tariffs to keep us out of their market, then we do non-monetary barriers to keep them out of our market."
  <br>
  <br>
  World leaders were watching Trump's speech closely, a day after he paused all military aid to Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  The suspension followed an Oval Office blowup in which Trump angrily upbraided Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in front of TV cameras.
  <br>
  <br>
  The pause in aid threatened Kyiv's efforts to defend against Russia, and further rattled European leaders worried that Trump is moving the US too far toward Moscow.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's 25 percent tariffs on Mexico and Canada, two of the country's closest allies, and an additional 10 percent on Chinese imports deepened investor concerns about the economy.

 Premier Li Qiang on Wednesday said Beijing would continue to fully implement the One Country, Two Systems policy and have the two SARs administered by patriots.

  <br>
  <br>
  "We will improve institutions and policies for promoting economic and cultural exchanges and cooperation across the Taiwan Strait and advance integrated cross-strait development to improve the well-being of Chinese people on both sides," the report said, adding that China will firmly advance the cause of reunification.
  <br>

 China on Wednesday said it will boost support for the application of AI models to foster more breakthroughs in technology.

  It was the first time AI models were mentioned in the work report, which comes after the emergence of Chinese AI startup DeepSeek.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China will strive to create an enabling environment for innovation that encourages exploration and tolerates failure," the report added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The report also highlighted the development of new quality productive forces, with the aim to foster emerging and future industries, such as quantum technology and the low-altitude economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the report laid out ways the country would deepen multilateral and regional economic cooperation, saying Beijing will continue to expand the nation’s globally-oriented network of free trade areas.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We will resolutely safeguard the WTO-centred multilateral trading system, broaden converging interests with other countries and promote shared development,” it said. (Additional reporting by Reuters)

 Hong Kong stocks rose 1.13 percent at the open on Wednesday, after Premier Li Qiang announced a target GDP growth of "around 5 percent" for 2025 and pledged to make domestic demand the "main engine" of its economic growth.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Hang Seng Index was up 258 points at 23,200 at the open.
  <br>
  <br>
  The GDP growth target was announced on Wednesday in a report being presented by Premier Li at the opening session of the National People's Congress.

  The Trump administration imposed tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico starting on Tuesday and doubled tariffs against imports from China. All three countries have announced retaliatory actions, sparking worries about a slowdown in the global economy. (Agencies)

    Arab leaders endorse Egypt's plan to rebuild Gaza

<img alt="Egyptian foreign minister Badr Abdelatty (R) meets with Jordanian foreign minister Ayman Safadi (L) to discuss details of the Gaza reconstruction plan, ahead of the emergency Arab summit in Cairo.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Arab leaders on Tuesday endorsed Egypt's postwar plan for Gaza that would allow its roughly two million Palestinians to remain, in a counterproposal to US President Donald Trump’s plan to depopulate the territory and redevelop it as a beach destination.
 <br>
  <br>
  The US$53 billion plan's endorsement by Arab leaders at a summit in Cairo amounted to a rejection of Trump’s proposal.
  <br>
  <br>
  The summit conclusions were welcomed by Hamas, rejected by Israel and given a lukewarm response by the Trump administration.
  <br>
  <br>
  Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi expressed his appreciation for “the consensus among the Arab countries to support the reconstruction plan for the Gaza Strip, which allows the Palestinian People to stay on their land without displacement.”
  <br>
  <br>
  In a social media post after the summit, el-Sissi said he looked forward to working with Trump, other Arab nations and the international community “to adopt a plan that aims for a comprehensive and just settlement of the Palestinian Issue, ends the root causes of the Israeli Palestinian conflict, guarantees the security and stability of the peoples of the region and establishes the Palestinian State."
  <br>
  <br>
  The White House welcomed input from Arab nations, but insisted Hamas could not remain in power.
  <br>
  <br>
  “President Trump has been clear that Hamas cannot continue to govern Gaza,” White House National Security Council spokesman Brian Hughes said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “While the President stands by his bold vision for a post-war Gaza, he welcomes input from our Arab partners in the region. It’s clear his proposals have driven the region to come to the table rather than allow this issue to devolve into further crisis.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamas welcomed the summit’s outcome, saying it marked a new phase of Arab and Islamic alignment with the Palestinian cause and that it valued Arab leaders’ rejection of attempts to transfer Palestinians from their territories in Gaza and the occupied West Bank.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel has embraced what it says is an alternative US proposal for the ceasefire itself and the release of hostages taken in Hamas' attack on southern Israel on October 7, 2023, which triggered the war.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel has blocked the entry of food, fuel, medicine and other supplies to Gaza to try to get Hamas to accept the new proposal and has warned of additional consequences, raising fears of a return to fighting. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China on Wednesday said it will aim for economic growth of around 5 percent in 2025.
 <br>
  <br>
  A government work report delivered by Premier Li Qiang at the start of the National People's Congress session also outlined other goals for the year, including a surveyed urban unemployment rate of around 5.5 percent, over 12 million new urban jobs, and an around 2 percent increase in the consumer price index.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In setting the growth rate at around five percent, we have taken into account the need to stabilise employment, prevent risks and improve the people's well-being, as well as the potential for growth and the conditions supporting growth," the document said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A target of around five percent is well aligned with our mid- and long-term development goals and underscores our resolve to meet difficulties head-on and strive hard to deliver," the document added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The world's second-largest economy grew by 5 percent in 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  China also aims for a budget deficit of 4 percent of GDP in 2025, up from 3 percent a year ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to the work report, China will support and encourage private investment, and guide more private investment toward major infrastructure and public well-being projects.
  <br>
  <br>
  The country will issue 500 billion yuan of special treasury bonds this year to support large state-owned commercial banks in replenishing capital.
  <br>
  <br>
  The report said that central authorities are keenly aware of the problems and challenges confronting China.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Internationally, changes unseen in a century are unfolding across the world at a faster pace,” Li said, describing them as increasingly complex and severe.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Global economic growth lacks steam, unilateralism and protectionism are on the rise, the multilateral trading system is experiencing disruptions and tariff barriers continue to increase.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The premier also noted that the "foundation for China‘s sustained economic recovery and growth is not strong enough", saying that demand is weak and consumption is sluggish.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Greater efforts need to be made to address social problems and guard against risks," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will stay committed to pursuing progress while ensuring stability." (Additional reporting by Xinhua)

    China's Liu Jiakun wins Pritzker Prize

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Pritzker Prize, dubbed the 'Nobel' for architecture, was awarded on Tuesday to China's Liu Jiakun, for designs that celebrate "everyday lives".
 <br>
  <br>
  "In a global context where architecture is struggling to find adequate responses to fast evolving social and environmental challenges, Liu Jiakun has provided convincing answers that also celebrate the everyday lives of people as well as their communal and spiritual identities," the award's jury wrote in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Born in 1956, Liu has worked on more than 30 projects in China ranging from academic and cultural institutions to civic spaces and commercial buildings.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Architecture should reveal something - it should abstract, distill and make visible the inherent qualities of local people," Liu said in the statement, evoking his craft's capacity to create "a sense of shared community".
  <br>
  <br>
  Liu lives and works in his birth city of Chengdu, where he prioritises the use of local materials and traditional building techniques.
  <br>
  <br>
  His projects include the Museum of Clocks in Chengdu, a large circular structure with a skylight that illuminates an interior strip of photographs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alejandro Aravena, who won the award in 2016 and is chair of the jury, said Liu's works offer "clues on how to confront the challenges of urbanisation" especially because they are sometimes "a building, infrastructure, landscape and public space at the same time".
  <br>
  <br>
  "Cities tend to segregate functions, but Liu Jiakun takes the opposite approach and sustains a delicate balance to integrate all dimensions of the urban life," Aravena said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liu, who is the 54th recipient of the Pritzker Prize, will be honoured at a celebration in Abu Dhabi in spring, award organisers said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last year's prize went to Japan's Riken Yamamoto, whose projects are credited with promoting human contact and who said at the time his objective was to "design architecture that can bring joy to people around it". (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 US stocks ended lower on Tuesday, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq veering near correction territory, as trade tensions escalated following US President Donald Trump's new tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 25 per cent tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada, along with doubled duties on Chinese goods, took effect on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Nasdaq Composite ended lower after veering into correction territory during the session but pared losses in choppy trading. The index closed down 9.3 per cent from its record closing high on December 16.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shares in financials and industrials were the biggest losers among the benchmark S&P 500's 11 main sectors.
  <br>
  <br>
  Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase & Co fell 6.2 per cent and nearly 4 per cent, respectively, sending the bigger banks index down 4.7 per cent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CBOE market volatility index rose 3.20 per cent to its highest since December 20.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.55 per cent, to 42,520, the S&P 500 lost 1.22 per cent, to 5,778 and the Nasdaq Composite lost 0.35 per cent, to 18,285.
  <br>
  <br>
  Car makers Ford and General Motors, which have vast supply chains across North America, fell 2.9 per cent and 4.6 per cent, respectively. The domestically focused Russell 2000 index dropped 1 per cent. (Reuters)

<img alt="A finance expert says the Chinese response is very firm and shows determination to the US. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1794282_1_20250305085101.jpg&q=60">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An economist on Wednesday said that the latest round of US tariffs on Chinese imports could gradually reduce China's gross domestic product by some 0.3 to 0.4 percent over a 12-month period.
 <br>
  <br>
  The comments came as US President Donald Trump slapped an additional 10 percent tariff on all Chinese goods entering the US. That prompted Beijing to retaliate, including a tariff on US agricultural products, export restrictions on select companies and a lawsuit at the World Trade Organization.
  <br>
  <br>
  Le Xia, Chief Economist for Asia at BBVA Research, said Beijing's measures were "measured and calibrated".
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think that the Chinese response is very firm and shows determination to the US," he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "At the same time, if you look at the coverage of all these agricultural products, I think in total it's a kind of maybe around 20 percent of the total US imports, so that means the Chinese response is still measured – it leaves the room for the negotiations."
  <br>
  <br>
  Xia also said he was not optimistic that both sides could reach a deal in the short term.
  <br>
  <br>
  "President Trump, he's too busy, he has so many things on his agenda, like the Ukraine crisis, and imposing tariffs on other partners like Canada and Mexico,“ he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Tuesday angrily denounced Trump's "dumb" tariffs and accused the US president of seeking to collapse Canada's economy in order to annex its northern neighbour.
  <br>
  <br>
  RTHK's US correspondent Simon Marks said there is currently a "massive" rift between the two countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We heard Trudeau using language about the United States and its government that we have never heard in the past from any previous Canadian leader."
  <br>
  <br>
  However, Marks said there are signs there could be a possible breakthrough.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have heard from the United States commerce secretary Howard Lutnick, who is a very close advisor to president Donald Trump, that there could be a climb-down coming by the US government."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lutnick said there has been an enormous amount of phone conversations between Canadian and Mexican officials and the United States, according to Marks. (Additional reporting by AFP)

<img alt="Arsena's 7-1 win over PSV was their biggest victory away from home in any Champions League match. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1794271_2_20250305071751.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Real Madrid claimed a small edge on city rivals Atlético Madrid with a tight 2-1 Champions League last 16 first-leg win.
 <br>
  <br>
  Julián Alvarez levelled for Atlético after Rodrygo Goes sent the hosts ahead, but Brahim Díaz stroked home the winner for the record 15-time winners to delight the Santiago Bernabeu stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  Diego Simeone's Atlético, who lost in the 2014 and 2016 finals against their bitter rivals, kept stars Vinicius Junior and Kylian Mbappé quiet but still came up short.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Rojiblancos played it safe in the final stages, seeming to accept their one-goal disadvantage for the second leg derby clash at home next week.
  <br>
  <br>
  Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti opted for Morocco international Díaz in midfield to replace the suspended Jude Bellingham and selected Fede Valverde at right-back after he was passed fit to play.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Italian had demanded his side show a better attitude and more commitment than during their La Liga defeat by Real Betis on Saturday and his charges delivered.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rodrygo pounced after just four minutes, slipping inside Javi Galán to collect Valverde's teasing pass before firing home with his left foot across Jan Oblak and inside the far post.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For a moment we had the game under control, but we knew that it would not be an easy match, because they were at home and they have great players," Alvarez said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But we know there are 90 minutes to go," he added. "It's one goal, and another game, at home with our fans."
  <br>
  <br>
  It was the Brazilian winger's fifth strike of the tournament, habitually shining on the European stage for Madrid, where he boasts 25 goals in 61 appearances.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rodrygo wanted a penalty when Galán appeared to hold him back in the area but his appeals were waved away.
  <br>
  <br>
  Atlético host Real Madrid next week at the Metropolitano stadium, with the winner facing Arsenal or PSV Eindhoven in the quarter-finals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal all but ensured a quarter-final berth as they crushed a shambolic PSV 7-1 in Eindhoven.

  <br>
  Jurrien Timber headed Arsenal into the lead on 18 minutes before Ethan Nwaneri smashed a second. Mikel Merino, from a narrow angle, put the visitors three goals up in just the 31st minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  Noa Lang hit back with a PSV penalty before half-time. But Martin Odegaard slotted home a rebound and Leandro Trossard dinked a goal as Arsenal scored twice in the first three minutes of the second half.
  <br>
  <br>
  Odegaard added another with 12 minutes left and then set up defender Riccardo Calafiori, a first-half replacement, to round off the scoring.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We were fluid. We had enthusiasm, the drive and the hunger," Arsenal midfielder Declan Rice said. "We need to keep pushing as a team with the mentality." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Volodymyr Zelensky on Tuesday said he wanted to "make things right" with Donald Trump and work under the US president's "strong leadership" to secure a lasting peace in Ukraine.
 <br>
  <br>
  In his first public comments since Trump halted US military aid to Ukraine, Zelensky said his public bust-up with Trump last week was "regrettable" and pledged to sign a key minerals deal with Washington.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also called for a "truce" in the sea and sky as a first step to ending the three-year war with Russia.
  <br>
  <br>
  A dramatic collapse in the Kyiv-Washington wartime alliance has played out in the open since a televised dispute between Zelensky and Trump in the Oval Office last week, mounting as Ukraine's top ally suspended crucial military aid.
  <br>
  <br>
  "My team and I stand ready to work under President Trump's strong leadership to get a peace that lasts," Zelensky wrote on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our meeting in Washington, at the White House on Friday, did not go the way it was supposed to be," the Ukrainian leader added. "It is time to make things right."
  <br>
  <br>
  He told Ukrainians in his regular evening address he had instructed his defence and intelligence chiefs to contact their US counterparts to "get official information" on the aid freeze.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's stunning decision Monday to halt assistance to Ukraine deepened fears in Kyiv and many European capitals that America was pivoting away from its allies -- and towards Russia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Moscow hailed Trump's decision, with Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov calling it a "solution which could really push the Kyiv regime to a peace process".
  <br>
  <br>
  The European Union, which -- along with Ukraine -- is excluded from US-Russian negotiations towards a potential truce, has been scrambling to bolster support for Kyiv.
  <br>
  <br>
  French President Emmanuel Macron praised Zelensky for his willingness to "re-engage in dialogue" with Trump, his office said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Still, Europe is fearing for the future of US-European defence cooperation.
  <br>
  <br>
  European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen presented an EU plan to mobilise some 800 billion euros (US$840 billion) for Europe's defence.
  <br>
  <br>
  Germany's likely next chancellor, Friedrich Merz, meanwhile said he would support the immediate approval of a three-billion-euro Ukraine aid package held up in parliament, calling it "urgent".
  <br>
  <br>
  The EU on Thursday is to hold an emergency summit aimed at cementing joint European support for Ukraine. (AFP)

    Mavs' Irving ruled out for NBA season with ACL injury

<div class="itemFullText">
 Dallas Mavericks All Star guard Kyrie Irving will miss the rest of the NBA season after suffering a torn anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) in his left knee, according to media reports.
 <br>
  <br>
  Irving sustained the injury during Monday's loss to the Sacramento Kings and the news is a massive blow to a Mavericks team already grappling with a turbulent season following the trade of star Luka Doncic to the Los Angeles Lakers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Irving, 32, hyperextended his knee, falling while he drove to the basket and was carried off court.
  <br>
  <br>
  ESPN and The Athletic cited sources saying the injury had been confirmed as a season-ending ACL.
  <br>
  <br>
  After Irving left the court, Jaden Hardy then turned his ankle in the third quarter and had to leave the game, adding to a growing injury list.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dallas, beaten by the Boston Celtics in last year's NBA finals, has been reeling since trading superstar Doncic to the Los Angeles Lakers in early February for Anthony Davis, a blockbuster move aimed at retooling the roster around Irving and Davis.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, Davis has been sidelined with an adductor strain, while P.J Washington, Dereck Lively, Daniel Gifford and Caleb Martin are all on the injury list.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Mavericks have lost four of their last five games.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It just seems every time we get close to get someone back, someone else goes down, we are running out of bodies here," said Mavs head coach Jason Kidd after Monday's loss. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Virat Kohli produced a trademark innings with a polished 84 as India pulled off a tense chase to beat Australia by four wickets in the first semi-final of the Champions Trophy.
 <br>
  <br>
  Set 265 for victory, India lost the 36-year-old Kohli in the closing overs but KL Rahul's unbeaten 42 steered the team home with 11 balls to spare at the Dubai International Stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  They will face South Africa or New Zealand in the final on Sunday in Dubai, with India playing all their matches at the venue after they refused to tour hosts Pakistan for the eight-nation event.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lahore was the alternative venue for the final had India missed out.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This game is all about pressure, especially in big games like semis and finals," said player of the match Kohli.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If you go deep into the innings and have wickets in hand, the opposition usually gives in and the game becomes easier. It is very important to control your impulses while the game is going on."
  <br>
  <br>
  Australia elected to bat and posted 264 all out after strong knocks from captain Steve Smith, who made 73, and Alex Carey, who hit 61.
  <br>
  <br>
  In reply India lost two early wickets before Kohli and Shreyas Iyer, who made 45, put the chase back on track in their partnership of 91.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I take pride in doing what my team wants," added the 36-year-old Kohli. "Individual records don't matter anymore for me. It's just about stepping out and hopefully doing the job for the team."
  <br>
  <br>
  "He's arguably the best chaser the game has seen. He's done it numerous times against us," Smith said of Kohli. "He controls the tempo of the game really well, plays to his strengths and takes the game deep."
  <br>
  <br>
  Cooper Connolly, in the team in place of the injured Matthew Short who was forced out of the tournament on Monday, trapped skipper Rohit Sharma lbw on 28 for his first ODI wicket.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kohli and Iyer then took stock against an inexperienced Australian attack missing fast bowlers Pat Cummins, Josh Hazlewood to injuries and Mitchell Starc for personal reasons.
  <br>
  <br>
  But leg-spinner Adam Zampa bowled Iyer before Nathan Ellis rattled the stumps of Axar Patel for 27. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Beijing said on Tuesday it had filed a complaint with the World Trade Organization against the United States over President Donald Trump's tariff increases on Chinese goods.
 <br>
  <br>
  The statement comes a day after Trump ordered additional tariffs against Chinese goods, increasing previously imposed 10 percent levies to 20 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The United States' unilateral tax measures seriously violate WTO rules and undermine the foundation of China-US economic and trade cooperation," the Commerce Ministry said in a statement, adding that it was "strongly dissatisfied and firmly opposed" to the tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  In response to the US tariffs, Beijing has imposed new duties on a range of agricultural imports from the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  The additional 15 percent tariffs on products including chicken, wheat, corn and cotton are due to come into effect next week.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China will, in accordance with WTO rules, firmly safeguard its legitimate rights and interests and defend... the international economic and trade order," the Commerce Ministry statement added.
  <br>
  <br>
  A WTO official confirmed to AFP that the new complaint from China had been received. (AFP)

    CK Hutchison to sell Panama unit after Trump pressure

<img alt="The sale to a BlackRock consortium will deliver cash proceeds in excess of US$19 billion to Hong Kong's CK Hutchison. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1794251_1_20250305042524.jpg&q=25">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's CK Hutchison on Tuesday agreed to sell its interests in a key Panama Canal port operator to a BlackRock Inc-backed consortium, following intense pressure from US President Donald Trump.
 <br>
  <br>
  The US$22.8 billion sale, which also includes dozens of ports in other countries, appeared to be a win for Trump's aggressive diplomacy just hours before he is due to tout the successes of the first six tumultuous weeks of his second term in an address to the US Congress. Trump had refused to rule out military action to assert US control over the canal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has complained about the presence of mainland Chinese and Hong Kong-based companies in Panama, while US officials and politicians have said CK Hutchison's control of ports at both entrances of the canal represents a security risk for the operation.
  <br>
  <br>
  The sale of licenses will result in the consortium gaining a 90 percent stake in Panama Ports Company, which has been the operator of the Balboa and Cristobal ports in the Central American country for more than two decades, CK Hutchison said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  BlackRock has briefed the White House and Congressional leadership on the deal, a person familiar with the transaction said.
  <br>
  <br>
  This would be BlackRock's largest infrastructure investment to date, that person said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US State Department, White House, National Security Council and Panama's government did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
  <br>
  <br>
  The canal is operated by the Panama Canal Authority, an autonomous agency overseen by the Panamanian government.
  <br>
  <br>
  Panama's authorities have announced an audit of CK Hutchison's contract, saying they are investigating its compliance with concession agreements. Panama's attorney general determined earlier this month that CK Hutchison's port contract was "unconstitutional." The Supreme Court was to have had the last word on its legal status.
  <br>
  <br>
  US Secretary of State Marco Rubio made his first overseas trip as top US diplomat to Latin America last month, including to Panama, where he pressured the country over China's presence along the canal. After his departure, Rubio hailed Panama's decision to exit China's Belt and Road infrastructure plan, and he has expressed optimism in media interviews that Hutchison would not own the ports in the future.
  <br>
  <br>
  The sale of Panama ports licenses held by the unit of billionaire Li Ka-shing's conglomerate to a consortium that includes BlackRock, Global Infrastructure Partners and Terminal Investment will give it control of an 80 percent interest in Hutchison Ports for an equity value of US$14.21 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  It will get control of 43 ports comprising 199 berths in 23 countries while delivering cash proceeds in excess of US$19 billion for the Hong Kong-based consortium.
  <br>
  <br>
  The sale does not involve any interest in Hutchison Port Holdings Trust, which operates ports in Hong Kong and Shenzhen, as well as South China, or any other ports in mainland China, CK Hutchison said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The consortium has agreed that negotiations will be on an exclusive basis for a period of 145 days, the company said.
  <br>
  <br>
  BlackRock completed the acquisition of Global Infrastructure Partners for approximately US$12.5 billion in cash and stock last October. At the time, chairman and CEO Larry Fink described infrastructure as “a generational investment opportunity.” (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 World number one Judd Trump made a winning start in Hong Kong, beating Gary Wilson to advance to the last 16 of the World Snooker Grand Prix at Kai Tak Arena.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump, who recently obtained Hong Kong residency through the Quality Migrant Admission Scheme, was playing on home soil for the first time.
  <br>
  <br>
  But it was fellow Englishman Wilson who started off strong and took the first frame. Trump struck back with a 142 break to level things up, before going on to win the best-of-seven match 4-2.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 35-year-old will next face another Englishman Jack Lisowski.
  <br>
  <br>
  In other first-round action, English stars Shaun Murphy and David Gilbert both secured narrow 4-3 victories to reach the last 16.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism, Rosanna Law, was in attendance and officiated at the opening ceremony.
  <br>
  <br>
  She hoped the ranking tournament will be a huge success and hoped that players and visitors would have an unforgettable experience.
  <br>
  <br>
  This six-day event marks the first official sports competition at the Kai Tak Sports Park, with over 4,200 people attending on the first day.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A Beijing official overseeing Hong Kong and Macau affairs has told delegates to the national legislative body to ride on the stock market boom and boost economic development in the territory.
 <br>
  <br>
  Xia Baolong, the director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, also expressed confidence that the city can "weather the storm" in face of challenges posed by geopolitics.
  <br>
  <br>
  He made the comments on Tuesday during a closed-door exchange with National People's Congress (NPC) delegates from the two SARs.
  <br>
  <br>
  The city's sole delegate to the NPC Standing Committee, Starry Lee, said the central government highly recognised the work of the Hong Kong administration on supporting the economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said the city's economy has been relatively stable, and achieved moderate growth of 2.5 percent last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We all understand that Hong Kong’s economy is relatively stable … especially the stock market, the volume [went up]. All these [were contributed by] the support of the central government," she told reporters after the meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the coming future, we will continue as NPC (members) to act as (contributors) to the economic development, and to improve the livelihood of Hong Kong people."
  <br>
  <br>
  NPC delegate Ma Fung-kwok said the director singled out the city's stock market as an area of focus.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[Xia] did mention the stock market rally in recent months. He said if this trend continues, it will certainly boost Hong Kong's economy," Ma said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked if geopolitics had been part of the conversation, the delegates quoted Xia as saying that some of the pressure faced by the country would "inevitably pass down to Hong Kong", but such challenges could be overcome.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, the office said Xia expressed the hope for the delegates to perform their duties "with a sense of responsibility and mission" and reflect public opinion.
  <br>
  <br>
  The statement went on to say the director told the members to fully support their respective SAR governments.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xia urged Hong Kong delegates to expedite the city's transition from stability to prosperity, and those from Macau to promote moderate economic diversification, the statement added.

    EU chief unveils US$840 billion 'rearm' plan

<div class="itemFullText">
 EU chief Ursula von der Leyen on Tuesday presented a five-part plan to mobilise some US$844 billion for Europe's defence, and help provide "immediate" military support for Ukraine after Washington suspended military aid.
 <br>
  <br>
  The move came hours after US President Donald Trump announced the aid freeze, intensifying Washington's push for a peace deal with Russia and confirming its pivot away from its European allies and partners in backing Kyiv's war effort.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A new era is upon us," the European Commission president said in a letter presenting the plan to EU leaders, two days before a summit aimed at cementing joint action on support for Ukraine and boosting Europe's defences.
  <br>
  <br>
  "'Rearm Europe' could mobilise close to US$844 billion of defence expenditures for a safe and resilient Europe," von der Leyen told reporters as she outlined the plan, which includes a US$158 billion loan facility along with steps to free up large-scale defence investments.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was not immediately clear how fast funds could be made available under the proposals, which need approval by member states, nor how quickly this could translate into battlefield support for Kyiv.
  <br>
  <br>
  It proposes that the EU ease strict budget rules, which oblige states to keep public deficits below three percent of gross domestic product, to allow them to ramp up spending on defence.
  <br>
  <br>
  Secondly, the plan calls for a new "instrument" to provide US$157 billion of loans to member states for defence investment.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are talking about pan-European capability domains - for example, air and missile defence, artillery systems, missiles and ammunition drones and anti-drone systems," said von der Leyen.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thursday's Brussels summit, after weekend crisis talks also involving Britain and Nato, comes as Europe contemplates the prospect of the United States withdrawing longer-term support from Ukraine and more broadly from its European allies. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The founding president of the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) has died last Sunday at the age of 87.
 <br>
  <br>
  Professor Woo Chia-wei led the university between 1991 and 2001.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement on Tuesday, HKUST council chairman Harry Shum said Woo's departure marked an irreplaceable loss to the university, Hong Kong and the global academic community.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Professor Woo was one of the few individuals with both grand visions and strong capability of execution. With unwavering dedication, he led the establishment of HKUST, transforming a bold vision into a world-class institution renowned for its pioneering research, innovation, and global impact, especially during a time when Hong Kong was in a critical juncture of transitioning to a knowledge-based economy,” he said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Current HKUST president, Nancy Ip, who worked alongside Woo for eight years when he was in charge, was also saddened by the news.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A man of extraordinary foresight, Professor Woo envisioned and empowered HKUST as a catalyst for Hong Kong's transformation. He forged a culture of excellence, recruiting distinguished faculty, designing cutting-edge curricula, and fostering partnerships with leading global institutions," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Woo’s son, Wu Dekai, expressed gratitude to the love and support his family has received during a difficult time. Also a professor at HKUST's Department of Computer Science and Engineering, he strived to carry forward his father's innovation, determination and can-do spirit.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other than his role in the university, the elder Woo also held positions in several government committees, and was appointed a member of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference in 1998.
  <br>
  <br>
  The physicist had also earned the Gold Bauhinia Star and Commander of the British Empire.

 The chairman of a leading casino and hospitality group in Macau said on Tuesday that Hong Kong and Macau should work together to attract more foreign investors.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on the sidelines of the Two Sessions in Beijing, Galaxy Entertainment Group chairman Francis Lui said Macau’s leisure industry has been developing steadily in recent years.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said he has full confidence in the industry’s future development, adding that the two SARs can work together to take business to a new level.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Hong Kong and Macau, we have a common objective in making sure that there will be more foreign players, customers and investors coming over,” he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I think we should cooperate with each other, making sure that all the hardware, all the services and all the resources behind Hong Kong and Macau could be working together to make sure that we bring in foreign investors.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Lui, a member of the National Committee of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference, said Hong Kong’s economic development is an issue for delegates.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said he hopes the central government will introduce measures during the Two Sessions that will help revitalise the city’s economy.

    China to firmly defend its interests: ambassador

<div class="itemFullText">
 China's ambassador to the United States says while China needs to firmly defend its interests, it will continue to handle Sino-US relations based on mutual respect, peaceful coexistence, and win-win cooperation.
 <br>
  <br>
  Xie Feng’s comments came after US President Donald Trump's order to further raise tariffs on Chinese imports, from 10 to 20 percent, took effect on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  China retaliated against the tariffs by announcing additional levies of up to 15 percent on various US agricultural products, including chicken, wheat, corn and cotton from March 10.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xie said those who start conflicts by harming others will ultimately hurt themselves.
  <br>
  <br>
  “On the one side, we must acknowledge the significant challenges facing China-US relations. On the flip side, we should maintain our confidence in China's progress and the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, staying determined. Whether it’s a tariff war or trade war, such disputes often begin by harming others but end up hurting oneself," he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xie is currently in Beijing for the annual meeting of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.

<div class="itemFullText">
 China vowed on Tuesday to fight to the "bitter end" if the United States pushes a trade war, after Washington and Beijing exchanged a salvo of tariffs.
 <br>
  <br>
  "If the United States... persists in waging a tariff war, a trade war, or any other kind of war, the Chinese side will fight them to the bitter end," Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian said.
  <br>
  <br>
  China retaliated against fresh US tariffs, announcing up to 15 percent increases to import levies covering a range of American agricultural and food products.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also placed 25 US firms under export and investment restrictions on national security grounds.
  <br>
  <br>
  China's countermeasures are to protect its own rights and interests, Lin told a regular press conference, urging Washington to return to dialogue and cooperation as soon as possible. (Agencies)

    CPPCC outlines modernisation push and self-improvement

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) outlined efforts to advance Chinese modernisation and refine standards and procedures at the start of the top political advisory body's annual session in Beijing on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Addressing 2,000 or so delegates -- as well as President Xi Jinping and other state leaders -- at the Great Hall of the People, Wang Huning also used his work report to note areas for improvement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We need to improve the CPPCC consultation systems and mechanisms, and the mechanisms for adopting, implementing, and providing feedback on consultation outcomes," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We need to expand the coverage of channels and platforms for bolstering unity and friendship, intensify implementation of measures in consultative oversight, and give full play to the unique role of different sectors. Going forward, we will take solid steps to make improvements in these aspects."
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang also recapped the party's achievements in the past year, saying the main economic and social development targets were accomplished, while major strides were made in the country's modernisation drive.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Hong Kong and Macau, the chairman said a system was implemented to facilitate visits by their delegates, as well as young people from the two SARs.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We continued to arrange inspection tours aimed at deepening exchanges and cooperation between the mainland and Hong Kong and Macau, and supported the organisation of report sessions to update young people in Hong Kong and Macau on national conditions as a form of campus outreach," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Last year, National Committee members held 75 report sessions in the two regions."
  <br>
  <br>
  Wrapping up his half-hour speech, Wang declared the further deepening of reform as both a "formidable task and a glorious mission", and urged everyone to forge ahead with firm confidence and collective strength.

    Octopus to speed up work for changing HK$2 scheme

<img alt="Jeny Yeung said Octopus will try to complete its adaptation to the HK$2 scheme adjustment in less than 18 months. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1794167_1_20250304161513.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The firm which operates the Octopus Card on Tuesday said it hopes to shorten the process needed to implement the government's plans to scale back the HK$2 elderly transport subsidy scheme.
 <br>
  <br>
  In the budget last week, the government proposed limiting the HK$2 subsidised trips to 240 a month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elderly passengers would also have to pay 20 percent of future trips that cost more than HK$10.
  <br>
  <br>
  Labour minister Chris Sun said last week it would take around 18 months to adjust each and every Octopus machine to adopt the changes.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a media gathering, Octopus chairwoman Jeny Yeung said it would take time to implement the scheme because different transport operators have different discounts and fare calculation methods.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said it should take the company at least a year to discuss these issues with them to adjust the system, as well as conduct trials.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeung said Octopus would seek to finish the work in less than 18 months.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said the firm wants to introduce a new function in the second half of the year that would allow users who installed the Octopus mobile app to send money to another app user, or an actual card.
  <br>
  <br>
  Such payments would require entering the card details of the other user.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeung added the firm is trying to extend its services to Japan in the third quarter of this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said the idea is that transactions would go through the Octopus mobile app, as the firm is discussing cooperation plans with platforms that have wider coverage in the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the past year or so, the firm extended services to mainland China and Thailand.

 Canada will slap tariffs on US imports beginning on Tuesday in response to levies pledged by President Donald Trump, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Monday, adding "there is no justification" for Washington's actions.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Should American tariffs come into effect tonight, Canada will, effective 12.01am EST tomorrow, respond with 25 percent tariffs against US$155 billion of American goods," the Canadian prime minister said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Steep US tariffs on Canadian and Mexican goods came into effect Tuesday as a deadline to avert President Donald Trump's levies passed without the North American neighbours striking a deal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Canadian goods will face a 25 percent tariff -- with energy resources hit by a lower 10 percent rate -- while Mexican products face a 25 percent blanket levy, according to orders Trump previously signed.
  <br>
  <br>
  He cited a lack of progress in tackling drug trafficking as he pushed ahead with the duties. (AFP)

 Entrepreneurs and leaders of mainland private enterprises have expressed hope that Beijing will roll out more supportive measures to assist with the nation's industrial upgrade, while balancing the development of various industries.
 <br>
  <br>
  The remarks came as the annual "two sessions", or "lianghui", kicked off on Tuesday, with thousands of political elites and lawmakers arriving in the capital to set policy agenda for the country's strategic areas including in economics and trade.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking in an interview with RTHK, He Xiaopeng, chief executive officer of Chinese EV company XPeng, noted that while China has always been supportive of its private sector, more measures were being offered to firms that fall into the so-called "entity industries", which include agriculture, industrial production, telecommunications, and infrastructure construction.
  <br>
  <br>
  He, who is an NPC deputy, also hoped to bring XPeng's latest flying vehicles technology to Hong Kong to grasp opportunities offered by the SAR's so-called "low-altitude economy".
  <br>
  <br>
  "I hope to let more people see the latest dynamics in the low-altitude flying technology," he told RTHK, adding that XPeng wuold also apply for trials covering flying vehicles and that there was vast potential in the industry, especially in the coastal regions.

    China's economy solid amid challenges: NPC spokesman

<div class="itemFullText">
 China’s economy has a solid foundation with new growth drivers despite facing some challenges in the coming year, a spokesman for the top legislature said on Tuesday, as dates for the parliament’s annual session were announced.
 <br>
  <br>
  The annual session of the National People’s Congress (NPC) will kick off on Wednesday and run until March 11, lasting for seven days.
  <br>
  <br>
  During the session, Beijing is expected to announce its economic growth target for 2025.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Undoubtedly, the adverse impacts brought the external environment have deepened and China’s economy still faces some difficulties and challenges,” Lou Qinjian said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “But it’s more important to note that China’s economy has a solid foundation, many advantages, strong resilience and vast potential.”
  <br>
  <br>
  With the United States doubling additional tariffs on Chinese imports, the spokesman said trade disputes should be settled within the framework of the World Trade Organisation (WTO).
  <br>
  <br>
  “By imposing unilateral tariffs, the US has violated WTO rules and disrupted the security and stability of the global industrial and supply chains,” Lou said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We hope the US can work in the same direction as China and find a solution through equal-footed consultation. China is also ready to work more closely with other countries to safeguard the hard-earned multilateral trading system, oppose unilateralism and protectionism, and advance a universally beneficial and inclusive economic globalisation.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The spokesman said the progress of DeepSeek reflects the rise of Chinese companies in artificial intelligence, saying such firms have become the backbone of the country’s science and technology development.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lou said while artificial intelligence technologies are accompanied by “unknown risks”, China attaches great importance to their development.

 The president of the Peking Union Medical College Hospital on Tuesday said she hopes the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) will fully consider its plan to set up the SAR's third medical school.
 <br>
  <br>
  Zhang Shuyang, a member of the National People's Congress, told RTHK that the hospital has worked with the institution on technology and technological research.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both parties also cooperate on medical projects, medical education and training for doctors, she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Zhang said she was unaware of HKUST's plan to start a medical school.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said she hopes the university will conduct research on its proposal.
  <br>
  <br>
  HKUST's president Nancy Ip revealed earlier that research and technology would be a focus of the medical school.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The secretary of the Qingdao Municipal Party Committee, and also a delegate to the National People's Congress, on Tuesday said the expansion of the Individual Visit Scheme to Qingdao provided great convenience for exchanges between Qingdao and the two SARs.
 <br>
  <br>
  The scheme was expanded in March last year to cover a number of mainland cities, including Qingdao.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zeng Zanrong told RTHK ahead of the preparatory meeting of the National People's Congress the implementation of the scheme had gone very well.
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted there were many exchanges between Qingdao and the SARs on various aspects, including technological innovation, finance, and shipping.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Foshan mayor Bai Tao said he will work to get his city covered by the scheme.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bai, who's also an NPC delegate, said he welcomes Hong Kong residents to travel to Foshan, adding that there are no barriers to doing so.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said he believes visits can foster the relationship between people in the two cities.
  <br>
  <br>
  The mayor also said he welcomes SAR enterprises to expand their businesses in Foshan.

<div class="itemFullText">
 China on Tuesday swiftly retaliated against fresh US tariffs, announcing a range of between 10 and 15 percent hikes to import levies covering a basket of American agricultural and food products, while placing 25 US firms under export and investment restrictions.
 <br>
  <br>
  "An additional 15 percent tariffs will be imposed on chicken, wheat, corn and cotton," the Finance Ministry said, adding "additional 10 percent tariffs will be imposed on sorghum, soybeans, pork, beef, aquatic products, fruits, vegetables and dairy products."
  <br>
  <br>
  "The US's unilateral tariffs measures seriously violate World Trade Organisation rules and undermine the basis for economic and trade cooperation between China and the US," the Commerce Ministry said in a separate statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China will firmly safeguard its legitimate rights and interests," the statement added.
  <br>
  <br>
  US President Donald Trump's new 25 percent tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada took effect on Tuesday, along with a doubling of duties on Chinese goods to 20 percent, launching new trade conflicts with the top three US trading partners. (Reuters)

    HK govt still in the dark over new US tariffs

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Commerce Secretary Algernon Yau on Tuesday said the SAR government still doesn't know whether new US tariffs on Chinese goods will also cover Hong Kong products, but in any case transit trade could be hit in the short term.
 <br>
  <br>
  An additional 10 percent duty on Chinese exports to the US is expected to come into force on Tuesday, following the extra 10 percent imposed by US President Donald Trump last month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Washington earlier clarified that the first tariffs move did apply to Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  On an RTHK radio programme, Yau reiterated the government's opposition to Trump's decision.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In fact, Hong Kong is a separate customs territory and the executive order is said to add duties on Chinese goods. But previous documents from the US Department of Homeland Security and the Customs and Border Protection have included Hong Kong goods as well. We have already announced that we'll file a complaint with the World Trade Organisation," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This time the US added another 10 percent levy on Chinese products. But it's very unclear; they did not say whether Hong Kong was included in the new tariffs. So we are studying whether they included Hong Kong this time."
  <br>
  <br>
  Yau said transit trade could be affected, but the tariffs won't have a significant impact as Hong Kong's exports to the US account for less than 0.1 percent of the city's overall exports globally.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, the commerce chief said there have been significant improvements in the city's trade of liquor, after tax on some spirits was reduced last October.
  <br>
  <br>
  The duty on liquor with an alcohol content above 30 percent and with an import price of over HK$200 was cut from 100 percent to 10 percent for the portion above HK$200.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yau said trading volumes of liquor increased by 60 percent from October to the end of January, while the value of the liquor traded rose by 150 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The momentum has been quite good in recent months. The reason we reduced the duties on premium liquor was that we wanted to develop Hong Kong into a trading centre for premium liquor. This would then have a knock-on effect to the catering, hospitality, logistics, and warehouse sectors, it could bring significant economic impacts," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We also hope to help Chinese baijiu to go global using the SAR as a trading centre. So we hope to boost trades on liquor, but not that we are encouraging people to consume more alcohol," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the minister encouraged SAR businesses to tap into opportunities brought by the rising e-commerce trend globally, noting that the sector accounts for some 20 percent of global trade, with revenues in this market rising by double digits on a yearly basis.
  <br>
  <br>
  A second edition of the "Hong Kong Shopping Festival" will be held in the SAR in August to further capture the booming e-commerce business, Yau said, adding that authorities also hope to take the festival to Asean member states to promote Hong Kong products.

    US 'pauses' military aid to Ukraine

<img alt="US President Donald Trump suspended military aid to Ukraine, a White House official said, sharply escalating pressure on Kyiv to agree to peace talks with Russia.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump has paused military aid to Ukraine following his clash with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky last week, a White House official said, deepening the fissure that has opened between the two one-time allies.
 <br>
  <br>
  The move comes after Trump upended US policy on Ukraine and Russia upon taking office in January, adopting a more conciliatory stance towards Moscow - and after an explosive confrontation with Zelensky at the White House on Friday in which Trump criticiSed him for being insufficiently grateful for Washington's support.
  <br>
  <br>
  "President Trump has been clear that he is focused on peace. We need our partners to be committed to that goal as well. We are pausing and reviewing our aid to ensure that it is contributing to a solution," said a White House official.
  <br>
  <br>
  The White House had no immediate comment on the scope and amount of aid affected or how long the pause would last.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Pentagon could not provide further details.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zelensky's office did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment nor did the Ukrainian Embassy in Washington.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Monday, Trump again said Zelensky should be more appreciative of American support after earlier responding angrily to an Associated Press report quoting Zelensky as saying the end of the war is "very, very far away."
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is the worst statement that could have been made by Zelensky, and America will not put up with it for much longer!" Trump wrote on Truth Social. (Reuters)

    Facial recognition mulled after alleged Kai Tak breach

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Facial recognition technology could be deployed at Kai Tak Sports Park and other venues to stop people sneaking in without permission, Culture, Sports and Tourism Secretary Rosanna Law said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Her comment follows a report by Wen Wei Po on Monday that two reporters managed to attend the park's opening ceremony last weekend despite not having tickets. The newspaper said the pair, and a man that helped them get inside, also managed to avoid security checks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Law said police are investigating the alleged breach, but such a lapse wouldn't demonstrate any "large-scale loophole" in security measures.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said there might be a need to use technology to stop people such as backstage staff from getting non-ticket holders into venues.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The authorities need to check whether the person entering a place is the actual pass-holder. Say if you own the pass but you gave it to me, I shouldn't be allowed in," the minister said on an RTHK programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Whether we can adopt real-name registration here, or, as some people suggested, use facial recognition, we can discuss these things with event organisers."
  <br>
  <br>
  Law also said officials are hoping to bring non-local football teams to play at the sports park in the summer.
  <br>
  <br>
  She added that the staging of the National Games in Hong Kong, Guangdong and Macau this November will provide a litmus test regarding the possibility of the region holding other major tournaments in the future.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If we host the Games well, that would prove that the Greater Bay Area city cluster is very much capable of hosting major sporting tournaments. Would this be the Olympics, or, I've also heard others say, perhaps the Asian Games?" she said.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Authorities in the capital have stepped up security ahead of the annual “Two Sessions” meetings.
 <br>
  <br>
  Delegates are in Beijing for the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) starting on Tuesday and the National People's Congress (NPC) a day later.
  <br>
  <br>
  “There are more patrolling officers and security guards. Public security officers are also doing ID checks,” a Beijing resident told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  A tourist from the Netherlands said this is his first visit to Beijing, and he felt safe thanks to the presence of more officers.
  <br>
  <br>
  “In the metro, there are guards at the entrance, so when you go inside they check [and] see if you bring no trouble,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “You have to go to the scanner, put your bags in the scanner and they just see if you have nothing with you that you can't bring.”
  <br>
  <br>
  A local CPPCC deputy, Johnny Ng, believes the arrangements this year will be more flexible, allowing them to communicate better.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We can flexibly have more communication with other delegates in CPPCC because we have over 2,000 [to] 3,000 people together,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We hope that we can have more communications this year, in order to make sure Hong Kong can have more cooperation with other delegates and cities.”

    SpaceX calls off Starship test flight at last minute

<img alt="The latest test flight was to include another attempt to catch the booster stage using the launch tower's " src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1794109_1_20250304101337.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Elon Musk's SpaceX called off the latest test flight of its Starship rocket just before its scheduled launch on Monday, citing an unspecified problem with the behemoth spacecraft.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Standing down from today's flight test attempt," SpaceX posted on X, also owned by Musk. "Starship team is determining the next best available opportunity to fly."
  <br>
  <br>
  The world's biggest and most powerful rocket was set to take off with no crew at 6:45pm local time from SpaceX's Starbase facility in Boca Chica, Texas.
  <br>
  <br>
  A rescheduled launch has yet to be announced, though SpaceX employee Dan Huot said it was expected "to be about 24 hours" during a live feed of the event.
  <br>
  <br>
  The flight will be Starship's eighth orbital mission overall and first since a dramatic mid-air explosion over the Caribbean during its last trial.
  <br>
  <br>
  Standing 123 metres tall, Starship is designed to eventually be fully reusable and plays a crucial role in Musk and SpaceX's vision of colonising Mars.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Nasa is awaiting a modified version of the rocket for its Artemis program, which aims to return astronauts to the Moon.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US Federal Aviation Administration grounded Starship after its previous flight on January 16 ended with the upper stage disintegrating in a fiery cascade over the Turks and Caicos Islands, prompting clean-up efforts for fallen debris.
  <br>
  <br>
  For the upcoming flight, SpaceX says it has introduced numerous upgrades to the upper-stage spacecraft, enhancing its reliability and performance.
  <br>
  <br>
  The mission, expected to last just over an hour, includes another attempt to catch the booster stage using the launch tower's "chopstick" arms – a feat SpaceX has successfully executed twice, including in the last flight.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the first commercial mission of Europe's new heavy-lift rocket Ariane 6 was called off minutes before it was scheduled to launch, due to an "anomaly" on the ground.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was the latest of several postponements for the rocket as Europe seeks to secure independent access to space. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A new round of negotiations for an international treaty on reducing global plastics pollution will be held in Geneva in August, the United Nations Environment Programme (Unep) said on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  A previous round of negotiations – tasked with hammering out a legally binding treaty – ended without agreement in South Korea last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Plastic pollution is so ubiquitous that microplastics have been found on the highest mountain peaks, in the deepest ocean trenches, and scattered throughout almost every part of the human body.
  <br>
  <br>
  The announcement on the Unep website of the new talks comes in the wake of a last-ditch Cop16 finance deal on biodiversity agreed in Rome last week by delegates from some 150 countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Unep said the new plastics talks will be held at the Palais des Nations in Geneva from August 5 to 14.
  <br>
  <br>
  December's South Korea talks broke down following opposition from a bloc of mainly oil-producing countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Delegates from nearly 200 nations debated for a week on how to stop millions of tonnes of plastic waste from entering the environment each year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The talks were meant to end with the world's first accord on cutting plastics pollution after nearly two years of discussions, but concluded without an agreement – except to extend talks. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Commerce Ministry on Tuesday vowed to retaliate against fresh US import tariffs set to take effect later in the day, reiterating its stance that the Trump administration was trying to "shift the blame" and "bully" Beijing over fentanyl flows.
 <br>
  <br>
  The extra 10 percent duty that US President Donald Trump threatened China with last week is expected to enter into force at 0501 GMT on March 4, resulting in a cumulative 20 percent tariff in response to what the White House considers Chinese inaction over drug flows.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tariff represents an additional hike to pre-existing levies on thousands of Chinese goods.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Global Times reported on Monday that China had American agricultural and food products in its crosshairs, and would hit back with a series of both tariffs and non-tariff measures.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China has repeatedly stated that the US' unilateral tariffs violate World Trade Organization rules and undermine the multilateral trade system, the Commerce Ministry said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Such measures will not solve [the US'] problems but instead will harm China-US economic and trade cooperation and disrupt regular international trade," it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  China urges the US to "immediately withdraw" its unilateral tariff measures that are "unreasonable and groundless, harmful to others," the ministry added. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Stock markets in Hong Kong and on the mainland both opened lower on Tuesday, as investors awaited the upcoming annual parliamentary sessions to gauge Beijing's policy path.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Hang Seng Index lost 328.02 points, or 1.43 per cent, to open at 22,678 points on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hang Seng Tech Index was down over three per cent.
  <br>
  <br>
  China's blue-chip CSI300 Index dropped 0.6 per cent at the open, while the Shanghai Composite Index lost 0.5 per cent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Market focus is shifting from the recent tech and AI themes to the National People's Congress meeting on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing was expected to maintain its economic growth target at roughly five per cent and announce a budget deficit of four per cent of GDP.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier, Japan's Nikkei share average fell more than one per cent in early trade, dragged by overnight Wall Street declines and a stronger yen, with US tariffs on Canada and Mexico to take effect as planned later in the day.
  <br>
  <br>
  US President Donald Trump also reaffirmed that he will increase tariffs on all Chinese imports to 20 per cent from the previous 10 per cent levy.
  <br>
  <br>
  After Trump's announcement, Beijing warned on Tuesday that it would take countermeasures against new US tariffs on Chinese imports.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the yen appreciated against the US dollar as the greenback slid, knocking down exporters shares and further dragging investor sentiment. (Agencies)

    Study paints grim picture of obesity

<img alt="Researchers estimate that 3.8 billion adults will be overweight or obese in 15 years. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1794096_1_20250304090417.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Nearly 60 percent of all adults and a third of all children in the world will be overweight or obese by 2050 unless governments take action, a large new study said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The research published in the Lancet medical journal used data from 204 countries to paint a grim picture of what it described as one of the great health challenges of the century.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The unprecedented global epidemic of overweight and obesity is a profound tragedy and a monumental societal failure," lead author Emmanuela Gakidou, from the US-based Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME), said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The number of overweight or obese people worldwide rose from 929 million in 1990 to 2.6 billion in 2021, the study found.
  <br>
  <br>
  Without a serious change, the researchers estimate that 3.8 billion adults will be overweight or obese in 15 years - or around 60 percent of the global adult population in 2050.
  <br>
  <br>
  The world's health systems will come under crippling pressure, the researchers warned, with around a quarter of the world's obese expected to be aged over 65 by that time.
  <br>
  <br>
  They also predicted a 121-percent increase in obesity among children and adolescents around the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  A third of all obese young people will be living in two regions - North Africa and the Middle East, and Latin America and the Caribbean - by 2050, the researchers warned.
  <br>
  <br>
  But it is not too late to act, said study co-author Jessica Kerr from Murdoch Children's Research Institute in Australia.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Much stronger political commitment is needed to transform diets within sustainable global food systems," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  That commitment was also needed for strategies "that improve people's nutrition, physical activity and living environments, whether it's too much processed food or not enough parks," Kerr said.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than half the world's overweight or obese adults already live in just eight countries - China, India, the United States, Brazil, Russia, Mexico, Indonesia and Egypt, the study said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The research is based on figures from the Global Burden of Disease study from the IHME, which brings together thousands of researchers across the world and is funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. (AFP)

 US stocks closed sharply lower on Monday, after US President Donald Trump slapped fresh sanctions against China and levies on Mexico and Canada neared imposition, while European defence shares soared as the European Union sought increased military spending over Ukraine.
 <br>
  <br>
  The White House said Trump had signed an executive order raising tariffs on China to 20 per cent, shortly after Trump seemed to rule out any change to the planned 25 per cent tariffs against Mexico and Canada.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 1.5 per cent, while the broad-based S&P lost 1.8 per cent, and the tech-rich Nasdaq took a harsher tumble, closing down 2.6 per cent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CBOE Volatility Index, or VIX - colloquially known as Wall Street's "fear gauge" - surged, hitting its highest level since December.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Europe, BAE Systems surged 14 per cent, helping London's benchmark FTSE 100 index to a record high, the latest in a series over recent months.
  <br>
  <br>
  French defence group Thales won more than 16 per cent and German peer Rheinmetall rallied 15 per cent. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump said on Monday that 25 percent taxes on imports from Mexico and Canada would start on Tuesday, sparking renewed fears of a North American trade war that already showed signs of pushing up inflation and hindering growth.
 <br>
  <br>
  “Tomorrow - tariffs 25 percent on Canada and 25 percent on Mexico. And that’ll start,” Trump told reporters in the Roosevelt Room. “They’re going to have to have a tariff.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has said the tariffs are to force the two US neighbours to step up their fight against fentanyl trafficking and stop illegal immigration.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Trump has also indicated that he wants to eliminate the Americas' trade imbalances as well and push more factories to relocate in the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  His comments quickly rattled the US stock market.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yet the Trump administration remains confident that tariffs are the best choice to boost US manufacturing and attract foreign investment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump provided a one-month delay in February as both Mexico and Canada promised concessions.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Trump said that there was “no room left for Mexico or for Canada” to avoid the steep new tariffs, which were also set to tax Canadian energy products, such as oil and electricity, at a lower 10 per cent rate.
  <br>
  <br>
  “If Trump is imposing tariffs, we are ready," said Canadian Foreign Minister Mélanie Joly.
  <br>
  <br>
  Joly said Canada had a very strong border plan and explained that to Trump administration officials last week. She said diplomatic efforts were continuing. She spoke after Trump made his comments on Tuesday. (AP)

    'No major policy shifts at Two Sessions expected'
   </title>

<img alt="" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1793998_1_20250303165106.jpg&q=75">

<div class="itemFullText">
 A local economics academic said he does not expect major policy shifts in the "Two Sessions" meetings in Beijing, saying it's important for the central government to focus on stabilising sentiment and continuing with high-quality growth.
 <br>
  <br>
  Delegates from the SAR and around the country are in Beijing for the opening of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference on Tuesday and the National People's Congress a day later, during which Beijing will announce its economic growth target for 2025.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho Lok-sang, an adjunct research professor from Lingnan University, said he expects mainland authorities to set a target of five percent, similar to last year's.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm pretty sure that the most likely target would be five percent, which is in my mind certainly within reach," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho highlighted the need for the world's second-largest economy to pursue high-quality growth.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's possible for China to achieve five percent, but there's no need to raise the target to suggest that they're very keen in pushing up economic growth. Five percent, I think, is a target that will produce the effect of giving confidence, and at the same time showing continuity."
  <br>
  <br>
  The academic believes under President Xi Jinping's leadership, the priorities this year include spurring domestic spending, boosting confidence and attracting more foreign investment.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's important to stimulate consumption. Internal consumption is something that's within the government's control, but external factors are difficult to tell... Continuing to open up is a main responsibility that President Xi has considered to be a priority, continuing to give the impression that we are really opening up, and all countries from Europe, North America, anywhere, are welcome to China."
  <br>
  <br>
  This year marks the end of the 14th Five-Year Plan, and authorities are now drawing up blueprints for the period between 2026 and 2030.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We do not expect any surprises and I think it's important for China – at this time – not to produce any surprises, because there had been some significant policy movement, initiatives in the past, and that had rocked market sentiments," Ho said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also said improving governance is another key focus at this year's "Two Sessions".
  <br>
  <br>
  "Improving governance has been on the agenda for quite some time, and improving governance is a way to boost people's confidence in the leadership.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Improving governance through introducing new laws can enhance people's confidence in the policies.
  <br>
  <br>
  "No one likes policies that come out of the blue, right? But if you improve governance, you're securing an atmosphere that is guaranteed by the legal framework."

    Forest sink Ipswich on pens to reach FA Cup quarters

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Nottingham Forest needed penalties to beat Ipswich and book a place in the FA Cup quarter-finals after a 1-1 draw at the City Ground.
 <br>
  <br>
  Jack Taylor was the only man who failed to score from the spot as Matz Sels' save edged the shootout 5-4 in Forest's favour to set up a last eight trip to Brighton.
  <br>
  <br>
  The sides are separated by 15 places and 31 points in the Premier League, but with Forest's priority securing Champions League football next season, Nuno Espírito Santo rested a number of his key players.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ipswich sensed their opportunity and took the lead early in the second half when George Hirst headed in a corner at the back post.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ryan Yates took advantage of some woeful defending to nod in an equaliser 22 minutes from time.
  <br>
  <br>
  An extra 30 minutes of extra-time came and went without a winner despite Nuno sending on top scorer Chris Wood and England international Morgan Gibbs-White.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Sels, another of Forest's star performers this season, proved the hero after the first nine penalties of the shootout found the net.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In penalties one of the goalkeepers is going to be the hero," said Sels. "I'm happy I could help the team to the next round. It was the only penalty I was in the right corner." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong delegates to the nation's top political advisory body who met with senior mainland official Xia Baolong in Beijing on Monday evening quoted him as saying the city should unite in supporting Chief Executive John Lee's administration.
 <br>
  <br>
  Xia, who heads the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, held talks with Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) delegates from the two SARs, a day before the opening of this year's CPPCC meetings.
  <br>
  <br>
  Delegates said during the 70-minute meeting with Xia, he highly praised the achievements of the two SARs in the past year.
  <br>
  <br>
  A local CPPCC member, Ho Hon-kuen, said Xia stressed that Hong Kong should work together as a whole.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Talking about the upcoming Legislative Council election, he said the current members have done a good job, but he hopes the next term can be even better,” Ho said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “He also said Hong Kong should unite and support the work of the chief executive. He said under the current economic and political situation, we should be confident in ourselves.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho also quoted Xia as saying that Hong Kong has the advantage of the One Country, Two Systems principle, and the central government and Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office fully support the SAR's development.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another local CPPCC member, Junius Ho, said they had discussions about the global political and economic situation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Junius Ho also mentioned Hong Kong's current situation.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The stability and prosperity that we are now enjoying do not come easy. We need to treasure them. We need to make it a sustainable growth. We need to maintain it. I think this requires concerted efforts, and we are all committed to do that,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The third session of the 14th CPPCC National Committee begins on Tuesday.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A car driven into a crowd in the German city of Mannheim on Monday killed one person and injured several, police said, adding that one person had been arrested.
 <br>
  <br>
  "We can now confirm that a car was driven into a pedestrian zone and that one person was killed," said police spokesman Stefan Wilhelm, adding that several people were injured.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We can confirm that one suspect was arrested," he said, adding that "the investigation is continuing".
  <br>
  <br>
  Wilhelm said residents had been urged "to avoid the inner city area" after the emergency sparked a large-scale police operation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police with heavy weapons cordoned off the area and police helicopters were seen in the air.
  <br>
  <br>
  A reporter for news channel NTV reported that "at least one person is lying covered under a tarpaulin".
  <br>
  <br>
  Germany has in recent months suffered a spate of violent attacks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last month a man drove a car into a trade union demonstration in the southern city of Munich, killing a two-year-old girl and her mother.
  <br>
  <br>
  In December a car-ramming attack targeted a Christmas market in the eastern city of Magdeburg, killing six people and wounding hundreds.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mannheim itself was the scene of a stabbing attack at an anti-Islam rally last May in which a policeman was killed and five others were wounded. (AFP)

    Sunbeam puts on a show for one last time

<img alt="Lana Wong, left, says she has many fond memories of Sunbeam. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1794043_2_20250303213509.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Sunbeam Theatre – the North Point venue best known for its Cantonese opera performances – put on its last show on Monday night, bidding farewell to fans and opera lovers after more than half a century.
 <br>
  <br>
  Dozens of people were already there ahead of the final show at 7.30pm, in what would be another full house.
  <br>
  <br>
  Harry Au Yeung brought along his son, 4, for a final look at the theatre that opened back in 1972.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think it's a great memory for many people," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I have never watched any Chinese opera before. But I think it is very valuable for most of the Hong Kong people, especially for the (older) generations. I hope the traditional Chinese opera can be extended to the future."
  <br>
  <br>
  Andrew To, a Malaysian who has been living in the SAR for over 20 years, was at Sunbeam Theatre for the second night in a row.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Today I'm not taking photo, but I'm just here to walk around, to see the people around, what they are doing, how they're saying farewells... Just soaking in the moment before it's gone forever," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Veteran actress Lana Wong, 94, performed at Sunbeam many times in the past. On this night, she came to watch the final show and say farewell.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Sunbeam is like my family, it's like my family being torn apart today. I am very, very sad," Wong said.
  <br>
  <br>
  But she said she doesn't believe the closure would affect the development of Cantonese opera, adding performances can still be staged in many other venues.
  <br>
  <br>
  A woman surnamed Chan also came for Sunbeam's last show, about the late paramount leader Deng Xiaoping played by award-winning opera performer Loong Koon-tin.
  <br>
  <br>
  Unlike Wong, she believes the end of the North Point landmark could have a negative impact on Cantonese opera because a lot of performances started off at Sunbeam.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan, who lives in Tseung Kwan O, also said while fans can still enjoy performances at locations such as the Xiqu Centre in West Kowloon, Sunbeam is more convenient because it's closer to her and can be easily reached by the MTR.
  <br>
  <br>
  A church will take over the location after Sunbeam ceases operation.

    Haifa attacker was Israeli Druze minority

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Israel's police said the perpetrator of a stabbing attack in the northern city of Haifa on Monday was a member of Israel's Druze Arab minority who recently returned from abroad.
 <br>
  <br>
  Israeli Druze are an ethno-religious minority among the Arab citizens of Israel, who's roots in the region go back centuries. They make up roughly 5.5 percent of Lebanon's population, 3 percent of Syria and 1.6 percent of Israel.
  <br>
  <br>
  The attack came one day after Israel blocked aid to the Gaza Strip during an impasse over extending the truce in the Palestinian territory.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier, a prominent Druze leader in Lebanon said on Sunday that he will soon visit Syria to meet its interim leader as tensions simmer between members of the minority group, the war-torn country’s interim government, and Israel.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The free Syrians must be cautious of the plots of Israel,” veteran Druze leader Walid Jumblatt said at a news conference Sunday, accusing Israel and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of creating sectarian division and chaos in the country. “In Syria there is a plot for sabotage. There is a plot for sabotage in the region and for the Arabs’ national security.”

  The six-week first phase of the truce ended at the weekend. It had enabled the entry of vital food, shelter and medical assistance to Gaza. The Israeli decision prompted the United Nations to call on Israel for an immediate restoration of the aid.
  <br>
  <br>
  Germany also urged Israel to resume aid flow "immediately".
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Israel's army said it struck on Monday a "suspicious motorised vessel" off the coast of south Gaza's Khan Yunis. (Agencies)

    'Hundreds of species at risk of local extinction'

<img alt="WWF-Hong Kong says it hopes to discuss its findings with government officials. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1794010_1_20250303173647.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Conservation groups are warning that around a quarter of almost 900 different species assessed in Hong Kong are at risk of local extinction, with types of birds and freshwater fish among the most in danger of disappearing from the territory.
 <br>
  <br>
  The findings were released on Monday in the 'The state of Hong Kong biodiversity' report by WWF-Hong Kong, in association with the Hong Kong Bird Watching Society, Kadoorie Farm and Botanic Garden, Outdoor Wildlife Learning Hong Kong and local researchers.
  <br>
  <br>
  The assessments covered mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, fish, butterflies, dragonflies and freshwater crustaceans. Of the 886 species researchers checked, 232 were deemed to be on the brink of local extinction while 21 were confirmed to be extinct.
  <br>
  <br>
  Examples of species under threat include the Oriental magpie which is at high risk of disappearing locally, and the crested bunting which has lost its breeding population here. The Chinese floating frog, meanwhile, is already gone from the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With nearly half of the native freshwater fish species at risk of local extinction, threats such as channelisation and water pollution, and the invasion of non-native species must be tackled," said Dr Alphonse Tsang, Research Assistant Professor at Lingnan University.
  <br>
  <br>
  The report is accompanied by the 'Hong Kong Terrestrial Biodiversity Hotspot Map 2025' which highlights what are described as 27 critical biodiversity sites outside the protected-area system.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nearly 80 percent of the hotspots are said to have suffered from eco-vandalism, while almost half are threatened by development.
  <br>
  <br>
  The report includes more than two dozen recommendations for the authorities, including the establishment of special task forces to combat poaching and a review of plans to build on ecologically important habits.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are going to share this report to all the relevant government bureaus and departments, and we would request to have a kind of sit-down and share our thoughts with the relevant departments," said Dr Bosco Chan, director of conservation at WWF-Hong Kong.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's retail sales dropped 3.2 percent in January year-on-year, marking the 11th consecutive month of declines.
 <br>
  <br>
  According to official data released by the Census and Statistics Department on Monday, the value of total retail sales in January was estimated at HK$35.3 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  January's drop was narrower than the revised 9.6 percent decline recorded in December last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sales of motor vehicles and parts saw the sharpest decline at 52.6 percent, while those of furniture and fixtures saw a 26.4 percent fall.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, a department spokesman said looking at both January and February data would give a better picture of the city's retail performance during the Lunar New Year period.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Looking ahead, the near-term performance of the retail sector would continue to be affected by the change in consumption patterns of visitors and residents," the department statement read.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bond Law, executive director of the Retail Management Association, said he expects a sluggish year for the sector.
  <br>
  <br>
  "By April, we anticipate that the drop may narrow or level off with slight increases during certain holidays. Overall, we expect a flat year with fluctuations of no more than 2 percent," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Law said purchasing power and consumer sentiment remained weak despite an increase in mainland travellers.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Taxis that offer a variety of ways to pay and come equipped with systems to keep an eye on the driver  are about to arrive on the city's streets, with officials saying the only way is up when it comes to service quality.
 <br>
  <br>
  Five new taxi fleets with more than 3,500 vehicles between them were unveiled on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hundreds of the taxis are brand new and as well as accepting various forms of electronic payments rather than just cash, the fleets' various boasts include a number of wheelchair-accessible vehicles, some electric vehicles, online booking, and driver monitoring systems "for passenger convenience and driving safety", according to the government.
  <br>
  <br>
  Transport Secretary Mable Chan said that after years of challenges, the taxi trade can only make improvements when it comes to service and she hopes the fleets will play a leading role in this.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think today is a start," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We hope that we can promote and attract more taxis to join such a kind of fleet management so as to provide more modern and more user-friendly services."
  <br>
  <br>
  Big Boss Taxi Company, CMG Fleet Management, Sino Development (International) Company, SynCab Service and Tai Wo Management are the operators granted licences.
  <br>
  <br>
  Between them they will run around 20 percent of all the city's taxis, with the first fleet expected to start operating by the end of this month and all of them arriving by July.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The annual session of China's top political advisory body will run from Tuesday to March 10, authorities announced on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The third session of the 14th CPPCC National Committee will begin on Tuesday 3pm at the Great Hall of the People, and about 3,000 Chinese and international journalists have signed up to cover the annual meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities said the week-long session will review the work of the national committee in the past year and plan for its work this year, while also discussing government work reports.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a media briefing, the session's spokesman, Liu Jieyi, said 2024 was a critical year for realising goals and tasks set forth in the 14th Five-Year Plan, and this year would be a concluding year.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The CPPCC National Committee will carry forward our fine traditions, keep in mind our political responsibilities, give full play to the CPPCC's role as a specialised consultative body, serve the overall picture by focusing on the central tasks,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We will strengthen theoretical and political guidance, actively produce policy advice, and contribute our ideas and strengths to building a great modern socialist country in all respects, and rejuvenating our nation through Chinese modernisation.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Liu added that China’s economy maintained steady progress in the past year, and the country also made solid advances in high-quality development.
  <br>
  <br>
  “As long as we face the challenges, be confident, and follow plans of the Central Committee of the Party, the high-quality development will be able to reach new heights,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Economic issues are always a priority in the work of the CPPCC National Committee. Over the past year, the National Committee offered advice on a series of important economic issues, and made solid and effective contributions to economic recovery and growth.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Liu said about 230 CPPCC members from Hong Kong and Macau played active roles in the country’s economic and social development, and the CPPCC would continue to help the two SARs integrate into the overall development of the country.
