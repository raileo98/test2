<div class="itemFullText">
 China's exports surged to a record high in 2024, providing a much-needed boost for the economy as the prospect of biting tariffs imposed by US President-elect Donald Trump looms.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump, set to return to the White House next week, has proposed hefty tariffs on Chinese goods, sparking fears of a renewed trade war between the two superpowers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Total exports in 2024 exceeded 25 trillion yuan for the first time, reaching 25.45 trillion yuan (US$3.47 trillion), a year-on-year increase of 7.1 percent", according to state media.
  <br>
  <br>
  Imports rose 2.3 percent to 18.39 trillion yuan, state media said, adding that combined trade swelled five percent to reach a record 43.85 trillion yuan.
  <br>
  <br>
  With exports outpacing imports, China's trade surplus grew to US$104.84 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a government press conference in Beijing on Monday, General Administration of Customs deputy head Wang Lingjun said that China's foreign trade growth in 2024 was relatively fast among major economies in the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China has become a major trading partner of more than 150 countries and regions, and the country's circle of friends in foreign trade is getting larger," Wang said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The official said that the structure of import and export products had also been continuously optimised and upgraded last year, with high-tech products reporting good growth numbers and a boom in new types of trade such as cross-border e-commerce.
  <br>
  <br>
  China's exports are likely to remain strong in the near-term, said Huang Zichun of Capital Economics, as businesses try to “front-run” potentially higher tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Outbound shipments are likely to stay resilient in the near-term, supported by further gains in global market share thanks to a weak real effective exchange rate," she wrote in a note.
  <br>
  <br>
  But exports will likely weaken later in the year if Trump follows through on his threat to impose tariffs, Huang said. (Xinhua/Agencies)

    'High hopes for the SAR's task force in Thailand'

<img alt="Former security minister Lai Tung-kwok said he was confident the SAR task force in Thailand would deliver results. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1787266_1_20250113115736.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Former security minister Lai Tung-kwok said he was optimistic about the prospects of the SAR's task force in Thailand, which is investigating allegations that Hongkongers have been lured to Southeast Asian countries to engage in illegal work.
 <br>
  <br>
  The task force, led by Undersecretary for Security Michael Cheuk, with members from Security Bureau and the Immigration Department, flew to Thailand on Sunday, after receiving 28 requests for assistance connected to Hong Kong residents allegedly being detained in various parts of the region.
  <br>
  <br>
  So far, 16 people have returned to Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  Seven men and five women reported restrictions on their movement, but are safe and able to remain in touch with the task force. It is thought they were not forcibly abducted.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a RTHK programme on Monday, Lai said the SAR government was highly concerned which is why it sent the task force led by Cheuk.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also had high hopes for the task force's prospects given it has been liaising with Thai authorities.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lai also believed the Thai police would also pay high attention to such incidents, considering the potential impact on tourism.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The Thai police also attach importance to this issue because it seriously affects the country's tourist industry. There have been media reports that many mainland tourists have cancelled trips to Thailand over the upcoming Lunar New Year - so I think Thailand wants to handle any incidents well,” Lai said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lai said many were lured to Southeast Asia after they were asked to take goods to places overseas.
  <br>
  <br>
  He called on authorities to raise public awareness about the dangers of getting lured by such schemes.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The death toll from massive wildfires that have ravaged Los Angeles rose to 24 on Sunday, with officials warning of incoming dangerous winds that could whip the blazes up further.
 <br>
  <br>
  The fires continued to rip through the United States' second-largest city for the sixth day, reducing whole communities to scorched rubble and leaving thousands without homes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Massive firefighting efforts have staunched the spread of the Palisades Fire, which was looming toward upscale Brentwood and the densely populated San Fernando Valley.
  <br>
  <br>
  But conditions are set to dramatically worsen, with "extreme fire behavior and life threatening conditions" over the coming days.
  <br>
  <br>
  Winds up to 110 kilometers per hour mean a "particularly dangerous situation (PDS)" will be declared from early Tuesday, said National Weather Service meteorologist Rose Schoenfeld.
  <br>
  <br>
  These gusts could fan flames and whip up embers from existing burn zones into new areas, firefighters warned.
  <br>
  <br>
  Los Angeles County Fire Department chief Anthony Marrone said his department had received resources including dozens of new water trucks and firefighters from far afield and was primed to face the renewed threat.
  <br>
  <br>
  Questioned whether hydrants could run dry again, as they did during the initial outbreak of fires last week, Mayor Karen Bass replied: "I believe the city is prepared." (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Sources say prominent pollster Robert Chung was taken away from his home by national security police on Monday morning, as part of an investigation involving the alleged provision of assistance to a fugitive who has fled Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  It’s understood that Chung was taken to the Wong Chuk Hang office of the Public Opinion Research Institute (Pori), of which he is president and chief executive officer.
  <br>
  <br>
  The group’s former deputy CEO Chung Kim-wah was last month put on a police wanted list for alleged national security offences.
  <br>
  <br>
  He is suspected of inciting secession on social media and colluding with foreign forces, and police are offering a HK$1 million reward for information leading to his arrest.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee has told thousands of business leaders from around the world that Hong Kong is working towards developing itself into an international gold trading centre.
 <br>
  <br>
  Delivering his opening remarks at the Asian Financial Forum on Monday, Lee revealed that the SAR will build world-class gold storage facilities, and strengthen support services in insurance, testing and certification, as well as logistics.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Ultimately, we plan to create a holistic gold trading centre with an industry chain," Lee said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The stability in Hong Kong amidst rapid changes in geopolitics around the world will provide a world of investors a secure environment for gold storage as well as other forms of wealth management."
  <br>
  <br>
  He also said the SAR will build on its existing advantages, and expand its overseas network, particularly with Belt and Road countries and regions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our strategies include strengthening financial cooperation with the Middle East and the 10-member states of ASEAN, as well as other established and emerging markets."
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will also organise more international financial events, seek collaboration in financial products, talent and experience sharing, and attract more overseas enterprises and capital to Hong Kong."
  <br>
  <br>
  The 18th edition of the two-day Asian Financial Forum - themed "Powering the Next Growth Engine" - has attracted some 3,600 business and financial leaders from more than 50 countries and regions this year.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Denver Nuggets, fired by standout performances from Russell Westbrook and Nikola Jokic, rallied from a 19-point third-quarter deficit to beat the Dallas Mavericks 112-101.
 <br>
  <br>
  Westbrook scored 21 points with 10 rebounds and seven assists, reigning NBA Most Valuable Player Jokic scored 19 points with 18 rebounds and nine assists and the Nuggets out-scored the Mavs 33-12 in the fourth quarter to seize the victory in Texas.
  <br>
  <br>
  In fact the Nuggets put together two impressive comeback runs, erasing a seven-point deficit to take a one-point lead early in the third quarter only for the Mavericks to race away again.
  <br>
  <br>
  Denver took the lead for good on Westbrook's running layup for a 97-96 lead with 5:21 to play. Jokic drove for a basket and Westbrook added another layup and the Nuggets pulled away.
  <br>
  <br>
  Klay Thompson scored 25 points to lead the Mavericks, who were again without star guards Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I believe we lead the league in double-figure comebacks, and that's a catch-22 because I don't like the fact that we've been down that many times double figures," Nuggets coach Michael Malone said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "What I love about this group is how resilient they are," he added. "We get down, we stay the course, there is no panic – we stay the course and try to find a way. Didn't like the start, but I loved the finish, and that's all that counts."
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere, Jalen Brunson scored 44 points and Karl-Anthony Towns added 30 points and 18 rebounds to lead the New York Knicks in a 140-106 rout of the Milwaukee Bucks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brunson set a tone with 23 points in the first quarter and shook off a hard fall early in the third, as the Knicks rebounded from a lopsided loss to the Oklahoma City Thunder on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Giannis Antetokounmpo scored 24 points and Damian Lillard added 22 for the Bucks, whose three-game winning streak ended.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the Indiana Pacers erased a 15-point deficit to bring Cleveland's 12-game NBA winning streak to an emphatic end, beating the league-leading Cavaliers 108-93.
  <br>
  <br>
  Andrew Nembhard scored 19 points, Pascal Siakam added 18 and Myles Turner had 15 points and 10 rebounds for the Pacers, who weathered the half-time departure of star guard Tyrese Haliburton with a tight left hamstring.
  <br>
  <br>
  Indiana handed the Cavaliers just their second home defeat of the season, notching their own sixth straight victory by a double-digit margin.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's nothing to lose," Nembhard said of the Pacers' second-half push. "This is the best team in the league right now. We just had to play hard, play together, put some more physicality in the game on the defensive side and play off that." (AFP)

<img alt="Bills quarterback Josh Allen (17) hands the ball off to running back Ty Johnson (26) in the fourth quarter. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1787251_1_20250113101925.jpg&q=55">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Josh Allen threw two touchdowns as the Buffalo Bills trounced the Denver Broncos 31-7 to cruise into the next round of the NFL playoffs.
 <br>
  <br>
  The second-seeded Bills underscored their status as the biggest threat to Kansas City's hopes of reaching a fifth Super Bowl in six seasons by producing a dominant performance at their Highmark Stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  Buffalo's wild card game victory sets up a blockbuster AFC divisional round clash next weekend against third seeded Baltimore, pitting Allen against the Ravens' reigning NFL Most Valuable Player Lamar Jackson.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He's a great quarterback obviously with what he's able to do," Bills quarterback Allen said of his looming duel with Jackson. "He's one of the most dynamic if not the most dynamic quarterback in the league. He's fun to watch. But I'll be watching their defence this week."
  <br>
  <br>
  Allen finished with 272 passing yards from 20-of-26 attempts, with two touchdowns and no interceptions, along with 46 rushing yards.
  <br>
  <br>
  Seventh seeds Denver rocked Buffalo with a touchdown on the first drive of the game, quarterback Bo Nix finding receiver Troy Franklin with a deep pass for a 43-yard touchdown to mute the home crowd.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Bills responded with 10 unanswered points, Tyler Bass slotting a 26-yard field goal and James Cook skipping into the end zone for a five-yard touchdown.
  <br>
  <br>
  Denver had a chance to tie the game on the stroke of halftime but Wil Lutz's 50-yard field goal attempt bounced back off the posts to leave Buffalo 10-7 ahead at half-time.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Bills took a stranglehold on the game in the third quarter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bass slotted a 27-yard field goal to make it 13-7, and after the Bills defense forced another Denver punt, Ty Johnson snagged a superb catch inches off the ground at the back of the end zone from Allen's pass to make it 19-7. A successful two-point conversion put the Bills 21-7 up.
  <br>
  <br>
  Allen tossed his second touchdown pass at the start of the fourth quarter, picking out Curtis Samuel for a 55-yard touchdown that took the score to 28-7.
  <br>
  <br>
  Denver's offense continued to be stymied by Buffalo's defense, their impotence summed up by a failure to convert a 4th&2 situation on their next possession.
  <br>
  <br>
  Allen and the Bills took that opportunity to extend the lead to 31-7 with Bass's third field goal of the game.
  <br>
  <br>
  The result also means that the defending Super Bowl champions, the Kansas City Chiefs, will host the Houston Texans in the divisional round.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the Philadelphia Eagles advanced in the NFC with a 22-10 win over a disappointing Green Bay Packers in a defensive grind.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts returned after missing the past two games following a concussion and he showed no signs of rust with an early 11-yard touchdown pass to Jahan Dotson.
  <br>
  <br>
  Packers quarterback Jordan Love had a tough day, throwing an early interception with Darius Slay snaffling up the pick.
  <br>
  <br>
  Even when Love did manage to get Green Bay within field goal range, with a 13-play drive in the second quarter, Brandon McManus missed the kick from 38-yards.
  <br>
  <br>
  Love threw another interception at the end of the half and although McManus reduced the deficit with a 26-yard field goal in the third, Green Bay never looked in contention.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dallas Goedert put Philadelphia 16-3 up when he collected a pass from Hurts and then burst towards the end-zone, delivering two stiff arms to keep Carrington Valentine at bay as he made the score.
  <br>
  <br>
  Josh Jacobs gave the Packers some hope with his one-yard rush after he had shown impressive power and strength on the previous play to break a series of tackles and make 31-yards.
  <br>
  <br>
  But that was the last productive moment from the Packers with two Jake Elliott field goals wrapping up the win for the Eagles.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hurts threw for 131 yards and two touchdowns while running back Saquon Barkley had 119-yards on 19 carries.
  <br>
  <br>
  "No matter how it looks and there's some things we can work on, improve on, the defence did a hell of a job and we got the win," said Barkley. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Julián Alvarez's strike helped Atlético Madrid move top of La Liga with 1-0 win over Osasuna.
 <br>
  <br>
  Diego Simeone's side climbed one point clear of champions Real Madrid and six ahead of third-placed Barcelona at the halfway mark in the Spanish league season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Atlético claimed a 14th consecutive victory across all competitions, a new club record, and have lost just one top-flight game all season.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was their eighth straight league win and a fifth clean sheet from those matches, with Simeone's side back to their miserly best in defence.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We've been doing a great job, we know that it's not over here and there's a long way to go, a lot of games to come," Alvarez said. "We have to continue on this path, to keep working with humility, and good things will come."
  <br>
  <br>
  Atlético started well against an Osasuna side with several regular starters left on the bench, including their top scorer, striker Ante Budimir.
  <br>
  <br>
  Antoine Griezmann had an early goal ruled out for handball, while his strike-partner Alvarez missed Atlético's best chances of the first half.
  <br>
  <br>
  The clearest came when Rodrigo De Paul scooped a pass over the top for the Argentina international, but Alvarez's effort, which bounced awkwardly off his shoulder, was saved by Sergio Herrera.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vicente Moreno's visitors, 11th, improved as the first half progressed and managed to keep Atlético largely at bay.
  <br>
  <br>
  However early in the second half a clever Rojiblancos corner routine helped them break the deadlock.
  <br>
  <br>
  Griezmann's whipped cross to the back post was nodded back into the danger area by Clement Lenglet and Alvarez was able to slam home from close range for his sixth league goal since joining last summer from Manchester City.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was a move we've been working on, we've had some days to train, to make these strategies," explained Alvarez. "Luckily today it came off, it's important to score from dead balls, because it can be decisive, above all in hard-fought games like these, which are tricky."
  <br>
  <br>
  Atlético were not at their sharpest but had more than enough to seal another victory and claim top spot, with Osasuna not troubling Jan Oblak.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier, Getafe earned a 2-1 win at Las Palmas to climb three points above the relegation zone. (AFP)

<img alt="Barcelona celebrates after winning the Spanish Super Cup. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1787223_1_20250113072122.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Barcelona hammered rivals Real Madrid 5-2 in a wild Spanish Super Cup Clasico final in Saudi Arabia on Sunday to win the first trophy of the Hansi Flick era.
 <br>
  <br>
  Kylian Mbappé put Madrid ahead but a dominant Barcelona hit five in response before their goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny was sent off in the second half.
  <br>
  <br>
  Madrid were hoping to avenge their 4-0 home defeat by Barcelona in October's La Liga Clasico but instead were left battered and bruised by their arch-rivals in Jeddah.
  <br>
  <br>
  After Mbappé's opener, Lamine Yamal levelled and Robert Lewandowski sent Barcelona ahead from the penalty spot, with Raphinha bagging a brace and Alejandro Balde also on target.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rodrygo Goes pulled one back for Madrid with a free-kick but they could not capitalise further on their numerical advantage in a humiliating defeat for the European champions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's really nice, it had been a season since we won a trophy, it's always special and on top of that in a Clasico against Real Madrid," Barcelona defender Jules Kounde said. "We had a lot of calm and patience, knowing that if we applied the plan we would win."
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm very proud and happy with the team," he added. "Right after the red card, we got together and said we were going to have to suffer, sit back, but we had a big advantage and this can't escape us."
  <br>
  <br>
  Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti said his team's poor defending was the main reason for the heavy defeat.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We defended badly and that cost us the game – they found their goals quite easily," Ancelotti said. "We're sad, like all our fans, it's disappointing and we don't have to hide that – we have to look forwards, there's nothing else we can do."
  <br>
  <br>
  Both coaches opted to maintain the same line-ups they started with in the semi-finals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yamal issued Madrid an early warning with a curling effort from the right which forced Thibaut Courtois into a fine save.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Belgian goalkeeper also produced a strong stop to keep a Raphinha header at bay after the Brazilian evaded Lucas Vázquez with ease.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite Barcelona's opening salvo it was Real Madrid who took the lead in the fifth minute with Mbappé's brilliant goal on the counter-attack.
  <br>
  <br>
  The French forward, frustrated numerous times by the offside flag in the league defeat by the Catalans, broke loose on the halfway line after Vinicius won the ball back and, after bursting into the area, clipped past Szczesny.
  <br>
  <br>
  It took a stunning individual goal from 17-year-old Yamal to level the scoreline, with the Spanish winger cutting in from the right before stroking home a low finish inside the near post in a similar style to former Barca great Lionel Messi, to whom he is often compared. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ten-man Manchester United beat Arsenal 5-3 on penalties after a dramatic 1-1 draw in the FA Cup third round, while Tottenham needed extra time before seeing off non-league Tamworth 3-0.
 <br>
  <br>
  Defeated 2-0 by Arsenal in the Premier League in December, FA Cup holders United exacted revenge on their return to the Emirates Stadium to extend their revival after last weekend's impressive draw at Liverpool.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ruben Amorim's troubled side took the lead through Bruno Fernandes, who smashed a superb strike into the far corner from the edge of the area in the 52nd minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  United defender Diogo Dalot was sent off for a second booking after fouling Mikel Merino nine minutes later.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gabriel Magalhaes grabbed Arsenal's equaliser in the 63rd minute, the Brazilian defender swivelling to hit a low shot that took a hefty deflection off Matthijs de Ligt.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Arsenal wasted a golden opportunity to take the lead when Harry Maguire's soft challenge on Kai Havertz was ruled a penalty.
  <br>
  <br>
  The furious United defender and team-mate Manuel Ugarte were involved in a melee with several Arsenal players before Altay Bayindir saved Martin Odegaard's spot-kick.
  <br>
  <br>
  Havertz missed a host of chances to win it and the German was culpable again in the shoot-out as his effort was saved by Bayindir, setting up the much-maligned Joshua Zirkzee to stroke home the decisive kick.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We deserved to pass through this round because we all suffered together and showed character," said Amorim, whose side host Leicester in the fourth round.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A few weeks ago Joshua was in a difficult moment, now he was a game-changer," he added. "Life has these beautiful things."
  <br>
  <br>
  It was another painful result for Arsenal after Tuesday's 2-0 home defeat against Newcastle in the League Cup semi-final first leg and last weekend's damaging league draw at Brighton.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In a thousand games like this you lose one," said Gunners boss Mikel Arteta, who hasn't won a trophy since 2020.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's unbelievable," he added. "We deserved to win the game by a mile. But the reality is we are out and the only thing that's going to be judged is that."
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Tottenham, who are currently 12th in the Premier League, are 96 places above Tamworth – who sit 16th in the fifth-tier National League.
  <br>
  <br>
  The supposed gap in quality was rarely apparent as Tottenham's dismal display took them to the brink of a historic humiliation.
  <br>
  <br>
  A part-time team whose players work day jobs alongside their football careers, Tamworth matched their highly-paid and supposedly superior opponents for long periods on the Lamb Ground's sloping artificial pitch.
  <br>
  <br>
  They should have caused one of the FA Cup's greatest upsets in normal time but their missed chances proved crucial.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nathan Tshikuna's extra-time own goal and late strikes from Dejan Kulusevski and Brennan Johnson sent Tottenham into the fourth round.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tottenham last won a major trophy in 2008, but the under-fire boss Ange Postecoglou boasts he always wins silverware in his second season at a club.
  <br>
  <br>
  Having beaten Liverpool 1-0 in the League Cup semi-final first leg on Wednesday, Tottenham remain in contention for a domestic cup double despite a troubled season.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They made it hard for us, with the surface it was about us staying calm and being persistent. In the end, we got the job done," said Postecoglou, whose team travel to Aston Villa in the fourth round. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Department of Health said on Sunday that around 1,700 staff members have been deployed to two test events at the Kai Tak Sports Park - but it stressed that this had "not in any way" affected the treatment of patients.
 <br>
  <br>
  The clarification came after multiple media reports suggested some patients had to reschedule their bookings because medical staff were drafted in to take part in upcoming drills to gauge the park's crowd management measures.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, the department confirmed that staff will be sent to drills on January 24 and February 4.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said minor adjustments were made to the appointment dates for non-therapeutic student health services with the consent of service recipients.
  <br>
  <br>
  "All have been agreed by the members of the public concerned and only two appointments will be postponed by one working day, while the others will be brought forward by two to 10 working days," the statement read.
  <br>
  <br>
  The department stressed that the Student Health Service provides regular health assessment and health education of a preventive nature.
  <br>
  <br>
  That said, it pledged to make more careful planning and strengthen internal co-ordination when deploying staff for future drills, so as to minimise disruption to public services.

    Industry to bear cost of cigarette tax labels: Customs

<img alt="Customs chief Chan Tsz-tat says the labelling system is aimed at targeting untaxed cigarettes attempting to pass off as legal, duty-paid ones. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1787178_1_20250112155320.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Customs say tobacco firms will likely have to bear the cost of an upcoming labelling system which will help consumers differentiate duty-paid cigarettes from illicit ones.
 <br>
  <br>
  Commissioner of Customs and Excise Chan Tsz-tat explained the proposed scheme is aimed at weeding out untaxed cigarettes which boast identical or similar packaging to their duty-paid counterparts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both feature government health warnings, and can be difficult to distinguish even by retailers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said one way to implement the scheme is to introduce anti-forgery features on the packaging.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The labels will be similar to anti-forgery features on banknotes, which are hard to replicate," Chan told a television programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There will also be a digital tag to be scanned. The tag can be attached when the cigarettes are produced but duty has not been paid. When duty is paid, we can activate the label from the back end. Then we will know the batch has been taxed."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan dismissed concerns that tobacco companies will transfer the extra costs to consumers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our initial thought is to have the tobacco industry shoulder the cost. Currently, a pack of cigarettes on the market is sold for over HK$100. The cost of adding labels is minimal and will have no impact on the selling price," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities are also looking to introduce stiffer penalties for people who flout a law on the permitted amount of cigarettes they can bring into Hong Kong tax-free.
  <br>
  <br>
  Currently, each traveller can carry 19 sticks of cigarettes every time they enter the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said officials are looking to amend legislation within this year, so offenders will be fined HK$5,000, up from HK$2,000.

<img alt="President Biden had cited national security concerns when he blocked the US$14.9 billion sale of US Steel to Nippon Steel. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1787187_1_20250112170252.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US authorities have extended the deadline for Japan's Nippon Steel to abandon its acquisition of its American rival after President Joe Biden blocked the deal, the companies said Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Biden cited national security concerns as he put a stop to the US$14.9 billion sale of US Steel to the Japanese giant.
  <br>
  <br>
  Accusing the president of "illegal interference", the companies filed a legal review with the US court of appeals.
  <br>
  <br>
  The administration will now hold off enforcing the order until June 18, Nippon Steel and US Steel said, extending an initial 30-day deadline.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are pleased that CFIUS (the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States) has granted an extension to June 18, 2025 of the requirement in President Biden's Executive Order that the parties permanently abandon the transaction," the companies said in a joint statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We look forward to completing the transaction, which secures the best future for the American steel industry and all our stakeholders," it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  While the outgoing president's decision to block the transaction enjoyed rare bipartisan support at home, it drew sharp criticism from the Japanese government and business community.
  <br>
  <br>
  Japan's industry minister labelled it "incomprehensible" and Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba called on Washington to "explain clearly" its rationale.
  <br>
  <br>
  Japan and the United States are each other's top foreign investors.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is important to appropriately deal with the issue while not undermining the big picture of the Japan-US alliance," Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya said Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I will ask the US side to remove concerns which are spreading in the business community," he said during a television debate. (AFP)

    Zheng Qinwen through at rain-hit Melbourne Park

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Organisers cancelled five singles matches as persistent rain washed out a large chunk of play on the opening day of the Australian Open on Sunday, disappointing the large crowds who had flocked to Melbourne Park.
 <br>
  <br>
  Olympic champion Zheng Qinwen, teenager Mirra Andreeva, Donna Vekic and Arthur Fils all reached the second round after matches played on the three showcourts which have roofs, but less than an hour's play was possible outside by early evening.
  <br>
  <br>
  Five of the 32 scheduled singles matches were scratched and organisers will be giving thanks for the cushion of the extra day which was first added to the tournament last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The mood and weather had been far brighter at the start of the day as fans formed lengthy queues at the gates eager for the start of the biggest sporting event of the Australian summer.
  <br>
  <br>
  The number of matches on the first few days of the tournament mean that tennis enthusiasts can watch main draw singles action on the outer courts for the relatively cheap price of a ground pass.
  <br>
  <br>
  They were sent scurrying for cover inside the first hour of play, however, when a violent storm swept across the precinct accompanied by flashes of lightning and explosive cracks of thunder.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Lovely time here, beautiful sitting in the arena, nice watching the water collect, but we didn't get any tennis," said local academic Alex with more than a hint of sarcasm in her voice.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We've paid 60 bucks and haven't seen anything."
  <br>
  <br>
  The roofs of the showcourts had already been closed and Chinese number one Zheng and Romanian qualifier Anca Todoni continued their baseline battle on Rod Laver Arena despite the wet weather.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zheng, who is looking to emulate her idol Li Na's Australian Open triumph of 2014, was always going to attract a lot of support given the number of her compatriots who travel to Melbourne each year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 22-year-old's last competitive match on the main showcourt was her loss to Aryna Sabalenka in the 2024 final, and the tall Todoni ensured her return was not as comfortable as she might have hoped.
  <br>
  <br>
  The fifth seed, who did not play a warm-up tournament, finally broke for 4-3 in the opening set but Todoni toughed it out, battling through four deuces to hold serve before breaking back for 5-5 and earning a set point.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zheng saved the set point then took the tiebreaker 7-3 and quickly raced to a 3-0 lead in the second set while Todoni, who had treatment on her back, racked up unforced errors as she fought in vain to stay in the contest.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The first match is never easy and I made some stupid mistakes," Zheng said after wrapping up her 7-6(3) 6-1 win in a shade under two hours.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There's more and more pressure (on me but) I think deal good with the pressure and, as Billie Jean King said, pressure is the privilege. Let's keep going playing with pressure."
  <br>
  <br>
  Andreeva was earlier the first player to reach the second round at the 113th edition of the championships when the 17-year-old Russian beat Czech Marie Bouzkova 6-3 6-3 on John Cain Arena.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Margaret Court Arena, the other court with a roof, Fils was the first player to make it into the men's second round when he came from a set down to beat unseeded Finn Otto Virtanen 3-6 7-6(4) 6-4 6-4.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's pretty nice, man. First time in my life I'm playing on a good court," the 20th seed said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "To be able to play a match and to finish a match with a roof, it's much more easy than to play, to stop with the rain."
  <br>
  <br>
  Croatian 18th seed Donna Vekic, who won Olympic silver behind Zheng in Paris last year, followed Fils onto Margaret Court Arena and beat France's Diane Parry 6-4 6-4.

<img alt="Paul Chan said a new chapter discussing cooperation with Gulf countries has been added to this week's Asian Financial Forum. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1787162_1_20250112122438.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The financial secretary said an annual financial forum this week includes a new discussion panel on how to cooperate with Gulf countries, as Hong Kong looks to grasp development opportunities with the Global South.
 <br>
  <br>
  Paul Chan said the Asian Financial Forum - set to begin on Monday - will host some 3,600 policymakers and business leaders from more than 50 countries and regions, a scale similar to last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The forum sets up a new chapter on the Gulf Cooperation Council, making new explorations on how to deepen financial cooperation between Hong Kong and the Middle East, while encouraging more bilateral capital flows," Chan wrote on his weekly blog.
  <br>
  <br>
  He urged Hong Kong businesses to grasp the new development opportunities brought by the emerging markets. These include the Middle East, as well as nations from Asean and the Global South.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan also noted that the SAR serve as a platform for countries like Indonesia to raise funds for products such as catastrophe bonds, or infrastructure and green projects.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last week, he led a 130-strong delegation to Jakarta to conduct business exchange and lure investment.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said given the risks of disasters brought by climate change, companies can opt for Hong Kong's catastrophe bond products, raise funds through issuing bonds in different currencies, or establish trusts.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister added that Indonesian representatives also expressed keen interest in Hong Kong's innovation and technology sector.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ten startups from the Hong Kong Science and Technology Park took part in dozens of business matching sessions, potentially reeling in over US$5 million of business, Chan revealed.

<img alt="The suspended South Korean president has been holed up in the presidential residence since his short-lived declaration of martial law. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1787171_1_20250112144935.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korea's suspended President Yoon Suk Yeol will not attend the first hearing of his impeachment trial next week because of safety concerns, his lawyer said on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Yoon has been holed up in the presidential residence and protected by an elite guard force since being suspended and impeached last month, following a short-lived declaration of martial law that plunged the country into political chaos.
  <br>
  <br>
  He has refused to meet prosecutors and investigators and his presidential guard unit thwarted an attempt to arrest him following a tense, hours-long standoff earlier this month.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Constitutional Court has scheduled five trial dates spanning January 14 to February 4, which will proceed in his absence if he does not attend.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Concerns about safety and potential incidents have arisen. Therefore, the President will not be able to attend the trial on January 14," lawyer Yoon Kab-keun said in a statement sent to AFP.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The President is willing to appear at any time once safety issues are resolved."
  <br>
  <br>
  The court will decide whether to uphold his impeachment or restore him to office.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, investigators seeking to question Yoon on insurrection charges linked to his ill-fated martial law declaration are preparing another arrest attempt.
  <br>
  <br>
  His lawyers have repeatedly said an initial seven-day warrant and the new one they secured this week were both "unlawful".
  <br>
  <br>
  Investigators have kept secret the length of the new warrant, with local media reports saying it is longer than the previous seven days.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rival protesters for and against Yoon have gathered almost daily in the South Korean capital since the crisis unfolded.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Sunday more demonstrations were planned by rival camps outside Yoon's residence and on the streets of Seoul -- either calling for his impeachment to be declared invalid or for him to be detained immediately.
  <br>
  <br>
  The president's legal team say his guards remain on "high alert".
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon would become the first sitting South Korean president to be arrested if investigators are able to detain him.
  <br>
  <br>
  If convicted, he faces prison or even the death penalty.
  <br>
  <br>
  A team of Corruption Investigation Office (CIO) officials and police are planning for the next attempt, which they said could be their last.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CIO said anyone obstructing their attempt could be detained themselves and police reportedly held a meeting of top commanders on Friday to plan for the renewed effort.
  <br>
  <br>
  Former Presidential Security Service (PSS) chief Park Chong-jun -- who resigned on Friday and was automatically replaced by a more hardline Yoon loyalist -- told reporters there must be no bloodshed in any second arrest attempt.
  <br>
  <br>
  He faced two days of questioning and did not explain his resignation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I am cooperating as diligently as possible with the authorities' investigation," he told reporters Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  His replacement, acting PSS chief Kim Seong-hun, refused to turn up to a third summons on Saturday claiming he had to protect Yoon, opening him up to possible arrest.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee Jin-ha, head of the service's security and safety division, was questioned on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The National Office of Investigation, a police unit, sent a note to high-ranking police officials in Seoul requesting they prepare to mobilise 1,000 investigators for the fresh attempt, the Yonhap news agency reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  As the crisis goes on Yoon's ruling party has seen a bump in approval ratings.
  <br>
  <br>
  A Gallup survey published Friday showed the People Power Party's approval rating had risen to 34 percent from 24 percent three weeks ago. (AFP)

<img alt="The Security Bureau is leading a dedicated task force, with members from Police and the Immigration Department to Thailand to investigate reports of Hong Kong residents being forced to work.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A six-member task force led by Undersecretary for Security Michael Cheuk has set off for Thailand on Sunday to investigate reports of Hong Kong residents allegedly lured to Southeast Asian countries and detained to engage in illegal work.
 <br>
  <br>
  The task force comprises officials from the Security Bureau, as well as police and the Immigration Department.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters at the airport, Cheuk said the Thai government is very concerned about the issue and is willing to arrange a meeting with SAR officials.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the past, we have been communicating with the relevant authorities. In terms of the latest development, we hope to meet them face-to-face and understand the situation and to seek all feasible help from them and see how we collaborate," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As for the operation goal, we for sure want all Hongkongers to come back safely. This is our ultimate goal."
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted criminals are adopting new methods to lure victims to Southeast Asian countries. These include asking people to help bring packages to Japan or Taiwan, but then changing the destination to a Southeast Asian country at the last minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  The task force will also meet officials from the Chinese embassy in Bangkok, and talk to Ministry of Justice representatives on an anti-human trafficking committee chaired by the Thai prime minister.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said that SAR authorities have so far received 28 requests for assistance in relation to Hong Kong residents alleging to be detained in Southeast Asian countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sixteen have already returned to Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cheuk said the remaining 12 are aged 21 to 43, and none were abducted. They reported restrictions on their movement but are safe and able to remain in touch with the task force, he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  In response to media enquiries, the Security Bureau revealed on Saturday that it had recently received an assistance request from the family of an SAR resident.
  <br>
  <br>
  The woman, in her twenties, was reportedly detained in a Southeast Asian country.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said the case had since been taken up by the Office of the Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Hong Kong, and the local Chinese Embassy.
  <br>
  <br>
  The relevant parities provided advice and all feasible help based on the family’s wishes, and it is understood the woman has returned to the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Security Bureau called on the public to be vigilant against online job advertisements which are too good to be true - either those which claim to offer quick money, or highly-paid positions which do not require any work experience or academic qualification.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A hill fire which had been burning in Pat Heung since Saturday afternoon was largely put out after more than 20 hours.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Fire Services Department said Sunday that the Government Flying Service is also water bombing the site.
  <br>
  <br>
  The blaze near Kai Kung Leng, literally meaning Rooster Ridge, once stretched to 200 metres from one end to the other.
  <br>
  <br>
  Emergency services first received reports about the fire at around 5.30pm on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  A Government Flying Service helicopter was deployed later that evening to extract two hikers trapped inside Lam Tsuen Country Park due to the fire and strong winds. They were both evacuated safely.

    2025 full of uncertainties and challenges: HKMA chief

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The head of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has predicted that 2025 will be a year marked by uncertainties and many changes, while the SAR will be affected by policies set to be introduced by incoming US President Donald Trump.
 <br>
  <br>
  Authority chief executive Eddie Yue also admitted on Sunday the city cannot fully shield itself from unforeseen factors in global financial markets.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When we look at the global monetary policy from a couple years ago, we experienced similar external shocks - our interest rates went up and down together," he told a radio programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But now there's division in international monetary policy. The United States may have slower rate cuts, but other places will increase interest rates. It could lead to faster and more volatile global capital flows, with cracks emerging that we didn't see over the past few years."
  <br>
  <br>
  Looking back at the past year, Yue said Hong Kong's overall financial system had developed "quite well". The Hong Kong dollar remained stable, while the linked exchange rate system operated in an orderly manner, he noted.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong's de-facto central banker also said global investors had changed their impression of the SAR over the past year, referring to his observations at the Global Financial Leaders' Investment Summit last November.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Whether they were being interviewed on stage or chatting with us on the side, they had full confidence in Hong Kong and saw that we have many opportunities in the future," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "No one asked me how the Article 23 [legislation] affected Hong Kong or how the national security law affected Hong Kong. Those were no longer topics of interest. [Investors] were more concerned about the development of the mainland."

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Manchester City dashed the dreams of Salford's former Manchester United star owners with an 8-0 FA Cup rout on Saturday, while Liverpool cruised into the fourth round with a 4-0 victory over Accrington Stanley.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chelsea were among the other big winners with a 5-0 demolition of Morecambe.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brentford were the only Premier League side to fall to lower-league opposition as Plymouth, who sit bottom of the Championship, stunned the Bees 1-0 thanks to Morgan Whittaker's late winner.
  <br>
  <br>
  League Two Salford have risen through the non-league ranks since investment from David Beckham, Gary and Phil Neville, Paul Scholes, Ryan Giggs and Nicky Butt began in 2014.
  <br>
  <br>
  Scholes, Butt and director of football Giggs were in attendance at the Etihad but were denied a night to rival their best during glorious playing careers at Old Trafford.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pep Guardiola made wholesale changes as Erling Haaland was afforded a rest.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jeremy Doku opened the scoring after just eight minutes before youngsters Divin Mubama and Nico O'Reilly made it 3-0 before half-time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jack Grealish scored his first City goal for over a year from the penalty spot, while Doku also netted from the spot.
  <br>
  <br>
  But James McAtee, who had only scored once for City previously, earned man-of-the-match honours with a 20-minute second-half hat-trick.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I've been here since I was 10 and it's a special moment for me. Something I'll remember forever," said McAtee.
  <br>
  <br>
  There was never any hint of an upset at Anfield either despite Arne Slot making eight changes for Liverpool.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trent Alexander-Arnold was named captain in the absence of Virgil van Dijk and led by example after being criticised for his display in a 2-2 draw against Manchester United last weekend.
  <br>
  <br>
  Slot had warned the Premier League leaders that a trip to Anfield would be Accrington's "Champions League final".
  <br>
  <br>
  A mammoth 86 league positions behind Liverpool in the 92-team English league system, Stanley held out for nearly half an hour before Diogo Jota was left with a simple task to tap in from Darwin Nunez's low cross.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alexander-Arnold then stepped forward to double the lead with a sumptuous hit into the top corner from outside the box.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I could talk for hours about that (goal), unbelievable," said Slot.

  "The biggest compliment Trent could get was the reaction of everyone after the Manchester United game.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Every player around the world, maybe except for a few, has a bad game and that is completely normal, but the moment Trent has one, everyone has an opinion about it."

  Jayden Danns made it 3-0 before Federico Chiesa netted his first Liverpool goal after an injury-hit start to his time in England.

  <br>
  Joao Felix was the star of the show for Chelsea as he got a rare chance to deputise for Cole Palmer.

  The Portuguese international and Tosin Adarabioyo both scored twice, while Christopher Nkunku made up for missing an early penalty by netting his 13th goal of the season.

  Only Liverpool have taken more points at home than Brentford in the Premier League this season, while Plymouth had not won away from home all campaign.

  Leicester went one better by hitting QPR for six in an eight-goal thriller at the King Power.

    Gaza agency says eight dead in Israel strike on school

<div class="itemFullText">
 Gaza's civil defence agency said an Israeli air strike on a school-turned-shelter on Saturday killed eight people, including two children, while the Israeli military said it targeted Hamas militants.
 <br>
  <br>
  Agency spokesman Mahmud Bassal confirmed eight people, including two children and two women, were killed by Israeli shelling on the Halwa school in the northern Gaza city of Jabalia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bassal said the strike wounded 30 people, including 19 children, and that the Halwa school housed "thousands of displaced people."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Israeli military, in a statement, acknowledged it conducted a strike on the facility.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said the air force "conducted a precise strike on terrorists in a command-and-control centre" that had previously served as the Halwa school in Jabalia.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said it targeted the premises because "the school had been used by Hamas terrorists to plan and execute attacks."
  <br>
  <br>
  The attack was the latest in a series of Israeli strikes on school buildings housing displaced people in Gaza, where fighting has raged for more than 14 months.
  <br>
  <br>
  A strike on the United Nations-run Al-Jawni school in central Gaza on September 11 drew an international outcry after the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, said six of its staff were among the 18 reported dead.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Israeli military accuses Hamas of hiding in school buildings where thousands of Gazans have sought shelter – a charge denied by the Palestinian militant group.
  <br>
  <br>
  At least 46,537 Palestinians, a majority of them civilians, have been killed in Israel's military campaign in Gaza since the war began, according to data provided by the health ministry. The United Nations has acknowledged these figures as reliable.
  <br>
  <br>
  The October 7 attack that triggered it resulted in the deaths of 1,208 people on the Israeli side, most of them civilians, according to a tally based on official Israeli figures, which includes hostages killed in captivity. (AFP)

    Los Angeles investigates fire blame as curfew enforced

<img alt="Abandoned cars sit on Sunset Boulevard following the Palisades Fire. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1787121_1_20250111210945.jpg&q=40">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Californians on Friday demanded to know who is at fault for the vast devastation caused by the raging Los Angeles wildfires, as a strict curfew went into force to prevent looting and lawlessness.
 <br>
  <br>
  At least 11 people died as flames ripped through neighbourhoods and razed thousands of homes in a disaster that US President Joe Biden likened to a "war scene."
  <br>
  <br>
  While Angelenos grapple with the heart-rending ruin, anger has risen over officials' preparedness and response, particularly for a series of false evacuation alarms and after fire hydrants ran dry as firefighters battled the initial blazes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Governor Gavin Newsom on Friday ordered a "full independent review" of the city's utilities, describing the lack of water supplies during the initial fires as "deeply troubling."
  <br>
  <br>
  "We need answers to how that happened," he wrote in an open letter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Residents like Nicole Perri, whose home in the upscale Pacific Palisades burnt down, said that officials had "completely let us down."
  <br>
  <br>
  "They let us, the ordinary people, burn," added Nicholas Norman, across the city in Altadena.
  <br>
  <br>
  A flare-up late on Friday prompted new mandatory evacuations from ritzy neighbourhoods along the fire's eastern flank, which include the famous Getty Center.
  <br>
  <br>
  Built at a cost of US$1 billion and constructed partly of fire-resistant travertine stone, the acclaimed museum boasts 125,000 artworks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, as fears of looting grow, a sunset-to-sunrise curfew took effect in evacuated areas.
  <br>
  <br>
  Around two dozen arrests have already been made across Los Angeles, where some residents have organised street patrols and kept armed watch over their own houses.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If we see you in these areas, you will be subject to arrest," Los Angeles Police Department chief Jim McDonnell said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Violators face up to six months in prison or US$1,000 fines, he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The National Guard has been deployed to bolster law enforcement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Five separate fires have so far burned more than 37,000 acres (15,000 hectares), destroying around 10,000 buildings, California's fire agency reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Los Angeles County medical examiner's office confirmed an additional fatality on Friday, bringing the overall death toll so far to 11.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It reminded me of more of a war scene, where you had certain targets that were bombarded," said Biden, as he received a briefing on the fires at the White House.
  <br>
  <br>
  Winds calmed on Friday, providing a much-needed if fleeting window of opportunity for firefighters battling blazes around the clock for a fourth consecutive day.
  <br>
  <br>
  At the biggest of the blazes, in Pacific Palisades and Malibu, firefighters said they were starting to get the fire under control, with eight percent of its perimeter contained.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Braveheart" actor Mel Gibson was the latest celebrity to reveal his Malibu home had burned down, telling NewsNation the loss was "devastating."
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the Eaton Fire in the Altadena area was three percent contained, with fire chief Jason Schillinger reporting "significant progress" in quelling the blaze.
  <br>
  <br>
  A third fire that exploded on Thursday afternoon near the wealthy Hidden Hills enclave, home to celebrities like Kim Kardashian, was 50 percent surrounded.
  <br>
  <br>
  But emergency chiefs warned the situation is "still very dangerous" and reprieve from the intense gusts that spread embers will not last.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The winds have died down today, but... are going to increase again in the coming days," said Deanne Criswell, administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema).
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities have said it was too early to know the cause of the blazes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Biden took a veiled swipe at incoming president Donald Trump, who has spread misinformation over the flames that has then been amplified on social media.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You're going to have a lot of demagogues out there trying to take advantage of it," Biden said of the fires.
  <br>
  <br>
  Governor Newsom, who has been blamed for the disaster by the president-elect, invited Trump to visit Los Angeles and survey the devastation with him.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the spirit of this great country, we must not politicise human tragedy or spread disinformation from the sidelines," said Newsom.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wildfires occur naturally, but scientists say human-caused climate change is altering weather and changing the dynamics of the blazes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two wet years in southern California have given way to a very dry one, leaving ample fuel on the ground primed to burn.
  <br>
  <br>
  Emergency managers apologised on Friday after false evacuation alerts were erroneously sent to millions of mobile phones, sparking panic.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I can't express enough how sorry I am," said Kevin McGowan, the director of the Los Angeles County Office of Emergency Management.
  <br>
  <br>
  Los Angeles fire chief Kristin Crowley blamed recent funding cuts, telling Fox News affiliate KTTV her department was chronically "understaffed" and "under-resourced." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 More than 200,000 people visited an exhibition in Dubai showcasing the appeal and vibrancy of Hong Kong through interactive art technology.
 <br>
  <br>
  The "Immersive Hong Kong" exhibition was part of Hong Kong's broader initiative to strengthen ties with the Middle East, with Chief Executive John Lee and other senior officials leading delegations to the region since 2023, to tell good stories of the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  The event, held from December 20 last year to January 5, was organised by the Information Services Department and the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office in Dubai.
  <br>
  <br>
  Apollonia Liu, the Director of Information Services, said the city has been fostering closer ties with the Middle East.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are very delighted with the positive response as well as the expansion of our circle of friends and network through staging this exhibition," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Information Services Department said it will explore organising the exhibition in other cities later this year, after already holding it in Dubai, Jakarta, Bangkok, Kuala Lumpur, and Guangzhou.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Vice President Han Zheng on Saturday met with British Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves, who is in Beijing for the 11th China-UK Economic and Financial Dialogue.
 <br>
  <br>
  China and the UK are both major economies and financial heavyweights in the world, Han said, pointing out that strengthening economic and financial cooperation in the spirit of strategic partnership is of great significance to promoting economic growth, improving people's lives and encouraging green development in these two countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  It will also inject confidence and impetus into the development of the world economy, Han added.
  <br>
  <br>
  China is willing to continue to expand openness and exchanges with the UK, enhance mutual understanding and trust, and deepen mutually beneficial cooperation to bring more benefits to the two countries and the world, said Han.
  <br>
  <br>
  Reeves, meanwhile, said the resumption of this dialogue after nearly six years is of great significance.
  <br>
  <br>
  The British side attaches importance to developing relations with China and is willing to strengthen candid dialogue and mutually beneficial cooperation with China to promote the economic development of each country, she added. (Xinhua)

<div class="itemFullText">
 More than 3,000 flights were cancelled on Friday and thousands more were hit by delays due to a storm in the southern United States, airlines and tracking website FlightAware reported.
 <br>
  <br>
  Delta Airlines said a "worse-than-expected mix of winter weather" prompted the shutdown of all five runways at Atlanta International Airport for more than two hours.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Delta cancelled approximately 1,100 flights across our network" on Friday, the carrier said as it was "working to recover the airline heading into Saturday."
  <br>
  <br>
  A Delta plane also had to abort take-off at Atlanta because of an engine problem.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 200 passengers and crew aboard the Boeing 757-300 had to exit via emergency slides, US media reported citing a company statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dallas Fort Worth (Texas) and Charlotte Douglas (North Carolina) were also affected by the bad weather, with more than 1,200 flights cancelled across the two airports according to FlightAware.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tracking website recorded more than 3,000 cancellations in total on Friday across multiple airports.
  <br>
  <br>
  The United States was already hit by a winter storm at the start of the week, leaving at least five people dead and prompting hundreds of flights to be scrapped as it swept across the centre and east of the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  Temperatures plummeted below zero degrees Fahrenheit (-18 degrees Celsius) in some places and tens of thousands of people were left without electricity. (AFP)

    'It's great to be back': Moyes returns as Everton boss

<img alt="David Moyes is reported to have agreed a two-and-a-half-year contract. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1787106_1_20250111175717.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 David Moyes has returned as Everton manager following Sean Dyche's sacking, the struggling Premier League club announced on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  "David is widely recognised as one of the Premier League's most experienced and accomplished managers, having led Everton for more than 500 matches from 2002 to 2013," a statement on the club's website read.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are pleased that David is joining us at this pivotal time in Everton's history," Everton's executive chairman Marc Watts said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With over a decade of experience at the club, he is the right leader to propel us through our final season at Goodison Park and into our new stadium. We look forward to working with David to build the foundation of a new era for Everton," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's great to be back! I enjoyed 11 wonderful and successful years at Everton and didn't hesitate when I was offered the opportunity to rejoin this great club," Moyes remarked.
  <br>
  <br>
  The club's new owners, the Friedkin Group, moved for Moyes after dismissing Dyche just hours before Thursday's 2-0 win against Peterborough in the FA Cup third-round.

  <br>
  Moyes is reported to have agreed a two-and-a-half-year contract to return to Everton 12 years after leaving for an unsuccessful spell in charge of Manchester United.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 61-year-old Scot has been out of work since leaving West Ham at the end of last season.
  <br>
  <br>
  He is set to start his second spell as Everton boss against Aston Villa in the Premier League on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Moyes remains popular with Everton fans after his 11-year stint in charge from 2002 to 2013, a period that included a fourth-place finish in 2005 and an FA Cup final appearance in 2009.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dyche's two-year reign came to an abrupt end on Thursday after Everton's defeat at Bournemouth on January 4.
  <br>
  <br>
  Former Chelsea boss Graham Potter was said to be Everton's top target but he joined West Ham, with Jose Mourinho, currently in charge of Fenerbahce in Turkey, also reportedly distancing himself from the job.
  <br>
  <br>
  Moyes will be tasked with leading Everton away from the relegation zone as they prepare to usher in a new era at their Bramley Moore Dock Stadium from next season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dyche managed only one win in his last 11 games in charge, leaving them just one point above the relegation zone.
  <br>
  <br>
  Former Everton defender Leighton Baines, now the club's under-18s head coach, and captain Seamus Coleman took charge for the win against third tier Peterborough. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Sam Moore, the surviving half and higher voice of the 1960s duo Sam & Dave that was known for such definitive hits of the era as “Soul Man” and “Hold On, I'm Comin,’” has died. He was 89.
 <br>
  <br>
  Publicist Jeremy Westby said Moore died on Friday morning in Coral Gables, Florida, due to complications while recovering from surgery. No additional details were immediately available.
  <br>
  <br>
  Moore, who influenced musicians including Michael Jackson, Al Green and Bruce Springsteen, was inducted with Dave Prater into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1992.
  <br>
  <br>
  Like many ’60s soul acts, Sam & Dave faded after the 1960s. But “Soul Man” hit the charts again in the late 1970s when the Blues Brothers, John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd recorded it with many of the same musicians.
  <br>
  <br>
  Moore had mixed feelings about the hit becoming associated with the “Saturday Night Live” stars, remembering how young people believed it originated with the Blues Brothers. (AP)

<img alt="Gael Monfils of France hits a return to Zizou Berges of Belgium during their singles final match at the ATP Auckland Classic, in Auckland. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1787094_1_20250111153952.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Gael Monfils became the oldest singles champion in ATP Tour history when the 38-year-old Frenchman swept to victory in the final of the Auckland Classic on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Monfils outclassed Belgian qualifier Zizou Bergs 6-3, 6-4, to eclipse Swiss great Roger Federer in the record books, a day before the start of the Australian Open in Melbourne.
  <br>
  <br>
  Monfils powered to a 13th career title and became the oldest player to win an ATP final since the Tour launched in 1990.
  <br>
  <br>
  Federer was two months younger when he won the Swiss Indoors in 2019.
  <br>
  <br>
  The flamboyant Monfils roared and flexed to the crowd after clinching victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said he was proud to win at an age when others have usually hung up the racquet.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Age is a number but I keep working," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I keep believing that I can play high quality tennis and I've been showing it this week so I'm very happy."
  <br>
  <br>
  Monfils won his first ATP Tour title in 2005.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was 20 years ago, I still have the passion to play tennis, I still feel like I strike a very good ball so hopefully many more to come."
  <br>
  <br>
  In hot conditions, the Frenchman defied his age to play with greater athleticism than Bergs, who was contesting his first final.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bergs dropped his serve early in both sets and lacked the firepower to break back against Monfils's clinical serve and varied groundstrokes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Monfils will rise 11 places to 41st in the world after his victory, taking the momentum into Melbourne, where he faces fellow Frenchman Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard in the first round of the Australian Open. (AFP)

    Jeju Air black boxes stopped recording before crash

<img alt="Investigators say the boxes are crucial to their probe but added they would not give up on trying to find out why the crash happened.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The black boxes holding the flight data and cockpit voice recorders for the crashed Jeju Air flight that left 179 people dead stopped recording four minutes before the disaster, South Korea's transport ministry said on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Boeing 737-800 was flying from Thailand to Muan, South Korea, on December 29 carrying 181 passengers and crew when it belly-landed at the Muan airport and exploded in a fireball after slamming into a concrete barrier.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The analysis revealed that both the CVR and FDR data were not recorded during the four minutes leading up to the aircraft's collision with the localiser," the transport ministry said in a statement, referring to the two recording devices.
  <br>
  <br>
  The localiser is a barrier at the end of the runway that helps with aircraft landings and was blamed for exacerbating the crash's severity.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Plans are in place to investigate the cause of the data loss during the ongoing accident investigation," the statement added.
  <br>
  <br>
  South Korean and US investigators are still probing the cause of the crash of Jeju Air flight 2216, which prompted a national outpouring of mourning with memorials set up across the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  Investigators have pointed to a bird strike, faulty landing gear and the runway barrier as possible issues.
  <br>
  <br>
  The pilot warned of a bird strike before pulling out of a first landing, then crashed on a second attempt when the landing gear did not emerge. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Los Angeles Lakers coach J.J. Redick says he hopes the team's eventual return to play can "give people hope" after seeing his Pacific Palisades home incinerated in the deadly wildfires that have ravaged the city.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Lakers postponed a scheduled home game against Charlotte on Thursday because of the fires, which have left at least 11 people dead and destroyed around 10,000 homes and other buildings.
  <br>
  <br>
  Redick oversaw practice on Friday for what was expected to be an emotionally charged home game against the San Antonio Spurs on Saturday, but that game too was postponed in a decision announced by NBA league chiefs.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Los Angeles Clippers' game against Charlotte set for Saturday was also postponed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Redick is one of several members of the Lakers organization directly impacted by the fires, seeing his family's rented property in Pacific Palisades, the ground zero of the disaster, consumed by the flames.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Friday, Redick became emotional as he spoke to reporters about the personal impact of the disaster on his family.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm not sure I've wept or wailed like that in several years," said Redick, who was living in the house with his wife, Chelsea, and their two sons.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was not prepared for what I saw," Redick said of visiting Pacific Palisades after returning home from the Lakers' road game at Dallas in the early hours of Wednesday morning.
  <br>
  <br>
  By that stage, Redick's family had been evacuated to a hotel. The Lakers coach then paid a visit to his home early on Wednesday to assess the situation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was complete devastation and destruction. I went a different way to the house through the village, and it's all gone," Redick said. "I don't think you can ever prepare yourself for something like that."
  <br>
  <br>
  Redick said his family had lost "irreplaceable" items in the destruction.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Everything that we owned that was of any importance to us in almost 20 years together as a couple and 10 years of parenting was in that house." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong experienced its coldest day so far this winter, with the observatory recording a minimum temperature of 11.5 degrees at its Tsim Sha Tsui headquarters on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The mercury dipped even lower in parts of the New Territories.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier, the forecaster warned of possible frost on Saturday morning, on high ground or in the northern part of the New Territories.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, hikers in Tai Mo Shan told RTHK that they hadn't seen any frost overnight.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It would create a really memorable experience. We'll take some photos if we see it. There's a small chance it could happen, but I won't be disappointed if we don't see it," said a hiker.
  <br>
  <br>
  The observatory reminded the public to wrap up warm and maintain proper indoor ventilation, adding that chilly weather is expected on Sunday morning.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Customs chief Chan Tsz-tat stressed that safety takes priority for officers and they must hold themselves accountable for their actions.
 <br>
  <br>
  A 27-year-old motorcyclist was killed last week in Kowloon Bay, after his vehicle rammed into an iron pole, and a 40-year-old man was later arrested on suspicion of tampering with a motor vehicle.
  <br>
  <br>
  Customs earlier said it was a tragic incident, and confirmed that one of their officers was involved.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a radio programme on Saturday, Chan said the case has been undergoing investigation and the involved frontline officer is now on leave.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan stressed that officers should contribute to society within legal and safe circumstances, and be responsible for every action even if they are not on duty.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have all along provided very comprehensive training for our staff members, starting from joining our department to on-the-job training, we have set very clear instructions," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Regarding the case, I must reiterate that safety is our primary consideration, no matter if a staff member is carrying out his duty in his official capacity or as a private citizen."

    Naming schools refusing flu jab sensible: Lo

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Health Secretary Lo Chung-mau on Saturday said the government must inform parents about which schools are not offering on-site flu shots so they can plan to get their children vaccinated elsewhere.
 <br>
  <br>
  His comment came a day after the Department of Health named 168 schools that refused to take part in a voluntary on-campus vaccination programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters after attending a radio programme, Lo said the transparency isn't about damaging school reputations but about protecting children's health.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If the parents are not aware that their school does not offer the program, they will not be aware that they would need to bring their kids to a private clinic or whatever facility and arrange the vaccination for their own kids," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have the responsibility to inform the public and especially the parents. So it's not a matter of affecting the reputation of a certain school. I think this is a fact and we all have the same mission and that is to protect our kids especially in this winter flu season."
  <br>
  <br>
  The health chief also said that the winter influenza season has officially begun, with a four-year-old boy who didn't get a flu shot and whose school didn't offer vaccines, now in intensive care.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, Lo said elderly patients no longer need to wait in long queues outside dental clinics in cold weather with the new online appointment system.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We hope that at the age of 80, our elderly will still be able to retain their [teeth], at least have more than 20 teeth. That would save a lot of our resources in providing treatment for them," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lo added that officials are planning to expand the student dental care programme to include both kindergarten and secondary students within this year.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Graham Potter suffered a painful start to his West Ham reign as Aston Villa's late surge sealed a 2-1 win in the FA Cup third round on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Potter was hired by the Hammers on Thursday to replace Julen Lopetegui, who was sacked earlier this week after just six months in charge.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the former Chelsea manager was unable to make a winning return to the dug-out as West Ham squandered the first half lead given to them by Lucas Paqueta.
  <br>
  <br>
  On a freezing evening at Villa Park, Unai Emery's men emphasised the size of the task facing Potter with a second half fightback that exposed West Ham's defensive flaws.
  <br>
  <br>
  Amadou Onana equalised before Morgan Rogers bagged the winner to leave Potter holding his head in frustration.
  <br>
  <br>
  The former Brighton boss is back in management for the first time since being dismissed by Chelsea in April 2023.

  Potter lasted less than seven months at Chelsea, losing 11 times in his 31 games in charge and slumping to 11th place in the top-flight despite a 288 million pound spending spree in his one transfer window.
  <br>
  <br>
  Potter has tried to learn from the "pain" of that failure, vowing to "come back stronger" after an experience that may have cost him a chance at the England job when Thomas Tuchel was hired last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Potter had just one training session with his players before the trip to Villa and was without key forwards Jarrod Bowen and Michail Antonio.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under the circumstances, he can be encouraged by West Ham's attacking play but fixing their issues at the back must be top of his to-do list.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Overall, disappointed to go out, but lots of positives in the game," Potter said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The start was really good but in the second half Aston Villa stepped-up and pushed us back a bit too much. That's something we will have to improve."

    Biden slams Meta's "shameful" fact-checking decision

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Biden blasted Meta on Friday for scrapping fact-checking on Facebook and Instagram in the United States, calling the move "really shameful" after a global network warned of real-world harm if the tech giant expands its decision to other countries.
 <br>
  <br>
  Meta chief executive Mark Zuckerberg triggered alarm on Tuesday when he announced the company was ditching third-party fact-checking in the United States and turning over the task of debunking falsehoods to ordinary users under a model known as "Community Notes," popularized by X.
  <br>
  <br>
  The decision was widely seen as an attempt to appease President-elect Donald Trump, whose conservative support base has long complained that fact-checking on tech platforms was a way to curtail free speech and censor right-wing content.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think it's really shameful," Biden told reporters at the White House when asked about the announcement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Telling the truth matters," he said, adding that the move was "completely contrary to everything America's about."
  <br>
  <br>
  The International Fact-Checking Network has warned of devastating consequences if Meta broadens its policy shift beyond US borders to the company's programs covering more than 100 countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Some of these countries are highly vulnerable to misinformation that spurs political instability, election interference, mob violence and even genocide," IFCN, which includes AFP among dozens of its global member organizations, said in an open letter to Zuckerberg.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If Meta decides to stop the programme worldwide, it is almost certain to result in real-world harm in many places," it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zuckerberg doubled down in an interview Friday with podcaster Joe Rogan, comparing the fact-checking programme with "something out of 1984," in a reference to George Orwell's dystopian novel.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that the programme, which began in 2016, was "destroying so much trust, especially in the United States."
  <br>
  <br>
  Zuckerberg also expressed regret for giving "too much deference" to the traditional media, criticizing it for pushing the narrative that social media misinformation had swung the 2016 election in favour of Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zuckerberg stunned many when he said on Tuesday that fact-checkers were "too politically biased," and added that the programme had led to "too much censorship."
  <br>
  <br>
  IFCN's letter rejected the claim as "false," insisting that Meta's fact-checking partners underwent "rigorous" verification to meet its strict nonpartisanship standards.
  <br>
  <br>
  Far from questioning those standards, it added, Meta had "consistently praised their rigour and effectiveness."
  <br>
  <br>
  The United Nations rights chief Volker Turk also insisted on Friday that regulating harmful content and hate speech online "is not censorship."
  <br>
  <br>
  Allowing such content to flourish online has "real-world consequences," Turk said on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brazil on Friday gave Meta 72 hours to explain its fact-checking policy for the country, and how it plans to protect "fundamental rights" on its platforms.
  <br>
  <br>
  Attorney General Jorge Messias told journalists his office could take "legal and judicial" measures against Meta if it does not respond in time to an extrajudicial notice filed Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Facebook currently pays to use fact checks from around 80 organizations globally on the platform, as well as on WhatsApp and Instagram. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US markets finished lower on Friday, after a strong employment report fuelled expectations the central bank might make fewer interest rate cuts this year.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 1.6 percent to 41,938.45, and the S&P 500 Index fell 1.5 percent to 5,827.04.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Nasdaq Composite Index retreated 1.6 percent to 19,161.63.
  <br>
  <br>
  The slide across major indexes came after a Department of Labor report showed the world's biggest economy adding 256,000 jobs in December.
  <br>
  <br>
  This defied expectations of a slowdown in job growth, while the unemployment rate ticked down to 4.1 percent as well.
  <br>
  <br>
  Following the report, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note shot up, before moderating its gains.
  <br>
  <br>
  Investors took the better-than-expected labour market figures "as a sign" that the Federal Reserve would be slower in reducing interest rates, said Sam Stovall of CFRA.
  <br>
  <br>
  While the Fed has started cutting rates last year, after the Covid-19 pandemic, policymakers have been balancing this with progress in lowering inflation sustainably.
  <br>
  <br>
  "January will continue to be a volatile month," Stovall said, citing interest rate worries and traders' focus on earnings reports.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to the CME FedWatch tool, the market sees a 97 percent chance that the Fed holds rates steady at its next policy meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among individual companies, Apple shed 2.4 percent and Nvidia shares fell 3.0 percent. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 US job gains soared past expectations in December, according to government data released on Friday, in a sign that the labour market remains healthy just shortly before President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration this month.
 <br>
  <br>
  Hiring in the world's biggest economy was 256,000 last month, up from a revised 212,000 in November, said the Labour Department.
  <br>
  <br>
  The jobless rate crept down to 4.1 percent from 4.2 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The latest report marks a solid end to 2024 for the jobs market, which has held up in the face of elevated interest rates, allowing consumers to continue spending.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Trump's return to the White House this month could bring uncertainty.
  <br>
  <br>
  He has pledged to raise tariffs on imports and deport undocumented immigrants – many of whom are a part of the US labour force including in areas like agriculture.
  <br>
  <br>
  In December, average hourly earnings picked up 0.3 percent from the month before to US$35.69.
  <br>
  <br>
  From a year ago, wages were up 3.9 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Labour market resilience and continued wage growth support consumption, a key driver of the US economy. (AFP)

    CE urges firms to invest more on the mainland

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Friday called on businesses to contribute to the country's development by investing on the mainland.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a forum in Shenzhen on technological collaboration between the two places, the CE noted that firms can benefit from Beijing's new amendments to the Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement, or CEPA, which will take effect in March.
  <br>
  <br>
  The changes include applying Hong Kong laws when firms from the SAR engage in arbitration, and allowing the proceedings to take place in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I encourage Hong Kong firms, or even companies from around the world, to make use of CEPA's new preferential treatments, and explore countless opportunities in the mainland market," Lee said in a speech.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They can then serve the country by bringing in capital and talent, while companies can go global."
  <br>
  <br>
  The CE said Hong Kong and Shenzhen can become a driving force in the development of new quality productive forces.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the SAR's businesses should also further develop their regional and international networks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee added that as the latest round of technological revolution takes place rapidly, firms should adapt to changes and seize opportunities provided by the nation's opening up.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at the same event, innovation, technology and industry minister Sun Dong noted that the SAR needs to align itself with the country's development plans.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also highlighted the need to speed up the construction of the Hetao Shenzhen-Hong Kong Science and Technology Innovation Co-operation Zone to provide impetus for high-level development in the region.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An estimated 3.2 million children under the age of five are expected to face acute malnutrition this year in war-torn Sudan, according to the United Nations Children's Fund (Unicef).
 <br>
  <br>
  "Of this number, around 772,000 children are expected to suffer from severe acute malnutrition," Eva Hinds, Unicef Sudan's Head of Advocacy and Communication, said on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Famine has already gripped five areas across Sudan, according to a report last month by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), a UN-backed assessment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sudan has endured 20 months of war between the army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), killing tens of thousands and, according to the United Nations, uprooting 12 million in the world's largest displacement crisis.
  <br>
  <br>
  Confirming that 3.2 million children are currently expected to face acute malnutrition, Hinds said "The number of severely malnourished children increased from an estimated 730,000 in 2024 to over 770,000 in 2025."
  <br>
  <br>
  The IPC expects famine to expand to five more parts of Sudan's western Darfur region by May – a vast area that has seen some of the conflict's worst violence. A further 17 areas in western and central Sudan are also at risk of famine, it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Without immediate, unhindered humanitarian access facilitating a significant scale-up of a multisectoral response, malnutrition is likely to increase in these areas," Hinds warned.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sudan's army-aligned government strongly rejected the IPC findings, while aid agencies complain that access is blocked by bureaucratic hurdles and ongoing violence.
  <br>
  <br>
  In October, experts appointed by the United Nations Human Rights Council accused both sides of using "starvation tactics."
  <br>
  <br>
  On Tuesday the United States determined that the RSF had "committed genocide" and imposed sanctions on the paramilitary group's leader.
  <br>
  <br>
  Across the country, more than 24.6 million people – around half the population – face "high levels of acute food insecurity," according to the IPC, which said: "Only a ceasefire can reduce the risk of famine spreading further." (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 England's upcoming Champions Trophy cricket match against Afghanistan should go ahead despite calls for a boycott over the Taliban's treatment of women, according to a senior British government minister.
 <br>
  <br>
  A group of more than 160 British politicians have called on the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) to refuse to play Afghanistan in protest at the women's sports policy of the Taliban.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since returning to power in 2021 the Taliban have effectively banned female participation – a move that puts the Afghanistan Cricket Board at odds with International Cricket Council (ICC) rules.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ICC, however, has allowed the Afghanistan men's team to continue to compete in global competitions, with England due to face them in the one-day international Champions Trophy in Lahore on February 26.
  <br>
  <br>
  And Cabinet minister Lisa Nandy said the match should be played amid concerns a boycott would see England docked points were they to forfeit the game.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I do think it should go ahead," Nandy, the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport said on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  She added: "I'm instinctively very cautious about boycotts in sports, partly because I think they're counterproductive.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think they deny sports fans the opportunity that they love, and they can also very much penalise the athletes and the sports people who work very, very hard to reach the top of their game, and then they're denied the opportunities to compete.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They are not the people that we want to penalise for the appalling actions of the Taliban against women and girls."
  <br>
  <br>
  The ECB has resisted calls for a boycott, with chief executive Richard Gould saying instead he would "actively advocate" for collective action by the ICC instead.
  <br>
  <br>
  That position has been backed by Downing Street, with a spokesman for UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer urging the ICC to take the lead on the issue.
  <br>
  <br>
  South Africa, who are also due to play Afghanistan at the Champions Trophy, have backed the ECB's stance.
  <br>
  <br>
  This is despite veteran anti-apartheid campaigner and British politician Peter Hain, who played a key role in sparking his native South Africa's sporting isolation during the 1970s, calling for a boycott.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are of the view that a more unified and collective approach from all ICC members will be more impactful," said Cricket South Africa president Rihan Richards. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Britain's Treasury chief is travelling to China this weekend to discuss economic and financial cooperation between the countries, as the UK's Labour government seeks to reset ties with Beijing.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Treasury on Friday said that Rachel Reeves would travel to Beijing and Shanghai and would meet with her counterpart, Vice Premier He Lifeng.
  <br>
  <br>
  Reeves' trip is expected to revive the China-UK Economic and Financial Dialogue — annual bilateral talks that have been suspended since 2019.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey and the UK Financial Conduct Authority's chief executive, Nikhil Rathi, are also in the delegation, according to the Treasury.
  <br>
  <br>
  Representatives from some of Britain’s biggest financial services firms will join the trip.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials did not provide details, but media reports have said senior executives from HSBC Holdings and Standard Chartered were included.
  <br>
  <br>
  Reeves' visit comes after Foreign Secretary David Lammy travelled to China in October and Prime Minister Keir Starmer met with President Xi Jinping on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Brazil in November.
  <br>
  <br>
  The meetings form part of a bid by Starmer, who was elected as leader in July, to strengthen political and economic ties with China, the UK's fifth-largest trading partner.

 Police on Friday said they arrested 17 people for allegedly conspiring to verbally intimidate the candidates and scrutineers in an election to pick the representatives of a public housing estate.
 <br>
  <br>
  The votes, which took place last month, was to select residents to oversee the management of King Lam Estate in Tseung Kwan O.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a press briefing, Chief Inspector Ho Kai-ho said officers made the arrests between December 18 and Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho added the suspects were aged between 25 and 77 years old.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Some of them have backgrounds related to triads, but it is not appropriate to disclose the exact number of suspects with triad backgrounds here. Among those arrested in this operation, some were candidates in this election," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho also said if convicted of conspiracy to criminally intimidate, offenders could face up to a five-year jail term.

    At least 10 dead in LA wildfires

 The two biggest wildfires ravaging the Los Angeles area have killed at least 10 people and burned more than 10,000 homes and other structures, officials said as they urged more people to heed evacuation orders after a new blaze ignited and quickly grew.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Kenneth Fire started late on Thursday afternoon in the San Fernando Valley just 3.2 kilometres from a school serving as a shelter for evacuees from another fire. It moved into neighbouring Ventura County but a large and aggressive response by firefighters stopped the flames from spreading.
  <br>
  <br>
  About 400 firefighters remained on scene overnight to guard against the fire flaring up.
  <br>
  <br>
  Only hours before the Kenneth Fire roared to life officials expressed encouragement after firefighters aided by calmer winds and help from crews from outside the state saw the first signs of successfully beating back the region’s two devastating wildfires.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Eaton Fire near Pasadena that started on Tuesday night has burned more than 5,000 structures, a term that includes homes, apartment buildings, businesses, outbuildings and vehicles.
  <br>
  <br>
  Firefighters were able to establish the first bit of containment on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  To the west in Pacific Palisades, the largest of the fires burning in the LA area has destroyed over 5,300 structures and firefighters had no containment.
  <br>
  <br>
  All of the major fires that have broken out this week are located in a roughly 40-kilometre band north of downtown Los Angeles, spreading a sense of fear and sadness across the nation’s second-largest city.
  <br>
  <br>
  No cause has been identified for the largest fires.
  <br>
  <br>
  The level of devastation is jarring even in a state that has grown used to massive wildfires.
  <br>
  <br>
  A large portion of scenic Pacific Palisades has been obliterated. Dozens of blocks in the seaside neighbourhood were flattened to smouldering rubble.
  <br>
  <br>
  In neighbouring Malibu, blackened palm strands were all that was left above debris where ocean-front homes once stood. (AP)

    Patient transferred to HK using cross-border ambulance

<div class="itemFullText">
 A 67-year-old patient was transferred from the Greater Bay Area (GBA) to Tuen Mun Hospital on Friday, the first case arranged under a cross-boundary ambulance transfer scheme.
 <br>
  <br>
  The one-year pilot scheme for direct cross-boundary ambulance transfer was launched in November last year, allowing patients in the GBA to be conveyed to designated hospitals in the SAR directly without the need to be handed over to local health authorities at boundary control points.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hospital Authority said its major incident control centre received a request for a patient transfer from the Shenzhen Hospital of the University of Hong Kong on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said the patient was admitted to the hospital in the GBA on Tuesday due to respiratory failure and had to be put on a ventilator.
  <br>
  <br>
  Anne Lee, deputy hospital chief executive of the Shenzhen Hospital, said the patient's condition improved and his family hoped he could be treated in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Although the patient is still in a serious condition, we think he is stable enough for a safe transfer," she told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee said the man was transferred from the GBA hospital at 11am via the Shenzhen Bay Port, and arrived at Tuen Mun Hospital in about 40 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said the process was smooth and the patient had been admitted to a ward.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked about the criteria for patients to be transferred to Hong Kong, she said authorities are always willing to help patients in need.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Not only patients using a ventilator are suitable for a transfer. If patients were involved in a traffic accident on the mainland, and have suffered fractures, they would not be able to use public transport to cross the border," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Lee stressed that if patients were able to make use of public transportation or could make arrangements themselves, they should not use this cross-boundary ambulance service.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Polytechnic University (PolyU) on Friday said that artificial intelligence, cancer treatment and innovative construction technologies were among 18 research projects it had received public funding for in the current financial year.
 <br>
  <br>
  It said in a statement it received nearly HK$92 million from the Research Grants Council, an advisory body under the University Grants Committee that allocates funding to eight local universities.
  <br>
  <br>
  The university said money for three of the projects came from a grant that supports younger academic staff with their research.
  <br>
  <br>
  Four others are to do with the Research Impact Fund, and they cover studies on sustainable aviation fuel engineering, cancer immunotherapy, modular integrated 3D-printed concrete construction, and headsets design for virtual reality and augmented reality.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The successes in securing [the council's] funds further illustrate PolyU’s strength in basic research and its capacity to lead innovative projects with significant societal impact, delivering valuable benefits," said the university's vice president for research and innovation, Christopher Chao.

 The Observatory (HKO) on Friday said a 4.2 magnitude earthquake stuck the sea south of Guangdong.
 <br>
  <br>
  The forecaster said more than 10 people in Hong Kong reported feeling minor shaking sensations for a few seconds.
  <br>
  <br>
  The HKO said the quake hit the waters south of Shanwei city at 2.40pm, with the epicentre around 200 kilometres south-east of Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tremor's focal depth was about 10 kilometres.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Initial estimate gave a local intensity of III (three) on the Modified Mercalli Intensity Scale, that is felt indoors. The vibration was like passing of light trucks," the HKO said.

    Officials take jab at schools refusing vaccine drive

<div class="itemFullText">
 Health authorities have singled out more than 160 schools for declining to arrange on-campus influenza vaccinations, calling on parents to bring their children to get jabbed as soon as possible.
 <br>
  <br>
  The list of schools, which has been uploaded online, includes a number of international and elite institutions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Albert Au, head of the Centre for Health Protection's communicable disease branch, on Friday said seven institutional or school outbreaks were reported last week, up from two to four cases a week in December.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said authorities have reminded schools to take extra precautionary measures and that most of them have arranged on-campus vaccinations for pupils.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A tiny fraction of schools have still refused to arrange on-campus vaccinations through the outreach programme for pupils. There are 168 of them. Another 13 schools which had previously agreed to arrange vaccinations, have not yet confirmed a date for the jabs," Au told an RTHK programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I would like to urge the parents of pupils studying at these schools, to bring their children to get vaccinated as soon as possible, if they haven't already done so."
  <br>
  <br>
  Au added the city had entered the flu season with influenza activity expected to increase further before peaking in about a month's time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Patrick Ip, professor in paediatrics and adolescent medicine at the University of Hong Kong, urged schools to help all pupils get vaccinated against the flu.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[For] all those schools that have not joined the school vaccination programme, I would encourage them to seriously think about what would be a better arrangement, for example, through better communication with the parents, particularly those parents of the younger kids," Ip told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also said the vaccination rate among young kids, particularly those in pre-school and kindergarten, was rather unsatisfactory.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 One of the NGOs, which operates under the Green@Community network, on Friday called on the government to offer more subsidies, as the community recycling network is due to take charge of all plastic collection work at the city's housing estates.
 <br>
  <br>
  Under the existing pilot scheme, three contractors were responsible for plastic collection at Eastern, Kwun Tong and Sha Tin districts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, organisations under the Green@Community network at three districts - Eastern, Kwun Tong and Sha Tin - were also tasked with heading to housing estates to collect recyclables other than plastics.
  <br>
  <br>
  With the scheme coming to an end, the Environmental Protection Department announced that a new arrangement would be implemented on January 19 to consolidate the process and prevent a duplication of resources.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yau Wing-kwong, founder of the organisation that operates under the Green@Community network in Tai Po Market, told RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme that there will be increased costs.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Previously, the collection is by the pilot scheme. So they (the government) did not put the budget on delivery of the plastic or treatment of the plastic because the contractor would come and take it away," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With the change of the pilot scheme, they have to pay more for the collectors to come and take it. They're talking about one part of cost for delivery - they come to collect the plastic - and another cost for treating the plastic. So all these additional costs would be put on the recyclable shops, the collection shops."
  <br>
  <br>
  But Yau assured the public that Green@Community's service quality would not be compromised under the new arrangement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We really don't have to worry about that. Because the Environmental Protection Department comes to visit us very frequently, and they have offices working very closely with all these recyclable shops," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Also, it's well-documented every day how much waste is collected, where it goes, and who has taken the recyclables away to recycle. It's all well-documented, and we make sure that they go to the right channel."

 Secretary for Home and Youth Affairs, Alice Mak, on Friday said the government would publish a comprehensive report of care teams once the service agreement with them ends.
 <br>
  <br>
  The government outsources district-level community services to care teams, which offer assistance to residents in each district, such as visiting the elderly.
  <br>
  <br>
  The teams are required to submit work and financial reports regularly to the authorities.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, Chinese University's student publication, U-Beat, earlier reported that it was unable to access these reports while doing a story on the issue.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters, Mak said it is more appropriate to reveal this information after the two-year contract concludes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "After the two-year service agreement, we will disclose the achievements of the care teams, including their work targets and indicators attained, in an appropriate manner."
  <br>
  <br>
  "We hope that after the two-year service agreement, there will be a complete and comprehensive record. I also think this approach is appropriate," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  There are 452 care teams in Hong Kong, with the first batch beginning their services in the Southern District in April 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  The home affairs chief noted the teams were able to visit 340,000 households over the past year, describing their performance as ideal.

 Mitch Jeter's 41-yard field goal with seven seconds left lifted Notre Dame to a 27-24 comeback win over Penn State in the Orange Bowl -- one of the College Football Playoff semifinals -- on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The seventh-seeded Fighting Irish won their 13th game in a row and advanced to the CFP national championship game, which will be played on January 20 in Atlanta.
  <br>
  <br>
  Their opponent will be the winner of the Friday night Cotton Bowl match-up between fifth-seeded Texas and eighth-seeded Ohio State.
  <br>
  <br>
  It will be the first time Notre Dame has played for a national title since 2013 when it lost to Alabama in a game played in Miami Gardens.
  <br>
  <br>
  Christian Gray's diving interception of a pass from Penn State quarterback Drew Allar with 33 seconds left set up the Fighting Irish's winning score.
  <br>
  <br>
  Notre Dame quarterback Riley Leonard completed 15 of 23 passes for 223 yards, one touchdown and two interceptions and converted a key first down on the Fighting Irish's final drive to set up Jeter's game-winner. (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President-elect Donald Trump on Thursday said that Russian leader Vladimir Putin wanted to meet and that a rendezvous between the pair was being arranged.
 <br>
  <br>
  He made the statement just a week and a half before taking office, following promises during his campaign to bring peace to Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He wants to meet, and we're setting it up," Trump said at a meeting with Republican governors at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida.
  <br>
  <br>
  "President Putin wants to meet, he's said that even publicly, and we have to get that war over with, that's a bloody mess."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has never made any concrete proposals for a ceasefire or peace deal, and has often criticised the large amount of military aid the United States has sent to Kyiv.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has also frequently mocked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky as a "salesman," while raising eyebrows in Washington by rarely criticising Putin -- and even speaking admiringly of the Kremlin leader.
  <br>
  <br>
  In addition to criticising the military aid sent to Ukraine under President Joe Biden, Trump has raised doubts over continued US involvement in the Western military alliance Nato.
  <br>
  <br>
  The United States under Biden has been Ukraine's biggest wartime backer, providing military aid worth more than US$65 billion since February 2022. (AFP)

<img alt="A firefighter battles the wildfires in the Los Angeles area. Scientists warn that natural disasters like the LA fires will intensify as the world continues to warm. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1786929_1_20250110122421.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The planet notched up its hottest year ever last year with such a big jump that it temporarily passed a major climate threshold, several weather monitoring agencies announced Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Last year's global average temperature easily passed 2023's record heat and kept pushing even higher. It surpassed the long-term warming limit of 1.5 degrees Celsius.
  <br>
  <br>
  The milestone was confirmed by the European Union's Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S), which said climate change is pushing the planet's temperature to levels never before experienced by modern humans.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The trajectory is just incredible," C3S director Carlo Buontempo told Reuters, describing how every month in 2024 was the warmest or second-warmest for that month since records began.
  <br>
  <br>
  The planet's average temperature in 2024 was 1.6 degrees Celsius higher than in 1850-1900, the "pre-industrial period" before humans began burning CO2-emitting fossil fuels on a large scale, C3S said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last year was the world's hottest since records began, and each of the past 10 years was among the 10 warmest on record.
  <br>
  <br>
  Britain's Met Office confirmed 2024's likely breach of 1.5C, while estimating a slightly lower average temperature of 1.53C for the year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Japan recorded a 1.57C average while the American monitoring teams — Nasa, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the private Berkeley Earth — were to release their figures later Friday but all will likely show record heat for 2024, European scientists said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The six groups compensate for data gaps in observations that go back to 1850, in different ways, which is why numbers vary slightly.
  <br>
  <br>
  Governments promised under the 2015 Paris Agreement to try to prevent average temperatures exceeding 1.5C, to avoid more severe and costly climate disasters.
  <br>
  <br>
  The first year above 1.5C does not breach that target, which measures the longer-term average temperature.
  <br>
  <br>
  Buontempo said rising greenhouse gas emissions meant the world was on track to soon also blow past the Paris goal - but that it was not too late for countries to rapidly cut emissions to avoid warming rising further to disastrous levels.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's not a done deal. We have the power to change the trajectory from now on," Buontempo said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The impacts of climate change are now visible on every continent, affecting people from the richest to the poorest countries on earth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wildfires raging in California this week have killed at least five people and destroyed hundreds of homes.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2024, Bolivia and Venezuela also suffered disastrous fires, while torrential floods hit Nepal, Sudan and Spain, and heatwaves in Mexico and Saudi Arabia killed thousands.
  <br>
  <br>
  Climate change is worsening storms and torrential rainfall, because a hotter atmosphere can hold more water, leading to intense downpours. The amount of water vapour in the planet's atmosphere reached a record high in 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  But even as the costs of these disasters spiral, political will to invest in curbing emissions has waned in some countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  US President-elect Donald Trump, who takes office on January 20, has called climate change a hoax, despite the global scientific consensus that it is human-caused and will have severe consequences if not addressed.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US experienced 24 climate and weather disasters in 2024 in which the cost of damages exceeded US$1 billion, including Hurricanes Milton and Helene, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chukwumerije Okereke, a professor of global climate governance at the University of Bristol in the UK, said the 1.5C milestone should serve as "a rude awakening to key political actors to get their act together".
  <br>
  <br>
  "Despite all the warnings that scientists have given, nations... are continuing to fail to live up to their responsibilities."
  <br>
  <br>
  Concentrations in the atmosphere of carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas, reached a fresh high of 422 parts per million in 2024, C3S said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zeke Hausfather, a research scientist at US non-profit Berkeley Earth, said he expected 2025 to be among the hottest years on record, but likely not top the rankings.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's still going to be in the top three warmest years," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  That's because while the biggest factor warming the climate is human-caused emissions, temperatures in early 2024 got an extra boost from El Nino, a warming weather pattern which is now trending towards its cooler La Nina counterpart. (Agencies)

    Cavs down Raptors for 12th straight victory

<img alt="Cavs guard Darius Garland drives to the basket against Toronto Raptors guard Jamal Shead. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1786925_1_20250110120213.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Darius Garland erupted for 40 points as the Cleveland Cavaliers came from behind to extend their unbeaten streak to 12 games with a 132-126 defeat of the Toronto Raptors.
 <br>
  <br>
  Twenty-four hours after their bruising win over the Western Conference-leading Oklahoma City Thunder, the Cavs looked poised to suffer a huge upset after the Raptors opened up a 12-point lead late in the third quarter.
  <br>
  <br>
  But a late burst of scoring from Garland hauled the Cavs back into the contest, and a lopsided 34-23 fourth quarter sealed a battling victory for the Eastern Conference leaders.
  <br>
  <br>
  Garland finished with 40 points from 14-of-22 shooting – 14 points coming in a fourth quarter flurry that swung the game decisively to Cleveland.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cavaliers coach Kenny Atkinson was left in no doubt as to the size of Garland's contribution to a win which leaves Cleveland leading the standings with a 33-4 record, six games clear of the reigning champion Boston Celtics.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He carried us," Atkinson said of Garland's performance. "This is the first game all year where I felt like one guy carried us. We weren't good but he single-handedly took over this game."
  <br>
  <br>
  Atkinson said Garland's performance was further proof of why he should be a shoo-in for next month's All-Star game.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I respect the league but he's got to be in that top, All-Star tier," Atkinson added. "He's phenomenal. He completely took over the game and carried us."
  <br>
  <br>
  With Donovan Mitchell missing from the Cavaliers line-up, Garland's scoring support came from Evan Mobley with 21 points while Jarrett Allen provided 18 points with 15 rebounds, two blocks and a steal to cap a fine all round display.
  <br>
  <br>
  In other NBA games, the injury-hit Mavericks produced a late fourth quarter escape to grab a 117-111 win over the Portland Trail Blazers in Dallas.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Mavs, missing injured stars Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving, looked headed for defeat after trailing by 10 points with just over four minutes remaining.
  <br>
  <br>
  But an electrifying 16-0 run flipped the script and set up an unlikely Dallas win. P.J. Washington led the scoring with 23 points and Dereck Lively added 21 to close out the victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Orlando, meanwhile, Julius Randle finished with 23 points and Anthony Edwards added 21 as the Minnesota Timberwolves cruised to a 104-89 victory over the Orlando Magic.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Detroit, the Golden State Warriors held off the Pistons to dig out a 107-104 win on the road.
  <br>
  <br>
  Buddy Hield led the Warriors scorers with 19 points while Stephen Curry finished with 17 after an uncharacteristically wayward shooting performance from long-range. Curry made only five-of-21 shots from the field, including only two of 14 attempted three-pointers. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The new commissioner of customs and excise, Chan Tsz-tat, said officers are dedicated to enhancing measures to tackle space oil drug cases, both those produced locally and those smuggled in from abroad, in order to curb the rise of this emerging narcotic.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chan said customs seized around 23.5 kilogrammes of etomidate, a main component of the space oil drug, last year, primarily shipped to Hong Kong via express delivery.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters on Friday, Chan said the department conducted a raid on a local drug distributor just a few days ago, highlighting the alarming popularity of the drug in the market.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When we found that person was in possession of one kilogramme of cocaine, we subsequently escorted the offender to his premises. What was so surprising is that we also found at that place that the drug trafficker is in fact manufacturing at his home space oil drugs," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He is in possession of apparatus to make these material of space oil drug into those capsules that can be easily consumed using electronic smoking devices."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said frontline officers are equipped with specialised equipment in detecting the drug.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have been using ion scanners as well as Raman spectrometres. These two types of equipment are very effective in detecting whether any consignment contain such drugs," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "On top of our detection on the front line, we also use a risk-based and intelligence-led approach to suppress the smuggling of dangerous drugs."
  <br>
  <br>
  He also said they would utilise big data to analyse the sources of shipments, transporters and declaration information moving forward.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The security chief of impeached South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol said on Friday that he had been unfairly treated for a sitting leader and warned bloodshed must be avoided.
 <br>
  <br>
  Yoon faces arrest over a criminal probe into his December 3 martial law bid.
  <br>
  <br>
  Park Chong-jun, head of the Presidential Security Service (PSS), is himself under investigation for obstructing official duty related to a six-hour standoff last week with investigators trying to execute an arrest warrant for Yoon.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arriving at police headquarters for questioning, Park, who is a former senior police official, said the current attempt to arrest a sitting president was wrong and Yoon deserved treatment "becoming of" the country's status.
  <br>

  "I believe there should not be any physical clash or bloodshed under any circumstances," Park told reporters, adding acting President Choi Sang-mok had not responded to his request for safety assurances for officials involved.

  Hundreds of PSS agents blockaded the presidential compound and thwarted investigators from trying to arrest Yoon. The investigators were pulled back because of the risk of a clash.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials of the Corruption Investigation Office for High-ranking Officials (CIO), which is leading the investigation, have said PSS agents were carrying firearms during the standoff although no weapons were drawn.
  <br>
  <br>
  The investigators obtained a new arrest warrant this week after the embattled leader defied repeated summons to appear for questioning.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Thursday, lawyers for Yoon said the arrest warrant was illegal and invalid.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon is under a separate Constitutional Court trial reviewing parliament's impeachment of the suspended leader on December 14 to decide whether to remove him from office permanently or reinstate him. (Reuters)

 Jimmy Carter brought a fleeting moment of national unity to a divided America on Thursday as all five living US presidents gathered for their predecessor's moving state funeral in Washington's National Cathedral.
 <br>
  <br>
  At the rare gathering just days before Donald Trump's return to the White House, sitting President Joe Biden gave a eulogy describing "character" as fellow Democrat Carter's main attribute.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump shook hands with former president Barack Obama on the country's day of mourning, while Bill Clinton and George W Bush were also there to pay their respects.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Biden, 82, also appeared to deliver a veiled swipe at Trump, the Republican whose racially-charged rhetoric and efforts to overturn the 2020 election he has often criticised as threats to democracy.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have an obligation to give hate no safe harbour," said Biden, also stressing the importance standing up against "the greatest sin of all, the abuse of power."
  <br>
  <br>
  After the speech, Biden briefly tapped the flag-draped coffin of Carter, America's 39th commander-in-chief, who died on December 29 at the age of 100 in his native Georgia.
  <br>
  <br>
  The presidential funeral was the first since George H W Bush died in 2018.
  <br>
  <br>
  During the service, family members and former political adversaries alike paid emotional tributes to Carter, the oldest-ever former US president and the only one to make it to three figures.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carter's coffin was earlier transported by an honour guard from the US Capitol, where thousands of mourners had paid their respects as the former president lay in state.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thursday has been designated a national day of mourning in the United States with federal offices closed. (AFP)

    Trump denied bid to halt hush money sentencing

<div class="itemFullText">
 The US Supreme Court on Thursday denied a last-minute bid by President-elect Donald Trump to halt sentencing in his hush money case.
 <br>
  <br>
  The top court, which includes three justices appointed by Trump, rejected his emergency application seeking to block Friday's sentencing by a 5-4 vote.
  <br>
  <br>
  The court, in a brief unsigned order, said the "burden that sentencing will impose on the President-elect's responsibilities is relatively insubstantial" and noted that Trump will be allowed to attend virtually.
  <br>
  <br>
  The court also noted that the judge who presided over the hush money case has already said he plans to impose a sentence of "unconditional discharge," which does not carry any jail time, fine or probation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump is scheduled to be sentenced in Manhattan at 9:30 am local time on Friday after being convicted by a New York jury in May of 34 counts of falsifying business records to cover up a hush money payment to porn star Stormy Daniels.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump, 78, who is to be sworn in as president on January 20, filed an emergency application with the Supreme Court on Wednesday seeking to halt his sentencing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Four justices - Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, all conservatives - were in favour of granting Trump's request to halt his sentencing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Amy Coney Barrett, also conservatives, joined the three liberal justices in rejecting the president-elect's bid.
  <br>
  <br>
  Barrett, Gorsuch and Kavanaugh were appointed by Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's lawyers made several legal manoeuvres in an effort to fend off sentencing, arguing that it would be a "grave injustice" and harm "the institution of the presidency and the operations of the federal government."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's attorneys also claimed that the immunity from prosecution granted to a sitting president should be extended to a president-elect.
  <br>
  <br>
  Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg rejected their arguments in his response on Thursday, saying Trump was a private citizen when he was "charged, tried, and convicted."
  <br>
  <br>
  In the order, the Supreme Court said Trump can still appeal his conviction through the New York state courts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump is the first former US president to be convicted of a crime and will be the first convicted felon to serve in the White House.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, a federal appeals court on Thursday declined to block the Justice Department from releasing a report on Trump, which is expected to detail investigations conducted by Special Counsel Jack Smith over attempts to subvert the 2020 presidential election results and for mishandling classified documents.
