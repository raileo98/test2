    Parents need more guidance on child abuse law: YMCA

<img alt="The Chinese YMCA says parents should be aware of their own emotions when taking care of their children, and to seek help when needed. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795949_1_20250316183822.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An NGO on Sunday said many parents are still unclear about an incoming law which makes it mandatory to report child abuse, adding that authorities should step up efforts to explain the legislation which comes into effect next year.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Chinese YMCA of Hong Kong polled over 2,500 parents from last July to November in a survey which found that two-thirds of them did not fully understand the Mandatory Reporting of Child Abuse Ordinance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Albert So, a lawyer who has been assisting the YMCA in holding activities regarding the legislation, said parents may not have had the chance to read up on the changes.
  <br>
  <br>
  “There are also lots of parents that are not local. They may be coming from the other jurisdictions, for example, some overseas ethnic minorities or people coming from mainland China,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Due to the cultural difference, [non-local parents] may not know about the situation of current legislation of Hong Kong," he said, adding more explanatory work, such as holding seminars and relevant activities, would improve the situation.
  <br>
  <br>
  The survey also revealed that almost 80 percent of the parents polled experienced mood swings when disciplining their children, and that about 30 percent of them believed a certain level of physical punishment could change their children’s behaviour.
  <br>
  <br>
  YMCA’s coordinating secretary Phoebe Sze says punishment has serious impacts on child development and should be discouraged.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We don't agree about using punishment to our children. It will harm their self-image in building their self-confidence, and may discourage their relationship with others. This would [also] discourage the children's exploration abilities.
  <br>
  <br>
  It called on parents to be more aware of their own emotions when taking care of their children and to seek help when needed.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A fire that tore through a nightclub in North Macedonia killed 51 revellers attending a hip-hop concert at the venue, with more than 100 wounded, the country's interior minister said on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The fire broke out in "Pulse", a nightclub in the eastern town of Kocani, where more than 1,000 mostly young fans had crammed in to see the hip-hop duo DNK popular in the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  "According to the data we have by now, 51 persons lost their lives," interior minister Pance Toskovski said after visiting the scene.
  <br>
  <br>
  "More than 100 persons are injured," Toskovski said, adding that the wounded had been transported to the local hospital in the town as well as to the capital Skopje and the town of Stip some 30 kilometres to the south.
  <br>
  <br>
  The concert kicked off around midnight, while online media outlet SDK, reported that the fire started about three hours later.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to Toskovski, the fire was probably caused by the use of pyrotechnic devices "used for light effect at the concert".
  <br>
  <br>
  "At the moment of activating the so-called sprinklers, the sparks caught the ceiling that was made of easily flammable material after which for a very short period of time the fire spread across the whole discotheque, creating a thick smoke" Toskovski said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Helicopters ferried some of the wounded to the capital Skope's hospitals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Videos posted on social networks and shot before the fire show the use of stage jets, a type of indoor fireworks used during concerts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other videos published by media in the Balkan country show the entrance to the building blackened by flames.

    HK firms should strive for win-win deals: Starry Lee

<img alt="Starry Lee responds to questions on articles criticising the CK Hutchison port deal. Photo courtesy of TVB" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795934_1_20250316165214.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's sole delegate to the country's top legislature on Sunday said all Chinese people should do their part to help the nation’s development, and business exchanges are only sustainable if it is a win-win situation.
 <br>
  <br>
  Starry Lee made the comment when asked on a TVB programme about Beijing officials reposting articles criticising CK Hutchison's sale of its Panama Canal ports – and dozens of other ports across the globe – to a US consortium.
  <br>
  <br>
  She added that businesspeople and Hong Kong residents have always been able to create win-win situations for all parties.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The best way to approach matters is to create win-win situations. Because no matter if you're talking about doing business or having an exchange with other people, it's only sustainable if it's win-win and benefits both parties," the member of the National People's Congress Standing Committee said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We think Hong Kong people are always flexible. We've always been able to grasp the idea of creating win-win situations."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee, a former chairwoman of the DAB party, also said the Northern Metropolis development has been too slow, and the Hong Kong government can speed things up by creating what she called "an SAR within an SAR".
  <br>
  <br>
  She said such a development mode has been adopted on the mainland where officials would cut red tape and adopt a different set of vetting procedures for projects.

    CK Hutchison Panama port deal questioned

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Beijing officials have shared a second article by the Ta Kung Pao newspaper criticising the sale by Hong Kong conglomerate CK Hutchison of its Panama Canal ports – and dozens of other ports across the globe – to a US consortium.
 <br>
  <br>
  CK Hutchison – the flagship firm of Hong Kong's richest man Li Ka-shing – will reportedly make US$19 billion from the deal.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the article, Ta Kung Pao questioned why CK Hutchison would want to sell to the US, which it described as having ill intentions.
  <br>
  <br>
  US President Donald Trump has said he wants the US to take back control of the Panama Canal – and has not ruled out military force.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ta Kung Pao also asked whether the transaction had taken the interests of the nation into account, saying those who choose to dance with the Americans have no future even if they make big money.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last week, the liaison office and the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs office shared an earlier article by Ta Kung Pao calling on CK Hutchison to rethink the deal.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Sunday said the success of mainland film Ne Zha 2 has inspired his administration to continue breaking barriers and forging its own path.
 <br>
  <br>
  Writing on his Facebook page after watching the highest-grossing film in national box office history, Lee said the movie showcased the rapid advancement of the nation's animation technology.
  <br>
  <br>
  Citing a line from the movie, "If there is no path ahead, I will make one", Lee drew parallels between Ne Zha's determination and Hong Kong's approach to tackling long-standing issues.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This mirrors Hong Kong's recent vigorous reforms, as we continue to resolve long-standing issues one after another," he wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Similarly, my team and I tackle each challenge fearlessly, demonstrating breakthrough thinking."
  <br>
  <br>
  The chief executive concluded by expressing optimism about the city's film industry, citing the success of recent local productions and expressed the hope they would reach more viewers outside Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  The sequel to the 2019 blockbuster Ne Zha premiered in Hong Kong last month, topping the local box office for several days.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 More than 3,000 runners took part in the inaugural Kai Tak Run at the Kai Tak Sports Ground on Sunday morning.
 <br>
  <br>
  Runners jogged past major facilities of the new sports ground, such as the Kai Tak Arena, with organisers saying participants were able to admire the design of the new venues and take in the nearby scenery.
  <br>
  <br>
  The event featured over eight races, including an elite, and open category.
  <br>
  <br>
  Matthew Yu, who competed at the event said he enjoyed the route. "It's very innovative, and it's something new."
  <br>
  <br>
  "We usually [race] through the streets during marathons, Tolo Harbour, or along cycling tracks in Tai Po. It's the first time for me to [race] in a large sports facility, and seeing the view from inside is a new experience for me," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Yu, who was competing in a wheelchair, also expressed the hope organisers could look into the possibility of allowing those in wheelchairs to compete alongside other groups.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think it would be better to allow us to participate alongside people in the other races, such as by having both groups start together. We could then enjoy the atmosphere together. I also think this would help promote disability inclusion," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yiu Hong-lai, the winner of the five-kilometre elite category race also said she enjoyed the race track.
  <br>
  <br>
  The runner said the route offered some challenges, such as slopes and U-turns, which tested runners' strength and ability to change directions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Also at the event was lawmaker Vincent Cheng. Speaking to reporters, Cheng expressed the hope that officials can promote the Kai Tak community ahead of international events.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Rugby Sevens is happening later this month. I hope organisers can provide more information to tourists on where to visit and the tourist spots nearby, so they could consume more [in Hong Kong]," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cheng also said the new sports ground can host more school sports competitions.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan said grooming local tech talent and attracting people in the field from outside Hong Kong are both important for the development of innovation and technology in the city.
 <br>
  <br>
  Writing on his weekly blog, he noted that local tech hubs have been offering thousands of jobs in recent weeks.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister said about 500 firms will host a job fair at Cyberport later this week offering more than two thousand jobs, more than half of them related to artificial intelligence.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last month, companies from the Science and Technology Park offered a thousand jobs in the industry.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan noted that in his budget last month, he asked more companies in the field to go to local schools to share their experience and inspire students.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister then said that the government's Hong Kong Investment Corporation will promote the development of AI technology, including hosting a forum on AI for global youth scientists.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It will promote the technical exchange of AI and its industrial development, including open source technology. Among them, the design and application of the Risc-V open source computer chip is an important part of strategic development going forward," Chan wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the firm will announce this week its partnership with a group focusing on Risc-V.

 The local official who heads the National Games Coordination Office on Sunday said test runs for cross-border sports events have shown there is room for improvement.
 <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong is set to co-host the November Games with Guangdong and Macau for the first time, and will host events for eight sports, including fencing and basketball.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeung Tak-keung told a radio programme that organisers are working to improve cross-border marathon and road cycling events, particularly in supporting athletes who lag behind the leading group.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We found that for some of the arrangements we can make further improvements, like how to support our athletes, and how to monitor [them]," he told reporters after the radio show.
  <br>
  <br>
  "During the road cycling and marathon [events], sometimes there may be a distance [between] the leading group and the other athletes – they may be not so close together. So how we can provide better support to them, that is one area that we think we can further improve."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Games will also feature 23 mass participation events, including bowling which will be hosted by the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  Local selections will take place in April and successful candidates can compete with bowlers from other Greater Bay Area cities in the finals in August.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeung added that officials are still working out the pricing for tickets but promised they will be affordable.

 US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov spoke on Saturday to discuss the next stage in talks on ending Moscow's war against Ukraine.
 <br>
  <br>
  According to State Department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce, the top diplomats "agreed to continue working towards restoring communication between the United States and Russia."
  <br>
  <br>
  The statement gave no details on when the next round of US-Russia talks, which are being hosted by Saudi Arabia, would begin.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rubio also updated Lavrov on military activity in the Middle East, where US forces carried out deadly strikes on Saturday against Huthi rebel targets in Yemen, the statement said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite recent tensions between President Donald Trump and his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky, Kyiv has agreed in principle to a US-brokered 30-day unconditional ceasefire if Moscow halts its attacks in eastern Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  Russia's President Vladimir Putin has not however agreed to any truce, instead setting conditions that were beyond what was called for in the US agreement with Ukraine. (AFP)

    US launches large-scale strikes against Yemeni Houthis

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 At least 19 were killed as US President Donald Trump launched large-scale military strikes against Yemen's Iran-aligned Houthis on Saturday over the group's attacks against Red Sea shipping, warning "hell will rain down" on them if they do not stop.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump also warned Iran, the Houthis' main backer, that it needed to immediately halt support for the group. He said if Iran threatened the United States, "America will hold you fully accountable and, we won't be nice about it!"
  <br>
  <br>
  The unfolding strikes - which one official said would last days and maybe weeks - represent the biggest US military operation in the Middle East since Trump took office in January. It came as the United States ramps up sanctions pressure on Tehran while trying to bring it to the negotiating table over its nuclear programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  At least 13 civilians were killed and nine injured in US strikes on Yemen's capital Sanaa, according to the Houthi-run health ministry.
  <br>
  <br>
  Six others, including four children and one woman, were killed and 11 were injured in a US strike on the northern province of Saada, the Houthi-run Al-Masirah TV reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Houthis' political bureau described the attacks as a "war crime."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our Yemeni armed forces are fully prepared to respond to escalation with escalation," it said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Residents in Sanaa said the strikes hit a building in a Houthi stronghold.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The explosions were violent and shook the neighbourhood like an earthquake. They terrified our women and children," one of the residents, who gave his name as Abdullah Yahia, told Reuters.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Houthis, an armed movement that took control of most of Yemen over the past decade, have launched more than 100 attacks targeting shipping since November 2023, disrupting global commerce and setting the US military on a costly campaign to intercept missiles and drones that burned through stocks of US air defences.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Houthis say the attacks are in solidarity with Palestinians over Israel's war with Hamas in Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  Iran's other allies, Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, have been severely weakened by Israel since the start of the Gaza conflict. Syria's Bashar al-Assad, who was closely aligned with Tehran, was overthrown by rebels in December.
  <br>
  <br>
  But throughout, Yemen's Houthis have remained resilient and often on the offensive, sinking two vessels, seizing another and killing at least four seafarers in an offensive that disrupted global shipping, forcing firms to re-route to longer and more expensive journeys around southern Africa.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US administration of former President Joe Biden had sought to degrade the Houthis' ability to attack vessels off its coast but limited the U.S. actions.
  <br>
  <br>
  US officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, say Trump has authorised a more aggressive approach.
  <br>
  <br>
  The strikes on Saturday were carried out in part by fighter aircraft from the Harry S. Truman aircraft carrier, which is in the Red Sea, officials said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US military's Central Command, which oversees troops in the Middle East, described Saturday's strikes as the start of a large-scale operation across Yemen.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Houthi attacks on American ships & aircraft (and our troops!) will not be tolerated; and Iran, their benefactor, is on notice," Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth wrote on X. "Freedom of Navigation will be restored."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump held out the prospect of far more devastating military action against Yemen.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Houthi attack on American vessels will not be tolerated. We will use overwhelming lethal force until we have achieved our objective," Trump wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  Iran's mission to the United Nations did not immediately respond to a request for comment. (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A federal judge on Saturday barred the administration of President Donald Trump from deportations under an 18th century law that Trump invoked just hours earlier asserting the United States was being invaded by a Venezuelan gang and that he had new powers to remove its members from the country.
 <br>
  <br>
  James E. Boasberg, chief judge for the US District Court for the District of Columbia, said he needed to issue his order immediately because the government was already flying migrants it claimed were newly deportable under Trump’s proclamation to El Salvador and Honduras to be incarcerated there.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I do not believe I can wait any longer and am required to act,” he said during a Saturday evening hearing in a lawsuit brought by the ACLU and Democracy Forward. “A brief delay in their removal does not cause the government any harm,” Boasberg added, noting they remain in government custody.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ruling came hours after Trump claimed the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua was invading the United States and invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 , a sweeping wartime authority that allows the president broader leeway on policy and executive action to speed up mass deportations of people — potentially pushing his promised crackdown on immigration into higher gear.

    France beat Scotland to claim Six Nations

<img alt="France's scrum-half Antoine Dupont (centre) holds the trophy while celebrating. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795897_1_20250316063919.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 France claimed their seventh Six Nations trophy in a record-strewn 35-16 victory Scotland on Saturday, shaking off their beautiful runners-up tag on a crisp evening at the Stade de France.
 <br>
  <br>
  Les Bleus matched England's number of titles since Italy joined the championship in 2000 and did so in style, scoring 30 tries in a pulsating campaign to make sure they would not end up runners-up for the fifth time in six years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Their only defeat came against England at Twickenham but Fabien Galthie's side put that 26-25 loss behind them by humiliating Italy before crushing Ireland despite losing their talismanic captain Antoine Dupont through injury.
  <br>
  <br>
  The hosts turned on the gas after the interval on Saturday, and prevailed through tries by Yoram Moefana (2), Louis Bielle-Biarrey and Thomas Ramos, who kicked the other points to become came France's all-time record points scorer.
  <br>
  <br>
  Scotland made a game of it and scored a try through Darcy Graham with Finn Russell kicking their other points.
  <br>
  <br>
  France, who gave Galthie his second title after the 2022 Six Nations since he took charge in 2020, finished on 21 points with England second.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was party time at the Stade de France but Les Bleus only really got into their groove after the break, relying again on forward power to finish off a combative but limited Scotland team.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dupont, who ruptured his ACL against Ireland, stayed with the squad and the mercurial scrumhalf received the loudest cheers as he watched from the stands.
  <br>
  <br>
  France started well.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gael Fickou tore through the middle and set up fellow centre Moefana for a try between the posts while Scotland were down to 14 after Jamie Ritchie was shown a yellow card.
  <br>
  <br>
  France, however, suffered a blow when Peato Mauvaka was sin-binned for head-butting Ben White and the hooker look relieved when he heard the sanction was not upgraded to a red card.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ramos slotted a penalty from under the sticks to beat Frederic Michalak's record of 436 points scored for France and give them a 13-3 lead. He now has 450 to his name.
  <br>
  <br>
  The visitors reduced the arrears when Graham touched down after collecting Russell's inside ball. The flyhalf converted and added a penalty to level the scores as French prop Jean-Baptiste Gros was sent off for 10 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ramos, however, restored a slim advantage with a penalty on the stroke of halftime before giving away possession with a poor kick.
  <br>
  <br>
  Scotland's Tom Jordan went over after a superb Blair Kinghorn break but the try was ruled out by the TMO as the fullback was ruled to be in touch.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bielle-Biarrey scored a championship record eighth try in a single campaign after being set up by Romain Ntamack who had sprinted through the defence.
  <br>
  <br>
  Then came the bomb squad as Galthie sent five forwards on from the bench and Scotland cracked.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ramos crossed the whitewash after another devastating rolling maul and Moefana, who bulldozed past Russell after Fickou's offload, claimed the bonus-point try. (Reuters)

 CCTV news says a People's Liberation Army naval fighter jet crashed on Saturday during a training exercise in Hainan Province, with the pilot safely ejecting.
 <br>
  <br>
  The jet from the Southern Theatre Command went down at about 1.30 pm and crashed in an open area in Lingao County, the navy said in a statement on social media.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said the pilot parachuted to safety and there was no collateral damage on the ground. The command said an investigation is taking place.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Gaza's civil defence agency said nine people, including journalists, were killed in Israeli strikes in the north on Saturday, an attack Hamas denounced as a "blatant violation" of the fragile ceasefire.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Nine martyrs have been transferred (to hospital), including several journalists and a number of workers from the Al-Khair Charitable Organisation, as a result of the occupation targeting a vehicle with a drone in the town of Beit Lahia, coinciding with artillery shelling on the same area," said civil defence spokesman Mahmoud Bassal.
  <br>
  <br>
  The health ministry in the Hamas-run Palestinian territory reported that "nine martyrs and several injured, including critical cases, have arrived at the Indonesian Hospital in northern Gaza Strip, due to the ongoing Israeli aggression."
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, the Israeli military said it struck "two terrorists... operating a drone that posed a threat to IDF troops in the area of Beit Lahia."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Later, a number of additional terrorists collected the drone operating equipment and entered a vehicle. The IDF struck the terrorists," it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  After the strikes, Hamas accused Israel of violating the Gaza truce deal.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The occupation (Israel) has committed a horrific massacre in the northern Gaza Strip by targeting a group of journalists and humanitarian workers, in a blatant violation of the ceasefire agreement," Hamas spokesman Hazem Qassem said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The director of Hamas-affiliated media in Gaza, Ismail Thawabteh, said that local photo journalists were killed while "using a drone to capture images of a Ramadan dining table in Beit Lahia."
  <br>
  <br>
  He said they were "directly targeted by the occupation in two air strikes, despite their work being clear."
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel has carried out near-daily air strikes in Gaza since early March, often targeting what the military said were militants planting explosive devices.
  <br>
  <br>
  The truce in Israel's war with Hamas, in effect since January 19, has largely held despite the attacks and with no agreement yet on extending the ceasefire.
  <br>
  <br>
  The first phase of the truce ended on March 1, but both Israel and Hamas have refrained from returning to all-out war. (AFP)

<img alt="Volodymyr Zelensky says he wants European boots on the ground in Ukraine. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795883_1_20250315215053.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Saturday he had urged Kyiv's Western allies to give "a clear position" on security guarantees, including about a potential foreign troop contingent on Ukrainian soil with a US backstop.
 <br>
  <br>
  His comments came after British Prime Minister Keir Starmer held a virtual call with other European leaders and allies, including Zelensky, where Starmer said a "coalition of the willing" would help secure Ukraine "on the land, at sea and in the sky" in the event of a peace deal with Russia.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We need to continue working on the contingents that will form the foundation of Europe's future Armed Forces," Zelensky said in a post on X with an image of himself taking part in the call.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Peace will be more reliable with European contingents on the ground and the American side as a backstop."
  <br>
  <br>
  Starmer has also called for a US security backstop to help secure a lasting peace between Russia and Ukraine in the three-year-old war.
  <br>
  <br>
  Russian leader Vladimir Putin said on Thursday that he supported in principle US President Donald Trump's proposal for a 30-day ceasefire with Ukraine, but that Russia would fight on until several crucial conditions were worked out.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zelensky urged European leaders to dismiss Putin's opposition to European peacekeepers in Ukraine and blamed the Russian leader for stalling peace efforts.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A ceasefire could have already happened, but Russia is doing everything to prevent it," he said. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Russian captain of a cargo ship which struck a tanker in the North Sea off the UK's northeastern coast appeared in court on Saturday charged with gross negligence manslaughter.
 <br>
  <br>
  Vladimir Motin, 59, appeared before magistrates in the port of Hull, where he was remanded in custody. He did not enter a plea, and will next appear in the Old Bailey in London on April 14.
  <br>
  <br>
  Motin, from Primorsky, St Petersburg, was arrested on Monday after his ship, the Portuguese-flagged Solong, rammed into the fuel-laden tanker Stena Immaculate, setting both vessels ablaze.
  <br>
  <br>
  Humberside Police said earlier that "extensive searches" by HM Coastguard to locate a missing crew member from the Solong had failed to locate him.
  <br>
  <br>
  The crew member was identified by state prosecutors as Mark Angelo Pernia, a 38-year-old Filipino, who is now presumed dead, police said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US-flagged tanker, which had been chartered by the US military, was anchored off the coast of Hull in northeastern England at the time of the crash.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police were granted two extensions on Wednesday and Thursday to allow more time to question the captain, given "the complexities of the incident," the Humberside police force said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  An investigation led by the UK, with US and Portuguese teams, has been launched to determine the exact cause of the collision, and why the Solong did not deviate from its course before it ploughed into the tanker.
  <br>
  <br>
  The UK government has ruled out foul play so far. (AFP)

    Ohtani hits home run in Dodgers' Tokyo exhibition game

<img alt="Superstar Shohei Ohtani sends the crowd wild with a two-run homer in the third inning. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795879_1_20250315205024.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Shohei Ohtani fever in Tokyo reached boiling point on Saturday as the Japanese baseball superstar hit a home run in his first game in a Los Angeles Dodgers uniform in his home country.
 <br>
  <br>
  Ohtani is in the Japanese capital with the World Series champion Dodgers to open the Major League Baseball season with two games against the Chicago Cubs next week.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 30-year-old was in action as the Dodgers beat Japan's Yomiuri Giants 5-1 in a warm-up game at the Tokyo Dome, which was packed to its 45,000-capacity rafters.
  <br>
  <br>
  He gave the crowd what they were looking for, smacking a huge home run in the third inning.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was great to see so many fans at an exhibition game," Ohtani told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It really made me feel like I was back in Japan for the first time in a while."
  <br>
  <br>
  It was Ohtani's first game in Japan since he helped his country win the World Baseball Classic two years ago in Tokyo.
  <br>
  <br>
  But it was his first-ever appearance in an MLB uniform in his home country, having left Japan for the Los Angeles Angels in 2018 before joining the Dodgers in late 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yurie Sakamune, who was at the game with her husband Junji, said the couple had entered 10 times into a lottery to buy tickets and had paid 50,000 yen (US$335) in total after snagging a pair.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's like a dream," said the 30-year-old, dressed in a Dodgers uniform with Ohtani's name and number 17 on the back.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I've been working every day to see Ohtani and I've put up with all the tough times for this. It's become like a life goal to see him."
  <br>
  <br>
  A huge cheer went up as Ohtani stepped up to the plate to open the game, drawing a walk from Giants starting pitcher Shosei Togo.
  <br>
  <br>
  He crushed the next pitch he faced, slamming a two-run home run into the stands.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Shohei, to be quite honest, in the last seven years has represented almost single-handedly the people of Japan," Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said before the game.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So for him to come back here in person, it's going to be an emotional night for a lot of people."
  <br>
  <br>
  Excitement has been building for Ohtani's visit, with around 500 fans waiting for the Dodgers to arrive at Tokyo's Haneda airport on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thousands more paid 2,000 yen (US$13) each to watch the team practice the following day, with Ohtani emerging for a brief workout lasting about 10 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The slugger, who has been described as a modern-day Babe Ruth, gave fans more for their money against the Giants.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's really cool," said American Dodgers fan Michael Artukovic, who travelled from his home in San Francisco just to watch the game.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A lot is going on in our country where we're becoming insular.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's great to see this where people from all over the world are coming to a baseball game in another country."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dodgers play another warm-up game against Japan's Hanshin Tigers on Sunday, before starting their two-game series against the Cubs on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The vast majority of fans at the Tokyo Dome were wearing Dodgers uniforms, although there was also a smattering of support for the Giants, Japan's most successful team.
  <br>
  <br>
  Atsuko Onuma said she was rooting for the Giants but said she had also come to see Ohtani.
  <br>
  <br>
  She confessed she would have "mixed feelings" if he were to hit a home run.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I want to see it but I also want to suppress that feeling," she said. (AFP)

    Putin will have to 'come to table,' UK PM tells summit

<img alt='Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron have been leading efforts to assemble a so-called "coalition of the willing."  Photo: AFP' src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795873_1_20250315201758.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 UK premier Keir Starmer said on Saturday that Russian President Vladimir Putin would "sooner or later" have to "come to the table" as he opened a virtual summit to drum up support for a coalition willing to protect any eventual ceasefire in Ukraine.
 <br>
  <br>
  The British prime minister told some 25 fellow leaders as they joined a virtual call hosted by Downing Street that they should focus on how to strengthen Ukraine, protect any ceasefire and keep up the pressure on Moscow.
  <br>
  <br>
  While Ukraine had shown it was the "party of peace" by agreeing to a 30-day unconditional ceasefire, "Putin is the one trying to delay," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If Putin is serious about peace, I think it's very simple, he has to stop his barbaric attacks on Ukraine and agree to a ceasefire, and the world is watching," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Overnight fighting continued in the relentless three-year war, with Russia saying it had taken two more villages in its Kursk border region where it has launched an offensive to wrest back seized territory.
  <br>
  <br>
  As moves have gathered pace for a ceasefire, Moscow has pushed this week to retake a large part of the land that Ukraine originally captured in western Kursk.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Russian defence ministry said troops took control over the villages of Zaoleshenka and Rubanshchina – north and west of the town of Sudzha, the main town that Moscow reclaimed this week.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kyiv, meanwhile, said its air force had overnight downed 130 Iranian-made Russian-launched Shahed drones over 14 regions of the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  Putin has called on embattled Ukrainian troops in Kursk to "surrender," while his US counterpart Donald Trump urged the Kremlin to spare their lives.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We can't allow President Putin to play games with President Trump's deal," Starmer said in comments released by Downing Street late on Friday, ahead of Saturday's call.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Kremlin's complete disregard for President Trump's ceasefire proposal only serves to demonstrate that Putin is not serious about peace."
  <br>
  <br>
  Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron have been leading efforts to assemble a so-called "coalition of the willing" ever since Trump opened direct negotiations with Moscow last month.
  <br>
  <br>
  They say the group is necessary – along with US support – to provide Ukraine with security guarantees by deterring Putin from violating any ceasefire.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky, who was on Saturday's call, said on Friday he had discussed "technical aspects" of how the ceasefire could be implemented with Macron.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our teams continue to work on clear security guarantees, and they will be ready soon," Zelensky said on the social media platform X.
  <br>
  <br>
  Starmer and Macron have said they are willing to put British and French troops on the ground in Ukraine, but it is not clear if other countries are keen on doing the same.
  <br>
  <br>
  Macron called on Russia late on Friday to accept the proposal for a ceasefire and stop making statements aimed at "delaying the process."
  <br>
  <br>
  The French president also demanded that Moscow stop its "acts of violence" in Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  Germany on Friday likewise criticised Putin's response to the US-proposed ceasefire in Ukraine as "at best a delaying tactic."
  <br>
  <br>
  US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Friday he was "cautiously optimistic" about reaching a truce, but acknowledged there was "a lot of work that remains to be done."
  <br>
  <br>
  Starmer has said he welcomes any offer of support for the coalition, raising the prospect that some countries could contribute logistics or surveillance.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The call is expected to delve further into how countries plan to contribute to the coalition of the willing, ahead of a military planning session being held next week," the UK government said.
  <br>
  <br>
  It added that Starmer will say that countries "need to ratchet up economic pressure on Russia, to force Putin into negotiations, in the short term."
  <br>
  <br>
  "And be prepared to support a just and enduring peace in Ukraine over the long term and continue to ramp up our military support to Ukraine to defend themselves against increasing Russian attacks."
  <br>
  <br>
  British Commonwealth partners Canada, Australia and New Zealand have been involved in early talks and are due to dial in to the summit.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nato chief Mark Rutte and European Union chiefs Ursula von der Leyen and Antonio Costa are also expected to take part, along with the leaders of Germany, Spain, Portugal, Latvia, Romania, Turkey and the Czech Republic, among others. (AFP)

 Nobody was reported injured after three workers became trapped on a gondola platform in Tin Shui Wai on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The incident happened at the Tin Shui Estate as Hong Kong saw its first amber rainstorm of the year at around 3 pm.
  <br>
  <br>
  A video circulating online showed the platform swaying from side to side amid high wind gusts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Firefighters rescued the workers shortly after.

    HK$2 tweaks can save govt nearly HK$700 million a year

<img alt="Chris Sun says changes to the HK$2 scheme will make the beneficiaries choose cheaper transportation. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795864_1_20250315174901.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Labour and welfare minister Chris Sun on Saturday said changes to the HK$2 fare scheme could save the government about HK$680 million a year.
 <br>
  <br>
  As Financial Secretary Paul Chan announced in the budget last month, instead of a flat HK$2 fare, citizens aged 60 or above will have to pay 20 percent of any standard fare costing more than HK$10.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters after an event, Sun said the HK$680 million saving is “not a small amount,” and it accounts for more than 10 percent of the expenditure on the scheme.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sun also said the amended scheme would encourage the elderly to take short-haul buses instead of long-haul ones for short journeys, which will save the government even more money.
  <br>
  <br>
  “This nearly HK$700 million saving is based on the assumption that the travel habits and patterns of the beneficiaries remain unchanged. However, implementing the changes means they will choose cheaper transportation,” Sun said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the amended scheme would not lose its original purpose, while its financial sustainability would be enhanced.

<img alt="Lando Norris says he knows Sunday's race conditions will be completely different to those during Saturday's qualifying. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795861_1_20250315171554.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lando Norris clinched pole position on Saturday for the season-opening Australian Grand Prix ahead of teammate Oscar Piastri as McLaren fired a warning shot to their rivals.
 <br>
  <br>
  In scorching hot conditions at Melbourne's Albert Park, world champion Max Verstappen came third in tense qualifying.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mercedes' George Russell will keep Red Bull's four-time world champion company on the second row. Lewis Hamilton will start in eighth on his Ferrari debut.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's the perfect way to start the year. A big congrats to the team, everyone has done an amazing job to start with a one-two," said Norris.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But it is just quali, right? Let's see tomorrow," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The car is extremely quick. When you put it together it is unbelievable, but it is hard to put it together.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm never going to get ahead of myself, I'm confident the car is in a good place but we have never run it in the wet."
  <br>
  <br>
  The forecast for Sunday's race is for cooler temperatures and rain.
  <br>
  <br>
  Norris eclipsed his rivals with a flying lap of one minute 15.096 seconds on soft tyres, 0.084sec ahead of Piastri.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Pretty happy, great to start the year on the front row," said Piastri.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Pretty happy with how qualifying went, but just not quite enough in Q3, but it is a long season so a good start," added the Australian.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Maybe left a little bit on the table."
  <br>
  <br>
  No Australian driver has won their home race since Alan Jones in 1980, but that was a non-championship race before Australia was added to the F1 calendar in 1985.
  <br>
  <br>
  Verstappen, who was the pole-sitter in 2023 and 2024, was three-tenths behind Norris.
  <br>
  <br>
  Verstappen is chasing a second win in Australia after his 2023 victory to kickstart his bid for a fifth consecutive world title, a feat only Michael Schumacher has achieved.
  <br>
  <br>
  RB's Yuki Tsunoda will start a surprise fifth alongside the Williams of Alex Albon.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ferrari pair Charles Leclerc and Hamilton were a disappointing seventh and eighth with Alpine's Pierre Gasly and Carlos Sainz in the other Williams filling out the top 10. (AFP)

 The Consumer Council has so far received 12 complaints involving around HK$5,000 in relation to the shutdown of the online food delivery platform, Deliveroo, in Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  It announced earlier that it will run until April 7, and part of its assets will be sold to rival Foodpanda.
  <br>
  <br>
  Consumer Council chief executive Gilly Wong pointed out that the biggest complaint involved about HK$600.

  Wong said Deliveroo has to make it clear whether its subscribers are still entitled to a complimentary half-year membership at its rival, Foodpanda, if they have already subscribed to that platform.
  <br>
  <br>
  She also called on Deliveroo to inform its customers about the handling of their data.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If customers have a membership on both platforms, or they do not want to switch to another platform to enjoy their services, can they ask for a refund for the subscription that they've purchased?" Wong called on the platform to spell out the arrangement.
  <br>
  <br>
  She noted that members will have their subscriptions renewed automatically when the complimentary subscription ends, but said the platform should allow members to decide for themselves instead.
  <br>
  <br>
  She added that the watchdog is maintaining close contact with Foodpanda, which is taking over part of Deliveroo's business, and the council will offer more details later.

 Executive Councillor Lam Ching-choi sounded the alarm on youth mental health in Hong Kong on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at an event, Lam, who chairs the Advisory Committee on Mental Health, said previous studies by the committee had found that one-fourth of primary students and one-sixth of secondary and university students faced mental health challenges.
  <br>
  <br>
  He underscored that the issue must be addressed early in life.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The reason to allocate a lot of resources to youth work is simple, and it is evidence-based, that 90 percent of mental illnesses are developed before 21 years old,” Lam said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “If we do a good job in addressing the needs of young people, the psychological burden for adults can be relieved,” he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lam said it is important for the medical sector, teachers and social workers, to coordinate and provide mental support to students in school, as there were a lot of unsuccessful referrals to other institutions in the past.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also said people from all walks of life can take part in mental health training to help themselves and others, as people may face mental health issues in their lives.

    'Rugby Sevens tourists opting for HK Island hotels'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Rugby Sevens, one of the city's most popular and highly anticipated events, will be hosted at a brand new location this year, but the retail and tourism sectors are still expecting a boost in spending.
 <br>
  <br>
  The three-day event kicks off on March 28 and will be staged at the newly opened Kai Tak Sports Park - after three decades of being held at the Hong Kong Stadium in Causeway Bay.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tourism sector lawmaker Perry Yiu told a Commercial Radio programme on Saturday that many tourists coming for the tournament have opted for hotels on Hong Kong Island despite the change in venue.
  <br>
  <br>
  He pointed out that it will take time for visitors to adjust to the new location.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Because they used to live in areas like Causeway Bay and they are used to the area, so they would continue to stay there," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They also know that transportation is convenient on Hong Kong island side, so maybe during the first year, they will adopt a wait-and-see approach."
  <br>
  <br>
  Yiu was also pleased to see that around 80 percent of the three-day tickets have been sold.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fellow lawmaker Peter Shiu from the retail sector believes Lan Kwai Fong in Central will remain a hotspot for revellers, on top of the new attractions in Kai Tak.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Timothy Chui, executive director of the Hong Kong Tourism Association, said the so-called "Hong Kong Super March", which features a series of world-class events such as LIV Golf, and the Coldplay concert next month, will attract long-haul visitors to the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the sector still lacks manpower, particularly coach drivers, he added.

    Sabalenka books Indian Wells title clash with Andreeva

<img alt="Belarus's Aryna Sabalenka shakes hands with USA's Madison Keys after winning their semi-final match at the Indian Wells Tennis. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795836_1_20250315123114.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Aryna Sabalenka avenged her Australian Open loss to Madison Keys on Friday, thrashing the American 6-0, 6-1 to book an Indian Wells title showdown with teen sensation Mirra Andreeva.
 <br>
  <br>
  Red-hot Russian 17-year-old Andreeva showed plenty of poise in a 7-6 (7/1), 1-6, 6-3 victory over defending champion Iga Swiatek, ending the second-ranked Pole's bid to become the first woman to win three titles in the California desert.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I was hungry," said Sabalenka, who had made no bones about wanting revenge after Keys denied her bid for a third straight Australian Open title in January.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That Australian Open match was really heartbroken for me, and I really needed some time to recover after that.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And if I would lose today again, it would get in my head and I didn't want that to happen. I was really focused, I was just really hungry to get this win against Madison."
  <br>
  <br>
  Keys, who was riding a 16-match winning streak, couldn't get a foot in the door.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think tactically I played really great tennis," said Sabalenka, adding her strategy was to "just keep her out of the rhythm".
  <br>
  <br>
  The mis-firing Keys finally held serve for 5-1 in the second, but minutes later Sabalenka sealed the win and lined up a shot at the WTA tour's newest sensation Andreeva in what 26-year-old Sabalenka quipped would be "kind of like an old mama playing against a kid".
  <br>
  <br>
  Andreeva beat Swiatek for the second time in as many tournaments, having stunned the Polish star in the quarter-finals at Dubai last month on the way to becoming the youngest ever WTA 1000 champion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Swiatek, who hadn't dropped a set in winning 10 straight Indian Wells matches, looked supremely confident as she dropped just one point in her first three service games.
  <br>
  <br>
  But it was Andreeva who claimed the first break of the tense first set for a 5-4 lead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Andreeva stepped up her attack and broke Swiatek to open the third, and she sealed the win with her third break of the set. (AFP)

    Cuba suffers fourth nationwide blackout in five months

<img alt="People gather in a neighbourhood during a national electrical grid collapse in Havana, Cuba. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795833_1_20250315115602.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Cuba suffered a general blackout on Friday caused by a crash of its national electricity grid, officials said, the fourth major power outage on the cash-strapped communist island in five months.
 <br>
  <br>
  "At around 8:15 pm tonight, a breakdown... caused the significant loss of power in western Cuba and with it the fall of the national electricity system," the Ministry of Energy and Mines said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Writing on the social network X, Prime Minister Manuel Marrero Cruz said the government was "working tirelessly" to restore power.
  <br>
  <br>
  In by now familiar scenes, the streets of Havana were plunged into darkness.
  <br>
  <br>
  Only a few hotels and private businesses with generators still had lights on, as did essential services such as hospitals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Angelica Caridad Martinez, a resident of the central city of Camaguey, said she was about to sit down for dinner when the power failed.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm not even hungry anymore," the 50-year-old said, "This situation is unsustainable, no one can live like this."
  <br>
  <br>
  The island of 9.7 million inhabitants has suffered three nationwide blackouts in the final months of 2024, two of them lasting several days.
  <br>
  <br>
  The repeated outages comes as the island battles its worst economic crisis in 30 years, marked by widespread shortages of food, medicine and fuel, high inflation and a massive outflow of migrants.
  <br>
  <br>
  Friday night marked the first general blackout of 2025, but citizens face almost daily outages of four or five hours across much of Havana, while in rural provinces the periods without power can last 20 hours or longer.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cuba's eight thermal power plants, nearly all of which came online in the 1980s or 1990s, suffer routine failures.
  <br>
  <br>
  And the Turkish floating power barges that help boost Cuba's national grid are fed with expensive imported fuel which is often in short supply.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cuba's leadership points to a six-decade-long US trade embargo that intensified during Donald Trump's first presidency for its difficulties in keeping the lights on.
  <br>
  <br>
  To make up its electricity shortfall, Cuba is racing to install a series of at least 55 solar farms with Chinese technology by the end of this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to authorities, these facilities will generate some 1,200 megawatts of power, about 12 percent of the national total. (AFP)

 Hong Kong’s sole delegate to the nation’s top legislature, Starry Lee, on Saturday called on the government to continue to coordinate with other major cities around the world to further strengthen the SAR's position across fields.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters after an RTHK programme, Lee said Hong Kong should make use of its unique system and further strengthen international cooperation, citing it as one of the key takeaways from this year’s “Two Sessions” meetings.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee suggested the government to invite various sectors to deliberate over how to boost international cooperation.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Apart from economic ties with different cities, we have to think about, for example, other areas politically, or make use of culture, sport, education, technology, all these other areas we can further develop various ties with different cities around the world,” Lee said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on the radio programme, Lee said Hong Kong should expand its network with the Global South and Asean countries, aside from just looking at traditional markets in Europe and North America.

    'New private sector law must be rolled out gradually'

File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795827_2_20250315105255.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An economist has said that the new law proposed by Beijing to protect and enhance the country's private sector could help address "grey areas" facing private business, but cautioned that it should be gradually rolled out to avoid stifling opportunities.
 <br>
  <br>
  Last week, the nation’s top legislators tabled the "private economy promotion law", which is designed to ensure private firms receive clear legal protection and create a fairer business environment.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bill was first introduced to the public via a consultation last October, subsequently reviewed twice by national lawmakers since last December, and was signalled by the country's top legislature - the National People's Congress - to be hammered out in parliament.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the bill was not passed at the annual session of the NPC, as lawmakers redrafted the bill to add more detailed measures - analysts expect more tweaks to come.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Ever since President Xi Jinping met some leading tech entrepreneurs last month, it has become a pretty clear signal that the government is very keen on promoting the private sector," Dan Wang, a director at the Eurasia Group's China team, told RTHK's Trending China programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang said the new bill is necessary, but cautioned that it should be rolled out gradually.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Previously, there were too many grey areas, including violations of intellectual property rights and people taking advantage of a symmetry information, so the government wants to address that. But precisely because regulations were added very fast, it stifled opportunities that could have existed for private entities."
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang, who's a seasoned economist, noted that while measures from the new law, such as prohibiting local governments to exclude private firms when launching government tenders, could give a boost for small and medium-sized private enterprises, authorities must come up with new ways to provide financial assistance for them.
  <br>
  <br>
  "How they can provide affordable and accessible financing is a problem. And how those private businesses can compete with their SOE competitors in the market, that's also a difficult issue," she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, another distinctive measure that was proposed by Premier Li Qiang in his report to the NPC, aimed to crackdown on the so-called, "996" work culture and "neijuan" practices.
  <br>
  <br>
  The "996" work culture refers to the practice by some firms to illegally make employees work from 9 am to 9 pm, six days a week. While "neijuan" refers to a self-defeating cycle of competition where firms feel forced to compete with each other excessively.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang noted the intention and necessity of the policy, but has questions on how it can be implemented practically.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Actually, China was in this vicious circle that everybody was racing, competing with each other to see who can come up with the longest working hours and who can be more competitive within the company. But it's quite damaging to the morale of the whole labour force," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For a young, fresh graduate, they don't really have negotiating power in the labour market. They probably prefer to hold on to a job rather than negotiating the work life balance."
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang added that fresh policies from Beijing during the "Two Sessions" showed a more "pro-labour" approach as part efforts to stablise the country's private sector and job market.

    Crew launch to ISS to replace stuck astronauts

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 After more than nine months on the International Space Station, two astronauts are a step closer to returning home following the launch of a crew swap mission on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  A Falcon 9 rocket with a Crew Dragon fixed to its top blasted off from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, carrying a four-member team bound for the orbital outpost.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We celebrate the countless individuals all over the world that have made this journey possible," said astronaut Nichole Ayers, the designated pilot of the Crew-10 mission, just before launch.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the real focus is what their arrival enables - the long-overdue departure from the ISS of NASA duo Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two former US Navy pilots have been stuck aboard the orbital lab since June after the Boeing Starliner spacecraft they were testing on its maiden crewed voyage suffered propulsion issues and was deemed unfit to fly them back to Earth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Instead, Starliner returned empty, without experiencing further major issues and what was meant to have been a days-long round-trip for Wilmore and Williams has now stretched past nine months.
  <br>
  <br>
  That is significantly longer than the standard ISS rotation for astronauts of roughly six months.
  <br>
  <br>
  But it is much shorter than the US space record of 371 days set by NASA astronaut Frank Rubio aboard the ISS in 2023, or the world record held by Russian cosmonaut Valeri Polyakov, who spent 437 continuous days aboard the Mir space station.
  <br>
  <br>
  What began as a technical failure has also spiraled into a political flashpoint, as President Donald Trump and his close advisor, Elon Musk, who leads SpaceX, have repeatedly suggested that former president Joe Biden "abandoned" the pair intentionally and rejected a plan to bring them back sooner.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump, meanwhile, has drawn attention for his bizarre remarks about the situation, referring to Williams, a decorated former naval captain, as "the woman with the wild hair" and speculating about the personal dynamic between the two.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They've been left up there. I hope they like each other, maybe they love each other, I don't know," he said during a recent White House press conference. (AFP)

 Wall Street stocks finished higher on Friday following bargain hunting that reduced the week's losses amid recession worries over President Trump's shifting tariff policy.
 <br>
  <br>
  Major indices opened higher and remained in positive territory through the day, shrugging off a downcast reading on US consumer sentiment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Analysts pointed to the diminished odds of a US government shutdown as supportive of stocks after Democratic Senate Leader Charles Schumer backed a spending bill favored by Republican President Donald Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  The broad-based S&P 500 finished at 5,638, up 2.1 percent for the day, but down 2.3 percent for the week.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1.7 percent to 41,488, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index jumped 2.6 percent to 17,754.
  <br>
  <br>
  A consumer survey by the University of Michigan said expectations for the future "deteriorated," with "many consumers": citing a "high level of uncertainty around policy and other economic factors."
  <br>
  <br>
  The report came as economists warn that Trump's wide-ranging and unpredictable trade policy risks delaying investments, raising the odds of a recession.
  <br>
  <br>
  Major indices dropped more than one percent on Thursday after Trump threatened a 200 percent tariff on European Union wine, champagne and other alcoholic beverages following the EU's announced countermeasures against new US steel and alumium tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Friday, all 11 sectors of the S&P 500 posted gains, while the Dow index was mostly up. (AFP)

    Putin tells Ukraine troops in Kursk to 'surrender'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 President Vladimir Putin on Friday called on beleaguered Ukrainian troops in the Russian region of Kursk to "surrender" as Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky accused the Russian leader of seeking to sabotage a ceasefire initiative.
 <br>
  <br>
  US President Donald Trump urged Putin to spare the lives of the Ukrainian troops as he said his envoy had held "productive" talks with Russia's leader on a proposed 30-day ceasefire.
  <br>
  <br>
  Russia has mounted a rapid counteroffensive in the western border region of Kursk over the past week, recapturing much of the territory Ukraine seized in a shock incursion last August.
  <br>
  <br>
  Defeat in Kursk would be a major blow to Ukraine's plans to use its hold on the region as a bargaining chip in peace talks for the three-year-old war.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are sympathetic to President Trump's call," Putin said in remarks broadcast on Russian television.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If they lay down their arms and surrender, they will be guaranteed life and dignified treatment," Putin said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said "thousands" of Ukrainian troops were "completely surrounded by the Russian military, and in a very bad and vulnerable position".
  <br>
  <br>
  "I have strongly requested to President Putin that their lives be spared. This would be a horrible massacre, one not seen since World War II," Trump said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ukraine's military leadership denied the claims. "There is no threat of our units being encircled," Ukraine's General Staff posted on social media.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zelensky gave a more sober assessment in comments to reporters in Kyiv. "The situation in the Kursk region is obviously very difficult," he said, while insisting the campaign still had value.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's latest comments came as he gave an update on a meeting on Thursday between his envoy Steve Witkoff and Putin on a US-Ukrainian proposal for a 30-day pause in hostilities.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We had very good and productive discussions with President Vladimir Putin of Russia yesterday, and there is a very good chance that this horrible, bloody war can finally come to an end," Trump said on his Truth Social platform.
  <br>
  <br>
  Putin said on Thursday that he had "serious questions" about the proposal and that events in Kursk would influence the next moves towards a ceasefire.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Kremlin said on Friday that it was "cautiously optimistic" a deal could be reached, but that Trump and Putin had to speak directly before talks could progress.
  <br>
  <br>
  Putin, addressing his Security Council, said he had read Trump's appeal.
  <br>
  <br>
  While accusing Ukrainian troops of carrying out crimes against civilians that he said amounted to "terrorism", something Kyiv denies, Putin said he understood the call by Trump to take humanitarian considerations into account. (Agencies)

    Mark Carney sworn in as Canada's PM

<div class="itemFullText">
 Mark Carney was formally sworn in as prime minister of Canada on Friday, putting him in a position to fight tariffs from US President Donald Trump that could devastate the trade-dependent Canadian economy.
 <br>
  <br>
  In the presence of Governor General Mary Simon, the personal representative of King Charles, who is Canada's head of state, Carney took the oath of office.
  <br>
  <br>
  The moment capped a momentous rise for the 59-year-old, who became the first Canadian prime minister without any serious political experience.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carney plans to travel to London and Paris next week, said a diplomat aware of the plans. Canada has sought to shore up alliances in Europe as its relations with the United States sink to unprecedented lows.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carney has reshaped his cabinet with a view to dealing with Washington. Finance Minister Dominic LeBlanc is moving to the international trade portfolio and will be replaced by current Innovation Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carney crushed his rivals on Sunday in a race to become leader of the ruling Liberal Party. He replaces Justin Trudeau, who spent more than nine years in office.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carney, a former head of both the Bank of Canada and the Bank of England, successfully argued his position as an outsider with a history of tackling crises meant he was the best person to take on Trump, who has repeatedly talked about annexing Canada.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Wednesday, Carney told reporters that he was ready to meet Trump when "there is respect for Canadian sovereignty."
  <br>
  <br>
  He also said he would keep in place retaliatory tariffs on US goods until the United States showed Canada some respect.
  <br>
  <br>
  Efforts are underway to arrange a call between Trump and Carney in the next couple of days, Canadian Foreign Minister Melanie Joly told reporters on Friday. (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Former Philippines president Rodrigo Duterte failed to show in person at the International Criminal Court on Friday at the opening of his crimes against humanity hearing over his deadly crackdown on narcotics.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 79-year-old, the first ex-Asian head of state to face charges at the ICC, was following by video link during a short hearing to inform him of the crimes he is alleged to have committed, as well as his rights as a defendant.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sounding frail and wearing a blue suit and tie, he spoke briefly to confirm his name and date of birth. The presiding judge allowed him to follow proceedings in absentia due to his long flight to The Hague.
  <br>
  <br>
  Duterte stands accused of the crime against humanity of murder over his years-long campaign against drug users and dealers that rights groups said killed thousands.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the prosecutor's application for his arrest, he said Duterte's alleged crimes were "part of a widespread and systematic attack directed against the civilian population in the Philippines."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Potentially tens of thousands of killings were perpetrated," the prosecutor alleged of the campaign that targeted mostly poor men, often without proof they were linked to drugs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Victims' families have welcomed the trial as a chance to get justice, while Duterte supporters believe he was "kidnapped" and sent to The Hague amid a spectacular fallout with the ruling Marcos family. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) on Friday called on members of the public to exercise caution when travelling to the Middle East.
 <br>
  <br>
  The reminder came as the World Health Organisation reported four new cases of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in Saudi Arabia, involving chronically-ill men aged between 27 and 78.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two of the patients have passed away.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, the CHP said one of the infected patients has had indirect contact with dromedary camels and their raw milk.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The CHP also recommends travel agents organising tours to the Middle East to refrain from arranging for visitors to ride dromedary camels or to participate in any activities involving direct contact with dromedary camels, which are known risk factors for acquiring MERS-CoV," the statement read.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials also reminded people to maintain good personal hygiene.

    Rashford recalled in Tuchel's first England squad

<img alt="Marcus Rashford has looked more like his old self since his loan move to Aston Villa. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795783_1_20250314215113.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Thomas Tuchel said Marcus Rashford and Jordan Henderson are contenders for England's 2026 World Cup squad after earning recalls in his first squad on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal's Myles Lewis-Skelly and Newcastle defender Dan Burn were handed their maiden call-ups for Tuchel's first matches in charge in World Cup qualifiers against Albania and Latvia.
  <br>
  <br>
  England have turned to the former Chelsea, Bayern Munich and Paris Saint-Germain coach in a bid to win a first major tournament since 1966 after losing the last two European Championship finals under Gareth Southgate.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rashford last played for the Three Lions a year ago but has been revitalised since a January loan move to Aston Villa from Manchester United.
  <br>
  <br>
  Henderson, 34, made the last of his 81 appearances for England back in November 2023 as moves to Saudi Arabia and then Ajax saw the former Liverpool captain fall down the pecking order for Southgate and interim boss Lee Carsley.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Everyone who's with us on this journey in the first camp is a contender for the World Cup," Tuchel said at a press conference at Wembley.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Jordan, I think this is a pretty easy one," he added. "What he brings to every team is his leadership, his character, personality, energy.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He makes sure that everyone lives by the standards and with this characteristic he embodies everything we try to build as a team."
  <br>
  <br>
  Rashford had been an outcast at United under Ruben Amorim, but has looked more like his old self in helping Villa to reach the quarter-finals of both the Champions League and FA Cup with four assists in nine appearances.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tuchel said he wanted to "bond" with the 27-year-old and encourage Rashford not to fall back into bad habits with his work rate.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I felt that Marcus had a huge impact in Aston Villa since he changed," said Tuchel, who won the Champions League with Chelsea in 2021.
  <br>
  <br>
  "His hard work in counter pressing, his tracking back on his position was impressive and I had the strong feeling that we should nominate him, we should bring him in, to push him to stay on that level. To not fall back in old routines."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lewis-Skelly was expected to be included after excelling in his breakout season for the Gunners at 18.
  <br>
  <br>
  Burn is at the other end of his career, but is rewarded for his consistency with a first call up at 32.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tuchel is the third non-British coach of England after Fabio Capello and Sven-Goran Eriksson.
  <br>
  <br>
  The German's appointment stirred controversy among some England fans given their long-standing rivalry with Tuchel's homeland.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Prince William, now an English Football Association patron after 18 years as the organisation's president, believes Tuchel's pedigree makes him well suited for the job.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Without doubt he is one of the top five managers in the world. It would be amazing if he could win the World Cup next year. It's gearing up to that and it's definitely possible," William told The Sun on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tuchel said it was an "honour" to have met William during his first few months in charge and is keen to prove the decision to appoint him was the correct one by the Football Association.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Exciting and a bit surreal," he said of becoming the first German to lead England. "It's a big honour and I'm very proud of it. I'm very well aware of it, I will make sure that I earn my rights to be in this place." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A male visitor at Kwong Wah Hospital has been arrested for allegedly assaulting a nurse.
 <br>
  <br>
  The hospital revealed that the nurse's arm was injured in the incident that happened in a ward on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said other medical staff and security officers were alerted, and reported the case to the police.
  <br>
  <br>
  The nurse was sent to the Accident and Emergency Department for treatment, and has since been discharged.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The hospital is highly concerned about the incident, expressed sympathy and rendered necessary support to the nurse," a Hospital Authority statement read.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The hospital resolutely adopts a zero-tolerance attitude to any workplace violence and strongly condemns the violent act."

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 UK police on Friday again extended the detention of the captain of a cargo ship that struck a tanker in the North Sea, citing the "complexities" of the case.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Russian captain was arrested on Monday on suspicion of gross negligence manslaughter after his ship, the Solong, slammed into the tanker anchored off the coast of Hull in northeastern England, setting both ships ablaze and leaving one sailor presumed dead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police were granted two extensions on Wednesday and Thursday to allow more time to question the 59-year-old captain due to "the complexities of the incident," the local Humberside police force said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police cited the location of both vessels at sea as one of the complications facing the probe, with the ships on fire for several days after the incident, requiring a massive firefighting response.

  <br>
  While all crew onboard the jet fuel-laden tanker, the US-flagged Stena Immaculate, were safely rescued, one sailor from the Portuguese-flagged Solong remains missing and presumed dead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Although the government has ruled out foul play, investigators are still determining the causes of the crash, in which the Solong never deviated from its course and slammed into the Stena at 16 knots an hour.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pockets of fire were still being reported on the deck of the Solong on Thursday evening, according to the UK Coastguard.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Extensive lines of enquiry are continuing," police said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Salvage teams boarded the vessels on Thursday to carry out initial damage assessments. (AFP)

 Safe-haven gold surpassed US$3,000 for the first time on Friday, boosted by uncertainty over US President Donald Trump's tariffs, while stock markets gained on hopes US lawmakers will avert a government shutdown.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Markets hate uncertainty, and Trump's second tenure in the White House has served to provide huge instability over expectations for trade, jobs, inflation, and government spending," said Joshua Mahony, chief market analyst at Scope Markets.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, Asian equities managed to end the week on a positive note while European markets were also up in midday deals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stocks gained support from "hopes that the US government would avoid a shutdown of non-essential services," said Derren Nathan, head of equity research at Hargreaves Lansdown.
  <br>
  <br>
  With just hours until a deadline to push a Republican spending bill through, Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer dropped his threat to block it.
  <br>
  <br>
  The package would keep the lights on through September, but Democrats have come under pressure from their grassroots to defy the plan, which they say is full of harmful spending cuts. (AFP)

    Drop in pupil numbers 'structural and would worsen'

<img alt="Christine Choi says measures are needed to ensure the stable and sustainable development of the education sector. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795759_1_20250314180708.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Education minister Christine Choi said on Friday the government was left with little choice but to change rules on how local schools can continue to operate, as Hong Kong faces a dwindling pupil population.
 <br>
  <br>
  She described the drop in student numbers as a "structural" rather than a "transitional" issue, and that it would only exacerbate in the coming years.
  <br>
  <br>
  This week, the Education Bureau announced tighter restrictions on how schools can continue to receive government funding, which effectively increased the risk of them closing down if they don't enrol enough students.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under current policy, schools can operate a class on private money for a year, and resume receiving government funding once they can meet the minimum intake of 16 pupils.
  <br>
  <br>
  From September, such classes cannot revert to private funding again for six years.
  <br>
  <br>
  And schools that are allowed to go private must ensure their pupils complete their primary education using private funds.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the past few years, we have lowered the class formation requirement. But today, we think basically all possible methods, all adjustments have been exhausted," Choi told reporters after attending an event.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We must face this problem squarely. We need to implement measures for the education sector's stable and sustainable development in a timely manner."
  <br>
  <br>
  She noted that there had been fears more than 10 schools could face closure this year, but it turned out that only two were affected.
  <br>
  <br>
  The secretary for education also said early next month, officials will reach out to parents whose children are due to attend Price Memorial Catholic Primary School in Wong Tai Sin and Southern District's Aplichau Kaifong Primary School, two schools that won't receive government grants to operate primary one classes in the coming academic year.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said the two schools, which are left with the options of running the primary one class with private funds, merging with other schools or facing an eventual closure, have to decide the way forward themselves.
  <br>
  <br>
  Only pupils who applied for the spots under the discretionary scheme would be affected, Choi said, because no pupils had been sent there through central allocation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Choi said students going on mainland study tours are reminded not to consume cold dishes, after dozens of students and teachers on such tours from three schools were said to have contracted gastroenteritis.
  <br>
  <br>
  Health officials said they all went to eat at the same location in Shaoguan in Guangdong province, but the education chief stressed there's no evidence their illnesses had to do with food served during the tours.
  <br>
  <br>
  She added that to be on the safe side, operators of mainland study tours have stopped providing cold dishes.

<img alt="HKGCC chair Agnes Chan says that the AI-empowered tool will support small businesses to develop ESG audit without significant costs. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795746_2_20250314170438.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong businesses, specially small and medium-sized ones, are set to receive a boost to enhance their environmental, social and governance practices with the launch of a new AI tool to help them comply with rules.
 <br>
  <br>
  Green360 was launched by The Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce (HKGCC) on Friday, and it is an online learning platform aimed at helping small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to start and develop their environmental, social and governance (ESG) audit and reporting processes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a launch ceremony, Algernon Yau, Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development, said the platform represents a pivotal step in Hong Kong's push forward as part of its sustainability agenda.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The introduction of Green360 comes at a crucial time as we navigate the complexities of environmental challenges for sustainable practices that are urgently needed. This innovative platform not only aligns with the global movement towards a greener economy but also emphasizes Hong Kong's role as a leader in integrating advanced technology commercial development," Yau said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since January 25, all companies are required by the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing to disclose their direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions.
  <br>
  <br>
  The move also came as the government rolled out a road map in December to align its sustainability disclosure requirements with International Financial Reporting Standards – Sustainability Disclosure (ISSB) Standards by 2028.
  <br>
  <br>
  Echoing Yau, HKGCC chairwoman Agnes Chan noted that the tool, which is empowered by artificial intelligence technology, will help speed up the city's green transition.
  <br>
  <br>
  "AI is emerging as a crucial driver for integrating green and just transitions, digital platforms and data analytics pivotal in accelerating the de-carbonisation of both the economy and the capital markets," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Many companies are uncertain about where to begin or lack the resources to pursue such initiatives. So Green360 alleviates these concerns by helping them to identify areas for improvement and achieve accreditation without incurring significant costs," she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fillippo Addarri, senior advisor for the United Nations Development Programme and project lead for the European Union Social Impact Score, said at the same event that Hong Kong and the European members could cooperate over green finance following increased economic ties between Europe and China.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said that Chinese green investments in Europe, such as in the battery and electric vehicle fields, have seen a 50 percent increase year on year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And as a global financial hub, Hong Kong is poised to become a key partner of the European Union. Your advanced regulatory framework and culture of innovation sets your leadership in the driving seat," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Touching on the question of support from Beijing, Xin Bingxian, executive secretary of the World Development Foundation, said at the event that the move is in line with the direction signalled from the Two Sessions meetings this year that carbon reduction requirements are shifting from voluntary to mandatory.
  <br>
  <br>
  But she suggested the SAR government cooperate with mainland authorities to also align on ESG disclosure rules as there are notable differences in regulations.

    CK Hutchison shares down after port deal criticism

<img alt="CK Hutchison earlier agreed to sell its interests in a key Panama Canal port operator to a consortium led by BlackRock. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795749_1_20250314172048.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Shares of CK Hutchison shed more than 6 percent on Friday, after the Beijing office in charge of Hong Kong affairs reposted a newspaper commentary slamming the firm's sale of its Panama Canal ports.
 <br>
  <br>
  Last week, the conglomerate controlled by tycoon Li Ka-shing agreed to sell its interests in a key Panama Canal port operator to a consortium led by US asset management firm BlackRock.
  <br>
  <br>
  The deal worth US$22.8 billion followed intense pressure from US President Donald Trump, who vowed to take back control of the canal, using force if necessary.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office shared on its website an opinion piece published by Ta Kung Pao on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The commentary noted reports suggesting BlackRock chief executive Larry Fink had a "close relationship" with Trump, and described the deal as an act of American hegemony.
  <br>
  <br>
  For CK Hutchison, "Critics say this is an act of kneeling down... and one which disregards national interests, betrays and sells out Chinese people," the article read.
  <br>
  <br>
  The commentary also told the company to think twice and decide "which position and side it wants to be on".
  <br>
  <br>
  The article was also shared by Beijing's liaison office in Hong Kong on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Andrew Leung, an independent China strategist, told RTHK that while he understood why Beijing was upset with the deal, CK Hutchison had to act with its business interests in mind.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[CK Hutchison] still has a great deal of businesses tied to mainland China and to Hong Kong. So I don't think that this is anything other than, if you like, a self-centered business strategy," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Beijing is fully aware of [CK Hutchison's] importance to Hong Kong. But on the other hand, it has to balance its national interests and perceived threats from the Trump administration - a hostile Trump administration bent on scuttling China's rise - and also send a signal to other businesses tied to China to be more aware of these national strategic priorities."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hang Seng Index, meanwhile, snapped a five-day losing streak, climbing more than 2 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The index had surged past 24,000 before giving up some of the gains.
  <br>
  <br>
  It ended 497 points or 2.1 percent higher at 23,959.

    Lunar eclipse brings 'bloody' marvellous spectacle

<div class="itemFullText">
 Stargazers across a swathe of the world marvelled at a dramatic red "Blood Moon" during a rare total lunar eclipse in the early hours of Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The celestial spectacle was visible in the Americas and Pacific and Atlantic oceans, as well as in the westernmost parts of Europe and Africa.
  <br>
  <br>
  The phenomenon happens when the sun, earth and moon line up, causing our planet to cast a giant shadow across its satellite.
  <br>
  <br>
  But as the earth's shadow crept across the moon, it did not entirely blot out its white glow. Instead the moon glowed a reddish colour.
  <br>
  <br>
  This is because the only sunlight that reaches the moon is "bent and scattered" as it goes through earth's atmosphere, said Daniel Brown, an astronomer at Britain's Nottingham Trent University.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is similar to how the light can become pink or red during sunrises or sunsets on earth, he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The more clouds and dust there are in earth's atmosphere, the redder the moon appears.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brown called the lunar eclipse, which will last around six hours, "an amazing way to see the solar system in action."
  <br>
  <br>
  The period when the moon is completely in earth's shadow, called the totality, lasts just over an hour.
  <br>
  <br>
  This event has been dubbed the "Blood Worm Moon," after one of the names given to March full moons by some Native Americans.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is the first total lunar eclipse since 2022, but there will be another one in September.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thursday's event is a "Micromoon," meaning the moon is the farthest away it gets from earth, making it appear about seven percent smaller than normal, according to the website Earthsky.
  <br>
  <br>
  This is the opposite of a "Supermoon," as was seen during 2022's lunar eclipse.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some stargazers will be in for another treat later this month. That will be a partial solar eclipse. (AFP)

    Hospitals may start charging for CT and MRI scans

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Health Lo Chung-mau said on Friday the government is reviewing fees and charges for public hospital services, including charging for such services as CT scans and MRIs to prevent abuse.
 <br>
  <br>
  However, he said that emergency and hospitalised patients would be exempted.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The demand for some complicated imaging services such as CT scans and MRIs keeps increasing, and prolongs the waiting time. We will consider having a co-payment on such services,” Lo said after a health services panel meeting in the Legislative Council.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We have to stress that these items are completely free now, as they are fully funded by the government, and that has led to an excessive use of services,” he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lo said the adjustment of fees and charges is needed to reduce waste in such areas as medication so that resources can be utilised accurately and directed towards helping patients whose conditions are more serious or who need more urgent treatment.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the government will take affordability into account when changing the fees and charges.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lo said the adjustment in public hospital fees is an important step in primary healthcare development, and people are encouraged to consult their family doctors instead when their symptoms are mild.

 Tourist arrivals hit 8.4 million in the first two months of the year, a seven percent increase year on year, the Hong Kong Tourism Board said on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  More than three-quarters of them – or 6.5 million – were from the mainland, an uptick of four percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arrivals from other short-haul markets also rose, with those from the Philippines, Indonesia, Japan and South Korea each surging more than 30 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Visitor numbers from long-haul markets grew as well, up 20 percent to 500,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arrivals from Australia, for example, saw a 34 percent increase.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong celebrated the start of the Year of the Snake on January 29, hosting a series of events such as the Lunar New Year parade and a fireworks display.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The US Senate finds itself on Friday in a familiar position, working to avoid a partial government shutdown with just hours to spare as Democrats confront two painful options: allowing passage of a bill they believe gives President Donald Trump vast discretion on spending decisions or voting no and letting a funding lapse ensue.
 <br>
  <br>
  Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer gave members of his caucus days to vent their frustration about the options before them, but late on Thursday made clear he will not allow a shutdown. His move gives Democrats room to side with Republicans and allow the continuing resolution, often described as a CR, to come up for a vote as soon as Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  A procedural vote on Friday will provide a first test of whether the package has the 60 votes needed to advance, ahead of final voting likely later in the day. At least eight Democrats will need to join with Republicans to move the funding package forward.
  <br>
  <br>
  “While the CR still is very bad, the potential for a shutdown has consequences for America that are much, much worse,” Schumer said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Congress has been unable to pass the annual appropriations bills designed to fund the government, so they've resorted to passing short-term extensions instead. The legislation before the Senate marks the third such continuing resolution for the current fiscal year, now nearly half over.
  <br>
  <br>
  The legislation would fund the federal government through the end of September. It would trim non-defense spending by about US$13 billion from the previous year and increase defense spending by about US$6 billion, which are marginal changes when talking about a topline spending level of nearly US$1.7 trillion.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Republican-led House passed the spending bill on Tuesday and then adjourned. The move left senators with a decision to either take it or leave it. And while Democrats have been pushing for a vote on a fourth short-term extension, GOP leadership made clear that option was a non-starter. (AP)

<img alt="Carlos Alcaraz reacts after winning his quarter-final match against Argentina’s Francisco Cerundolo in Indian Wells. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795712_1_20250314142648.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Two-time defending champion Carlos Alcaraz fought off determined challenger Francisco Cerundolo 6-3, 7-6 (7/4) to reach the semi-finals of the Indian Wells ATP Masters.
 <br>
  <br>
  On another cold, blustery night in the California desert, Alcaraz battled back from 1-4 down in the second set, coming up with a break and two love service holds to force the tiebreaker as he stayed on track in his bid to join Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic as the only men to win three straight Indian Wells titles on track.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alcaraz had to save break points in each of his first three service games. But after an emphatic hold for 4-3 he gained the first break of the contest with a deft volley and just like that he was serving for the first set.
  <br>
  <br>
  After sliding to pop a drop volley winner over the net for set point Alcaraz drilled a deep forehand that Cerundolo could barely get a racquet on.
  <br>
  <br>
  But it was Cerundolo who broke first in the second, finally converting his ninth break point of the match then holding for 4-1.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he couldn't hold off the world number three, who raced to a 5-2 lead in the tiebreaker on the way to victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was really difficult for me to start the match," said Alcaraz, who looked less comfortable in the windy weather than he did just a day before.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He got a lot of chances in the first set," Alcaraz said. "I'm just pleased about saving all of them and taking the only one that I had.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I didn't hit the ball as clear as yesterday, but I just did what I had to and that's what it's about."
  <br>
  <br>
  Alcaraz next faces Britain's Jack Draper, who reached his first Masters 1000 semi-final with a 6-4, 7-5 victory over American Ben Shelton.
  <br>
  <br>
  Draper took the opening set with one break of serve then rallied from 0-3 down in a second-set slug-fest.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shelton's 32 unforced errors included five double-faults, including one to hand Draper a break for 6-5 in the second.
  <br>
  <br>
  Russian Daniil Medvedev, runner-up to Alcaraz each of the past two years, rallied from a break down in a wild, wind-blown final set to beat young gun Arthur Fils 6-4, 2-6, 7-6 (9/7).
  <br>
  <br>
  The world number six booked a semi-final meeting with Denmark's Holger Rune, a 5-7, 6-0, 6-3 winner over Tallon Griekspoor.
  <br>
  <br>
  Medvedev, who had won just one of his past nine third-set tiebreakers, gave a leap of sheer joy after securing the win in two hours and 25 minutes to keep alive his bid for a first title since 2023, when he won five.
  <br>
  <br>
  Medvedev faces another young gun in Rune, who burst onto the scene in 2022 with a win over Novak Djokovic in the Paris Masters final.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rune has struggled often since, but after dropping the first set he dominated Griekspoor, the 43rd-ranked Dutchman who had ousted top-seeded Alexander Zverev in the second round. (AFP)

    China hosts trilateral nuclear talks with Iran, Russia

<div class="itemFullText">
 China urged an end to "illegal" sanctions on Iran as it hosted diplomats from that country and Russia on Friday for talks Beijing hopes will restart long-stalled negotiations on Tehran's nuclear programme.
 <br>
  <br>
  Vice Foreign Minister Ma Zhaoxu, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov and Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Kazem Gharibabadi held their meeting in Beijing.
  <br>
  <br>
  A readout of the talks by CCTV said the three diplomats "exchanged views on the Iran nuclear issue and other issues of common concern".
  <br>
  <br>
  Ma expressed China's support for "political and diplomatic engagement and dialogue based on mutual respect" after the meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We emphasised the necessity of ending all illegal, unilateral sanctions," Ma told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The relevant parties should work to eliminate the root causes of the current situation and abandon sanctions, pressure, and threats of the use of force."
  <br>
  <br>
  In a joint statement, the three countries reaffirmed that political and diplomatic engagement and dialogue remains the only viable and practical option for the Iranian nuclear issue.
  <br>
  <br>
  The United States withdrew from the landmark 2015 Iran nuclear deal, which had imposed curbs on Tehran's nuclear development in return for sanctions relief, during US President Donald Trump's first term.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tehran adhered to the agreement for a year after Washington's withdrawal but then began rolling back its commitments. Efforts to revive the pact have since faltered.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump recently sent a letter to Tehran urging nuclear talks, warning of possible military action if it refuses.
  <br>
  <br>
  Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian responded that he would not negotiate with the US while being "threatened", and Iran would not bow to US "orders" to talk.
  <br>
  <br>
  Iran has long denied that it is working on developing a nuclear weapon. But the International Atomic Energy Agency warned last month that Tehran was "dramatically" accelerating enrichment of uranium to near the roughly 90 percent weapons-grade level. (AFP/Reuters)

    Parents express concern over possible school closures

<div class="itemFullText">
 Some parents at a primary school that won't get public funding to operate first-year classes in the next academic year said on Friday they're shocked by the development.
 <br>
  <br>
  Price Memorial Catholic Primary School in Wong Tai Sin is one of two schools left with the options of running the primary one class with private funds, merging with other schools or facing an eventual closure.
  <br>
  <br>
  The other one is Southern's Aplichau Kaifong Primary School.
  <br>
  <br>
  Outside the Wong Tai Sin school, a mother said that all three of her children attend the school or had done so, and she's among parents who're concerned it may ultimately be forced to close.
  <br>
  <br>
  "My children and pupils like the school a lot, they like the teachers here," she said. "When our children learned of the news, they were like, 'oh why? I don't want this,'"
  <br>
  <br>
  "But we hope the school can continue and persist."
  <br>
  <br>
  School principal Maureen Ho said it notified parents of the news on Thursday night once the government announced the funding decision.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said it's early days still as to what will happen, but the school will discuss a way forward in an attempt to come up with the best arrangement for the pupils.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When we got the news we found it regrettable and weren't too happy. But it's a decision made by the Education Bureau so we have to respect that," Ho said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We care a lot about our pupils, so our management will discuss different plans with our council and sponsoring body, as well as education officials, to help them."
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho noted that the lack of pupils is a territory-wide issue, adding that the school particularly had trouble attracting new pupils because it is hard to get to.
  <br>
  <br>
  In recent years, schools that faced the same problem could go private for a year and, once they were able to meet the minimum class intake of more than 16 pupils, resume receiving government funding.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the government changed the rule this week, requiring schools to operate a class with private funds for six years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Education officials also said if schools take in less than 16 pupils again within that period, they won't be allowed to go private again.
  <br>
  <br>
  They said the change was made because the number of pupils projected to enter primary schools in the coming years is expected to drop by just over 11,000 to around 37,500 in 2031.

 An American Airlines plane caught fire after landing at Denver International Airport, prompting slides to be deployed so passengers could evacuate quickly.
 <br>
  <br>
  Flight 1006, which was headed from Colorado Springs to Dallas, diverted to Denver and landed safely around 5.15pm on Thursday after the crew reported engine vibrations, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said.
  <br>
  <br>
  While taxiing to the gate, an engine on the Boeing 737-800 caught fire, the FAA added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Passengers stood on one of the plane’s wings as smoke surrounded the aircraft. The FAA said passengers exited using the slides.
  <br>
  <br>
  American said the flight experienced an engine-related issue after taxiing to the gate. There was no immediate clarification on exactly when the plane caught fire.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 172 passengers and six crew members were taken to the terminal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Twelve people were transported to hospitals with minor injuries.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We thank our crew members, DEN team and first responders for their quick and decisive action with the safety of everyone on board and on the ground as the priority,” American said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Firefighters put out the blaze by  evening, an airport spokesperson said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The FAA said it will investigate.
  <br>
  <br>
  The country has seen a recent spate of aviation disasters and close calls stoking fears about air travel, though flying remains a very safe mode of transport. (AP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 People around the globe marked World Sleep Day on Friday, an annual event that serves as a reminder of the importance of sleep to one's well-being and health.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a pre-recorded interview broadcast on
  <a href="https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/news-programmes/this-episode.htm?cmsid=77" target="_blank">
   <u>
    <b>
     RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme
    </b>
   </u>
  </a>
  , Julia Sun, a clinical psychologist at the Chinese University's Department of Psychiatry, said people should not underestimate the importance of a good night's sleep.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Sleep is really important and it is related to the physical and mental well-being. Physically, chronic sleep depravation will lead to reduced immune function and hormonal imbalance. And also we can see that when people sleep less, they tend to gain more weight. Sleep depravation is also linked to increased cardiovascular risk," Sun said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In terms of mental well-being, insomnia, or sleeping less, leads to increased irritability... it also leads to more mood swings and also difficulty in managing stress."
  <br>
  <br>
  Sun recommended that people get into a routine before bed, to ensure a good night's sleep.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think that regularity is important - try to have a regular sleep-wake schedule no matter in weekdays or weekends... try to limit the screen use before sleep, for example like 15 to 30 minutes before bedtime. And also you can dim your light before you go to sleep."

    Japanese duo pay for Great Wall buttocks 'prank'

<div class="itemFullText">
 Two Japanese tourists in their 20s were detained for two weeks in China then deported for taking photos showing exposed buttocks at the Great Wall, local media reported.
 <br>
  <br>
  The incident at the World Heritage site near Beijing concerned a man who showed his bottom and a woman who took photos, NTV and other Japanese media outlets reported on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tokyo's foreign ministry said on Friday that "the embassy of Japan in China confirmed on January 3 that two Japanese nationals were detained by local authorities at the Great Wall."
  <br>
  <br>
  They "were subsequently released and returned to Japan during January", it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Japanese embassy did not reply to requests for comment.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tourists were detained on the spot by security guards and held for around two weeks, the reports said, citing sources.
  <br>
  <br>
  Exposing the lower half of the body in a public place is against the law in China.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tourists reportedly told the embassy they did it as a prank.
  <br>
  <br>
  The reports sparked outrage in China, where memories of atrocities committed during Japan's occupation of the country in the 1930s and 40s still evoke strong feelings.
  <br>
  <br>
  A hashtag translating to "Japanese man and woman detained for indecent behaviour at the Great Wall" had been viewed more than 60 million times on Weibo by Friday morning.
  <br>
  <br>
  Many top-liked comments blasted the tourists for the act, with some using hateful language toward Japanese people.
  <br>
  <br>
  One comment by actor Chen Yitian, who has over seven million followers on the platform, condemned them for doing "shameful things on my Great Wall."
  <br>
  <br>
  Others suggested China ban all Japanese visitors. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 DAB lawmaker Nixie Lam on Friday welcomed the government's initiative on lifting the storage period limitation for frozen eggs, sperm or embryos.
 <br>
  <br>
  The government on Thursday announced it would launch a public consultation on issue.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on

   <u>
    <b>
     RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme
    </b>
   </u>
  </a>
  , Lam said many people were starting families later in life which is why an adjustment to current regulations was needed.
  <br>
  <br>
  "More and more couples are getting married late and planning their families late... and if you look at some of the restrictions to current [regulations] we're having such as this 10-year period, it's pretty much outdated. We do need a full-on upgrade of a lot of the rules and regulations around this to ensure that it fits with current trends."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lam said easing restrictions on non-married couples or single people, allowing them to use their frozen embryos to start a family, would also help.
  <br>
  <br>
  "At the moment it might be a little bit tricky, but we do need to do more persuasive discussions in Hong Kong," Lam said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Medical sector lawmaker David Lam, speaking on an RTHK programme, said the proposed measure was helpful, but people also needed to understand that, if possible, it is better to start a family sooner rather than later.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We need to let people know that this option is not for everyone, it is a choice for those with a unique problem. It should not become an option for people to delay childbearing. We should have children as early as possible.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Lam added that pregnancy difficulties and health risks would increase as women get older which was another reason not to delay starting a family.

<img alt="Bruno Fernandes was decisive for Manchester United with his hat-trick. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795685_1_20250314104926.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Bruno Fernandes netted a hat-trick as Manchester United beat Real Sociedad 4-1 in their Europa League last-16 second leg on Thursday, while Tottenham bounced back to edge AZ Alkmaar 3-2 on aggregate.
 <br>
  <br>
  Rangers knocked out Jose Mourinho's Fenerbahce 3-2 on penalties as Chelsea saw out a 1-0 home win against Copenhagen to ensure their place in the last eight of the Europa Conference League.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two spot-kicks and a late arrowed finish from Fernandes sent Man Utd into the quarter-finals by a 5-2 aggregate margin against 10-man Sociedad.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We need to help him win titles, because he deserves it," Man Utd manager Ruben Amorim said of his captain.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was a good performance. The physicality was there... Even without the sending-off, you felt that the team were going to win this game."
  <br>
  <br>
  A 10th-minute penalty gave the visitors the lead at Old Trafford before Fernandes converted from 12 yards in the 16th and 50th minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jon Aramburu saw red shortly after the hour and Man Utd took full advantage with Fernandes rifling in a third three minutes from time and Diogo Dalot rubber-stamping an emphatic victory in injury-time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Amorim's side will meet Lyon in the next round.
  <br>
  <br>
  Goals in either half from Wilson Odobert and James Maddison in London earned Spurs a 3-1 win against AZ Alkmaar.
  <br>
  <br>
  Odobert powered home following sloppy AZ defending to get Spurs level on aggregate in the 26th minute, after the first leg finished 1-0 to the Dutch side.
  <br>
  <br>
  Maddison put the hosts 2-0 up three minutes into the second period with an arrowed finish before Peer Koopmeiners responded after the hour to level the tie again.
  <br>
  <br>
  Odobert grabbed his second and Spurs' third on the night in the 74th minute to set up a quarter-final meeting with Eintracht Frankfurt.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We played pretty well, I thought we were really in control of the game, but we were our own worst enemies at times," Spurs boss Ange Postecoglou.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It got a bit nervy towards the end but we thoroughly deserved to progress."
  <br>
  <br>
  After losing the first leg in Istanbul 3-1, Fenerbahce fought back at Rangers to win 2-0.
  <br>
  <br>
  Polish winger Sebastian Szymanski produced two cute finishes in the 45th and 73rd minutes to force extra-time with the aggregate score locked at three-apiece.
  <br>
  <br>
  But three missed spot-kicks by the Turkish side handed Rangers a 3-2 win in the shoot-out and a last-eight clash with Athletic Bilbao.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall got the winner 10 minutes into the second half at Stamford Bridge to send Chelsea through the Conference League quarter-finals at the expense of Copenhagen, 3-1 over both legs. (AFP)

    Swiatek cruises past Zheng to reach Indian Wells semis

<img alt="Iga Swiatek beat Zheng Qinwen in straight sets to reach the final four at Indian Wells. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795674_1_20250314093042.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Defending champion Iga Swiatek beat Zheng Qinwen of China 6-3, 6-3, avenging her Olympics semi-final loss to the Paris Games gold medallist, to reach the last four at Indian Wells.
 <br>
  <br>
  The world number two from Poland will get a chance to avenge another upset loss in the semi-finals, where she'll take on Mirra Andreeva, the 17-year-old Russian who stunned her in the quarter-finals at Dubai last month on the way to becoming the youngest-ever WTA 1000 champion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Swiatek delivered another dominant performance as she continued her bid to become the first woman to win three titles in the California desert.
  <br>
  <br>
  Swiatek, who won her first Indian Wells title in 2022, could also join Martina Navratilova as the only women to lift the trophy in back-to-back years.
  <br>
  <br>
  After dropping just two games in each of her first three matches, Swiatek was broken twice as she faced her toughest test so far, but secured the victory with a flourish as she broke Zheng at love in the final game after a brief shower paused play late in the second set.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was a weird match with all the breaks and everything, but I wanted to be composed and really focused and I'm glad that I did that," Swiatek said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Swiatek converted all five of her break chances. Zheng twice surrendering her serve in games she led 40-0.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zheng did manage late breaks in each set, but neither those hiccups nor the brief shower that paused play in the second set proved much impediment to Swiatek.
  <br>
  <br>
  "At the end it got really windy, which made it super tricky," Swiatek said. ""When the conditions change during the match you need to adjust quickly and it's not that easy. I'm happy that I was pushing until the end."
  <br>
  <br>
  Swiatek admitted she was pleased to avenge her Olympic defeat, a heartbreaking loss on the Philippe Chatrier court where the Polish star has won four French Open titles.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's not nice to lose to anybody, so for sure you want to have a little, like revenge, but it's nothing personal," Swiatek said.
  <br>
  <br>
  She can settle another score against Andreeva, who kept her bid for another prestigious title on track with a 7-5, 6-3 victory over Ukrainian veteran Elina Svitolina. (AFP)

    US influencer visa under review after wombat outcry

<div class="itemFullText">
 Australia is reviewing an American influencer’s visa after she posted video of her snatching a baby wombat from its mother.
 <br>
  <br>
  Sam Jones, who describes herself as an “outdoor enthusiast & hunter,” made her Instagram account private on Thursday after she was widely condemned for the video.
  <br>
  <br>
  It shows her lifting the wombat joey by its front legs in darkness from a roadside and running away from its mother.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I caught a baby wombat,” she says, as a man filming her laughs. She returns the wombat to the roadside after several seconds.
  <br>
  <br>
  Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke said her visa was under review.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The department is now working through the conditions on her current visa and determining whether immigration law has been breached,” Burke said in a statement on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I can’t wait for Australia to see the back of this individual, I don’t expect she will return,” he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prime Minister Anthony Albanese added his voice to the criticism. “To take a baby wombat from its mother, and clearly causing distress from the mother, is just an outrage,” Albanese told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I suggest to this so-called influencer, maybe she might try some other Australian animals. Take a baby crocodile from its mother and see how you go there. Take another animal that can actually fight back rather than stealing a baby wombat from its mother,” Albanese added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jones, who also uses the name Samantha Strable, closed her social media channels to messages and couldn’t be reached for comment on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The wombat appears to be a common wombat, also known as a bare-nosed wombat. It is a protected marsupial found only in Australia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yolandi Vermaak, founder of the animal care charity Wombat Rescue, said separating the young wombat from its mother created a risk that the mother would reject her offspring.
  <br>
  <br>
  “My biggest concern is that we didn’t actually see mom and baby getting reunited. When she put it down, it looked disoriented. It was turned away from where the mother was last seen. So we don’t know if mom and baby actually found each other again,” Vermaak told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. (AP)

<img alt="President Trump signed an executive order in January demanding a freeze on all US foreign aid to allow time to assess overseas expenses. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795666_1_20250314084123.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The prestigious Johns Hopkins University said on Thursday it was being forced to lay off more than 2,000 employees in the aftermath of the Trump administration's massive reduction in foreign aid funding.
 <br>
  <br>
  "This is a difficult day for our entire community. The termination of more than US$800 million in USAID funding is now forcing us to wind down critical work here in Baltimore and internationally," the school, a leading institution of scientific research, said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hopkins, in Maryland's largest city an hour's drive north of the US capital, is eliminating more than 2,000 positions - 1,975 in projects across 44 countries and 247 jobs in the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  The cuts impact several key programs, including the university's medical school and school of public health, and Jhpiego, a global health non-profit organisation founded at the university more than 50 years ago and which works to improve health in countries worldwide.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Johns Hopkins is immensely proud of the work done by our colleagues in Jhpiego, the Bloomberg School of Public Health, and the School of Medicine to care for mothers and infants, fight disease, provide clean drinking water, and advance countless other critical, life-saving efforts around the world," the university said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The cuts make Johns Hopkins one of the universities most deeply impacted by the slash of federal funding for research.
  <br>
  <br>
  The university receives roughly US$1 billion annually in funding from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and is currently running 600 clinical trials, according to The New York Times, adding that Hopkins is one of the plaintiffs in a federal lawsuit challenging such cuts.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US Agency for International Development (USAID), the largest funding agency for Jhpiego, distributes humanitarian aid around the world, with health and emergency programs in around 120 countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  US President Donald Trump, who is dismantling the humanitarian agency, signed an executive order in January demanding a freeze on all US foreign aid to allow time to assess overseas expenses. Critics warn that slashing USAID work will affect millions of people. (AFP)

    Duterte's first court appearance set for Friday

<img alt="People protest against former Philippine president Rodrigo Duterte in front of the ICC in the Hague. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795667_1_20250314085246.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Rodrigo Duterte's first appearance at the International Criminal Court has been set for Friday, the court said, as the former Philippines president faces crimes against humanity charges over his deadly war on drugs.
 <br>
  <br>
  A statement from the court late on Thursday said Duterte's first appearance would take place at 2 pm local time.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 79-year-old will appear before judges for a hearing where he will be informed of the crimes he is alleged to have committed, as well as his rights as a defendant.
  <br>
  <br>
  Duterte stands accused of the crime against humanity of murder over his years-long campaign against drug users and dealers that rights groups said killed tens of thousands of people.
  <br>
  <br>
  As he landed in The Hague, the former leader appeared to accept responsibility for his actions, saying in a Facebook video: "I have been telling the police, the military, that it was my job and I am responsible."
  <br>
  <br>
  Duterte's stunning arrest in Manila came amid a spectacular meltdown in relations between his family and the Marcos family, who had previously joined forces to run the Philippines.
  <br>
  <br>
  Current President Ferdinand Marcos and Vice-President Sara Duterte - Rodrigo's daughter - are at loggerheads, with the latter facing an impeachment trial over charges including an alleged assassination plot against Marcos.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sara Duterte is in The Netherlands to support her father, after labelling his arrest "oppression and persecution", with the Duterte family having sought an emergency injunction from the Supreme Court to stop his transfer.
  <br>
  <br>
  The high-profile Duterte case also comes at a critical moment for the ICC, as it faces unprecedented pressure from all sides, including US sanctions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last month, US President Donald Trump imposed sanctions on the court over what he said were "illegitimate and baseless actions targeting America and our close ally Israel."
  <br>
  <br>
  The ICC has issued an arrest warrant for Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former defence minister Yoav Gallant for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity during the Gaza war. (AFP)

 US President Donald Trump on Thursday threatened to slap a 200 percent tariff on wine, cognac, and other alcohol imports from Europe.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump's threat came in response to a European Union plan to impose tariffs on American whisky and other products next month - which itself is a response to Trump's 25 percent tariffs on steel and aluminium imports that took effect on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The European Commission had no immediate comment on Trump's post.
  <br>
  <br>
  Canada, a neighbour and close ally that is the US's biggest aluminium provider, has also announced countermeasures of its own to Trump's metals tariffs and has taken the dispute to the World Trade Organization.
  <br>
  <br>
  At an Oval Office meeting with NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte later on Thursday, he said he would not back off from reciprocal tariffs he has vowed to impose on all trading partners on April 2.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We've been ripped off for years, and we're not going to be ripped off," Trump said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alcohol is shaping up to be a key friction point in the brewing trade war.
  <br>
  <br>
  Many of the EU's proposed countermeasures, worth US$28.31 billion in all, would apply to products that have little more than symbolic value, such as dental floss and bathrobes.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the proposed 50 percent duty on US bourbon would be a significant hit for the industry, which has seen exports grow steadily since the United States lifted tariffs Trump imposed during his first term in office.
  <br>
  <br>
  The EU accounted for roughly 40 percent of all spirits exports in 2023, according to the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States, a trade group.
  <br>
  <br>
  Likewise, the United States accounts for 31 percent of EU wine and spirits exports, according to Eurostat.
  <br>
  <br>
  Industry officials on both sides of the Atlantic urged their leaders to de-escalate. "This cycle of tit-for-tat retaliation must end now!" said spiritsEurope, an industry trade group.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump says tariffs are a crucial tool to revitalise US industries that have withered due to decades of globalisation. But US importers and distributors said it would lead to lost sales, layoffs, and shuttered businesses. (Reuters)
