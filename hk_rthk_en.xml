<div class="itemFullText">
 US stocks closed lower on Tuesday as traders digested economic data which lowered the likelihood of an imminent Federal Reserve interest rate cut.
 <br>
  <br>
  Services sector and job openings data pointed to price pressures and a relatively robust labour market.
  <br>
  <br>
  Given the Fed's dual mandate from Congress to tackle inflation and unemployment, Tuesday's data suggest there is no burning need to cut interest rates.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You have some relatively minor numbers today, but they pointed to things that are not at all Fed friendly: higher prices and a more robust labour economy," said Steve Sosnick from Interactive Brokers told.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones faired best of the three major indices on Wall Street, closing down 0.4 percent at 42,528.
  <br>
  <br>
  The S&P 500 Index fell 1.1 percent to 5,909, while the Nasdaq Composite Index lost 1.9 percent to close at 19,489.
  <br>
  <br>
  While the stock markets fell, yields on US Treasurys rose, with the yield on the popular 10-year US Treasury rising by six basis points to around 4.7 percent on growing fears that President-elect Trump's threats to impose tariffs could prove inflationary.
  <br>
  <br>
  Over the past 24 hours, futures traders have raised their expectations that the Fed will pause interest rate cuts at its next rate meeting this month, according to data from CME Group.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among individual companies, chip titan Nvidia plunged 6.2 percent after chief executive Jensen Huang's keynote address at a tech conference failed to impress investors.
  <br>
  <br>
  But there was good news for pharmaceutical giant Moderna, which jumped 11.7 percent as flu and Covid-19 cases continued to rise across the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  Traders are now looking ahead to the release of job data on Wednesday and Friday of this week, which will provide key information on the overall health of the labour market. (AFP)

<img alt="Alexander Isak opened the scoring for Newcastle during their English League Cup semi-final first leg against Arsenal. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1786563_1_20250108071526.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Newcastle took a giant stride towards the League Cup final as goals from Alexander Isak and Anthony Gordon earned a 2-0 semi-final, first leg lead at Arsenal.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Magpies have never previously won the competition and have had to wait since 1969 to celebrate any major trophy.
  <br>
  <br>
  But in Isak they have the form striker in England right now and he rifled home the opener then helped tee up the second for Gordon.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal have a mountain to climb when the sides meet for the second leg on February 5 if they are to progress to meet either Tottenham or Liverpool in the final.
  <br>
  <br>
  The importance of silverware to both clubs was reflected in the line-ups as Mikel Arteta and Eddie Howe named their strongest available teams.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arteta has brought Arsenal back into contention for Premier League titles in recent seasons, but his only trophy in charge of the Gunners came five years ago by lifting the FA Cup in the early months of his reign.
  <br>
  <br>
  The home side were able to welcome back Kai Havertz, Martin Odegaard and Gabriel Martinelli from the side that started Saturday's 1-1 draw at Brighton.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Arsenal's lack of a lethal striker like Isak proved the difference between the sides. Arsenal had the majority of the ball and the chances but failed to make them count.
  <br>
  <br>
  Martinelli came closest when he raced onto Leandro Trossard's pass and smashed against the post.
  <br>
  <br>
  Moments later came the sucker punch. Arsenal, so renowned for their own set-piece threat, allowed a long free-kick into their box to fall at the feet of Isak who fired in off the underside of the bar.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Swede's 14th goal in his last 15 games took him to 50 in a Newcastle shirt – doing so in five fewer matches than it took the club's record goalscorer Alan Shearer.
  <br>
  <br>
  Isak had a major role to play in what could be a decisive second goal in the tie just after the break.
  <br>
  <br>
  This time the Newcastle striker's quick feet allowed him to get a shot off that was parried by David Raya into the path of the onrushing Gordon to fire in the rebound.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal should still have made their mammoth task for the return leg in Tyneside next month a more manageable one.
  <br>
  <br>
  Havertz somehow miscued a header wide with the goal gaping to cut the arrears. Howe replaced Isak and Gordon as Newcastle were happy to just to protect their lead in a 5-5-0 formation for the final 20 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal, though, lacked the guile to break them down without the injured Bukayo Saka to seemingly extend their wait for Arteta's revolution to deliver another trophy. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Didier Deschamps, France's longest serving national team coach, will reportedly not seek to renew his contract which expires in 2026, according to the French Football Federation.
 <br>
  <br>
  Deschamps' deal runs until after the next World Cup, for which Les Bleus have yet to qualify.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 56-year-old took over from fellow 1998 World Cup winner Laurent Blanc in 2012 and led Les Bleus to the World Cup title in 2018, two years after reaching the European Championship final on home soil.
  <br>
  <br>
  The former France captain, one of only three to win football's most prestigious prize as a player and a coach, guided the national team to the World Cup final again in 2022 – losing to Argentina on penalties after one of the best matches in the tournament's history. (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Tottenham have exercised the option to extend captain Son Heung-min's contract until June 2026.
 <br>
  <br>
  Son's deal, which he signed in 2021, was due to expire at the end of the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  The South Korean, 32, joined the Premier League club in 2015 from Bayer Leverkusen and has made 431 appearances, scoring 169 goals – fourth on Tottenham's all-time list.
  <br>
  <br>
  Son was named club captain in August 2023, and shared the Premier League's Golden Boot with Liverpool forward Mohamed Salah in the 2021 to 2022 season after scoring 23 goals.
  <br>
  <br>
  He is also captain of South Korea, making 131 appearances to date and scoring 51 times.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the current season, he has scored seven goals in all competitions in a struggling Spurs side who are 12th in the Premier League table.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tottenham said the South Korea international had become a “global star” and a “modern-day great” in his time at the club.
  <br>
  <br>
  The announcement of his extension came ahead of Tottenham's English League Cup semi-final first leg against Liverpool. (AFP/AP)

Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1786533_1_20250107215041.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 France on Tuesday marked 10 years since an Islamist attack on the Charlie Hebdo satirical newspaper that shocked the country, and led to fierce debate about freedom of expression and religion.
 <br>
  <br>
  President Emmanuel Macron and Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo led commemorations by laying wreaths at the site of the weekly's former offices, which were stormed by two masked Al-Qaeda-linked gunmen with AK-47 assault rifles.
  <br>
  <br>
  Macron and Hidalgo also paid tribute to Ahmed Merabet, a Muslim police officer who was executed at point-blank range near the building in the Bastille area of the capital in one of the most shocking images recorded of the tragedy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Twelve people died in the attacks, including eight editorial staff, while a separate but linked hostage-taking at a Jewish supermarket in eastern Paris by a third gunman on January 9, 2015, claimed another four lives.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bloodshed signalled the start of a dark period for France during which extremists inspired by Al-Qaeda and the Islamic State group repeatedly mounted attacks that set the country on edge and raised religious tensions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Today is not necessarily sad," Frederica Wolinksi, the daughter of famed French cartoonist and Charlie Hebdo contributor Georges Wolinski. "It's good that 10 years later we can still remember those who died on January 7 so well."
  <br>
  <br>
  The attack on Charlie Hebdo, carried out in retaliation for the newspaper’s irreverent caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad, ignited fierce global debates about the limits of free expression.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the days that followed, millions marched in solidarity, brandishing pens and signs declaring, “Je Suis Charlie” (I am Charlie).
  <br>
  <br>
  But 10 years on, the unity of that moment has given way to deeper divisions. Charlie Hebdo said its research shows that while a majority of French still believe in the fundamental right to caricature, younger generations increasingly criticise satire they see as divisive or insensitive, particularly toward marginalised communities.

 The number of dead in a magnitude 6.8 earthquake that struck the Tibet Autonomous Region in western China has risen to at least 126.
 <br>
  <br>
  The tremor also left 188 others injured.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities have raised the earthquake emergency response to the highest level, the region's emergency command centre announced on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The earthquake struck at 9.05am, and the epicentre was in Tsogo Township of Dingri County.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 1,000 houses were damaged in the strongest tremor to hit Dingri in five years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Many people were trapped as dozens of aftershocks shook the remote region.
  <br>
  <br>
  President Xi Jinping has ordered all-out rescue efforts to save lives.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vice Premier Zhang Guoqing led a team to the quake site, and thousands of rescuers and medical workers have been sent to the area.
  <br>
  <br>
  People in northeastern Nepal also felt the earthquake, but there were no initial reports of injuries or damage.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Chief Executive John Lee said the Hong Kong government will maintain close contact with relief organisations and provide assistance through its Disaster Relief Fund to those affected in Tibet.
  <br>
  <br>
  He expressed deep condolences to the victims and their families.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee added that authorities have not received any requests for assistance from Hong Kong residents so far. (Additional reporting by Xinhua, agencies)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Breast Milk Bank said on Tuesday it is making good progress in recruiting donors.
 <br>
  <br>
  The milk bank's director, Rosanna Wong, said it has received more than 100 calls from potential donors since the launch of the facility's website in November.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Since the opening of our website, we have actually received a lot of phone calls. More than 100 potential moms have already contacted us. So after today, we are going to contact them, actively support them, hopefully they could be donors at the end," Wong said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The facility, located at the Hong Kong Children's Hospital, started operation on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  It aims to collect 1,000 litres of milk a year, which Wong said would require 150 to 200 donors, each contributing at least 5 litres.
  <br>
  <br>
  If the annual target is met, it can be supplied to 450 to 600 premature babies born before 32 weeks, or critically-ill newborns in nine public hospitals.
  <br>
  <br>
  A donor, Yoyo Chan, who has an eight-month-old daughter, said she wants to help other premature babies after two previous miscarriages.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When I know that there's a breast milk bank, I decided to do it because I want to bless and contribute to the premature babies. At least I can do something to help them," Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The facility's advanced practice nurse Christine Lam said a face-to-face interview will be conducted with prospective donors.
  <br>
  <br>
  To qualify as donors, the mothers must be healthy, must not smoke nor drink alcohol, and are currently breastfeeding a baby under one year old.
  <br>
  <br>
  They will also have to take a blood test once every three months, and to inform staff of the facility whether they are taking medicines.
  <br>
  <br>
  The milk bank will offer milk bottles and pouches to donors and arrange couriers to collect their milk.

 More than 3,600 global finance and business figures will attend the annual Asian Financial Forum (AFF) which is set to kick off in Hong Kong next Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chief Executive John Lee; Justin Lin, former chief economist and senior vice president of the World Bank; and Stuart Russell, co-chair of the World Economic Forum's Council on artificial intelligence will be among the speakers for the event, touching on the shifting global economic landscape and its impact on mainland China, as well as the development and governance of AI.
  <br>
  <br>
  The theme of the 18th edition of the forum is "Powering the Next Growth Engine".
  <br>
  <br>
  While AI is expected to be a key focus, Patrick Lau, deputy executive director of the Trade Development Council, told RTHK that the event will also explore other fields that are considered as new drivers for the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are also seeing family offices and wealth management, together with philanthropy, as another area of high growth, especially leveraging in Hong Kong's strength as an international financial centre," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Green and sustainability will continue to be very important going forward. Last but not least, we have many new friends in Asean and the Middle East, so Islamic finance is another big area [in focus] for Hong Kong."
  <br>
  <br>
  Noting the SAR's financial markets have undergone a series of reforms, including a road map on sustainability disclosure and a policy statement on responsible application of AI in the financial markets, Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury Christopher Hui said the forum will showcase the SAR's latest financial advantages while exploring new collaborations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Luanne Lim, chairwoman of the AFF Steering Committee and Chief Executive Officer, Hong Kong, of HSBC, said despite greater uncertainties this year with increased tariff risks, Asia will continue to be the global growth engine.
  <br>
  <br>
  The region's gross domestic product is expected to grow 4.4 percent this year, outpacing the 2.7 percent global average target.

 A South Korean court has re-issued a warrant to arrest impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol, the country's corruption investigation agency said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Investigators seeking to question him on allegations of insurrection have struggled to execute a warrant for his arrest.
  <br>
  <br>
  The head of the investigation unit, blocked by a human chain of hundreds of presidential security service and military guards outside his residence last week, said earlier on Tuesday they remained determined to bring him in.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon's lawyers filed an injunction request to a Seoul court to nullify the arrest warrant, but the court struck that down on Sunday, a court official said on Tuesday. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 This year's Guangdong-Hong Kong Cup football competition will highlight a roster of young players from the SAR, as Hong Kong, China aim to nurture a new generation of talent for international play.
 <br>
  <br>
  The first leg of the tournament will take place at Yuexiushan Stadium in Guangdong on January 15, while the SAR will host the return leg at Hong Kong Stadium on January 22.
  <br>
  <br>
  Darren Arnott, head coach of the youth divisions, will be leading the Hong Kong, China team of 37 players, with 29 of them under the age of 23.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eric Fok, chairman of the Football Association of Hong Kong, China (HKFA), said on Tuesday that the experience will be crucial in encouraging young players to take on a key role in football development in the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  "One of the main initiatives of the HKFA is to develop more young players and give them more opportunities to play and train. So under this strategy, we have a number of initiatives," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We saw that at the last Asian Games at Hangzhou, it was mainly comprised of the youth team U-23. We had a historic result in the Asian Games, which showed that Hong Kong has a bright future and we have many good quality youth players."
  <br>
  <br>
  Fok also said the association has established a league for younger players and set up a training base in Guangxi to provide players with better facilities.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said Hong Kong Stadium will host the second leg of the Guangdong-Hong Kong Cup to accommodate a larger crowd.
  <br>
  <br>
  RTHK will broadcast both matches live.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fok added that the HKFA is in discussions with Kai Tak Sports Park about the possibility of hosting the home games for the AFC Asian Cup qualifiers, starting with the match against India in June.

    Govt to put up Tung Chung residential site for tender

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Development Secretary Bernadette Linn on Tuesday said she is reasonably optimistic that a residential site put up for tender this quarter will be successful, adding it is too early to predict whether the annual land sales income target can be met.
 <br>
  <br>
  The parcel earmarked for sale in Tung Chung, which will provide around 745 flats, was first put up for tender in September 2023 but was unsuccessful.
  <br>
  <br>
  Announcing the last land sale programme for the 2024/25 fiscal year, Linn said the government had been listening to the market.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have heard views from the real estate industry, suggesting that the government should roll out simpler, smaller-sized [plots] with fewer requirements on site formation and government facilities," Linn said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[The tender] is in line with such market expectations as it attaches very simple tender conditions and no requirement to construct government facilities. Moreover, as the site sits on reclaimed land, the development is not required to conduct any further site formation works, which may help reduce the development cost."
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister said the parcel was originally not part of the land sale programme for this fiscal year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked if she was confident the annual land sales revenue target of HK$33 billion could be met, Linn said it was still too early to make a conclusion.
  <br>
  <br>
  The development chief said the administration had been listening to developers about the type of site that was in demand.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We remain pragmatic and prudent in selecting the kind of land that we would like to roll out. When we know that the appetite of the market is for smaller sites, simpler sites, we are exactly moving along that direction, and that would help enliven the market and rekindle their interest in coming forward to bid for sites," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Taking into account various land sources, Linn said the land supply for the fourth quarter can provide around 1,100 new private residential units.

<div class="itemFullText">
 China said it attaches "great importance" to remarks by US President-elect Donald Trump on developing bilateral ties.
 <br>
  <br>
  "China is willing to promote the stable, healthy and sustainable development of Sino-US economic and trade relations," Foreign Ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun said in a media briefing on Tuesday, citing mutual respect and win-win cooperation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump on Monday said he and President Xi Jinping have been speaking through representatives, and that he believes the two leaders will get along.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We've already been talking. We've been talking through their representatives," Trump said in an interview.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And I think we will probably get very well, I predict," he said. "But you know, it's got to be a two-way street."
  <br>
  <br>
  Guo did not confirm that any exchanges had been made through the leaders' aides, but said the two countries have maintained communications through various means.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Vice Premier He Lifeng held talks via video link with US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, with both sides agreeing to maintain communication, manage differences and continue stabilisation of economic relations during the political transition period in the US.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to Xinhua News Agency, the video call was candid, in-depth and constructive, and both nations agreed on the importance of maintaining communication.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xinhua added that the Chinese side expressed concern over US economic and trade restrictions on China, in particular clarifying Beijing's position concerning the recent trade investigation initiated by Washington.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yellen, meanwhile, raised concerns about "malicious cyber activity" by Chinese state-sponsored actors, according to a statement by the US Treasury Department. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Various local attractions such as the giant panda will feature prominently in the upcoming Lunar New Year parade.
 <br>
  <br>
  The parade will be held on the evening of January 29, the first day of the Year of the Snake.
  <br>
  <br>
  Organised by the Hong Kong Tourism Board and sponsored by Cathay Pacific, it will feature nine floats and 46 performing groups from 14 countries and regions.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Many floats will even act as Hong Kong tourism ambassadors, featuring authentic elements of the city, such as the giant pandas. They will make an impressive appearance together with local famous food, such as milk tea,” Tourism Board chairman Pang Yiu-kai told a press conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  The K-pop girl group Kep1er and Thai boy band LYKN are among those invited to perform at the parade.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cathay’s chief executive officer Ronald Lam said the city's flagship carrier is committed to promoting mega events in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  “This parade is a platform for international cultural exchange. We have groups from different countries, gathering here and performing for local people and tourists, allowing everyone to experience the festive atmosphere with the characteristics of Hong Kong,” Lam said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The parade will start at 8pm at the Hong Kong Cultural Centre in Tsim Sha Tsui, proceeding along Canton Road, Haiphong Road and Nathan Road.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tickets will be on sale from January 11.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Tourism Board said the parade will kick off a series of festive celebrations across Hong Kong, including a fireworks display on January 30, Lunar New Year horse racing on January 31 and the Chinese New Year Cup football match on February 1.

    US-Japan ties rock solid: Blinken

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US Secretary of State Antony Blinken insisted during a visit to Tokyo on Tuesday that ties with Japan were stronger than ever, days after President Joe Biden blocked Nippon Steel's takeover of US Steel.
 <br>
  <br>
  Business groups say the decision could have a chilling effect on Japan's standing as the biggest foreign investor in the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  With two weeks left before president-elect Donald Trump takes over and Blinken is slated to be replaced by Marco Rubio, the top US diplomat noted that he also came to Japan on his first trip in 2021.
  <br>
  <br>
  The visits show "not just the importance, the centrality, the United States attaches to our alliance", Blinken said as he met Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This allyship, I believe, it's actually stronger than it's ever been," Blinken said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pointing to the need to coordinate after North Korea's launch of a missile Monday -- while he was in South Korea -- Blinken said: "Even though we're in a political transition, the world doesn't stop."
  <br>
  <br>
  Blinken also cited the strength of economic ties but made no direct mention of Biden's decision last week to block Nippon Steel's US$14.9-billion takeover of long-struggling US Steel, citing national security concerns.
  <br>
  <br>
  In response, the two companies filed a lawsuit on Monday against the Biden administration's "illegal interference" in the transaction.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're certain the lawsuit will reveal a set of facts that clearly violate the constitution and the law, so I believe we have a chance of winning," Nippon Steel chair Eiji Hashimoto said on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump, who takes office on January 20, "wants to make manufacturing strong again, and once again enrich the lives and future of manufacturing workers", Hashimoto added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is exactly in line with what we're doing."
  <br>
  <br>
  Nippon Steel had touted the takeover as a lifeline for a US company long past its heyday but opponents warned the Japanese owners would slash jobs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Biden had criticised the deal for months, while holding off on a move that could hurt ties with Tokyo.
  <br>
  <br>
  Japan and the United States are each other's top foreign investors, with Japanese firms investing almost US$800 billion in the United States in 2023. (AFP)

 Indonesia welcomed on Tuesday Brazil's announcement that it had become a full member of the Brics group of nations, a bloc of developing economies increasingly seen as a counterweight to the West.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Brazilian foreign ministry said in a statement on Monday that Southeast Asia's most populous country "shares with the other members the will to reform the institutions of global governance and contribute positively to cooperation within the Global South".
  <br>
  <br>
  Brazil, which holds the rotating presidency of the grouping in 2025, said Indonesia's bid to join the bloc had been approved during a summit in 2023 in Johannesburg.
  <br>
  <br>
  Indonesia in turn said it "welcomes" the announcement of its inclusion.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This achievement shows Indonesia's increasingly active role in global issues and commitment to strengthening multilateral cooperation to create a global structure that is more inclusive and fair," the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brics was created in 2009 by founding members Brazil, Russia, India and China.
  <br>
  <br>
  South Africa joined the following year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bloc was expanded again last year with Iran, Egypt, Ethiopia and the United Arab Emirates becoming full members.
  <br>
  <br>
  Indonesia sees its Brics membership as "a strategic step to improve the collaborations and cooperation with other developing nations, based on the principle of equality, mutual respect, and sustainable development", the Jakarta statement said.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also expressed Indonesia's "gratitude to Russia", the 2024 Brics chair, "for its support and leadership in facilitating Indonesia's joining", as well as to Brazil.
  <br>
  <br>
  During its presidency, Brazil aims to boost cooperation between countries of the "Global South" and reform multilateral institutions.
  <br>
  <br>
  One of the objectives, according to the government of left-wing President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, is the "development of means of payment" to facilitate trade between member countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  During the last Brics summit in Kazan, Russia, in November 2024, member nations discussed boosting non-dollar transactions and strengthening local currencies. (Reuters)

    'Putting Tencent, CATL on US list is suppression'

<img alt="The US Defence Department added tech giant Tencent and battery maker CATL to a list of companies it says are affiliated with the military. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1786435_1_20250107115416.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Beijing on Tuesday accused Washington of "unjustified suppression" after the US Defence Department added tech giant Tencent and battery manufacturer CATL to a list of companies it says are affiliated with the military.
 <br>
  <br>
  "China is always firmly opposed to the US side's generalisation of the concept of national security, the establishment of various discriminatory lists, the unreasonable suppression of Chinese enterprises and the curbing of China's high-quality development," Foreign Ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun told a regular press briefing.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We urge the US side to immediately correct its wrong practices," Guo said, adding China would "take the necessary measures to resolutely protect the rights of Chinese companies".
  <br>
  <br>
  The list also included chip maker Changxin Memory Technologies, Quectel Wireless, drone maker Autel Robotics, and China's largest shipping company Cosco Shipping Holdings, according to a document published on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two entities owned by Chinese state-owned oil major China National Offshore Oil Corporation were also listed, CNOOC China Ltd and CNOOC International Trading.
  <br>
  <br>
  The annually updated list of Chinese military companies, formally mandated under US law as the "Section 1260H list," designated 134 companies, according to a notice posted to the Federal Register.
  <br>
  <br>
  While the designation does not involve immediate bans, it can be a blow to the reputations of affected companies and represents a stark warning to US entities and firms about the risks of conducting business with them.
  <br>
  <br>
  It could also add pressure on the US Treasury Department to sanction the companies.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong-listed shares of Tencent fell as much as seven percent in early trade on Tuesday, while the US-traded shares of the company, which is also the parent of Chinese instant messaging app WeChat, fell eight percent in over-the-counter trading.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tencent said in a statement that its inclusion on the list was "clearly a mistake."
  <br>
  <br>
  It added: "We are not a military company or supplier. Unlike sanctions or export controls, this listing has no impact on our business."
  <br>
  <br>
  CATL, the world's largest electric vehicle battery maker whose Shenzhen-listed shares dropped more than five percent, also called the designation a mistake, saying it "is not engaged in any military-related activities."
  <br>
  <br>
  A Quectel spokesperson said the company "does not work with the military in any country and will ask the Pentagon to reconsider its designation, which clearly has been made in error." Quectel's shares fell nearly seven percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cosco's HK-listed shares dropped more than four percent. (Agencies)

    Scores killed after powerful quake hits Tibet region

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping has ordered all out rescue efforts after at least 95 people were killed and another 130 injured when a magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck the Tibet Autonomous Region in western China on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The epicentre was about 75 kilometres northeast of Mount Everest, which straddles the border with Nepal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi also urged efforts to prevent secondary disasters, properly resettle affected residents, and handle the aftermath work effectively.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is essential to strengthen earthquake monitoring and early warning, promptly allocate emergency rescue supplies, expedite the repair of damaged infrastructure, ensure the basic needs of residents are met, and guarantee a safe and warm winter for all," Xi said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The area is seismically active and is where the India and Eurasia plates clash and cause uplifts in the Himalayan mountains strong enough to change the heights of some of the world’s tallest peaks.
  <br>
  <br>
  The average altitude in the area around the epicentre is about 4,200 metres, the China Earthquake Networks Center said in a social media post.
  <br>
  <br>
  State broadcaster CCTV said there are a handful of communities within five kilometres of the epicentre, which was 380 kilometres from Lhasa, the provincial capital, and about 23 kilometres from the region's second-largest city of Shigatse, also known as Xigaze in Chinese.
  <br>
  <br>
  About 230 kilometres away in Nepal's capital, Kathmandu, the earthquake woke up residents and sent them running out of their homes into the streets. No information was immediately available from the remote, mountainous areas of Nepal closer to the epicentre.
  <br>
  <br>
  There were also reports of tremors in the northern Indian state of Bihar, which borders Nepal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials said the quake damaged or destroyed buildings in the autonomous region.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to the China Earthquake Networks Centre, the quake occurred at 9.05am local time in Xigaze, at a depth of 10 kilometres.
  <br>
  <br>
  It revised the strength of the tremor from its earlier reading of 6.9.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US Geological Survey, meanwhile, reported the tremor as magnitude 7.1.
  <br>
  <br>
  By 10am, multiple aftershocks had been recorded, with the largest one measuring 4.4 in magnitude, according to state media.
  <br>
  <br>
  Videos went viral on Chinese social media platforms, showing crumbled houses amid the aftermath from the nearby town of Lhatse, with debris spilling out onto the road.
  <br>
  <br>
  The State Council Earthquake Relief Headquarters Office and the Ministry of Emergency Management have launched a level 3 emergency response to the quake, while the local government dispatched over 1,500 people to conduct search and rescue work in the affected areas.
  <br>
  <br>
  A magnitude 6.8 quake is considered strong and is capable of causing severe damage.
  <br>
  <br>
  South-western parts of China, Nepal and northern India are frequently hit by earthquakes caused by the collision of the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2008, a huge quake in Sichuan province killed almost 70,000 people, while a magnitude 7.8 tremor struck near Kathmandu in 2015 leaving about 9,000 people dead in Nepal's worst ever earthquake. (Reporting by Xinhua, Reuters and Associated Press)

    Govt enhances New Capital Investment Entrant Scheme

<img alt="Applicants of the New Capital Investment Entrant Scheme will only need to prove they have a minimum net worth of HK$30 million in the six months before they apply.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Tuesday said its enhancement measures to the New Capital Investment Entrant Scheme will attract more people, as well as promote the development of family offices.
 <br>
  <br>
  Starting in March, applicants will only need to prove they have a minimum net worth of HK$30 million in the six months before applying, rather than the original period of two years.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government will also consider the total amount of net assets that applicants are absolutely beneficially entitled to within their family.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under the scheme, applicants must invest a minimum of HK$30 million within the six-month time limit.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government will also recognise investments made by private enterprises that are wholly owned by applicants as eligible investment, but the companies must be incorporated or registered in the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We believe these measures will encourage more investors to join the scheme and can create synergy with the tax concession regime for family offices, thereby promoting the development of family office businesses in Hong Kong," the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury Christopher Hui said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are committed to providing comprehensive support for family office decision-makers to establish themselves in Hong Kong, further attracting global asset owners and reinforcing Hong Kong's leading position as an international asset and wealth management hub."
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 800 applications have been received since the scheme was implemented last March, and the government expects over HK$24 billion of investment will be brought into the region.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alpha Lau, Director-General of Investment Promotion, pointed out that the number of applications in the first 10 months since the implementation has surpassed the same period under the previous Capital Investment Entrant Scheme that was launched in 2003.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I trust that these measures will enhance the attractiveness of the scheme. We will continue to work closely with professionals and service providers to further promote the scheme to high-net-worth families around the globe," she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lawmaker Shang Hailong was confident the new measures would attract more wealthy people to Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I hope that Hong Kong would attract more than 5,000 applications, bring in more than HK$150 billion of investment, set up more and more companies or family offices here,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The investors from all over the world, who expect Hong Kong's advantages, for example, safety, low tax, and [connectivity] to the mainland market - those investors will get benefits in the near future.”
  <br>
  <br>
  But the founder of the Hong Kong Top Talent Services Association added the scheme had room to grow in terms of attracting more applicants.
  <br>
  <br>
  “There's room for improvement. For example, HK$24 billion is a lot of money, but I noticed that this is only a forecast number. We hope the government help these investors complete their investments as soon as possible. We know there is still a long way to go from waiting for investment to completing the investment. I think 800 applications is not ideal,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shang said the government should provide more assistance to help investors settle in the SAR and expand into the mainland.

    Singapore, Malaysia agree deal on joint SEZ

<div class="itemFullText">
 Malaysia and Singapore announced on Tuesday an agreement on a special economic zone (SEZ) in the southern Malaysian state of Johor, aiming to support investment and free up movement of goods and people between the countries.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Southeast Asian neighbours first agreed in principle to jointly develop the SEZ a year ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tuesday's agreement was announced during a visit to Malaysia by Singapore Prime Minister Lawrence Wong and senior cabinet ministers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's an important project ... we can both be more competitive, enhance our value proposition, and jointly attract more investments to our shores," Wong told a joint press conference with Malaysian counterpart Anwar Ibrahim.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When negotiating the agreement, both sides have actively engaged stakeholders to ensure that the SEZ has the conditions to help our businesses grow together for the longer term."
  <br>
  <br>
  Anwar said the SEZ was unique initiative as it was rare for two countries to team up on a single project.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two countries are aiming to attract high-value investments into Johor in sectors ranging from manufacturing and logistics to tourism and energy transition, Malaysia's Economic Minister Rafizi Ramli told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  They are targeting 50 projects at the economic zone within the first five years of its inception, and the creation of 20,000 skilled jobs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Malaysia will set up and manage an infrastructure fund to support companies looking to set up there, while Singapore will create its own fund to facilitate investments and support Singaporean companies operating in Johor, Rafizi said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thousands of Malaysians commute every day to Singapore for work and study, causing frequent traffic congestion on the causeway between the countries, one of the world's busiest border crossings.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two leaders also invited proposals for high-speed rail between the two countries, which Anwar said should be led by the private sector, with limited government involvement. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police said they are investigating a fatal traffic accident in Tai Po on Monday, in which a pedestrian was killed.
 <br>
  <br>
  At about 6pm, a coach was travelling along Kwong Wang Street towards Kwong Fuk Estate, when it reportedly hit a 65-year-old man while approaching a bus stop.
  <br>
  <br>
  The pedestrian sustained chest injuries and was sent to Prince of Wales Hospital in a conscious state, but was certified dead at about 7.30pm.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police said the force of the impact caused the man to knock over another pedestrian - a 67-year-old woman - who sustained limb injuries.
  <br>
  <br>
  She was sent to Alice Ho Miu Ling Nethersole Hospital in a conscious state.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 66-year-old coach driver was arrested on suspicion of dangerous driving causing death and remains in custody.

    US records its first human death from bird flu

<img alt="The amount of bird flu circulating among animals and humans has alarmed scientists over concerns it could mutate into a more transmissible form. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1786433_1_20250107112537.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Louisiana health authorities on Monday reported the first human death in the United States linked to bird flu, while noting the patient had underlying medical conditions and that general risks to the public remained "low".
 <br>
  <br>
  The patient, aged over 65, had been hospitalised in the southern state since at least mid-December, when the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announced it as the country's first serious case of human infection from the H5N1 virus.
  <br>
  <br>
  "While the current public health risk for the general public remains low, people who work with birds, poultry or cows, or have recreational exposure to them, are at higher risk," the Louisiana Department of Health said in a statement announcing the death.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said the patient had "contracted H5N1 after exposure to a combination of a non-commercial backyard flock and wild birds," but had detected no further H5N1 infections nor evidence of person-to-person transmission in the state.
  <br>
  <br>
  The news comes just days after the federal government awarded an additional US$306 million to bolster H5N1 surveillance programs and research, amid some criticism for President Joe Biden's administration over its response to the simmering issue.
  <br>
  <br>
  The amount of bird flu circulating among animals and humans has alarmed scientists over concerns it could mutate into a more transmissible form – potentially triggering a deadly pandemic.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since the beginning the 2024, the CDC has recorded 66 cases of bird flu in humans in the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have a lot of data that shows that this virus can be lethal, more lethal than many viruses we worry about," Jennifer Nuzzo, a professor of epidemiology at Brown University said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For that reason, people have been quite alarmed about these outbreaks that have been occurring on farms and other places in the US and have really been shouting for the US government to do more," she added.

<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korean anti-graft investigators were waiting on Tuesday for a new court-ordered arrest warrant for impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol, whose failed martial law bid threw the country into turmoil.
 <br>
  <br>
  The former star prosecutor has refused questioning three times over a bungled martial law decree last month and is holed up in his residence surrounded by hundreds of guards preventing his arrest.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is likely a new warrant will be granted by the same court that issued the first order, which expired after seven days, but investigators refused to disclose the duration of the new warrant they were seeking.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Joint Investigation Headquarters today refiled a warrant with the Seoul Western District Court to extend the arrest warrant for defendant Yoon," the Corruption Investigation Office (CIO) said in a statement late on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Details regarding the validity period cannot be disclosed."
  <br>
  <br>
  There was no comment by investigators or the Seoul court on the new warrant being approved by Tuesday morning.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, CIO deputy director Lee Jae-seung told reporters on Tuesday before it was refiled that the likelihood the court would not grant an extension was "very low".
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon is being investigated on charges of insurrection and, if formally arrested and convicted, faces prison or, at worst, the death penalty. His failed martial law decree plunged South Korea into its worst political crisis in decades.
  <br>
  <br>
  He would also become the first sitting president in South Korean history to be arrested.
  <br>
  <br>
  His lawyers repeatedly said the initial warrant was "unlawful" and "illegal", pledging to take further legal action against it. (AFP)

    Polar vortex keeps much of the US in icy grip

<img alt="Winter arrives to Washington DC, on the day of a joint session of Congress to certify Donald Trump's election. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1786417_1_20250107094255.jpg&q=85">

<div class="itemFullText">
 A huge swathe of the US was blasted with ice, snow and wind on Monday as the polar vortex that dipped south over the weekend kept much of the country east of the Rockies in its frigid grip, making many roads treacherous, forcing school closures, and causing widespread power outages and flight cancellations.
 <br>
  <br>
  The immense storm system brought disruption to areas of the country that usually escape winter's wrath, downing trees in some Southern states, threatening a freeze in Florida and causing people in Dallas to dip deep into their wardrobes for hats and gloves.
  <br>
  <br>
  Washington DC received heavy snow as President-elect Donald Trump’s victory was certified. Taking advantage of the rare snowstorm in the nation’s capital, revellers engaged in a snowball fight in front of the Washington Monument as flags flew at half-staff in memory of former President Jimmy Carter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ice and snow blanketed major roads in Kansas, western Nebraska and parts of Indiana, where the National Guard was activated to help stranded motorists.
  <br>
  <br>
  The National Weather Service issued winter storm warnings for Kansas and Missouri, where blizzard conditions brought wind gusts of up to 72 kph. The warnings extended to New Jersey into early Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The polar vortex of ultra-cold air usually spins around the North Pole, but it sometimes plunges southward into the US, Europe and Asia. Studies show that a fast-warming Arctic is partly to blame for the increasing frequency of the polar vortex extending its grip.
  <br>
  <br>
  School closings were widespread, with districts in Indiana, Virginia, Kentucky, Missouri and Kansas cancelling or delaying the start of classes on Monday. Classes were also cancelled in Maryland, where Governor Wes Moore declared a state of emergency on Sunday and announced that state government offices would also be closed the next day.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 2,500 flights were cancelled and at least 6,500 more were delayed nationwide as of Monday morning, according to tracking platform FlightAware. (AP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chris Wood scored his 12th Premier League goal of the season as third-placed Nottingham Forest beat Wolverhampton Wanderers 3-0 at Molineux Stadium, keeping them on course for an unlikely title challenge.
 <br>
  <br>
  Morgan Gibbs-White and substitute Taiwo Awoniyi were also on target for the visitors as they won their sixth top-flight game in a row, the first time they have managed that feat since 1979 under then manager Brian Clough.
  <br>
  <br>
  Forest have 40 points from 20 games, six behind leaders Liverpool, who have a game in hand. Forest's tally is the same number as Leicester City had accumulated by the same point of the 2015-2016 campaign when they went on to become shock Premier League champions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is about consistency and doing what we have been doing extremely well already this season. Not letting up halfway through. We need to keep going," Wood said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is all about confidence, belief and responsibility, and a team that works to all of our strengths," he added. "It is not the same every week, we try to tweak things to get better. It is well and truly too early to talk about a title challenge, we are not thinking about that."
  <br>
  <br>
  Wolves had their chances, not least striker Jorgen Strand Larsen who might have had a hat-trick but was wasteful in front of goal. They have 16 points from 20 games and are only out of the relegation zone on goal difference.
  <br>
  <br>
  Former Wolves player Gibbs-White gave the visitors the lead inside seven minutes. A lightning counter-attack saw the midfielder feed Anthony Elanga and when he took the return pass, Gibbs-White fired low into the bottom right corner of the net.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wolves should have gone level when Strand Larsen had a tap-in three metres from goal, but the forward saw his effort blocked on the line by Murillo with the goal gaping.
  <br>
  <br>
  Strand Larsen had another excellent chance with a header that was saved from point-blank range by Forest goalkeeper Matz Sels.
  <br>
  <br>
  The visitors doubled their advantage before halftime with an almost inevitable Wood goal. Callum Hudson-Odoi made a storming run down the left wing and, after holding off Matt Doherty, pulled the ball back for a side-footed finish from the New Zealand striker.
  <br>
  <br>
  Strand Larsen forced another good save from Sels, but the chances dried up for Wolves.
  <br>
  <br>
  Awoniyi completed a perfect night for the visitors when he got his first goal since February after he was teed-up by fellow substitute James Ward-Prowse. (Reuters)

    US Congress certifies Trump election victory

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The US Congress formally certified Republican President-elect Donald Trump's election victory on Monday during a session presided over by Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris, who lost the November contest.
 <br>
  <br>
  The quadrennial ritual, clearing the way for Trump's inauguration in two weeks, went smoothly - in sharp contrast to four years ago when Trump supporters stormed the Capitol in a failed bid to block the certification of then-President Trump's 2020 loss to Democratic President Joe Biden.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump continues to falsely claim that his 2020 defeat was the result of widespread fraud, and had warned throughout his 2024 campaign that he harboured similar concerns until his November 5 defeat of Harris.
  <br>
  <br>
  Harris oversaw the roll call of the states in the vice president's ceremonial role as president of the Senate.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Congress certifies our great election victory today - a big moment in history. MAGA!" Trump wrote on his social media platform Truth Social earlier on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The joint session of Congress proceeded despite a winter storm that dropped about 15 centimetres of snow.
  <br>
  <br>
  The final certification backed up preliminary findings that Trump won 312 Electoral College votes to Harris's 226.
  <br>
  <br>
  Republicans also captured a majority in the US Senate and held a narrow edge in the House in November's election, which will give Trump the party support he needs to implement his planned agenda of tax cuts and a crackdown on immigrants living in the country illegally.
  <br>
  <br>
  Democrats did not try to block certification of Trump's victory on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Security inside and outside the Capitol was heightened in preparation for the certification and was expected to remain in place through Trump's swearing-in on January 20. (Reuters)

 Tech sector gains helped US indexes recoup some holiday-season losses.
 <br>
  <br>
  The S&P 500 rose 32.91 points, or 0.6 percent, to 5,975.38. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 25.57 points, or 0.1 percent, to 42,706.56, and the Nasdaq composite jumped 243.30, or 1.2 percent, to 19,864.98.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tech companies were the clear leaders, including those with A-I exposure. Nvidia climbed 3.4 percent to top its record set in November ahead of a speech by CEO Jensen Huang at the annual CES convention in Las Vegas after trading ended for the day.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nvidia and other AI stocks keep climbing despite criticism that they're overbought.
  <br>
  <br>
  Microsoft Vice Chair Brad Smith said on late Friday the company is on track to invest about US$80 billion to build out AI-enabled data centres to train AI models this fiscal year. Smith said AI is the biggest opportunity “to harness new technology to invigorate the nation’s economy” since the invention of electricity. Microsoft rose 1.1 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Uber Technologies rose 2.7 percent higher after the ride-hailing app said it would accelerate US$1.5 billion in purchases of its own stock.
  <br>
  <br>
  US Steel climbed 8.1 percent after it and Japan’s Nippon Steel filed a federal lawsuit challenging President Joe Biden’s decision to block a proposed nearly US$15 billion deal for Nippon to buy its Pittsburgh-based rival. (AP)

    Canada PM Trudeau announces resignation

<div class="itemFullText">
 Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced on Monday that he will step down as leader of the ruling Liberals after nine years in office but will stay on in his post until the party chooses a replacement.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trudeau, under heavy pressure from Liberal legislators to quit amid polls showing the party will be crushed at the next election, said at a news conference that parliament would be suspended until March 24.
  <br>
  <br>
  That means Trudeau will still be prime minister on January 20 when US President-elect Donald Trump takes office. Trump has threatened to impose tariffs that would cripple Canada's economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I intend to resign as party leader as prime minister after the party selects its next leader through a robust, nationwide competitive process," Trudeau said. "This country deserves a real choice in the next election, and it has become clear to me that if I'm having to fight internal battles, I cannot be the best option in that election."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trudeau, 53, took office in November 2015 and won re-election twice, becoming one of Canada's longest-serving prime ministers.
  <br>
  <br>
  But his popularity started dipping two years ago amid public anger over high prices and a housing shortage, and his fortunes never recovered.
  <br>
  <br>
  Parliament was due to resume on January 27 and opposition parties had vowed to bring down the government as soon as they could, most likely at the end of March. But if parliament does not return until March 24, the earliest they could present a non-confidence motion would be some time in May.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trudeau had until recently been able to fend off Liberal legislators worried about the poor showing in polls and the loss of safe seats in two special elections last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  But calls for him to step aside have soared since last month, when he tried to demote Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland, one of his closest cabinet allies, after she pushed back against his proposals for more spending.
  <br>
  <br>
  Freeland quit instead and penned a letter accusing Trudeau of "political gimmicks" rather than focusing on what was best for the country. (Reuters)

    UK PM Starmer defends record as public prosecutor

<img alt="Britain's Prime Minister Keir Starmer answers a question from the media during a visit to the Elective Orthopaedic Centre at Epsom Hospital. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1786370_1_20250106223004.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 British Prime Minister Keir Starmer defended his work as Britain's top prosecutor on Monday, refusing to mention US billionaire Elon Musk by name but addressing his criticism that, long before he became leader, he had failed to prosecute gangs who sexually abused girls.
 <br>
  <br>
  Musk, a close ally of US President-elect Donald Trump, has spent days posting messages on his social media site X accusing Starmer of what he said was a failure to prosecute gangs of men, mostly of a South Asian background, who raped young girls when he was director of public prosecutions (DPP) between 2008 and 2013.
  <br>
  <br>
  Starmer declined to address some of Musk's other messages on X - including a poll asking whether the United States should liberate the UK from its "tyrannical government" - but strongly defended his record as DPP, saying he had overcome resistance to tackling the allegations by reopening cases.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When I was chief prosecutor for five years, I tackled that head-on ... and that's why I reopened cases that had been closed and supposedly finished. I brought the first major prosecution of an Asian grooming gang ... I changed the whole prosecution approach," he told a press conference, visibly angry.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Those that are spreading lies and misinformation as far and as wide as possible are not interested in victims, they are interested in themselves."
  <br>
  <br>
  Starmer has refrained from commenting on Musk's increasingly critical comments of his tenure, but his impatience was clear when he tackled the allegations over cases involving gangs who systematically groomed and raped girls over a period of years, some of which coincided with his time as DPP.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Transport Department on Monday said it had approved the conversion of two red minibus routes into the more regulated green minibus routes, under its conversion scheme.
 <br>
  <br>
  The routes are from Hiu Kwong Street in Sau Mau Ping to Pak Hoi Street in Jordan; and a circular route running between Park Yoho in Yuen Long and Yuen Long Station.
  <br>
  <br>
  Services are expected to begin in March.
  <br>
  <br>
  A spokesman for the Transport Department said the two operators have started the preparation work, including drawing up the service schedules, buying stop signs, repainting the minibus bodies, as well as recruiting drivers.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added it has been the government’s established policy to encourage the conversion of red minibus routes for more effective monitoring and better service quality.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The Transport Department will consider the way forward of the Scheme, taking into account the implementation of these routes in the first batch of the Scheme as well as the views and feedback from the trades,” he said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The department had previously invited the operators of 11 selected red minibus routes to convert into green minibus routes, but only received two applications.

    Nippon, US Steel file lawsuit after Biden blocks sale

<img alt="US and Nippon Steel are mounting a legal challenge against President Joe Biden's decision to block the deal. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1786361_1_20250106211435.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Nippon Steel and US Steel filed a federal lawsuit challenging the Biden administration's decision to block a proposed nearly US$15 billion deal for Nippon to acquire Pittsburgh-based American steel maker.
 <br>
  <br>
  The suit, filed on Monday in the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, alleges that it was a political decision and violated the companies' due process.
  <br>
  <br>
  “From the outset of the process, both Nippon Steel and US Steel have engaged in good faith with all parties to underscore how the transaction will enhance, not threaten, United States national security, including by revitalising communities that rely on American steel, bolstering the American steel supply chain, and strengthening America’s domestic steel industry," the companies said in a prepared statement Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Nippon Steel is the only partner both willing and able to make the necessary investments.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Nippon Steel had promised to invest US$2.7 billion in US Steel’s ageing blast furnace operations in Gary, Indiana, and Pennsylvania’s Mon Valley.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also vowed not to reduce production capacity in the United States over the next decade without first getting US government approval.
  <br>
  <br>
  Biden on Friday decided to stop the Nippon takeover — after federal regulators deadlocked on whether to approve it — because “a strong domestically owned and operated steel industry represents an essential national security priority. ... Without domestic steel production and domestic steel workers, our nation is less strong and less secure," he said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  While administration officials have said the decision was unrelated to Japan's relationship with the US — this is the first time a US president has blocked a merger between a US and Japanese firm. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Sources said an off-duty customs officer was arrested on suspicion of tampering with a vehicle last Friday, when a motorcyclist died in a traffic accident in Ngau Tau Kok.
 <br>
  <br>
  Police said a 40-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of tampering with a motor vehicle on the day of the fatal traffic accident.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officers said they were still investigating and would seek advice from the Department of Justice. The arrested man has been released on bail.
  <br>
  <br>
  Customs said it would not comment on the case as it is still under investigation.
  <br>
  <br>
  The accident happened at around 5.46pm last Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police said the deceased 27-year-old man was riding his motorcycle along Wang Kee Street towards Lam Hing Street.
  <br>
  <br>
  He reportedly lost control of his vehicle and rammed into a roadside iron pole near Central Mail Centre.
  <br>
  <br>
  The motorcyclist, who had sustained serious injuries, was declared dead at the scene.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police also said a 40-year-old male passerby was knocked down by the motorcycle.
  <br>
  <br>
  He sustained injuries to his hand and was sent to United Christian Hospital for treatment.

    Jailed ex-Malaysian PM Najib closer to house arrest

<img alt="Malaysia's appeals court on Monday granted a bid by jailed ex-premier Najib Razak to see a document he said should allow him to serve his sentence at home. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1786331_1_20250106172957.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Malaysia's imprisoned former Prime Minister Najib Razak on Monday won an appeal to pursue his bid to serve his remaining corruption sentence under house arrest.
 <br>
  <br>
  In an application in April last year, Najib said he had clear information that then-King Sultan Abdullah Sultan Ahmad Shah issued an addendum order allowing him to finish his sentence under house arrest.
  <br>
  <br>
  Najib claimed the addendum was issued during a pardons board meeting on January 29 last year chaired by Sultan Abdullah that also cut his 12-year jail sentence by half and sharply reduced a fine. But the High Court tossed out his bid three months later.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Court of Appeals, in a 2-1 ruling on Monday, ordered the High Court to hear the merits of the case.
  <br>
  <br>
  The decision came after Najib's lawyer produced a letter from a Pahang state palace official confirming that then-Sultan Abdullah had issued the addendum order.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We are happy that finally Najib has got a win,” his lawyer Mohamad Shafee Abdullah said. “He is very happy and very relieved that finally they recognised some element of injustice that has been placed against him.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The lawyer said Najib gave a thumbs-up in court when the ruling was read.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said it was “criminal” for the government to conceal the addendum order. Shafee noted that a new High Court judge will now hear the case.
  <br>
  <br>
  In his application, Najib accused the pardons board, home minister, attorney-general and four others of concealing the sultan’s order “in bad faith.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Sultan Abdullah hails from Najib’s hometown in Pahang. He ended his five-year reign on January 30 last year under Malaysia’s unique rotating monarchy system. A new king took office a day later.
  <br>
  <br>
  Home Minister Saifuddin Nasution Ismail has said he had no knowledge of such an order since he wasn't a member of the pardons board. The others named in Najib’s application have not made any public comments.
  <br>
  <br>
  Najib, 71, served less than two years of his sentence before it was commuted by the pardons board. His sentence is now due to end on August 23, 2028.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was charged and found guilty in a corruption case linked to the multibillion-dollar looting of state fund 1Malaysia Development Berhad.
  <br>
  <br>
  The pardons board didn’t give any reason for its decision and wasn’t required to explain. But the move has prompted a public outcry over the appearance that Najib was being given special privileges compared to other prisoners.
  <br>
  <br>
  Najib set up the 1MDB development fund shortly after he took office in 2009.
  <br>
  <br>
  Investigators allege at least US$4.5 billion was stolen from the fund and laundered by Najib’s associates through layers of bank accounts in the United States and other countries, financed Hollywood films and extravagant purchases that included hotels, a luxury yacht, art and jewellery.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than US$700 million landed in Najib’s bank accounts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Najib is still fighting graft charges in the main trial linking him directly to the scandal. (AP)

<img alt="Canada’s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau could resign within the coming 24 hours, according to Canadian media reports. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1786322_1_20250106165200.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau may resign as soon as Monday, according to media reports, as he faces mounting dissent within his Liberal Party.
 <br>
  <br>
  National newspapers The Globe and Mail and The Toronto Star reported that sources inside Trudeau's Liberal Party expect him to step down ahead of its national caucus on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The announcement may be made in the coming 24 hours, sources told both papers in stories they ran on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trudeau's departure would leave his party without a leader just a few months before the next legislative elections, scheduled to be held by the end of October.
  <br>
  <br>
  It remained unclear whether Trudeau, 53, would remain as his party's interim leader or would vacate the position immediately if he tendered his resignation as prime minister.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trudeau's popularity has waned in recent months, with his government narrowly surviving a series of no-confidence votes and critics calling for his resignation.
  <br>
  <br>
  He has vowed to stay on to guide the Liberals to elections but has faced further pressure from incoming US president Donald Trump, who has threatened a 25-percent tariff on Canadian goods.
  <br>
  <br>
  Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland quit in December after disagreeing with Trudeau over how to respond to Trump's apparent plan, in the first open dissent against the prime minister within his cabinet.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trudeau announced a major shakeup to his cabinet later that month, changing a third of his team in a bid to settle the political turmoil.
  <br>
  <br>
  He travelled to Florida in November to meet with Trump at his Mar-a-Lago estate in a bid to head off a trade war.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the US president-elect has since also landed humiliating blows against Trudeau on social media, repeatedly calling him "governor" of Canada and declaring that the United States' northern neighbour becoming the 51st US state is a "great idea."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trudeau swept to power in 2015 and led the Liberals to two more ballot box victories in 2019 and 2021.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he now trails his main rival, Conservative Pierre Poilievre, by 20 points in public opinion polls.
  <br>
  <br>
  The eldest son of the charismatic former prime minister Pierre Trudeau, who died in 2000, Justin Trudeau came late to politics after working as a snowboard instructor, bartender, bouncer and teacher.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was first elected to the House of Commons in 2008 to represent a working-class Montreal neighbourhood.
  <br>
  <br>
  He brought in Senate reforms, signed a new trade deal with the United States and introduced a carbon tax to reduce Canada's greenhouse gas emissions during his first two terms as prime minister.
  <br>
  <br>
  The married father of three also legalised cannabis, held a public inquiry into missing and murdered Indigenous women and passed legislation permitting medically assisted suicide. (AFP)

    XPeng seals new partnership deal with Volkswagen

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Shares of Chinese EV maker XPeng jumped sharply after the company announced an expanded strategic partnership with German automaker Volkswagen to build the largest electric vehicle supercharging network in China.
 <br>
  <br>
  The two companies signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), under which the two parties will open up their respective fast-charging networks to each other's customers, and work together to build a ultra-fast charging network in the country that comprises over 20,000 charging terminals covering 420 cities.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shares of XPeng Motors jumped as much as five percent in the morning session in Hong Kong, before retreating to HK$46.45 at noon, 3.9 percent higher than the close in the previous session.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two sides will also explore their joint construction of co-branded ultra-fast charging stations in China to improve customer experience, the statement added.
  <br>
  <br>
  XPeng and Volkswagen forged a partnership in July 2023, when Volkswagen bought 4.99 percent of XPeng for about US$700 million with plans to jointly launch two Volkswagen-branded EV models by 2026 for the mid-sized car market.
  <br>
  <br>
  Volkswagen later said it had developed a new architecture for smart electric vehicles with XPeng that would help it offer more affordable EVs in its largest market. (Additional reporting by Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said a North Korean missile test carried out during his visit to Seoul on Monday was a reminder of the need to deepen Washington's cooperation with South Korea and Japan to deter an emboldened Pyongyang.
 <br>
  <br>
  North Korea fired what appeared to be an intermediate-range ballistic missile at around noon, which flew more than 1,100 kilometres east before falling into the sea, according to South Korea's military.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking a few hours later, Blinken told a news conference the launch underscored the importance of collaboration between the US, South Korea and Japan, including on sharing real-time missile data and holding trilateral military exercises.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Today's launch is just a reminder to all of us of how important our collaborative work is," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Blinken also warned of Pyongyang's deepening ties with Moscow. He said Washington believed Russia intended to share space and satellite technology with North Korea in exchange for its support in the conflict with Ukraine, in which more than 1,000 North Korean soldiers have been killed or wounded.
  <br>
  <br>
  US President Joe Biden, who leaves office this month, made headway in deepening trilateral cooperation between the US and South Korea and Japan, despite historic issues that have often plagued relations between the Asian neighbours.
  <br>
  <br>
  But political turmoil in South Korea, together with the imminent return of the unpredictable rule of Donald Trump in the United States, has raised questions over whether those efforts can be sustained.
  <br>
  <br>
  South Korean lawmakers last month voted to impeach President Yoon Suk-yeol and suspend him from duties after his December 3 declaration of martial law stunned the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon's impeachment trial is being heard by the Constitutional Court.
  <br>
  <br>
  If Yoon is permanently removed from office, a presidential election would be called and the liberals -- seen as likely to win that contest -- have been critical of Yoon's efforts to partner with Tokyo.
  <br>
  <br>
  Blinken, who also met on Monday with acting President Choi Sang-mok, told the news conference that while Washington had "serious concerns" about Yoon's actions, it had confidence in the country's institutions and democratic resilience.
  <br>
  <br>
  Monday's launch was Pyongyang's first since November 5 when it fired at least seven short-range ballistic missiles. (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 "The Brutalist," the story of a Holocaust survivor who chases the American dream, and musical thriller "Emilia Perez", took home the first major movie honours of Hollywood's awards season at the Golden Globes on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Voters for the Globes, handed out by entertainment journalists around the world, named "The Brutalist" best movie drama and star Adrien Brody the best drama film actor. The film also landed the best director prize for Brady Corbet.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brody, who plays an architect trying to build a life in the United States, called the movie from independent studio A24 "a monument to humanity and the arts."
  <br>
  <br>
  "To the many people who have struggled emigrating to this country, I hope this work stands to lift you up a bit and give you a voice," Brody said on stage at the black-tie event in Beverly Hills.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Emilia Perez," about a Mexican drug lord who transitions to a woman, claimed best movie musical or comedy. The Spanish-language Netflix movie led all films with four awards in total, including a supporting actress honor for Zoe Saldana.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The light always wins over the darkness," said Karla Sofía Gascón, the trans actor who plays the lead role in "Emilia Perez." "You can never take away our soul, or existence or identity."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Globes kick off a marathon awards season in Hollywood that culminates with the Academy Awards in March. Winning a Globe can shine a spotlight on movies angling for the coveted best picture prize at the Oscars.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Wicked," the box office smash based on the popular Broadway musical, claimed the Globe for cinematic and box office achievement. Director Jon M. Chu spoke of his love for movies as he was surrounded by the cast on stage.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When pessimism and cynicism sort of rule the planet right now, we can still make art, and still make art that is an act of optimism, that is empowerment and that is joy," Chu said.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a surprise, Demi Moore won best actress in a musical or comedy film for her leading role in "The Substance," the story of a fading actress seeking a fountain of youth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Known for movies such as "St. Elmo's Fire" and "Ghost," Moore told the crowd that she had once been dismissed as a "popcorn actress" and feared her career was over.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm just in shock right now," Moore said as she held her trophy on stage. "I've been doing this a long time, over 45 years. This is the first time I've ever won anything as an actor."
  <br>
  <br>
  Among other awards, Brazil's Fernanda Torres took the trophy for best actress in a movie drama for Portuguese language film "I'm Still Here." The movie tells the story of a woman who must reinvent herself after her family is shattered by violence during the military dictatorship in Brazil in 1971.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sebastian Stan was named best actor in a film musical or comedy for "A Different Man," a movie about a man with facial disfigurement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our ignorance and discomfort around disability and disfigurement has to end now," Stan said. "We have to normalize it and continue to expose ourselves to it and our children." (Reuters)

    Trio appointed to oversee trustee of Nina Wang estate

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Secretary for Justice (SJ) has appointed three people to a body supervising a new trustee of the estate of the late tycoon Nina Wang.
 <br>
  <br>
  Former Monetary Authority chief Joseph Yam, former Legislative Council president Rita Fan and former Baptist University Council chairman Cheng Yan-kee were named members of the supervisory managing organisation (SMO) responsible for supervising the operation of the trustee that was appointed by the High Court.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang, who chaired developer Chinachem, died in 2007, and the legal battles for her HK$141 billion estate ensued for years.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2023, the High Court ruled that a charitable foundation founded by the firm was not suitable to be the trustee of her estate. The court later agreed with the SJ's plan to set up a new trust.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Department of Justice said it firmly believes that after the trustee's board is formed, it will do its best in managing the charitable trust, "including charity projects and a 'fund and a Chinese prize of worldwide significance similar to that of the Nobel Prize', to fulfil Mrs Wang's testamentary wishes and bring benefits to the country, including different sectors of Hong Kong society."
  <br>
  <br>
  The department stressed that local laws state that the SJ has a role in protecting charitable interests, and it therefore intervened in the estate's legal proceedings in view of significant public interest.

    'Waitlisted dental patients will be handled flexibly'
   </title>

<img alt="" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1786281_1_20250106113802.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Department of Health has assured residents that public dental clinics will handle patients under a new online system with flexibility.
 <br>
  <br>
  The department on Monday began operating an oversubscription mechanism as well as a wait-list mechanism for online bookings. People who are allocated a spot for dental services are required to arrive at the clinic by 8.30am for registration. If they fail to do so, staff will reach out to people on the waiting list.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dr Kitty Hse, the consultant in-charge of the department's dental services, said on an RTHK radio programme that staff will contact patients on the waiting list from 9:30am, and they have to arrive by 11:30am.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The people on the waiting list have mainly put that clinic as their first preference, and are 65 or over, so they get the highest priority. That means they should be living nearby or not too far from the clinic. So we expect them to come in within two hours," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But they don't have to worry... if they confirm that they'll show up but may be slightly late, our colleagues will handle it flexibly and will still offer dental services to them."
  <br>
  <br>
  Hse also pointed out the no-show rate of patients dropped from 31 percent at the start of the online registration programme last Monday to 20 percent later in the week.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on the same programme, Ivan Lin, a community organiser at the Society for Community Organisation, said some elderly people struggled with the new system.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Since registration moved online, many elderly people say they don't know if they'll be able to get a slot. In the past, they could queue overnight for one or two days and find out if they could get a spot, but now they really don't know. They don't know how many attempts it will take before they're allocated a slot," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lin urged the government to fast-track implementation of the Community Dental Support Programme which targets the underprivileged. The scheme was unveiled in last year's policy address.

    China's services sector hits seven-month high

<img alt="China’s services sector expands in December as domestic consumption picks up. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1786275_1_20250106105722.jpg&q=65">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China's services activity expanded at the fastest pace in seven months in December, buoyed by accelerated growth in domestic demand, although overseas orders declined, according to a private sector survey showed on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Caixin/S&P Global Services purchasing managers' index (PMI), which provides an independent snapshot of operating conditions in industries as such retail and tourism, rose to 52.2 in December from 51.5 the previous month.
  <br>
  <br>
  That growth pace was the fastest since May 2024, surpassing the 50-mark that separates expansion from contraction on a monthly basis.
  <br>
  <br>
  The readings also broadly align with the country's official PMI data released last week, which saw non-manufacturing activity considerably recover to 52.2 in December, after a neutral reading of 50.0 in November.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, the survey showed that new business sub-index rose to 52.7 in December from 51.8 in November. However, inflows from abroad fell for the first time since August 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  A business confidence reading remained positive but dipped to the second-lowest since March 2020, with companies worried by potential international trade disruption after Donald Trump returns to the White House.
  <br>
  <br>
  Exports could also face tariff risks under a second Trump administration. Authorities have recently introduced measures to revitalise growth. (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong China Rugby on Monday said the first Rugby Sevens tournament to be held at the new stadium in Kai Tak will be a next-level event.
 <br>
  <br>
  James Farndon, Hong Kong China Rugby CEO, made the comments after authorities said the first test event at the main stadium of the Kai Tak Sports Park went well.
  <br>
  <br>
  Farndon said his operations team is now busy with debriefing and reviewing with stakeholders ahead of the Rugby Sevens, which will be held at the end of March.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong Sevens is famous around the world, of course, as the event that every Sevens player wants to play in. And I think the first tournament in the new stadium is going to take that to an even higher level," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said athletes and fans are excited about the new state-of-the-art venue.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The players will be able to enjoy [the experience] in the much better surroundings of Kai Tak which is also more conducive to enhancing their performance slightly on the pitch, so that'll be great for the players," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Farndon noted that the stadium in Kai Tak was at 20 percent capacity during Sunday's test.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Based on the atmosphere we had, I think the fans are in for something really incredible" during the Rugby Sevens, he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also pointed out that the new South Stand will be bigger and would overlook the Hong Kong skyline.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Probably the most unique feature in the stadium is the window looking out on the Hong Kong skyline on the South Stand terrace, and that's going to make the experience even more memorable for fans."

    Police asked to take over efforts to detain Yoon

<img alt="Police officers gather near the official residence of the impeached South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol in Seoul. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1786257_1_20250106083624.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korea’s anti-corruption agency has asked police to take over efforts to detain impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol after its investigators failed to bring him to custody following an hours-long standoff with the presidential security service last week.
 <br>
  <br>
  The agency and police confirmed the discussion on Monday, hours before the one-week warrant for Yoon’s detention was to expire. Broadcaster YTN says the Corruption Investigation Office for High-ranking Officials will seek a new court warrant to extend the window for Yoon’s detention.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Seoul Western District Court had issued a warrant to detain Yoon on December 31, after he dodged several requests by investigators to appear for questioning.
  <br>
  <br>
  The anti-corruption agency, which leads a joint investigation with police and military investigators, is weighing charges of rebellion after the conservative president, apparently frustrated that his policies were blocked by a legislature dominated by the liberal opposition, declared martial law on December 3 and dispatched troops to surround the National Assembly.
  <br>
  <br>
  A handful of Yoon's die-hard supporters had camped outside his compound in the bitter cold, some holding all-night prayer sessions.
  <br>
  <br>
  They chanted "Illegal warrant is invalid" as police and media gathered outside the residence.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon also faces a separate Constitutional Court hearing that will confirm or reject his impeachment by parliament. (Agencies)

 Heavy snow and freezing rain brought widespread disruption across Europe on Sunday, particularly in the UK and Germany, with several major airports forced to suspend flights.
 <br>
  <br>
  The National Grid, which oversees the UK's electricity network, said it had been working to restore power after outages across the country. Power cuts were reported in the English cities of Birmingham, Bristol, Cardiff, and Wales.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool's John Lennon Airport and Manchester Airport had to close runways overnight, but were returning to normal on Sunday. Leeds Bradford Airport took longer to get flights back in the air.
  <br>
  <br>
  The road network was heavily impacted too on what would have been a very busy day with many families returning home from the Christmas and New Year's break, and students heading back to universities.
  <br>
  <br>
  Many roads had been pre-emptively closed by local authorities, but stranded vehicles and collisions caused disruption elsewhere.
  <br>
  <br>
  A number of UK train services were cancelled, with National Rail warning of disruption continuing into the working week.
  <br>
  <br>
  Britain's main weather forecaster, the Met Office, says sleet and snow will continue to push north on Sunday and will be heaviest in northern England and into southern Scotland.
  <br>
  <br>
  Snow and ice were also causing havoc in Germany, where a bout of wintry weather is spreading from the southwest. Authorities have issued black ice warnings for drivers and pedestrians, advising people to stay home where possible. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A dominant United States lifted their second United Cup mixed team tournament title in three years after they beat Poland 2-0, with Coco Gauff and Taylor Fritz both winning their singles matches.
 <br>
  <br>
  The top seeds in the US$10 million tournament that began with 18 nations in contention clinched the trophy when Fritz defeated Hubert Hurkacz 6-4 5-7 7-6(4), after Coco Gauff outclassed Iga Swiatek 6-4, 6-4 in Sydney.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Americans had also won the 2023 title in the inaugural edition of the tournament, which serves as a tune-up event for the Australian Open Grand Slam.
  <br>
  <br>
  With the second singles contest locked at one set apiece, Fritz raised his level at 3-3 in the tiebreak of the decider to see off Hurkacz and spark huge celebrations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gauff earlier stepped up preparations for the year's first major that begins next Sunday with a second successive win over world number two Swiatek in a blockbuster showdown that gave fans at the Ken Rosewall Arena their money's worth.
  <br>
  <br>
  The world number three, who beat Swiatek en route to the WTA Finals title last season, squandered a 2-0 lead in the first set but battled back from there to gain the upper hand in the match as her opponent counted the costs of 19 unforced errors.
  <br>
  <br>
  In another high-octane set that followed, Gauff recovered a break to level at 4-4 and went on to secure the win that ensured she ended her singles campaign at the tournament unbeaten. (Reuters)

    US hit by massive winter storm

<div class="itemFullText">
 A blast of snow, ice, wind and plunging temperatures stirred up dangerous travel conditions in parts of the central US on Sunday, as a disruptive winter storm brought the possibility of the “heaviest snowfall in a decade” to some areas.
 <br>
  <br>
  Snow and ice blanketed major roadways in nearly all of Kansas, western Nebraska and parts of Indiana, where the state's National Guard was activated to help any motorists who were stuck.
  <br>
  <br>
  At least 20 centimetres of snow were expected, particularly north of Interstate 70, as the National Weather Service issued winter storm warnings for Kansas and Missouri, where blizzard conditions were reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  The warning extended to New Jersey for Monday and into early Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  “For locations in this region that receive the highest snow totals, it may be the heaviest snowfall in at least a decade,” the weather service said early Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  About 63 million people in the US were under some kind of winter weather advisory, watch or warning on Sunday, according to Bob Oravec with the National Weather Service.
  <br>
  <br>
  The polar vortex of ultra-cold air usually spins around the North Pole.  People in the US, Europe and Asia experience its intense cold when the vortex escapes and stretches south.
  <br>
  <br>
  Studies show a fast-warming Arctic is partly to blame for the increasing frequency of the polar vortex extending its icy grip.
  <br>
  <br>
  Roughly 25 centimetres of snow had fallen in parts of the state, with snow and sleet totals predicted to top 35 centimetres for parts of Kansas and northern Missouri.
  <br>
  <br>
  Parts of upstate New York saw 0.9 metres or more of snow from a lake effect event expected to last until late Sunday afternoon.
  <br>
  <br>
  The storm was then forecast to move into the Ohio Valley and reach the Mid-Atlantic states on Sunday and Monday, with a hard freeze expected as far south as Florida. (AP)

    Dembélé powers PSG to 3rd straight French Super Cup

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ousmane Dembélé scored a stoppage-time winner as Paris Saint-Germain beat Monaco 1-0 to win the Champions Trophy for the third consecutive season.
 <br>
  <br>
  The France winger was unmarked at the back post to meet a low cross from the left by Fabián Ruiz in the second minute of added time.
  <br>
  <br>
  PSG won the trophy, also known as the French Super Cup, for a record-extending 13th overall. PSG won the league and cup double last season, with Monaco finishing second in the league.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The result reflects our domination,” PSG coach Luis Enrique said, while Monaco coach Adi Hütter conceded PSG played better.
  <br>
  <br>
  “A goal in the last minute always feels like a knife in the back,” Hütter said. “PSG deserved to win if we're being honest, they had more chances.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The match took place at Stadium 974 in Doha, Qatar, with PSG owned by Qatar-based QSI since 2011.
  <br>
  <br>
  Désiré Doué hit the crossbar early on for PSG and Monaco goalkeeper Philipp Köhn made several saves.
  <br>
  <br>
  Monaco improved after the break and hit the post through Eliesse Ben Seghir and Brazilian defender Vanderson.
  <br>
  <br>
  Although Köhn made a fine save to deny Achraf Hakimi in the 74th minute, he failed to properly read Ruiz's cross and Monaco missed out on winning the trophy for the first time since 2000. (AP)

    Diallo earns Man Utd thrilling 2-2 draw with Liverpool

<img alt="Manchester United's Amad Diallo celebrates after scoring his side's second goal. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1786247_1_20250106054913.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Amad Diallo came back to haunt Liverpool with a late equaliser that secured a 2-2 draw for Manchester United against the Premier League leaders.
 <br>
  <br>
  The forward turned home Alejandro Garnacho’s cross in the 80th minute at Anfield after Mohamed Salah’s penalty had looked like giving Liverpool the win.
  <br>
  <br>
  Diallo struck at the end of extra time as United beat Liverpool 4-3 in a dramatic FA Cup clash last season and hit a 90th-minute winner against Manchester City last month.
  <br>
  <br>
  His goal was only worth a point on this occasion, but it halted United's four-game losing run and prevented fierce rival Liverpool from opening up an eight-point lead at the top of the standings.
  <br>
  <br>
  United head coach Ruben Amorim, however, was still unhappy.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It’s a point, a deserved point – but it’s just one point," he said. "We should get mad. Today we should be really disappointed."
  <br>
  <br>
  United led through Lisandro Martínez’s strike in the 52nd, but Cody Gakpo levelled seven minutes later. Salah fired Liverpool ahead from the spot in the 70th after Matthijs de Ligt handled in the box.
  <br>
  <br>
  The draw saw United move up to 13th in the standings.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool missed the chance to open up an eight-point lead on second-place Arsenal, which drew 1-1 with Brighton on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Reds are still six points clear at the top with a game in hand.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Over the whole game we created more chances than them; a point feels like it’s something to take, but when I watch the game back I would hope for more,” Liverpool head coach Arne Slot said.
  <br>
  <br>
  United is without a win at Anfield since 2016 – a run that spans nine matches in all competitions. But it was a first point for Ruben Amorim's team since the 2-1 win against Manchester City on December 15.
  <br>
  <br>
  It could have been better for United, with Harry Maguire firing over from close range deep into added time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool had its chances to win as well, with Virgil van Dijk firing a header straight at United goalkeeper Andre Onana late on.
  <br>
  <br>
  With 39 top-flight titles between them, this was the latest meeting between English football's two greatest teams.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool has the chance to equal United’s record total of 20 league crowns this season and could have taken a firmer hold on the title race with a win in front of its home fans.
  <br>
  <br>
  But United produced a performance that confounded its recent form, which has even had Amorim admitting his team could face a relegation fight.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We’ve been fairly criticised because the position in the table says it all," United captain Bruno Fernandes said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I think it’s a fair result, both teams played really good football. But we can’t be satisfied," he added. "I’m really upset, because if we can show this against Liverpool – why can’t we do this every week?”
  <br>
  <br>
  Diallo and Rasmus Hojlund had chances in the first half before Martínez lashed a left-footed shot into the roof of the net from a narrow angle.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alexis Mac Allister had seen Liverpool’s best effort in the first half saved by Onana, but the keeper could do nothing to stop Gakpo’s powerful shot after cutting onto his right foot in the box.
  <br>
  <br>
  A VAR review led to referee Michael Oliver awarding Liverpool a penalty after the ball struck De Ligt’s arm and Salah fired low to score his 21st goal of the season. He has scored 13 goals against United – more than any other player in Premier League history.
  <br>
  <br>
  But it wasn’t enough to earn Liverpool the win after substitute Garnacho cut the ball back for Diallo to convert.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The way we conceded the two goals was unacceptable, lazy and careless," Van Dijk said. "It shouldn’t happen.” (AP)

    Muller downs Nishikori to claim Hong Kong Open crown

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Frenchman Alexandre Muller on Sunday earned a major confidence boost as he lifted his first-career ATP Tour finals crown after downing Japan's Kei Nishikori 2-6, 6-1, 6-3 to win the Hong Kong Tennis Open final.
 <br>
  <br>
  Muller, 27, fell behind early as Nishikori claimed the opening set.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he refused to go down quietly, dominating the second and third to deny the 35-year-old Japanese of his 13th tour-level championship in an intense showdown lasting one hour and 43 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm very happy to get a title here in Hong Kong," Muller told reporters in a post-match interview. "It's been a long and tough week for me, losing the first set in all the matches – so I'm just very happy about my first title."
  <br>
  <br>
  The victory caps off a stellar week of play for Muller, who is now projected to rise eleven places in the world rankings to a career-high 56th as he gears up to face Czech Jakub Mensik in the ASB Classic in Auckland on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked how he would celebrate his maiden trophy, Muller kept it light-hearted.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm not the kind of guy who would go to nightclubs and stuff like this," he joked.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Maybe just a light dinner with my team, as I got my flight to Auckland tomorrow. That's tennis life – enjoying your title for a few hours before we go again."
  <br>
  <br>
  Nishikori was competing in first final in six years. Speaking to reporters after the match, the world number 106 cited tiredness as one of the main reasons for the way he played in the second and third sets, but remained pleased in his overall performance nonetheless ahead of the Australian Open come January 12.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Very disappointed in how I played in the second and third," Nishikori said. "I think there are more chances to win a few matches in Australia, but I am still on the way."
  <br>
  <br>
  "I can play good in some moments, but I still got ups-and-downs so I got to keep working on it," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier in the day, Dutchman Sander Arends and Briton Luke Johnson won the men's doubles.
  <br>
  <br>
  They dispatched world number eight Andrey Rublev and Karen Khachanov from Russia, 7-5, 4-6, 10-7 in an hour and 33 minutes.

 A 36-year-old man died on Sunday after reportedly fainting and falling backwards while on an escalator in Sha Tin.
 <br>
  <br>
  Officers said the victim's mother reported the incident at Sha Kok Estate at around 2pm.
  <br>
  <br>
  The man was reportedly going up on the escalator connecting a wet market and a shopping mall.
  <br>
  <br>
  And as he fell backwards, he hit a 65-year-old woman who suffered a minor injury.
  <br>
  <br>

<img alt="Rosanna Law says the Hong Kong Coliseum could be repositioned for entertainment. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1786214_1_20250105172615.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government said some of its venues could focus on entertainment after the opening of more sports facilities.
 <br>
  <br>
  Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism Rosanna Law said on a TVB programme that the positioning of the existing public venues can be different after new facilities such as Kai Tak Sports Park and the East Kowloon Cultural Centre are opened.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some venues, like the Hong Kong Coliseum, could focus on holding entertainment shows instead of sports events in future, Law said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “In the past, some people would say the Hong Kong Coliseum should give sports events priority. But now we have Kai Tak Sports Parks and other new facilities. Can we think of different positioning on venues, such as some places are mainly for sports events while some for entertainment?” Law said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last year, nearly 60 percent of events held at the Hong Kong Coliseum were concerts, more than 20 percent were sports events, while the rest were activities like graduation ceremonies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Law also said the government will finalise the recommendations on stage construction regulation in the first quarter of this year, after a giant LED screen fell and injured dancers during the MIRROR concert in July 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said the recommendations will mainly apply to the Hong Kong Coliseum and Queen Elizabeth Stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some rules will also apply to Kai Tak Sports Park.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A rugby tournament featuring university students was held at the Kai Tak Sports Park on Sunday, the first test event at the main stadium there.
 <br>
  <br>
  Officials described the test event as generally smooth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Around 10,000 spectators were expected inside the 50,000-strong venue, with free seating and multiple entry and exit allowed.
  <br>
  <br>
  A number of spectators were unaware of the rule that water bottles were not allowed inside the venue, and had to put them away for temporary storage.
  <br>
  <br>
  A player from Hang Seng University said he's happy with the experience both on and off the pitch.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's good because this is a standard-sized pitch with real grass. We always play on artificial grass, which hurts more when you fall," he told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The facilities are also much better at Kai Tak. Say at Kings Park Sports Ground, the changing rooms aren't as big. Here, every team has its own changing room. There's ice for cold therapy, and there's an area for each team member."
  <br>
  <br>
  A spectator, who works in public relations, said he's glad to make his first visit to the state-of-the-art venue along with many other members of the public, even though the atmosphere at the test event may not be as good as that at the Rugby Sevens.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is a really nice venue, different from the Hong Kong Stadium. When you come inside Kai Tak Stadium, you feel that Hong Kong has a world-class stadium. I've been to similar stadiums in other major cities, and now we have our very own," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Security minister Chris Tang and Sports Commissioner George Choi were among the officials on hand to inspect the operations, and they found the arrangements generally smooth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Going forward, Tang said the authorities will host three more tests involving at least 65,000 people for the main stadium and other venues at the Sports Park.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said various scenarios will be simulated to get officials ready.
  <br>
  <br>
  The rugby tournament involved 17 teams, with the games lasting for the whole day.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Kai Tak main stadium will host the Rugby Sevens in late March.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Runners who took part in this year’s Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge Half Marathon said they were happy with the arrangements after issues were raised in the event’s inaugural edition in 2023.
 <br>
  <br>
  Around 7,000 people took part in Sunday's race, which covered the local section of the 55-kilometre mega-bridge.
  <br>
  <br>
  The race for the challenge group of runners started at 7.15am, and the remaining three non-challenge groups began in batches about half an hour later.
  <br>
  <br>
  A runner from Yunnan, surnamed Jian, said she previously ran in the plateau and wanted to experience something different.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Running here is totally different. You're on the bridge and over the sea, while elsewhere it's just road running. I think the arrangement is pretty good. The volunteers are really enthusiastic and there are clear signs,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some runners who participated in the November 2023 race complained about not being offered enough sports drinks or snacks, as well as the lack of toilets.
  <br>
  <br>
  This year’s race is designated a Gold Label Road Race by World Athletics.
  <br>
  <br>
  Many elite marathon runners took part, including Japan’s Yuki Kawauchi, who won the 2018 Boston Marathon as an amateur runner. “I'm happy to see so many runners cheering for me,” he spoke through an interpreter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ethiopian Milkesa Mengesha came first in the challenge group in just over an hour, while Grace Nawowuna from Kenya took the women’s title.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chong See-yeung and Virginia Lo were the first SAR man and woman to finish the race.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chong, who also ran in 2023, said the facilities, including the toilets, were much better compared with the previous race.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that he was thrilled and honoured to be able to run alongside Kawauchi.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I feel very inspired because he is a role model for me. As an Asian athlete with a larger build similar to mine, he resonates with me. He started as a recreational runner and has achieved results comparable to, or even better than, professional athletes. This serves as a great motivation for us,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lo, meanwhile, was about 40 seconds off her personal best. She said the overall experience was great, though the uphill tunnel section was the toughest part.
  <br>
  <br>
  Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism Rosanna Law called the start of the challenge group race.
  <br>
  <br>
  She and other officials, including justice chief Paul Lam and security minister Chris Tang, took part in a special 2-kilometre race.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Midway through the race I noticed the sunrise is magnificent. So, it’s really half sports, half tourism,” Law said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The Hong Kong, China Association of Athletics Affiliates also told me that for future large-scale events, they plan to invite not just elite runners from abroad but also those who are overseas travellers. When they come, there’s no reason to just run the marathon – they'll likely stay a night and spend money. I totally support this idea.”
  <br>
  <br>
  According to the Hong Kong, China Association of Athletics Affiliates, 19 runners said they felt unwell and suffered injuries and three were sent to hospital for treatment as of 11am.

<img alt="Lamar Jackson of the Baltimore Ravens finishes the regular season with 4,172 yards passing and 915 yards rushing, the best combined record for an NFL quarterback. File photo: Tommy Gilligan-Imagn Images via Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1786202_1_20250105140836.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lamar Jackson threw two touchdown passes and the Baltimore Ravens won the AFC North for the second straight season, clinching the division with a 35-10 victory over the Cleveland Browns.
 <br>
  <br>
  In the other NFL game on Saturday, the Cincinnati Bengals kept their slim playoff hopes alive with a 19-17 win over the Pittsburgh Steelers.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Ravens (12-5) will open the playoffs at home against either the Los Angeles Chargers or Steelers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Baltimore was two games behind the Steelers in the division before winning its final four to finish on top.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jackson threw TD passes to Mark Andrews in the second quarter and Rashod Bateman in the third, finishing a spectacular statistical season that might be good enough to earn him a third MVP award.
  <br>
  <br>
  He finished the season with 4,172 yards passing, 41 touchdown passes and only four interceptions. He became the first quarterback to reach 4,000 yards passing with 40 TD passes and four or fewer interceptions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jackson also finished the season with 915 yards rushing, becoming the first to throw for 4,000 yards and rush for at least 800. His passer rating of 119.6 wasn't quite enough to break the single-season record of 122.5 held by Aaron Rodgers.
  <br>
  <br>
  The biggest concern coming out of this game for the Ravens was the health of Pro Bowl receiver Zay Flowers, who left in the second quarter with a right knee injury.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cleveland (3-14) ended a dreadful season with six straight losses. Both Bailey Zappe and Dorian Thompson-Robinson took snaps at quarterback in the finale. Neither could move the ball much, and Zappe had an interception returned 26 yards for a touchdown by rookie Nate Wiggins for the game's first points.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Pittsburgh, Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow passed for 277 yards and a touchdown and Cade York kicked four field goals in Cincinnati's win.
  <br>
  <br>
  Burrow also threw an interception and his NFL record streak of consecutive games with at least 250 yards passing and three touchdowns came to an end. But he did enough to propel the Bengals (9-8) to their fifth straight win and keep them in the mix until the season's final day.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cincinnati will earn the seventh seed in the AFC if Denver loses to Kansas City and Miami either loses to or ties the New York Jets on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pittsburgh is assured of playing next week despite a four-game losing streak. The Steelers will be the fifth seed if the Chargers lose at Las Vegas. If the Chargers win, Pittsburgh will be the sixth seed and travel to rival Baltimore in the first round. (AP)

<img alt="Paul Chan says Hong Kong needs to maintain its low and simple tax regime to stay competitive. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1786199_1_20250105134449.jpg&q=20">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government will focus on cutting expenditure to tackle a fiscal deficit, Financial Secretary Paul Chan said.
 <br>
  <br>
  As the deficit for the current fiscal year is expected to reach just under HK$100 billion, Chan wrote in his weekly blog that public works projects will be prioritised, with the Northern Metropolis as well as housing and economic development projects getting resources first.
  <br>
  <br>
  For other infrastructure projects, the government will raise capital by issuing bonds and through public-private partnership, he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Apart from further controlling the spending of various departments, Chan said the government will review certain funding schemes that could affect the public coffers.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It is inevitable for us to look into some funding schemes as their expenditure growth will bring significant long-term impact to the public finance,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The finance chief said various departments will be asked to further control their spending, including reallocating resources and prioritising works to better meet the needs of society.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Increasing revenue and reducing expenditure is the key to improve public finance,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Our strategy will focus on cost-cutting, in which we will control the increase in recurrent expenditures, under the premise of maintaining and improving public service.”
  <br>
  <br>
  On ways to boost revenue, Chan stressed the need for the government to stick to a low and simple tax system to order to maintain Hong Kong's competitive edge.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also said officials will follow the user pays principle, so as to minimise the impact to the average people.

    User pays principle can help boost revenue: minister

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Christopher Hui, said on Sunday that the user pays principle is among the factors at play when officials consider ways to widen the tax base.
 <br>
  <br>
  Amid a multi-year budget deficit, Financial Secretary Paul Chan said on Saturday that officials were considering having high-income earners pay more tax, in line with the principle of having people pay more if they can afford to.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hui stressed after attending a Commercial Radio programme that officials are considering ways to find new sources of revenue and cut expenses at the same time.
  <br>
  <br>
  "On the one hand, we'll consider how these measures affect the people. And we'll also look at adopting the principle of user pays, such that we can achieve a stable fiscal management in a sustainable manner," the minister said.
  <br>
  <br>
  During the show, Hui noted that Hong Kong is capable of embracing the world as shown in the government's drive to expand into new markets.
  <br>
  <br>
  For example, he said Indonesia and other countries have said they plan to issue bonds in the SAR, while some firms had expressed interest in setting up family offices.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hui said Hong Kong's status as the country's international financial centre will become more prominent going forward, thanks to an increase in cross-border trading of financial products.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister added that as mainland firms become more competitive globally, the SAR can help them expand overseas by providing them with professional services and serving as a fund-raising platform.

    31 arrested over investment 'scams'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Sunday said they smashed a syndicate that allegedly made use of deepfake technology to conduct investment scams.
 <br>
  <br>
  Officers raided two locations in neighbouring industrial buildings in Kowloon Bay last week and arrested 31 people, aged between 20 and 34.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police said the total amount of losses exceeded HK$34 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  They said the syndicate had been operating for more than a year, and the victims were mainly from outside of Hong Kong, such as Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia and the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fung Pui-kei, superintendent with the Commercial Crime Bureau, said the syndicate made use of deepfake technology to build relationships online.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They also make use of the new technology, like AI face-swapping technology, to [pretend] to be some good-looking ladies and gentlemen to induce potential victims, gain their trust and develop into romance relationships in order to commence the romance scams," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Once gaining their trust, the syndicate persuaded people to send money to a fake investment platform, police said.
  <br>
  <br>
  During the raids, officers seized HK$10 million worth of suspected criminal gains, including cash, handbags and luxury watches.
  <br>
  <br>
  Most of those arrested said they were unemployed, while some were university students.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officers said five of those held, among them core syndicate members, have been charged with conspiracy to defraud. They'll appear at Eastern Court on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The other suspects were released on bail.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last October, the force took down a syndicate operating in a similar way, and police are trying to determine if the two cases were connected.

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Joe Biden bestowed the Presidential Medal of Freedom to 19 of the most famous names in politics, sports, entertainment, civil rights, LGBTQ+ advocacy and science on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Former US secretary of state Hillary Clinton received a standing ovation as she received her medal. Clinton was accompanied to the event by her husband former president Bill Clinton, daughter Chelsea Clinton and grandchildren. Democratic philanthropist George Soros and actor-director Denzel Washington were also awarded the nation’s highest civilian honour in a White House ceremony.
  <br>
  <br>
  “For the final time as president I have the honour bestowing the Medal of Freedom, our nation’s highest civilian honour, on a group of extraordinary, truly extraordinary people, who gave their sacred effort, their sacred effort, to shape the culture and the cause of America,” Biden said.
