    South Korea slaps travel bans on more top officials

<img alt="Protesters tear a banner representing the flag of the ruling People Power Party as they attend a rally calling for the impeachment of South Korean President Yoon. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1782840_1_20241210150302.jpg&q=55">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korean authorities banned more top officials from leaving the country on Tuesday in the wake of President Yoon Suk-yeol's bungled attempt to impose martial law.
 <br>
  <br>
  A day after Yoon himself was hit with a travel ban, his party was forging a "resignation roadmap" that reportedly could see him step down in February or March before fresh elections.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon suspended civilian rule a week ago and sent special forces and helicopters to parliament, before lawmakers forced him to rescind the decree in a country assumed to be a stable democracy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Investigators are probing the president and a cabal of allies -- many from the same school -- for alleged insurrection over the sequence of extraordinary events.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Tuesday Cho Ji-ho, commissioner general of the Korean National Police Agency, and two other top police officials became the latest to be banned from foreign travel, the Yonhap news agency reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  Already confined to South Korean territory are the former defence and interior ministers, martial law commander General Park An-su and defence counterintelligence commander Yeo In-hyung.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kim Yong-hyun, the former defence minister, was detained on Sunday and late on Monday prosecutors filed a formal arrest warrant against him.
  <br>
  <br>
  Charges included "engaging in critical duties during an insurrection" and "abuse of authority to obstruct the exercise of rights".
  <br>
  <br>
  A Seoul court will hold a hearing later on Tuesday to rule on whether to issue the warrant for Kim, the first court decision to be made related to the martial law chaos.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kim issued contrite comments Tuesday saying that "all responsibility for this situation lies solely with me".
  <br>
  <br>
  Kim "deeply apologised" to the South Korean people and said that his subordinates were "merely following my orders and fulfilling their assigned duties", in a statement made through his lawyers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon narrowly survived an impeachment effort in parliament on Saturday as tens of thousands braved freezing temperatures to call for his removal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Civic groups held further candlelight vigils across the country on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The motion failed after members of Yoon's own People Power Party (PPP) walked out of parliament, depriving it of the necessary two-thirds majority.
  <br>
  <br>
  The PPP says that in exchange Yoon has agreed to hand power to the prime minister and party chief, prompting the opposition to accuse it of a "second coup".
  <br>
  <br>
  Local media reported on Tuesday that the PPP will announce a "resignation road map" soon in order to head off a new impeachment motion, which the opposition wants to put before lawmakers on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The party's task force was also reportedly reviewing two options, including for Yoon to resign in February with an April election, or to step down in March with a vote in May. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping said on Tuesday that a trade war with the United States would result in "no winners", ahead of next month's inauguration of US president-elect Donald Trump.
 <br>
  <br>
  During a meeting with heads of major international economic organisations in Beijing, Xi said he hopes the US will work with China to push bilateral relations towards a steady, healthy and sustainable direction.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Tariff wars, trade wars and sci-tech wars go against the trend of history and the laws of economics, and there will be no winners," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The president said Beijing is willing to maintain dialogue, expand cooperation and manage differences with Washington.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has threatened to raise tariffs on goods from China, Canada and Mexico after he takes office, raising fears of a trade war.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi also said China has full confidence in achieving this year's economic growth target and in continuing to play the role of the world's largest engine of economic growth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing has set a 2024 GDP growth target of around 5 percent. (Xinhua and agencies)

<img alt="Official figures show Chinese exports grew 6.7 percent in November from a year earlier. File photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1782832_1_20241210141802.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chinese exports rose in November at a slower rate than expected while imports shrunk further, official data showed on Tuesday, reinforcing the need for more support a day after top officials pledged to bolster growth.
 <br>
  <br>
  Outbound shipments grew 6.7 percent last month, compared with a 12.7 percent rise in October.
  <br>
  <br>
  Exports grew 5.4 percent on-year in January-November.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China's exports were perhaps the biggest upside surprise for the economy in 2024," wrote Lynn Song, Chief Economist for Greater China at ING.
  <br>
  <br>
  This is "one of the main reasons China is set to achieve its 'around five percent' growth target" for this year, he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some analysts say that the latest setbacks are likely to be temporary.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We expect exports to accelerate again in the coming months, supported by gains in export competitiveness and exporters front-running tariffs,” Huang Zichun of Capital Economics said in a note.
  <br>
  <br>
  Others pointed out that the recent spike in exports could be down to companies ramping up stockpiles amid fears of another China-US trade war when Donald Trump takes the White House next month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, imports shrank 3.9 percent, their worst performance in nine months.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xing Zhaopeng, senior China strategist at ANZ, attributed the poor import figure to falling commodity prices.
  <br>
  <br>
  China's trade surplus grew to US$97.44 billion last month, up from US$95.72 billion in October. (Agencies)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong is embracing digital transformation in the insurance sector and taking steps to address growing challenges brought by climate change, Chief Executive John Lee said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The CE was speaking at the Asian Insurance Forum, which drew more than 400 professionals in person and 1,800 online participants this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee said the SAR is committed to supporting insurtech development through various initiatives, including the Insurtech Sandbox and Open API Framework.
  <br>
  <br>
  "These initiatives allow insurance providers to experiment with new business models, explore digital products and enhance customer experience in ways that were previously unimaginable," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong's fast-evolving insurtech business is helping the industry embrace artificial intelligence, data analytics and blockchain, bringing tangible improvements to businesses as well as consumers."
  <br>
  <br>
  The CE added that the SAR is "at the forefront" in developing solutions to combat climate change with measures such as insurance-linked securities and catastrophe bonds.
  <br>
  <br>
  "To date, Hong Kong has issued five catastrophe bonds, raising more than US$700 million for protection against typhoons, earthquakes and other natural disasters. Technological innovation will be a key enabler of insurance industry growth," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong is home to about 160 authorised insurers, including six of the world's top 10 insurance firms, Lee added.

    Nearly 200 dead in Haiti massacre

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Nearly 200 people in Haiti were killed in brutal weekend violence reportedly orchestrated against voodoo practitioners, with the government on Monday condemning a massacre of "unbearable cruelty".
 <br>
  <br>
  The killings in the capital Port-au-Prince were overseen by a powerful gang leader convinced that his son's illness was caused by followers of the religion, according to civil organisation the Committee for Peace and Development (CPD).
  <br>
  <br>
  It was the latest act of extreme violence by powerful gangs that control most of the capital city in the Caribbean country mired for decades in political instability, natural disasters and other woes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He decided to cruelly punish all elderly people and voodoo practitioners who, in his imagination, would be capable of sending a bad spell on his son," a statement from the Haiti-based group said.
  <br>
  <br>
  UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres condemned the "horrific" violence, which his spokesman said left at least 184 people, including 127 elderly men and women, dead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Calling the bloody episode an "act of barbarity, of unbearable cruelty," the office of Prime Minister Alix Didier Fils-Aime said "this monstrous crime constitutes a direct attack on humanity".
  <br>
  <br>
  Both the CPD and UN said that the killings took place in the capital's western coastal neighborhood of Cite Soleil.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The gang's soldiers were responsible for identifying victims in their homes to take them to the chief's stronghold to be executed," the CPD said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Reliable sources within the community report that more than a hundred people were massacred, their bodies mutilated and burned in the street," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Haiti has suffered from decades of instability but the situation escalated in February when armed groups launched coordinated attacks in the capital to overthrow then-prime minister Ariel Henry.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gangs now control 80 percent of the city. Despite a Kenyan-led police support mission, backed by the United States and UN, violence has continued to soar.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Ocean Park chairman Paulo Pong on Tuesday said 10-minute limits placed on visits to the giant pandas An An and Ke Ke helped prevent overcrowding.
 <br>
  <br>
  Thousands of people flocked to the park when the pandas made their public debut on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The crowd control measures were taken after considering the visitor experience and safety concerns. They're necessary because the exhibit can't hold too many people," Pong said on an RTHK radio programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With regard to the 10-minute visiting time, we looked at other places and this isn't too short. Some places only allow visitors to stay for three or four minutes."
  <br>
  <br>
  Pong also said the public were able to meet the pandas sooner than originally expected, as the animals were adopting very well to their new habitat and are very energetic.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that twin panda cubs at the park are in good shape, with the heavier male starting to develop its baby teeth.
  <br>
  <br>
  The pair could be able to meet the public from around Lunar New Year, Pong said.

    West Ham beat Wolves to ease pressure on Lopetegui

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Jarrod Bowen eased the pressure on West Ham boss Julen Lopetegui as his superb strike sealed a vital 2-1 win that pushed Wolves manager Gary O'Neil closer to the sack on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a showdown dubbed "El Sackico" due to the intense scrutiny surrounding the futures of Lopetegui and O'Neil, it was the Hammers chief who earned some much-needed breathing space thanks to Bowen's moment of magic.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bowen bagged a priceless winner in the second half at the London Stadium, just moments after Wolves defender Matt Doherty had cancelled out Tomas Soucek's opener.
  <br>
  <br>
  West Ham's first win in three games lifted them nine points clear of the relegation zone, while second bottom Wolves remain four points adrift of safety after their 10th defeat in 15 league matches.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the aftermath of last week's 3-1 loss at Leicester, Lopetegui was reported to have survived a board meeting about his position.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the Spaniard, who replaced David Moyes in the close-season, must build on this valuable victory over the team he managed in the 2022-23 season before he can fully relax.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I don't talk about noise, I talk about football. If you ask me about football, I will. A win is always good for me," Lopetegui said. "The fans have supported us a lot through the bad times. I'm happy for them."
  <br>
  <br>
  O'Neil, who played for West Ham from 2011 to 2013, heard Wolves fans call for his dismissal during their 4-0 thrashing at Everton on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Now he will anxiously await the verdict from the Wolves board on his future, which looks bleak after the latest blow to Wolves' survival hopes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "An awful lot of decisions went against us in a big game, big moments. You need some of them to go your way but they didn't," O'Neil said.
  <br>

  "I'm not concerned," he added. "People above me are supportive, but the supporters want to be successful – I understand I have to take responsibility."

  West Ham were rocked at the weekend by the news that their Jamaica striker Michail Antonio had been in a serious car crash that left him needing surgery on a lower limb fracture.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 34-year-old had to be cut out of his Ferrari following the accident, with Lopetegui admitting it was a "miracle" he survived.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It wasn't an easy week. We dedicate the victory to Michail," Lopetegui said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hammers fans held a minute's applause for Antonio in the ninth minute to match his shirt number. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong, China men's football team will kick off the final round of their campaign for the 2027 AFC Asian Cup when they travel to Singapore in March following Monday’s draw for qualification to the continental showpiece in Saudi Arabia.
 <br>
  <br>
  The SAR were drawn in Group C, which also features India and Bangladesh. Only the winners from each of the six groups earn a spot.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong will begin their qualifying campaign by playing Singapore away on March 25, and India on June 10.
  <br>
  <br>
  These qualifiers will be the final chance for 24 teams to secure the final six spots, with the SAR being drawn in a tight and extremely competitive group.
  <br>
  <br>
  Singapore are currently ranked 161 in the world, and are also gearing up to take on Thailand, Malaysia, Cambodia, and Timor-Leste in the Asean Championships being played across Southeast Asia this month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, India – who qualified for the 2023 edition of the AFC Asian Cup in Qatar but finished bottom of their group – are ranked 127th.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bangladesh, ranked 185th, has also shown rapid improvement in their level of play in recent times.

<img alt="The Hang Seng Index rose more than three percent in the opening minutes. File photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1782809_1_20241210094938.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong and Shanghai stocks soared at the open on Tuesday after China's leadership said it would take a more "relaxed" approach to monetary policy.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Hang Seng Index jumped 3.2 percent, or 655 points, to 21,070, and the Shanghai Composite Index climbed 2.6 percent, or 87 points, to 3,490.
  <br>
  <br>
  This followed Beijing's announcement of a looser monetary policy and a more proactive fiscal policy after a Politburo meeting on Monday, marking a shift from the country's rather prudent policy stance since 2011.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alain Groshens, the CEO of SystematicEdge, told RTHK's Money Talk programme that he believes the move will be a game changer.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China is getting ready for the US to impose tariffs on China. There could be an additional maybe 10 percent, maybe up to 60 percent," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So the objective of these measures is really to boost Chinese domestic consumption, but also to stabilise the real estate market and the capital market... There will be a strong impact on the Chinese equity market."
  <br>
  <br>
  Groshens added that he expects China to achieve its growth target next year thanks to the new fiscal stimulus measures, projecting around 4.5 percent growth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Richard Harris, CEO of Port Shelter Investment Management, told the same programme that he thinks China will focus more on fiscal policy and government spending going forward.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think rates are reasonably low, but I think they will really try and focus more on the fiscal side, how government directs its spending," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But the one thing that international observers have been critical of is the fact that a lot of this stimulus hasn't gone down to the consumer itself. I think people would quite like to see consumption vouchers, you know how much we love them in Hong Kong."
  <br>
  <br>
  Harris said while Beijing has been trying to stimulate the economy for over a year, many investors have been "asleep at the wheel" in noticing these efforts.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said he hopes to see more direct support for people living in poverty, and consumption vouchers to boost domestic spending.
  <br>

    Suspect in US insurance exec killing in custody: NYPD

<div class="itemFullText">
 A 26-year-old man was arrested Monday over the targeted killing of a health insurance executive on the streets of New York, with investigators charging him with possession of fake IDs and a gun.
 <br>
  <br>
  Investigators continued to interrogate Luigi Mangione in connection with last week's brazen murder, which triggered a nationwide manhunt and global headlines.
  <br>
  <br>
  He arrived at a Pennsylvania court wearing a dark sweatshirt on Monday evening and was led inside by Altoona police flanked by NYPD detectives where he was arraigned, broadcasters showed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mangione is next due to appear in court on December 23.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro said that murder charges in New York state would follow, telling a media briefing "we do not kill people in cold blood to resolve policy differences or express a viewpoint."
  <br>
  <br>
  Police have not confirmed reports the words "delay" and "deny" – language used by insurers to reject claims – were written on casings found at the scene, hinting at a possible political motive for the crime.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mangione was apprehended by officers following a tip from staff at an Altoona McDonald's branch, where he was found wearing a mask and a beanie while using a laptop, and gave officers a fake ID, charging documents show.
  <br>
  <br>
  They then searched him and found what police called a "ghost gun" capable of firing 9MM rounds and equipped with a suppressor that could have been made on a 3D printer.
  <br>
  <br>
  When officers asked if he had been to New York recently, Mangione "became quiet and started to shake," according to the criminal complaint.
  <br>
  <br>
  One of the fake IDs found was that used to check in to a Manhattan hostel ahead of the attack, discovered alongside a document that spoke to Mangione's "motivation and mindset", New York police said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mangione was born and raised in Maryland, studied at the Ivy League University of Pennsylvania, and had been living in Hawaii ahead of the killing.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He matches the description of the identification we've been looking for. He's also in possession of several items that we believe will connect him to this incident," said New York mayor Eric Adams.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police told reporters that Mangione possessed material that suggested he had "ill-will towards corporate America". (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Bayern Munich captain Manuel Neuer will likely not play again in 2024, coach Vincent Kompany said ahead of Tuesday's clash with Ukrainian side Shakhtar Donetsk.
 <br>
  <br>
  "He's got a broken rib, which means he probably won't play again this year," Kompany said. "What's important is that it heals now – hopefully from the start of January we'll have him back, but for now it's too early."
  <br>
  <br>
  Kompany confirmed Neuer broke his rib in a collision with Bayer Leverkusen's Jeremie Frimpong on Tuesday, for which the goalie also picked up the first red card of his 866-game career.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bayern are missing several first-team players as an injury crisis sweeps through the club.
  <br>
  <br>
  Neuer, Harry Kane, Kingsley Coman, Alphonso Davies, Joao Palhinha, Serge Gnabry, Josip Stanisic, Hiroki Ito and Mathys Tel are all on the injured list, while back-up 'keeper Sven Ulreich is out for personal reasons.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're missing a lot of players, but I think we've come through well so far," Kompany said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Neuer's absence means Bayern's third-choice goalie, Daniel Peretz, will start between the sticks.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Israel goalkeeper will play his third game for Bayern having made his club debut off the bench after Neuer's sending off in the 1-0 German Cup last 16 loss to Leverkusen.
  <br>
  <br>
  The six-time Champions League winners sit in 13th spot on the Champions League table after five matches, after three home wins and away losses to Barcelona and Aston Villa.
  <br>
  <br>
  A win against Shakhtar would help Bayern's bid to finish in the top eight and avoid an additional playoff round. (AFP)

<img alt="Wall Street finished lower, as Nvidia led the tech sector lower, and investors are also nervous ahead of inflation data. File photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1782786_1_20241210052146.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The main US indices finished lower on Monday, fueled by a decline in AI leader Nvidia that weighed on tech stocks, as investors looked ahead to a crucial inflation report set for later this week.
 <br>
  <br>
  Nvidia fell after China's market regulator launched an investigation into the chipmaker over suspected violation of antimonopoly law, dragging down the information technology sector.
  <br>
  <br>
  Advanced Micro Devices slipped after BofA Global Research downgraded its rating on the stock, weighing on the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The market was taken a bit by surprise regarding China's investigating (Nvidia) as a possible antimonopoly-law violation. So that's one thing that's putting a little damper on the market," said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research in New York.
  <br>
  <br>
  The S&P 500 lost 37.92 points, or 0.6 percent, to end at 6,052.35, and the Nasdaq Composite lost 123.08 points, or 0.6 percent, to 19,736.69. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 240.59 points, or 0.5 percent, to 44,401.93.
  <br>
  <br>
  Comcast declined after forecasting a loss of more than 100,000 broadband subscribers in the fourth quarter, denting the communication services sector.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shares of Hershey soared following a report that Cadbury parent Mondelez was exploring an acquisition of the chocolate maker. Mondelez shares fell.
  <br>
  <br>
  Investors are anticipating the consumer price index (CPI) data set for release on Wednesday, along with the producer price index (PPI) on Thursday, ahead of the Federal Reserve's meeting on Dec. 17-18.
  <br>
  <br>
  Several Fed officials, including Chair Jerome Powell, emphasized caution regarding the central bank's approach to easing monetary policy due to the economy's resilience.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wall Street's main indexes started December on a positive note, with the benchmark S&P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq both gaining in their first week, while the blue-chip Dow ended the week slightly lower.
  <br>
  <br>
  US stocks soared in November after Donald Trump won the presidential election and his party secured control of both houses of Congress, raising expectations for a more business-friendly policy agenda. (Reuters)

    2024 the hottest year on record: EU monitor

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 This year will be the world's warmest since records began, with extraordinarily high temperatures expected to persist into at least the first few months of 2025, European Union scientists said on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The data from the EU's Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) comes two weeks after UN climate talks yielded a US$300 billion deal to tackle climate change, a package that poorer countries blasted as insufficient to cover the soaring cost of climate-related disasters.
  <br>
  <br>
  C3S said data from January to November had confirmed 2024 is now certain to be the hottest year on record, and the first in which average global temperatures exceed 1.5 degrees Celsius above the 1850-1900 pre-industrial period.
  <br>
  <br>
  The previous hottest year on record was 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  Extreme weather has swept around the world in 2024, with severe drought hitting Italy and South America, fatal floods in Nepal, Sudan and Europe, heatwaves in Mexico, Mali and Saudi Arabia that killed thousands, and disastrous cyclones in the US and the Philippines.
  <br>
  <br>
  Scientific studies have confirmed the fingerprints of human-caused climate change on all of these disasters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last month ranked as the second-warmest November on record after November 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're still in near-record high territory for global temperatures, and that's likely to stay at least for the next few months," Copernicus climate researcher Julien Nicolas said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carbon dioxide emissions from burning fossil fuels are the main cause of climate change.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cutting emissions to net zero – as many governments have pledged to eventually do – will stop global warming from getting worse. Yet despite these green pledges, global CO2 emissions are set to hit a record high this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  C3S' records go back to 1940, and are cross-checked with global temperature records going back to 1850. (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Damascus stirred back to life on Monday at the start of a hopeful but uncertain era after rebels seized the capital and President Bashar al-Assad fled, following 13 years of civil war and more than 50 years of his family's rule.
 <br>
  <br>
  Heavy traffic returned to the streets and people ventured out after a nighttime curfew, but most shops remained shut.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rebels milled about in the centre.
  <br>
  <br>
  The main rebel commander Ahmed al-Sharaa, better known as Abu Mohammed al-Golani, met overnight with Assad's Prime Minister Mohammed Jalali and Vice President Faisal Mekdad to discuss arrangements for a transitional government, a source familiar with the discussions told Reuters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Al Jazeera television reported that the transitional authority would be headed by Mohamed Al-Bashir, who ran the administration in a small pocket of rebel-held territory before the 12-day lightning offensive that swept into Damascus.
  <br>
  <br>
  Syria's banks would reopen on Tuesday and staff had been asked to return to offices, according to a Syrian central bank source and two commercial bankers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Syria's currency would continue to be used, they said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fighters from the remote countryside milled about in the capital, clustering in the central Umayyad Square before Damascus's great eight-century mosque.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We had a purpose and a goal and now we are done with it. We want the state and security forces to be in charge," said Firdous Omar, who said he had been battling the Assad government since 2011 and was now looking forward to laying down his weapon and returning to his job as a farmer in provincial Idlib.
  <br>
  <br>
  The advance of a militia alliance spearheaded by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), a former al Qaeda affiliate, was a generational turning point for the Middle East.
  <br>
  <br>
  It ends a war that killed hundreds of thousands of people, caused one of the biggest refugee crises of modern times and left cities bombed to rubble, swathes of countryside depopulated and the economy hollowed out by global sanctions. Millions of refugees could finally go home from camps across Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Assad's fall wipes out one of the main bastions from which Iran and Russia wielded power across the region.

  <br>
  Turkey, long aligned with Assad's foes, emerges strengthened, while Israel hailed it as an outcome of its blows to Assad's Iran-backed allies.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Arab world faces the challenge of reintegrating one of the Middle East's central states, while containing the militant Sunni Islam that underpinned the anti-Assad revolt but has also metastasised into the horrific sectarian violence of Islamic State.
  <br>
  <br>
  HTS is still designated as a terrorist group by the United Nations, but has spent years trying to soften its image to reassure foreign states and minority groups within Syria.
  <br>
  <br>
  The group's leader Golani, who spent years in US custody as an insurgent in Iraq but broke with al Qaeda and Islamic State to align his movement with more mainstream anti-Assad groups, has vowed to rebuild Syria.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A new history, my brothers, is being written in the entire region after this great victory," he told a huge crowd at the Umayyad Mosque in Damascus on Sunday. With hard work Syria would be "a beacon for the Islamic nation".
  <br>
  <br>
  Assad's prime minister Jalali told Sky New Arabia he was ready to provide documents and assistance for the transfer of power.
  <br>
  <br>
  The fate of Syria's army would be "left to the brothers who will take over the management of the country's affairs", Jalali said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "What concerns us today is the continuation of services for Syrians." (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Air India has placed an order to buy 100 more Airbus aircraft, the Tata Group-owned carrier said on Monday, in a deal aimed at bolstering its fleet and winning over flyers.
 <br>
  <br>
  The airline said the deal consisted of 10 widebody A350 and 90 narrowbody A320 family aircraft.
  <br>
  <br>
  The new purchase, the company said in a statement, is "in addition" to the orders for 470 aircraft Air India placed with Airbus and Boeing last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  When the two deals were announced, it was the largest order unveiled at the same time by a commercial carrier, with list price calculations for the jets suggesting an estimated value north of US$70 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The latest order takes the total number of aircraft that Air India ordered with Airbus in 2023 from 250 aircraft, comprising 40 A350 and 210 A320 family aircraft, to 350," the carrier said in a statement, without giving price details on the latest order.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since taking over the former national carrier in 2022, the sprawling Tata Group conglomerate has sought to turn around the loss-making airline by ordering new aircraft and upgrading its existing fleet.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tata Sons chairman Natarajan Chandrasekaran said the airline saw a "clear case" for Air India to expand its future fleet beyond the 470 aircraft ordered in 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  "These additional 100 Airbus aircraft will help to position Air India on the path to greater growth and contribute to our mission of building Air India into a world-class airline that connects India to every corner of the world," Chandrasekaran said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury said in a statement that he was pleased by Air India's latest investment.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Having personally witnessed the formidable growth of the Indian aviation sector... I am glad to see Air India renew its trust in Airbus with this additional order," he said. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China's top electric vehicle maker BYD gained market share as the world's largest auto market recorded its fastest-growing month in 2024, setting BYD up to exceed its global annual sales goal and overtake Ford and Honda.
 <br>
  <br>
  BYD has been on an extraordinary expansion this year, growing capacity and undertaking a massive hiring spree to turbocharge revenue that surpassed EV leader Tesla in the third quarter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Aided by robust sales in China, BYD is on course to top its annual sales target of 4 million vehicles, which would put it ahead of Japan's Honda and Detroit-based Ford for 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Chinese electric vehicle giant delivered 3.76 million vehicles in the first 11 months of this year, including 506,804 units sold in November.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bolstered by strong sales led by a competitive lineup of models with its latest plug-in hybrid technology, BYD gained ground over rivals as China's car sales grew in November at their fastest from a year earlier since January, thanks to government-subsidised auto trade-ins.
  <br>
  <br>
  As of last month, BYD's share of the Chinese auto market, which makes up more than 90 percent of its total sales, stood at 17.1 percent, up from 12.5 percent in 2023, according to data from the China Passenger Car Association.
  <br>
  <br>
  In comparison, Volkswagen's two joint ventures with SAIC and FAW Group took a combined 11 percent market share in the January-November period, compared with 14.2 percent last year. (Reuters)

    Lawmaker urges more flexible sports funding system

<img alt="Lawmaker Kenneth Fok (second right) says if billiard sports are downgraded to Tier B status, it may affect their development. Photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1782725_1_20241209170136.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The city's sports sector lawmaker has called for more flexibility in the funding system for sports, and not just focus on Olympic and Asian Games participation when determining the city's three-tiered support mechanism.
 <br>
  <br>
  Kenneth Fok, who represents the sports, performing arts, culture and publication sector, said on Monday the global sports scene was evolving with events coming in and out in top-level international competitions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Are we just chasing Olympic and Asian Games medals or do we want more? Can we actually have our athletes shine in different international arenas and competitions too?" Fok questioned.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The system should allow for more flexibility, instead of just chasing the Olympic and Asian [Games] medals... The whole mechanism is now more rearward-facing. We're looking at past results only. It creates a system where you first get the results, and then you get the reward."
  <br>
  <br>
  Sports in Hong Kong are classified into three levels: Tier A*, Tier A, and Tier B, with those in the top tier like fencing and swimming being identified as ones with the potential to excel at the Olympics and athletes receiving the best resources.
  <br>
  <br>
  Those with a Tier A status are sports with athletes competing in previous Olympics or Asian Games, and are set to continue doing so. Athletes for such sports get funding for training programmes and dedicated coaching, among others.
  <br>
  <br>
  Support for athletes in the remaining tier depends on individual circumstances.
  <br>
  <br>
  But billiard sports do not meet the criteria of being included in enough Asian and Olympic games between 2010 and 2030, to pass for the Tier A level of support. As it stands, billiard sports are at risk of losing up to 80 percent of current funding.
  <br>
  <br>
  The lawmaker said the achievements of SAR snooker players should not be disregarded simply because they did not compete in the Olympics and Asian Games.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With the proven results of cue sports in Hong Kong, in terms of our athletes repeatedly gaining world championship status, that should be part of the equation too," Fok said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If [billiard sports] are demoted to Tier B, it will not just send a negative image on government support for cue sports despite their results, but it might also impair the ability...to deliver other objectives besides elite athletes."
  <br>
  <br>
  Vincent Law, chairman of the Billiard Sports Council of Hong Kong China, said it could happen as early as April next year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our hands are quite tied, because we have no influence on the policy-making part... But we, and our athletes, will keep doing our job, and we won't waste the resources that the government has given us," Law said.

    Taxi trade reps welcome cameras, e-payment plan

<img alt="A trade representative says the installation of CCTV cameras inside taxis is long overdue. Photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1782724_1_20241209165830.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Some taxi and transport trade representatives have reacted positively to the government's proposal to make the installation of surveillance cameras in cabs compulsory, saying it could help reduce quarrels between drivers and passengers.
 <br>
  <br>
  The government told the legislature on Monday that in the next two years, it wants to mandate the installation of CCTV cameras in taxi cabins, as well as dashcams and Global Positioning System, along with the provision of at least two electronic payment methods.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chow Kwok-keung, a former chairman of the Hong Kong Taxi and Public Light Bus Association, described the cameras plan as long overdue.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he said the government should offer financial assistance, saying the trade is going through tough times.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is like spring season arriving late. As for costs, you can find CCTV cameras in the market costing around HK$4,700, HK$5,000, or more than HK$7,000," he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But we're a bit disappointed that it seems the government won't be subsidising the camera installations at all. So we feel a bit unhappy."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chow said e-payment is clearly the trend moving forward and the industry has to bear the responsibility to provide the systems needed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Transport sector lawmaker Frankie Yick, of the Liberal Party, also welcomed the proposals, noting that the use of CCTV cameras inside taxis is something he has called for for many years.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said drivers actually want the cameras to protect themselves, as they're now subject to a points-deduction system that can lead to a licence suspension for malpractice.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yick said some drivers have encountered instances of passengers accusing them of engaging in wrongdoing, and cameras could help all sides.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also brushed aside any privacy concerns.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I've checked with the privacy commissioner, and I have got positive answers. Because inside the cab, it's not a private environment, it's semi-private, so you have to know that it's not a closed situation," the lawmaker told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And I think the most important thing is to make sure that the passenger is well-aware that the [CCTV] system is on."
  <br>
  <br>
  As for e-payments, Yick said he has come across instances where taxi owners have installed an e-payment system, but the drivers didn't want to use them and so kept them away from passengers.
  <br>
  <br>
  He expressed the hope that making the systems mandatory would "help Hong Kong's reputation".

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping and other senior officials on Monday said the country would implement a more proactive fiscal policy and a looser monetary policy next year.
 <br>
  <br>
  The announcement came after the Politburo of the Communist Party of China Central Committee met to analyse and study the economic work of 2025 and arrange Party conduct and anti-corruption work.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to state media, a meeting statement noted it was "necessary to enrich and improve the policy toolkit, strengthen unconventional counter-cyclical adjustments, intensify the coordination of various policies, and make the macro regulation more forward-looking, targeted and effective."
  <br>
  <br>
  "We must vigorously boost consumption, improve investment efficiency, and comprehensively expand domestic demand," state media quoted officials as having said.
  <br>
  <br>
  They also stressed the need to stabilise the stock and property markets, and managed risks.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Next year we should... implement a more active fiscal policy and an appropriately relaxed monetary policy," they added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The statement also indicated the main goals and tasks for economic and social development in 2024 would be successfully accomplished. (Xinhua/AFP)

    Ex-lawmaker Chim Pui-chung, son convicted of fraud

<img alt="The District Court found former lawmaker Chim Pui-chung and his son guilty of conspiracy to defraud. File photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1782721_1_20241209160826.jpg&q=70">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Former lawmaker Chim Pui-chung and his son were on Monday found guilty of conspiracy to defraud more than HK$42 million in transactions linked to a listed company.
 <br>
  <br>
  The District Court ruled that Chim, who was the largest shareholder of Asia Resources, and his son Ricky Chim, who was the chairman, conspired with mainland businessman Ma Zhonghong to defraud the company, its board and shareholders between July 2013 and November 2015.
  <br>
  <br>
  The case involved the issuance of convertible notes to increase the company's share capital while concealing a secret "shell company" agreement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ma had agreed to pay the ex-lawmaker HK$210 million for 70 to 75 percent of Asia Resources' issued shares.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ma's associate and businesswoman, Wong Poe-lai, was convicted of money laundering in connection with the case.
  <br>
  <br>
  A judge in 2022 issued an arrest warrant for the businessman who failed to report to the police and appear in court.
  <br>
  <br>
  In his written judgement, Judge Ernest Lin cited evidence found by the ICAC in Chim's office in 2018, which revealed the former lawmaker as the mastermind behind the shareholding control scheme.
  <br>
  <br>
  The financial transactions were found to be unusually complex and "could not possibly be considered normal business activities", which were believed to hide the identities of those involved, the judge added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lin said the elder Chim also made use of his influence to arrange for his son to become the firm’s chairman and executive director and orchestrate transactions.
  <br>
  <br>
  The judge criticised the pair for treating the listed company as private property, harming both Asia Resources and its shareholders.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The victims were not only Asia Resources but also the company's small shareholders, who were denied both the option of a mandatory takeover offer and saw their personal investments turned into tools for others' profit-making," Lin wrote in the judgement.
  <br>
  <br>
  While shell company acquisitions aren't illegal, their actions prevented the board from protecting shareholders' interests, Lin noted.
  <br>
  <br>
  All three defendants were remanded in custody until sentencing next month.
  <br>
  <br>
  An ICAC spokesperson said the graft-buster will continue to work closely with financial regulators to combat corruption and crimes involving listed companies.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The ICAC will strive to uphold integrity and fair operation of the Hong Kong financial market and to foster the confidence of stakeholders in the financial system," the spokesperson said in a statement.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Swindlers could be harvesting the personal information of jobseekers to commit fraud, a watchdog warned on Monday, after it found privacy breaches involving online job adverts.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data (PCPD) said it carried out an investigation into JobsDB and eight organisations that used the platform to post "blind ads" – where the identity of those said to be recruiting isn't clear.
  <br>
  <br>
  "All of the eight organisations that placed the aforesaid blind ads on JobsDB and requested job applicants to submit their personal data to unknown recruiting companies and JobsDB that published the same on its platform were involved in the unfair collection of the job applicants’ personal data, and this constituted contraventions of... the PDPO [Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance]," the watchdog said.
  <br>
  <br>
  It added that it has therefore served enforcement notices on JobsDB and three of the organisations, ordering them to take measures to remedy the contraventions and prevent them from happening again. The other five organisations have been sent advisory notices.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hermina Ng, PCPD's senior legal counsel, said the eight organisations involved businesses in areas including financial securities, apparel retail, Chinese medicine and transport services. But she also warned that some online job adverts may not be legitimate.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The privacy commissioner would also like to call upon other operators of online recruitment platforms to beware of anyone using blind ads to perpetrate fraud or collect personal data by unfair means and to carefully review recruitment advertisements to identify blind ads and avoid publishing the same in order to protect the personal data privacy of members of the public," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Blind ads may be used as an unscrupulous means to collect personal data and may be misused by swindlers to collect personal data for fraudulent activities. When jobseekers are unable to ascertain the employers’ identities, they should check and verify the information contained in the blind ads carefully and should not respond to the blind ads arbitrarily and submit their personal data."
  <br>
  <br>
  Ng also urged employers to increase transparency when placing recruitment adverts, by disclosing their identity.
  <br>
  <br>
  JobsDB said it has now required all companies to disclose their name and contact information in their advertisements "for the benefit of applicants".
  <br>
  <br>
  The platform also said the posting of blind ads was suspended in November, and when it resumes from Thursday, employers will not be able to directly access an applicant's personal information without revealing their identity.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The candidates' personal data that we collect – including their current role, industry, and the types of jobs they look for – is only used in connection with the services we provide, as disclosed in our privacy statement. We do not share personal data with third parties, other than as disclosed in our privacy statement or as permitted by law," it said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  JobsDB added it took steps to ensure job ads posted were genuine, including by manually verifying anyone placing recruitment adverts.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korea’s Justice Ministry on Monday imposed an overseas travel ban on President Yoon Suk-yeol as authorities investigate allegations of rebellion and other charges in connection with his short-lived declaration of martial law last week.
 <br>
  <br>
  Yoon’s martial law decree last Tuesday, which brought special forces troops into Seoul streets, plunged South Korea into political turmoil and caused worry among its key diplomatic partners and neighbours.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Saturday, Yoon avoided an opposition-led bid to impeach him, with most governing party lawmakers boycotting a parliamentary vote.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the opposition parties vowed to submit a new impeachment motion against him this week.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bae Sang-up, a Justice Ministry official, told a parliamentary hearing that it banned Yoon from leaving the country following requests by police, prosecutors and an anti-corruption agency as they expand their probes into the circumstances surrounding Yoon’s power grab.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Monday, a senior National Police Agency officer told local reporters in a background briefing that police can also detain Yoon if conditions are met.
  <br>
  <br>
  While a sitting South Korean president has immunity from prosecution while in office, that does not extend to allegations of rebellion or treason.
  <br>
  <br>
  This means that Yoon can be questioned and detained by police over his martial law decree, but many observers doubt that police will forcefully detain him or search his office because of the potential for clashes with his presidential security service. (AP)

    Govt dept gets enforcement notice over Covid data leak

    <![CDATA[<div>
<img alt="Earlier this year a data leak was reported involving some 17,000 public housing tenants who underwent mandatory Covid tests in 2022. Photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1782702_1_20241209135743.jpg&q=65">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A government department failed to take adequate measures to protect the personal data of thousands of people ordered to undergo Covid tests back in 2022 and which was later found to be freely available online, the privacy commissioner's office said on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  In April this year the watchdog alerted officials to the fact that information including names, phone numbers, ID card numbers, addresses and Covid vaccination status of more than 17,000 public housing tenants was accessible online, without the need for any account or password.
  <br>
  <br>
  The blunder, by the Electrical and Mechanical Services Department (EMSD), was made public a few days later.
  <br>
  <br>
  During an investigation by the watchdog, the department said that given it had stopped using the services of the e-form platform involved in the breach, it wrongly believed the personal data in question had been automatically deleted.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was only when EMSD became aware of the incident on 30 April 2024 that it requested the contractor to remove the personal data involved," said Hermina Ng, senior legal counsel for the privacy commissioner's office.
  <br>
  <br>
  The watchdog said the department had a lack of written policies on the retention of personal data, had failed to take the initiative to get the information deleted, and didn't follow up the issue with the e-form platform.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The EMSD merely assumed that the contractor would act on its own volition after the expiry of the contract. The EMSD had never urged, checked or reminded the contractor to delete the personal data from the e-form platform, and had never sought to understand or monitor the progress or effectiveness of the contractor’s relevant actions," the office said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The EMSD, as the data user, should not merely await passively for the contractor to take action, nor should it ride on its trust in the contractor and not to verify the work done by the contractor. This is another obvious deficiency."
  <br>
  <br>
  The privacy watchdog concluded that the EMSD failed to ensure the data collected was kept only for as long as necessary, and that it didn't safeguard the personal information from unauthorised or accidental access.
  <br>
  <br>
  Privacy Commissioner Ada Chung said an enforcement notice has been issued to the EMSD, directing it to take measures to remedy the violations and prevent similar situations from happening again in future.
  <br>
  <br>
  In response to the watchdog's findings, the department said it immediately conducted an in-depth enquiry with the contractor about the operational details of the server platform to ensure the complete removal of the relevant data.
  <br>
  <br>
  The EMSD also said it introduced a number of measures, including developing a dedicated platform to store personal data on its own servers, to try to prevent a repeat of similar incidents in future.

    Govt to mandate cameras and e-payments for cabs

<img alt="The government plans to mandate the installation of taxi cameras and the provision of electronic payments in the next two years. File photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1782694_1_20241209130644.jpg&q=70">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Transport officials on Monday said they plan to require taxi drivers to install surveillance cameras inside their vehicles by the end of 2026, and provide electronic payment methods by the end of next year.
 <br>
  <br>
  On top of that, drivers would also be required by law to install dashcams and Global Positioning Systems, to monitor their behaviour and collect data to help with investigations by law enforcement officials.
  <br>
  <br>
  In documents submitted to the legislature, transport officials said in the past year or so, lawmakers, taxi trade representatives and some members of the public had all said they want the installation of CCTV cameras in the vehicle cabins.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This can record the situation inside the cabin. If disputes arise between taxi drivers and passengers, the footage can become evidence for the police or the Transport Department to follow up on the complaints, and investigate suspected malpractices such as overcharging and refusing a hire," the Transport and Logistics Bureau said.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said drivers would be allowed to pick their own devices, which would be properly sealed to guard against tampering, and data collected must be encrypted and only kept for 30 days.
  <br>
  <br>
  The information would only be transferred to a planned Transport Department central platform when complaints arise or if there was an accident.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials stressed they attach great importance to privacy protection, and would contact the privacy commissioner to discuss guidelines on handling the data and offering training to drivers.
  <br>
  <br>
  On payment methods, the bureau said there are still plenty of drivers who only take cash, and this can easily cause disputes as passengers, especially tourists, find this very inconvenient.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials proposed that drivers provide at least two types of electronic payment methods.
  <br>
  <br>
  They said while this might create extra costs for drivers, there are plenty of such platforms which offer promotions, such exempting device charges or handling fees.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bureau said it plans to table legal amendments for the proposals in the second quarter of next year.

    Australia launches special task force on antisemitism

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Australia on Monday launched an anti-semitism task force following an arson attack at a synagogue in Melbourne last week which police say was likely terrorism.
 <br>
  <br>
  The fire early on Friday at the Adass Israel synagogue injured one and caused widespread damage, and has strained relations between Australia and its ally Israel.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is the third anti-semitic attack in Australia this year, following the vandalism of a Jewish MP's office in Melbourne in June and anti-semitic graffiti daubed on cars in Sydney's eastern suburbs, an area with a high Jewish population, last month.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Australian Federal Police (AFP) task force will be known as Abalight.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Special Operation Abalight will be an agile and experienced squad of counter-terrorism investigators who will focus on threats, violence, and hatred towards the Australian Jewish community and parliamentarians," the head of the AFP Reece Kershaw told a news conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In essence, they will be a flying squad to deploy nationally to incidents."
  <br>
  <br>
  Australia Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said the attacks on the Jewish community were concerning.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Antisemitism is a major threat, and antisemitism has been on the rise," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier on Monday, Australian police transferred the investigation into Friday's blaze to a joint counter-terrorism unit, saying the blaze was likely a terrorist attack.
  <br>
  <br>
  State and federal police along with the country's domestic intelligence service will work in tandem to identify three suspects wanted in connection with the attack, Shane Patton, Chief Commissioner of Victoria Police, told a news conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have the best resources, best-skilled investigators, people who are expert in this field, and we will throw everything we can at this investigation to resolve it," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police initially said on Friday it did not believe the fire met the threshold of a terror attack.
  <br>
  <br>
  Designating it a suspected terror incident gives investigators additional resources and powers that include preventative detention, Patton said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police have also stepped up patrols of Jewish areas in Melbourne in order to reassure the community there, he added. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong, China on Sunday defeated Romania 8-2 to take bronze at the International Table Tennis Federation Mixed Team World Cup in Chengdu, as Team China successfully defended their title.
 <br>
  <br>
  Ng Wing-lam and Yiu Kwan-to handed the SAR the perfect start, after claiming all three games in their mixed doubles showdown over Elizabeta Samara and Ovidiu Ionescu by a final scoreline of 11-3, 11-6, 11-9.
  <br>
  <br>
  Doo Hoi-kem and Wong Chun-ting, who were paired during the Paris Olympics in July, defeated Bernadette Szocs and Eduard Ionescu in back-to-back showings to put the SAR within one game of claiming the bronze medal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong and Yiu rounded out the evening with an 11-4 win against Darius Movileanu and Ionescu to secure the prize.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Team China, successfully retained their title after recording an 8-1 win over South Korea in the final.
  <br>
  <br>
  That result gave the national team a clean sweep of the tournament, having won all 10 matches leading up to the final.

    Soto to sign with New York Mets on record 15-year deal

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Dominican baseball superstar Juan Soto has agreed to join the New York Mets on a record-breaking 15-year, US$765 million deal, multiple US media reports said on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  ESPN and Major League Baseball's official website both reported Soto's blockbuster move, which if confirmed would be the richest contract in the history of North American professional sport.
  <br>
  <br>
  Soto had entered free agency after playing last season for the New York Yankees, who had hoped to re-sign the gifted 26-year-old outfielder.
  <br>
  <br>
  The deal reported on Sunday eclipses the US$700 million, 10-year contract the Los Angeles Dodgers signed with Japanese star Shohei Ohtani last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  ESPN reported that Soto's Mets contract could eventually be worth more than US$800 million if certain benchmarks were met.
  <br>
  <br>
  The guessing game over Soto's likely next destination had dominated baseball's rumor mill since the Yankees were beaten 4-1 by the Dodgers in the World Series in October.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Yankees had mounted a concerted effort to re-sign Soto, who blasted 41 home runs and amassed 166 hits for the Bronx Bombers last season.
  <br>
  <br>
  However the Yankees were just one of several teams actively pursuing the explosive slugger, with the Mets and the Boston Red Sox amongst the teams who met with Soto's representatives to discuss a possible deal.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Mets, however, won the race for Soto after a season in which they made a giant-killing playoff run to the National League Championship Series, where they eventually lost to the Dodgers.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Mets will be the fourth team of Soto's relatively short career.
  <br>
  <br>
  He exploded onto the Major League Baseball scene during his first full season in 2019, helping the Washington Nationals score an upset World Series victory over the Houston Astros.
  <br>
  <br>
  He rejected a 15-year, US$440 million offer to stay with the Nationals in 2022, and was eventually traded to the San Diego Padres in August of that year.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Soto failed to settle in San Diego and headed back to the east coast in December 2023 in a trade that took him to the Yankees. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China's consumer price index (CPI), a main gauge of inflation, was up 0.2 percent year on year in November, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The figure was down from the 0.3-percent increase registered in October, largely due to slower food price rises, said NBS chief statistician Dong Lijuan.
  <br>
  <br>
  The national average temperature in November was the highest for any comparable period since 1961, which supported production and transportation of agricultural goods, helping bring fresh food prices down, Dong said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The core CPI, which excludes food and energy prices, rose 0.3 percent from a year ago in November, up from 0.2 percent in October.
  <br>
  <br>
  On a monthly basis, the CPI slipped 0.6 percent in November, following a 0.3-percent decrease in October.
  <br>
  <br>
  The world's second-largest economy is bracing for a possible new round of tariffs from a second Donald Trump White House while dealing with other headwinds, suggesting more policy stimulus could be needed to shore up growth. (Xinhua/Reuters)

    Jokić erupts as Denver rout Hawks, Heat stun Cavs

<img alt="Jokić shoots over Atlanta Hawks' centre Clint Capela. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1782681_1_20241209113327.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Nikola Jokić produced another dazzling high-scoring performance with a 48-point masterpice as the Denver Nuggets crushed the Atlanta Hawks 141-111 on the road on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Reigning NBA Most Valuable Player Jokić – who scored a career-high 56 points in vain during a defeat to Washington on Saturday – was nearly unplayable in a dominant display that included 14 rebounds, eight assists and three steals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Michael Porter Jr. added 26 points for Denver while Christian Braun finished with 17 and Julian Strawther 13 in a wire-to-wire blowout against an Atlanta outfit who had gone into the contest on a six-game winning streak.
  <br>
  <br>
  Denver coach Michael Malone was left purring with pleasure at Jokić's performance, describing the opportunity to coach the Serbian superstar as a privilege.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I can't say I'm surprised because I've been spoiled by having the best seat in the house to watch this guy for 10 years, to watch him do it night-in, night-out," Malone said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As much as we put on his shoulders, he never runs from it, never complains," he added. "I love his mental toughness and physical toughness. I feel privileged to have the chance to coach him – I never take it for granted."
  <br>
  <br>
  Malone meanwhile was satisfied with a victory that lifts Denver to 12-10 for the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was a response that was needed," Malone said. "There's some stuff we can clean up, but we needed a win and we got it."
  <br>
  <br>
  In other games on Sunday, Tyler Herro scored 34 points as the Miami Heat sent the Cleveland Cavaliers crashing to only their fourth defeat of the season with a 122-113 victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  Herro drained five three-pointers and was a perfect nine-from-nine from the free throw line to spearhead a third straight victory for in-form Miami.
  <br>
  <br>
  Herro was backed with 23 points from Duncan Robinson while Jimmy Butler added 18.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bam Adebayo also played a huge part in the victory with 16 points, 13 rebounds and six assists as Miami improved to 12-10 for the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cleveland meanwhile saw seven players finish in double figures, with Darius Garland leading the scoring with 23 points, five rebounds and five assists.
  <br>
  <br>
  A disappointing loss for Cleveland was exacerbated by an injury to Evan Mobley who suffered a right ankle sprain that left him able to play only for 11min 46sec.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I don't think it's a bad one," Cavs coach Kenny Atkinson said of Mobley's injury, revealing the forward had initially sought to play through the knock.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That's a tough kid," Atkinson said. "It's unfortunate for us." (AFP)

    Streetathon organiser says instructions could improve

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The organiser of Hong Kong Streetathon has admitted that instructions could have been clearer after some half-marathon runners went miles out of their way in Sunday’s event.
 <br>
  <br>
  Both the half-marathon and full marathon started near the East Coast Park in Causeway Bay and finished at San Shan Road in To Kwa Wan. But half-marathon runners did not have to go through the Tseung Lam Highway.
  <br>
  <br>
  Andes Leung, CEO and co-founder of RunOurCity Foundation, said around 20 to 30 half-marathon runners accidentally entered the Tseung Kwan O–Lam Tin Tunnel when they should have turned right.
  <br>
  <br>
  Leung told an RTHK programme on Monday that while the signs were set up correctly, staff could have taken more initiative to instruct runners where to go.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm not saying the organiser can't improve. I think the staff could have been more proactive. They could have reminded runners, face-to-face, that full marathon runners should go straight ahead, while half-marathon runners should turn right. That would have been better," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Leung added that staff training will be improved to prevent similar issues from happening again.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Syria's former president Bashar al-Assad is in Moscow with his family after Russia granted them asylum on humanitarian grounds, a Kremlin source told Russian news agencies on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Russia's Foreign Ministry said that Assad had left Syria and had given orders for a peaceful transfer of power, after rebel fighters raced into Damascus unopposed on Sunday, ending nearly six decades of his family's rule and a brutal 13-year civil war.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Syrian President Assad of Syria and members of his family have arrived in Moscow. Russia has granted them asylum on humanitarian grounds," state media quoted the unnamed Kremlin source as saying.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Syrians awakened on Monday to a hopeful if uncertain future, after rebels seized the capital Damascus, forcing Assad to flee the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  The lightning advance of a militia alliance spearheaded by Hayat al-Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), a former al-Qaeda affiliate, marked one of the biggest turning points for the Middle East in generations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Assad's fall wiped out a bastion from which Iran and Russia exercised influence across the Arab world.
  <br>
  <br>
  Many in the international community sought to take stock of a new-look Middle East following the end of Assad's autocratic rule.
  <br>
  <br>
  US President Joe Biden said Syria is in a period of risk and uncertainty, and it is the first time in years that neither Russia, Iran nor Hezbollah held an influential role there.
  <br>
  <br>
  The rebels face a monumental task of rebuilding and running a country after a war that left hundreds of thousands dead, cities pounded to dust and an economy hollowed by global sanctions. Syria will need billions of dollars in aid.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A new history, my brothers, is being written in the entire region after this great victory," said Ahmed al-Sharaa, better known as Abu Mohammed al-Golani, the head of HTS.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to a huge crowd on Sunday at Damascus' Umayyad Mosque, a place of enormous religious significance, Golani said with hard work Syria would be "a beacon for the Islamic nation."
  <br>
  <br>
  HTS is still designated as a terrorist group by the US, Turkey and the United Nations, although it has spent years trying to soften its image to reassure international governments and minority groups within Syria. (Reuters)

 When Fok Mei-ling's son was born in 1991, he was diagnosed with Spinal Muscular Atrophy - a rare genetic disorder. She was told he may not live past his first birthday.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Eating was not possible, movement was not possible, and of course, breathing, because all voluntary muscles are affected. But I didn't quit," Fok said.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 1998, Fok started the charity, FSMA - Families of SMA Foundation - after she found out that the disease need not be fatal given proper and aggressive medical intervention.
  <br>
  <br>
  And her son is living proof. He is now 33-years-old.
  <br>
  <br>
  FSMA is one of the 11 beneficiaries of this year's Operation Santa Claus (OSC), an annual charity campaign holding fundraising projects for over 35 years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fok, the charity's founder and chairperson, says they aim to relieve hardship and suffering faced by SMA patients and their families, and also raise awareness about SMA diseases.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We do donate medical equipment, wheelchairs and bespoke baby buggies. We also give them free high nutritional supplements because these are very expensive," Fok said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We also lately have the drug delivery program... and we also offer some emergency home help service, part-time for parents who need some help at home."
  <br>
  <br>
  Fok said she hoped more SMA patients could receive assistance.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[There] is also an important project. It's called Mercy Medical Management. We send a multi-disciplinary medical team with the doctor on Zoom, registered nurses, technicians with medical equipment to go and do the tests."
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is the programme exactly that Operation Santa Claus will help so that we can increase the number of patients that we help who are technology dependent for their survival," she said.

    3D scans of Notre Dame aid restoration efforts

<img alt="First mass open to the public at the Notre-Dame de Paris Cathedral, five-and-a-half years after a fire ravaged the Gothic masterpiece. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1782660_1_20241209090420.jpg&q=45">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An architect in Hong Kong says laser scanning of Paris' famous Notre Dame Cathedral, carried out by late art historian Andrew Tallon, played a crucial role in the restoration of the Gothic gem.
 <br>
  <br>
  The more than 850-year-old cathedral has finally reopened its doors after it was partially destroyed by a fire in 2019.
  <br>
  <br>
  Most of the timber roof and the structure's spire were ravaged by the flames.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yu Ka-sing, Associate Professor of Practice at the Faculty of Architecture from the University of Hong Kong told RTHK that Tallon's scans of the interior and exterior of the cathedral conducted before the blaze provided basic information for the restoration team to start with.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Basically, it is the process that can allow the site to create a digital twin of the historic building by collecting a range of geospatial information," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yu noted that the Emperor Qinshihuang's Mausoleum Site Museum in China cooperated with France on the restoration, and its deputy director Zhou Ping paid a visit to France earlier this year to gain a better understanding of the restoration process.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the international heritage conservation aspect, both France and China are of the highest levels," said Yu.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And also given the fact that the Emperor Qinshihuang's Mausoleum [Site Museum] has also got many burned timber debris, so sharing some similarity with Notre Dame, the two sites have some good knowledge for exchange."
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite rolling out the red carpet to the public, the 700-million euro restoration project has yet to be completed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tasks, such as the restoration of the chevet and sacristy, as well as the installation of stained glass windows will continue.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Antoine Griezmann struck a 94th-minute winner to snatch Atlético Madrid a thrilling 4-3 victory over Sevilla on Sunday in La Liga.
 <br>
  <br>
  Diego Simeone's side, third, have won nine matches straight across all competitions and the win pulled them a point behind second-placed title holders Real Madrid and three behind leaders Barcelona.
  <br>
  <br>
  Atlético showed character and quality as they fought back from two goals down in the second half to triumph.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rodrigo De Paul powered Atlético ahead but Dodi Lukebakio equalised for 13th-placed Sevilla.
  <br>
  <br>
  Isaac Romero sent the visitors ahead after half-an-hour and Juanlu Sánchez gave them a 3-1 lead before the hour mark.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, Griezmann pegged one back before substitute Samuel Lino scored a stunning effort from the edge of the box and the Frenchman then blasted home in stoppage time to continue Atlético's superb run of form.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lukebakio gave the ball away for De Paul's opener as he tried to dribble out of a dangerous area.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Argentine midfielder lashed the ball beyond the reach of Sevilla goalkeeper Álvaro Fernández from the edge of the box in the 10th minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  However the Andalusians were quickly on level terms, with Lukebakio making amends two minutes later.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Belgian forward, on the left of Atlético's area, took one step to beat his marker and smashed home at the near post, catching out Jan Oblak with his powerful strike.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sevilla played with huge intensity, pressing Atletico and throwing themselves into tackles, up for the fight at the Metropolitano stadium in front of over 60,000 fans.
  <br>
  <br>
  They took the lead in the 32nd minute when Romero broke in behind to reach Kike Salas' pass to net his first goal of the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  The striker fired past Oblak, who got a hand to his effort but could not keep the ball out.
  <br>
  <br>
  The hosts battled hard to find a way back in but Francisco Garcia Pimienta's Sevilla soaked up the pressure and netted their third early in the second half.
  <br>
  <br>
  They put together an excellent team move, involving Lukebakio, Djibril Sow and Salas, the latter of whom crossed for Sánchez to slam home at the far post.
  <br>
  <br>
  Atlético were unperturbed and swiftly pulled one back through Griezmann, after an excellent through-ball from Spanish midfielder Pablo Barrios.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sevilla goalkeeper Fernández made several good saves as the Rojiblancos pushed for an equaliser, denying substitute Alexander Sorloth twice, and the Norwegian striker narrowly missed a tempting cross with a diving header.
  <br>
  <br>
  Atlético pulled level thanks to Lino's spectacular strike from distance, which was reward for their heavy pressure in the second half.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sevilla were under the cosh in the final stages and eventually caved when Griezmann swivelled and smashed the winner past the helpless Fernández. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chelsea roared back from two goals down to beat Tottenham 4-3 on Sunday, moving just four points behind Premier League leaders Liverpool after Arsenal were held by Fulham.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Gunners and Chelsea both started the day seven points adrift of Arne Slot's side, whose game this weekend was postponed due to stormy weather.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal were forced to settle for a 1-1 draw but Enzo Maresca's Chelsea, kicking off later Sunday, mounted a stunning comeback at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dominic Solanke and Dejan Kulusevski put Spurs two goals up inside 11 minutes but Jadon Sancho quickly pulled one back with a fine strike and the second half belonged to the visitors.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cole Palmer equalised from the penalty spot in the 61st minute and Enzo Fernandez put Chelsea ahead 12 minutes later.
  <br>
  <br>
  Palmer's ice-cool "Panenka" spot-kick gave the visitors a two-goal cushion before Son Heung-min added a late third for Spurs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Second-placed Chelsea now have 31 points after 15 games, two points ahead of London rivals Arsenal. Liverpool, with a game in hand, are on 35 points.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The plan or the idea is to not let the players slow down," Maresca told Sky Sports. "They cannot drop because they know another player is waiting to come in."
  <br>
  <br>
  But the Italian, in his first season at Stamford Bridge, played down his team's title chances.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Arsenal, Manchester City and Liverpool probably don't slide like what Cucurella did," he added. "To be serious, we are not ready – we are far from these teams, but we focus on day-by-day and trying to improve the team."
  <br>
  <br>
  The defeat is a disastrous result for under-pressure Spurs boss Ange Postecoglou, whose side hammered champions Manchester City 4-0 just two weeks ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is a sore one, a painful one," said the Australian, whose team are now 11th in the Premier League table after their seventh defeat.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier, Bukayo Saka had a late winner ruled out for offside by a VAR review as the Gunners' four-match winning streak was halted in west London.
  <br>
  <br>
  Raúl Jiménez fired Fulham into an early lead before William Saliba levelled after yet another Arsenal goal from a corner.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are very disappointed not to win the game – overall we absolutely dominated the game from start to end," Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We did all the things that we wanted to do during the game and unfortunately we concede one goal in one shot. The way the team played, the way the team wanted to win, it was unbelievable."
  <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal were still without influential defensive pair Gabriel Magalhães and Riccardo Calafiori through injury and Fulham exposed a makeshift left side of the Gunners' backline to take the lead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal underlined their threat from set-pieces when they scored twice from corners to beat Manchester United 2-0 in midweek. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The SAR’s footballers on Sunday began their quest to make the final of an East Asian tournament with a dominant 3-0 victory over Mongolia at the Mong Kok Stadium.
 <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong, China were in control from start to finish of the opener of the qualifying round of the East Asia Football Federation (EAFF) E-1 Championship – in what was their fourth consecutive victory under coach Ashley Westwood.
  <br>
  <br>
  Star winger Everton Camargo and midfielder Wong Wai each scored a goal for the home side before half-time.
  <br>
  <br>
  After the break, winger Nicholas Benavides came out to score his first goal for the SAR in only his second game by heading home a cross from substitute Mahama Awal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Goalkeeper and captain Edmond Yapp earned his 100th cap for Hong Kong, China, the first player from the SAR to reach the century mark.
  <br>
  <br>
  The football association marked the occasion by presenting him with a commemorative kit, to the delight of more than 3,300 spectators.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SAR will play against Chinese Taipei on Saturday in another Group B match.
  <br>
  <br>
  Guam and Macau are the two remaining teams in Group A, after North Korea withdrew from the competition last month.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two teams topping their respective groups will play in the final on 17 December.
  <br>
  <br>
  The winner will advance to the tournament in South Korea next summer to play against the hosts, Japan and the national team.
  <br>
  <br>
  Those three teams automatically qualify for the final round of the competition.

    Vissel Kobe win the J. League for domestic double

<img alt="Members of Vissel Kobe celebrate with the title cup following their victory. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1782620_1_20241208191040.jpg&q=65">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Japan's Vissel Kobe won on the final day of the season on Sunday to seal their second straight J. League title and complete a domestic double.
 <br>
  <br>
  Kobe, who lifted the Emperor's Cup two weeks ago, started the day one point ahead of nearest challengers Sanfrecce Hiroshima and sealed the deal with a dominant 3-0 win at home to Shonan Bellmare.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hiroshima crashed 3-1 to Gamba Osaka while third-placed Machida Zelvia, who went into the final day with a slim chance of winning the title in their first season in the top flight, lost 3-1 to Kashima Antlers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kobe are also on course to qualify from the league stage of the Asian Champions League as they chase an unprecedented treble.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We've played a lot of games this season and that's thanks to everyone in the team," said coach Takayuki Yoshida.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We've won two titles and we're progressing well in the Asian Champions League. I appreciate the hard work of everyone in the team, all the players and staff."
  <br>
  <br>
  Kobe won the J. League for the first time last season, almost five months after Spanish legend Andres Iniesta left the club.
  <br>
  <br>
  The former Barcelona star spent five years in Kobe and played alongside two other World Cup winners in Spain's David Villa and Germany's Lukas Podolski.
  <br>
  <br>
  All of Kobe's high-profile overseas players have since departed and the club have found success through former Japan internationals such as Yoshinori Muto, once of Newcastle United.
  <br>
  <br>
  "All the players have given 100 percent in games and in training," said Muto, who scored 13 goals for the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The strong point of our team is that everyone is willing to take responsibility."
  <br>
  <br>
  Kobe lined up against lowly Shonan knowing that a win would guarantee them a second title, and Taisei Miyashiro put them in front in the 26th minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  Muto forced a save from Shonan goalkeeper Naoto Kamifukumoto with a powerful header and Miyashiro swept home the rebound from close range.
  <br>
  <br>
  Muto made it two just minutes before half time, finishing off a fast break.
  <br>
  <br>
  Takahiro Ogihara put the icing on the cake with a stunning long-range effort in the 70th minute, his first goal of the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hiroshima, led by German coach Michael Skibbe, started the day with a better goal difference than Kobe but they conceded early against Gamba and never recovered.
  <br>
  <br>
  Machida had only a mathematical chance of winning the title just over a decade after being in non-league football. (AFP)

    HK Streetathon ends with some going the extra mile

<img alt="The Hong Kong Streetathon featured a full marathon around Victoria Harbour, a cross-harbour half marathon, and a 10km race from Tseung Kwan O to Kwun Tong. Photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1782615_1_20241208180257.jpg&q=30">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Nearly 17,000 runners took part in this year's Hong Kong Streetathon on Sunday, but some unintentionally went further than the standard distance during one of the races.
 <br>
  <br>
  The full marathon around Victoria Harbour kicked off the races early this morning under chilly weather, as temperatures dipped to their lowest so far this winter at 16 degrees Celsius.
  <br>
  <br>
  The day also featured a cross-harbour half marathon and a 10km race from Tseung Kwan O to Kwun Tong.
  <br>
  <br>
  For the first time, local delicacies were dished out to runners as part of what's being dubbed a "Five-senses Marathon".
  <br>
  <br>
  Music and fragrance diffusers also featured along parts of the route.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tiffany, a 10km race participant, said she was delighted there was poon choi, a communal dish of foods served in layers which is often eaten on festive occasions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There was a band performing along the way to cheer us up, and someone gave me a high-five. There was also something to eat – poon choi with mushrooms. That could give runners a boost," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  For Patsy, a runner who's visually impaired, the route this time around was a bit different than last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I wanted to challenge myself and see what I was capable of. The most important thing was that I had a guide who took good care of me and encouraged me," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the 21-kilometre half marathon saw some runners go an extra nine kilometres due to unclear instructions.
  <br>
  <br>
  James, who was among those who ran the additional stretch, said he was unable to see where to go during part of the route.
  <br>
  <br>
  “There were traffic cones and a bunch of staff members. We couldn't see any of the signs at all," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If only one or two runners could not see the signs, then it could be their problem. But when you had more than 10 people go the wrong way, would it be an issue with the organisers?"
  <br>
  <br>
  Organisers said they were looking into the incident to see whether there was human error involved.
  <br>
  <br>
  Almost all of the runners who showed up finished the race, organisers said, with more than 3,000 coming from overseas.
  <br>
  <br>
  Four participants were hospitalised, while 110 others suffered minor injuries.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korea's main opposition party said on Sunday it would try again to impeach President Yoon Suk-yeol after his declaration of martial law.
 <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, police arrested the defence minister in charge of the martial law operation, and the interior minister resigned. Both they and Yoon are being investigated for alleged insurrection.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon averted impeachment late on Saturday as huge crowds braved freezing temperatures in another night of protests outside parliament to demand the president's ouster.
  <br>
  <br>
  Opposition parties proposed the impeachment motion, which needed 200 votes in the 300-member parliament to pass, but a near-total boycott by Yoon's People Power Party doomed it to failure.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee Jae-myung, leader of the main opposition Democratic Party, said on Sunday that they will try again on December 14.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Yoon, the principal culprit behind the insurrection and military coup that destroyed South Korea's constitutional order, must either resign immediately or be impeached without delay," Lee told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "On December 14, our Democratic Party will impeach Yoon in the name of the people." (AFP)

 The Foreign Ministry in Beijing said on Sunday it hoped Syria would return "to stability as soon as possible", after rebels said they had taken Damascus and sent President Bashar al-Assad fleeing.
 <br>
  <br>
  Beijing "is closely following the development of the situation in Syria and hopes that Syria returns to stability as soon as possible", a Foreign Ministry spokesperson said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Chinese government has actively assisted Chinese citizens who are willing to leave Syria in a safe and orderly way, and has maintained contact with... Chinese citizens who remain in Syria," the ministry said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We urge the relevant Syrian parties to take practical measures to ensure the safety of Chinese institutions and personnel in Syria," it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "At present, the Chinese embassy in Syria is still holding strong, and we will continue to provide full assistance to Chinese citizens in need." (AFP/Xinhua)

    Notre Dame holds its first Sunday mass since fire

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Newly restored Notre Dame cathedral held its first service for the public on Sunday after a historic re-opening ceremony that saw firefighters, builders and artists celebrated for their work saving the 12th-century masterpiece.
 <br>
  <br>
  The beloved Paris monument nearly burned down in 2019, but has been renovated inside and fitted with a new roof and spire during a frenzied reconstruction effort since then.
  <br>
  <br>
  During a re-opening service on Saturday, attended by world leaders including incoming US president Donald Trump, French leader Emmanuel Macron expressed the "gratitude of the French nation" for the work.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have rediscovered what great nations can do -- achieve the impossible," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  One of the most moving moments came when firefighters in their protective gear walked through the congregation to thunderous applause as the word "Merci" ("Thank you") was beamed on the intricate facade and famous belltowers of the Gothic masterpiece.
  <br>
  <br>
  The architectural wonder had been in danger of collapsing during the April 2019 blaze and was saved only by the heroic intervention of teams of firefighters pumping water from the nearby River Seine.
  <br>
  <br>
  After the morning service, a second mass in the evening at 6.30pm will be open to the public, with roughly 2,500 people who secured free tickets this week expected to attend.
  <br>
  <br>
  The cathedral will open fully to visitors on December 16 via an online reservation system.
  <br>
  <br>
  The exact cause of the 2019 blaze has never been identified despite a forensic investigation by prosecutors, who believe an accident such as an electrical fault was the most likely reason.
  <br>
  <br>
  Notre Dame welcomed around 12 million visitors a year before the fire, but expects to receive an even higher figure of "14 to 15 million" after the reopening, according to the church authorities. (AP)

 US President-elect Donald Trump said on Sunday that Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky was keen for a deal to end his country's conflict with Russia, after the pair met in Paris to celebrate the reopening of the Notre Dame cathedral.
 <br>
  <br>
  French President Emmanuel Macron hosted three-way talks with Zelensky and Trump at the Elysee Palace on Saturday, almost three years into the war and ahead of the US president-elect taking office in January.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Zelenskyy and Ukraine would like to make a deal and stop the madness," Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There should be an immediate ceasefire and negotiations should begin. Too many lives are being so needlessly wasted, too many families destroyed, and if it keeps going, it can turn into something much bigger, and far worse."
  <br>
  <br>
  Zelensky's meeting with Trump was his first face-to-face encounter with the tycoon-turned-politician since his November election victory. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) on Sunday said Hong Kong's coral reefs are generally healthy, although bleaching was observed during summer this year.
 <br>
  <br>
  The department, along with the non-profit Reef Check Foundation, conducted its five-month review of local corals from June at 33 sites of ecological importance, which included nine marine parks.
  <br>
  <br>
  It found that coral coverage at the sites ranged from 12.8 percent to 75.1 percent, with the highest coverage recorded at Hoi Ha Wan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eleven sites had more than 50 percent coral coverage, in which five of them were marine parks.
  <br>
  <br>
  The average health index of corals across all sites was 3.95, which is above the general average of three.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the AFCD said large-scale coral bleaching reappeared after it last occurred in 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The department has engaged a group of local coral and marine science experts to consult with and gather their views on conserving corals in Hong Kong, and to explore future directions of relevant research and conservation work, such as identification and enhancement of monitoring for the key environmental factors associated with coral bleaching as well as devising research projects for alleviating the impact of coral bleaching in the local environment," an AFCD spokesman said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said corals which saw the most bleaching were recovering due to the influx of cooler waters from last month.
  <br>
  <br>
  The results also indicated there were no signs destructive fishing practices, but abandoned nets were found at 12 sites.
  <br>
  <br>
  The department said the impact was low and the netting would be removed.

    Officials optimistic about tourism sector this month

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Tourism officials on Sunday expressed optimism the industry would enjoy a merry festive period this year, in part because of the boost by the resumption of the multi-entry permit scheme for Shenzhen residents.
 <br>
  <br>
  The new tourism minister, Rosanna Law, said Saturday saw some 145,000 visitor arrivals from the mainland, nearly 30 percent more than the daily average for November.
  <br>
  <br>
  Law believed this was due to last Sunday's resumption of multi-entry permits for Shenzhen residents, saying various sectors should seize the opportunities brought by these visitors.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have so many tourists coming in so let's work together and show a smile," Law told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We've heard mainland travellers saying in interviews that we are smiling more and that our Mandarin has improved. I hope this will continue. It's important to keep an open mind and think of ways to make good use of business opportunities."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Travel Industry Council, meanwhile, said it expects overall tourist arrivals year-on-year to rise by five to 10 percent this month, citing the visa scheme change and a series of upcoming events.
  <br>
  <br>
  "December is also our peak tourist season, with many winter promotional events organised by the Tourism Board taking place. We are very confident there'll be more visitors this December, compared to previous [years]," the council's chairwoman, Gianna Hsu, told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The launch of the Kai Tak Sports Park, the commencement of the airport's three-runway system, and the official debut of giant pandas, also encourages more tourists to come and see the cityscape of Hong Kong."
  <br>
  <br>
  The council and a number of tourism sector groups called on the industry to reinforce Hong Kong's brand as a hospitable destination.

<div class="itemFullText">
 LA Galaxy beat New York Red Bulls 2-1 with goals from Joseph Paintsil and Dejan Joveljic to win a record-extending sixth MLS Cup and snap a 10-year championship drought on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The final looked like it would be one-sided when hosts and favourites Galaxy scored twice inside 13 minutes through Paintsil and Joveljic in front of a sun-soaked crowd.
  <br>
  <br>
  The vaunted Red Bulls defence, who lost Andres Reyes just before the start of the game through illness, initially had no answer to Galaxy's aggressive offence despite playing without key injured midfielder Riqui Puig.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Red Bulls clawed one back in the 28th when the ball pinballed around in front of goal after a corner before finding Sean Nealis, who fired high past goalkeeper John McCarthy.
  <br>
  <br>
  The goal immediately changed the tone of the contest as the home side began to play more tentatively and the Red Bulls began to go on the attack.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both sides had chances in the second half and the Red Bulls battled to force extra time as the final whistle approached but Galaxy held firm as they sealed their first MLS Cup since 2014. (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Panda enthusiasts gathered at Ocean Park on Sunday to get a sight of An An and Ke Ke, as the two pandas gifted by Beijing made their public debut today.
 <br>
  <br>
  Kamy Yeung, who has been following the news about the animals, told RTHK that it is a great day to give the pandas a big welcome.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I happen to be seeing them eating breakfast in the morning... and it’s quite nice to see them being lively and smiley. It’s nice to see all the enthusiasm from everyone around the world to celebrate the joy at the park,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Singapore tourist Rachel Wang spent around HK$1,100 on panda souvenirs. She said she finds An An adorable.
  <br>
  <br>
  “He’s so active, but having seen the pandas, I think Ke Ke is very demure and very loveable. I’m really excited and I love pandas to start with... actually I want to be a panda as well after seeing them,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Anthony Mezzatesta from the United States said he woke up early just to see the pandas.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I like the girl panda a little bit more, she seemed a little bit more shy, very cute to see her get all nervous seeing a bunch of people. We queued up at around 9am. I was very excited to see the pandas. I woke up at six in the morning ready to go to Ocean Park to see the pandas,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The theme park has implemented dispersion measures, in which around 100 tickets are given out every 15 minutes. Each visitor is only allowed to stay in the area for 10 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Following the debut of An An and Ke Ke, the new panda twins will greet the public in the first quarter next year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Also on Sunday, the new tourism minister, Rosanna Law, said the panda naming competition had allowed the public to participate in a meaningful way.
  <br>
  <br>
  Law said the winner of the competition, which received some 20,000 entries, had given good reasons why the original names should be kept.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister described the names as approachable adding it was good there was no need to change them.

    'No worries over undersubscribed bonds'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The finance chief on Sunday said there is no need for concern after the latest offering of retail infrastructure bonds, totalling HK$20 billion, fell short of its target.
 <br>
  <br>
  Around 128,000 investors signed up for the bonds during the offering period that ended on Friday, with the final issuance size expected to be around HK$17.8 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  On a Commercial Radio programme on Sunday, Financial Secretary Paul Chan said people should not worry about the undersubscription of the latest round of bonds.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Institutional investors have oversubscribed for the bonds by three or four times, so we don't have to worry about the amount raised from bonds this year," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Currently there are many investment options. We can also see that in future, many high-quality companies will come to Hong Kong to list, so the investment market will be vibrant."
  <br>
  <br>
  The government previously told lawmakers that it had doubled its estimated deficit for the current financial year to around HK$100 billion, from its forecast of a little more than HK$48 billion announced in February's budget.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said it might take some time for the government to achieve a fiscal balance, but cautioned the process should not be done too quickly.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We believe it will take several years to achieve a fiscal balance," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We've spoken to credit rating agencies and they agreed that major economies have been experiencing financial deficits during the pandemic. They're against achieving a fiscal balance aggressively and within a short period of time, such as one or two years, by significantly cutting spending. This would not only hurt people's livelihoods, but would also cause the economy to contract, which is counterproductive."
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, the finance chief said on his weekly blog that the government is committed to coordinating different mega events to "achieve maximum synergy".
  <br>
  <br>
  Over the past two weeks, Hong Kong has held a number of fashion and design events.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said designers and entrepreneurs from all over the world that have come to Hong Kong for large-scale international arts and culture galas "highly recognised" the capability of the SAR in curating and coordinating such events.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added these events allowed people in the arts and creative industries to more easily reach out to potential partners.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Housing chief Winnie Ho said officials could reward informants who alert authorities to poor quality sub-divided units (SDUs), when the flats are subject to a future regulatory regime.
 <br>
  <br>
  The government is now collecting public views on its proposal to require each SDU to be no less than less than eight square metres in size, or 86 square feet, as well as having features like at least one window and an individual toilet.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials propose that landlords who violate the requirements in future could be subject to a maximum three-year jail term.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho said the reward system might be needed to dig out "hidden" sub-standard flats, but she stressed officials are also gauging public views over the matter.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister said the public has seen the proposed standards and finds them reasonable, and she described the penalty as rather heavy.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We hope that everyone won't have to wait until informant and reward systems - that everyone agrees to follow the new rules, register the flats," she said on a TVB programme that aired on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We'll see how effective the new system is - and we'll see if we need to offer rewards, in addition to the regular reporting system."
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho added that the Rating and Valuation Department has received two complaints so far from sub-divided flat tenants who said they were forced out by landlords because of the proposed regime, and officials will handle different complaints regarding rental issues.

    Syrian rebels say they have toppled Assad

<div class="itemFullText">
 Syrian rebels announced on state television they had ousted President Bashar al-Assad, eliminating a 50-year family dynasty in a lightning offensive that raises the spectre of a new wave of instability in a Middle East gripped by war.
 <br>
  <br>
  Syria's army command notified officers on Sunday that Assad's regime had ended, a Syrian officer who was informed of the move told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the Syrian army later said it was continuing operations against "terrorist groups" in the key cities of Hama and Homs and in Deraa countryside.
  <br>
  <br>
  Assad, who had crushed all forms of dissent, flew out of Damascus for an unknown destination earlier on Sunday, two senior army officers told international media, as rebels said they had entered the capital with no sign of army deployments.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We celebrate with the Syrian people the news of freeing our prisoners and releasing their chains and announcing the end of the era of injustice in Sednaya prison," the rebels said, referring to a large military prison on the outskirts of Damascus where the Syrian government detained thousands.
  <br>
  <br>
  Syrian Prime Minister Mohammed Ghazi Jalali said the government was ready to “extend its hand” to the opposition and hand over its functions to a transitional government.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I am in my house and I have not left, and this is because of my belonging to this country,” Jalili said in a video statement. He said he would go to his office to continue work in the morning and called on Syrian citizens not to deface public property.
  <br>
  <br>
  He did not address reports that Assad had left the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rami Abdurrahman of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights confirmed to reporters that Assad took a flight from Damascus.
  <br>
  <br>
  State television in Iran, Assad’s main backer in the years of war in Syria, reported that Assad had left the capital. It cited Qatar’s Al Jazeera news network for the information and did not elaborate.
  <br>
  <br>
  There was no immediate statement from the Syrian government on the reports of Assad's departure.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the leader of Syrian rebel group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, ordered forces on Sunday not to approach official institutions in Damascus, saying they would remain under the prime minister until they are "officially" handed over.
  <br>
  <br>
  "To all military forces in the city of Damascus, it is strictly forbidden to approach public institutions, which will remain under the supervision of the former prime minister until they are officially handed over," Jolani said in a statement on Telegram, using his real name Ahmed al-Sharaa instead of his nom de guerre, and adding: "It is forbidden to shoot into the air."

<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol will not be involved in foreign and other state affairs before his early departure, the leader of Yoon's ruling party said on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  People Power Party leader Han Dong-hoon made the comments during a joint press conference with Prime Minister Han Duck-soo, after Yoon survived an impeachment vote in the opposition-led parliament late on Saturday over his brief imposition of martial law last week.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon's future remained uncertain on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  A boycott by Yoon's party killed off the impeachment motion late on Saturday even as huge crowds braved freezing temperatures outside parliament to demand his removal.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the deeply unpopular president's survival may be short-lived, with Yoon's People Power Party saying it had "effectively obtained (Yoon's) promise to step down".
  <br>
  <br>
  "Until the president steps down, the president will be effectively excluded from his duties," it said in a statement. (Agencies)

<img alt="Syrian rebels led by HTS have intensified their offensive, capturing Damascus and seizing control of key areas in Aleppo and Hama. File photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1782573_1_20241208111037.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Syrian rebels said they have seized control of the capital Damascus with reports suggesting that President Bashar al-Assad had boarded a plane and left the country for an unknown destination on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Thousands in cars and on foot congregated at a main square in Damascus waving and chanting "Freedom", witnesses said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We celebrate with the Syrian people the news of freeing our prisoners and releasing their chains and announcing the end of the era of injustice in Sednaya prison," said the rebels.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sednaya is a large military prison on the outskirts Damascus where the Syrian government detained thousands.
  <br>
  <br>
  Just hours earlier, rebels announced they had gained full control of the key city of Homs after only a day of fighting, leaving Assad's 24-year rule dangling by a thread.
  <br>
  <br>
  Intense sounds of shooting were heard in the centre of the Damascus, residents said on Sunday, although it was not immediately clear what the source of the shooting was.
  <br>
  <br>
  In rural areas southwest of the capital, local youths and former rebels took advantage of the loss of authority to come to the streets in acts of defiance against Assad's rule.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thousands of Homs residents poured onto the streets after the army withdrew from the central city, dancing and chanting "Assad is gone, Homs is free" and "Long live Syria and down with Bashar al-Assad".
  <br>
  <br>
  Rebels fired into the air in celebration, and youths tore down posters of the Syrian president, whose territorial control has collapsed in a dizzying week-long retreat by the military.
  <br>
  <br>
  The fall of Homs gives the insurgents control over Syria's strategic heartland and a key highway crossroads, severing Damascus from the coastal region that is the stronghold of Assad's Alawite sect and where his Russian allies have a naval base and air base.
  <br>
  <br>
  Homs' capture is also a powerful symbol of the rebel movement's dramatic comeback in the 13-year-old conflict.
  <br>
  <br>
  Swathes of Homs were destroyed by gruelling siege warfare between the rebels and the army years ago. The fighting ground down the insurgents, who were forced out.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hayat Tahrir al-Sham commander Abu Mohammed al-Golani, the main rebel leader, called the capture of Homs a historic moment and urged fighters not to harm "those who drop their arms".
  <br>
  <br>
  Rebels freed thousands of detainees from the city prison. Security forces left in haste after burning their documents.
  <br>
  <br>
  Residents of numerous Damascus districts turned out to protest Assad on Saturday evening, and security forces were either unwilling or unable to clamp down.
  <br>
  <br>
  Syrian rebel commander Hassan Abdul Ghani said in a statement early on Sunday that operations were ongoing to "completely liberate" the countryside around Damascus and rebel forces were looking toward the capital.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Syrian army said it was reinforcing around Damascus, and state television reported on Saturday that Assad remained in the city. (Reuters)

    South Korean media say ex-defence minister arrested

<img alt="South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol bows while delivering an address to the nation at the Presidential Office in Seoul on Saturday. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1782564_1_20241208093453.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korea's former defence minister was arrested on Sunday, local media reported, a day after President Yoon Suk Yeol survived an impeachment vote over his calamitous attempt to impose martial law.
 <br>
  <br>
  The motion failed due to a boycott of the vote by Yoon's party, even though huge crowds braved freezing temperatures in another night of protests outside parliament in Seoul to demand the president's ouster.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kim Yong-hyun had already resigned as defence minister after the brief suspension of civilian rule late on Tuesday by Yoon that saw soldiers and helicopters sent to parliament.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon was forced to rescind the order hours later and parliament voted down his decree.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kim had already been slapped with a travel ban.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police have launched an investigation into Yoon, Kim and others for alleged insurrection.
  <br>
  <br>
  The prosecutors' office was not immediately available for comment on Kim's arrest, reported by the Yonhap news agency and other local media outlets on Sunday morning.
  <br>
  <br>
  Opposition parties proposed the impeachment motion, which needed 200 votes in the 300-member parliament to pass, but a near-total boycott by Yoon's People Power Party (PPP) doomed it to failure.
  <br>
  <br>
  The PPP said after the vote that it had blocked the impeachment to avoid "severe division and chaos", adding that it would "resolve this crisis in a more orderly and responsible manner".
  <br>
  <br>
  Party leader Han Dong-hoon said that the party had "effectively obtained" Yoon's promise to step down, and said until this happened he would "be effectively excluded from his duties", leaving the prime minister and party to manage state affairs.
  <br>
  <br>
  The failure of the impeachment motion came as a huge blow to the massive crowds -- numbering 150,000 according to police, one million according to organisers -- demonstrating outside parliament.
  <br>
  <br>
  National Assembly speaker Woo Won-shik called the PPP's walkout "a failure to engage in the democratic process" on the part of the ruling party.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Even though we didn't get the outcome we wanted today, I am neither discouraged nor disappointed because we will get it eventually," protester Jo Ah-gyeong, 30, said on Saturday.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ruben Amorim's Manchester United honeymoon is truly over after Nottingham Forest inflicted a second straight Premier League defeat on his side on Saturday while Manchester City stumbled again.
 <br>
  <br>
  Leaders Liverpool maintained their seven-point lead at the top of the table even though their match at Everton was postponed because of storms on Merseyside.
  <br>
  <br>
  Amorim replaced the sacked Erik ten Hag at Old Trafford last month after a terrible start to the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  He began brightly, with a draw and two wins in his first three games.
  <br>
  <br>
  But reality is starting to bite hard after a 2-0 Premier League defeat at Arsenal in midweek followed by Saturday's chastening 3-2 loss to high-flying Forest, who capitalised on United's defensive blunders.
  <br>
  <br>
  United forward Rasmus Hojlund cancelled out Nikola Milenkovic's early goal at Old Trafford, but Morgan Gibbs-White and Chris Wood put the visitors in charge. Forest kept the home side at bay after Bruno Fernandes pulled one back.
  <br>
  <br>
  United's Andre Onana was embarrassed by a swerving Gibbs-White strike for Forest's second while the goalkeeper, Lisandro Martinez and Matthijs De Ligt all failed to deal with a looping Wood header for the third.
  <br>
  <br>
  The win lifts Forest to fifth in the Premier League table. United are languishing in 13th spot.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Tough game in a tough moment but we have to continue the job," a disappointed Amorim said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is a long journey. We are improving in some aspects. We have to win games to help us improve the team.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are in the start of something so big that we pay attention to every detail. We already know it's a big job so we have to continue."
  <br>
  <br>
  Forest boss Nuno Espirito Santo said "I'm very proud of the way we work together, build things together, from the owner to everyone else in the club.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's a moment to celebrate. But for me, I'm thinking about (next week's match against) Aston Villa."
  <br>
  <br>
  Manchester City failed to win for the eighth time in nine games in a 2-2 draw at Crystal Palace.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pep Guardiola's men had the chance to go second in the table but failed to build on an encouraging 3-0 win over Forest in midweek.
  <br>
  <br>
  Daniel Munoz fired the home team ahead early but Erling Haaland's towering header levelled the score.
  <br>
  <br>
  The visitors started the second half strongly but were hit with a sucker punch when Maxence Lacroix powered home Will Hughes' corner.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rico Lewis found the top corner to level once more for City, but was then sent off six minutes from time.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We fought incredible. We came back twice," said Guardiola. "We gave everything and we take a point."
  <br>
  <br>
  Fourth-placed City are eight points behind Liverpool and a fifth straight Premier League title is looking increasingly unlikely.
  <br>
  <br>
  The final league derby between Everton and Liverpool at Goodison Park will be rescheduled after Storm Darragh battered western regions of England with high winds and heavy rain.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brentford enjoy the best home record in the division and made it seven wins from eight games at the Gtech Community Stadium with a thrilling 4-2 victory over Newcastle.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bryan Mbeumo, who has been linked with a move to the Magpies, opened the scoring with a sensational individual effort.
  <br>
  <br>
  Newcastle quickly levelled twice in the first half through Alexander Isak and Harvey Barnes, either side of Yoane Wissa's second for Brentford.
  <br>
  <br>
  But calamitous defending cost Newcastle in the second period when Nathan Collins prodded home from goalkeeper Mark Flekken's long ball forward.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kevin Schade then sealed the points for the Bees.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The players are growing, a lot of the players here for a while have taken another step up," said Brentford boss Thomas Frank, whose team are seventh in the table.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I would like to carry on this home form but some wins on the road would be welcome too."
  <br>
  <br>
  Aston Villa beat bottom-of-the-table Southampton 1-0 thanks to Jhon Duran's goal in his first Premier League start of the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool's postponement means Arsenal and Chelsea have the chance the cut the gap at the top to four points later on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Gunners travel to Fulham while Chelsea are at Tottenham. (AFP)

    Notre Dame re-opens five years after fire

<div class="itemFullText">
 The archbishop of Paris re-opened Notre Dame cathedral on Saturday by symbolically knocking on the doors and entering the 12th-century landmark which has been restored after a devastating fire in 2019.
 <br>
  <br>
  Wearing new designer vestments and carrying a staff cut from one of the roof beams that survived the inferno, Laurent Ulrich joined hundreds of VIPs inside the Gothic masterpiece for a two-hour ceremony.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ulrich commanded the cathedral to "open your doors" and he entered the magnificently-restored edifice.
  <br>
  <br>
  US President-elect Donald Trump sat on the front row as guest of honour next to French President Emmanuel Macron, with invitees marvelling at the freshly cleaned walls, new furniture and state-of-the-art lightening installed as part of the cathedral's overhaul.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other dignitaries in attendance included outgoing US first lady Jill Biden and Prince William.
  <br>
  <br>
  Outside, small crowds of Parisians and tourists braved wet weather and high winds to witness the renaissance of a beloved monument which came close to being totally destroyed by the inferno that toppled its roof and spire.
  <br>
  <br>
  The reconstruction effort has cost around US$750 million, financed from donations, with the re-opening achieved within a five-year deadline set by Macron despite predictions it could take decades.
  <br>
  <br>
  Workers had to overcome problems with lead pollution, the Covid-19 epidemic, and the army general overseeing the project falling to his death while hiking in the Pyrenees last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is "a cathedral like we have never seen before," Philippe Jost, who took over as project manager last year, told Franceinfo radio, adding that he was proud to "show the whole world" a "great collective success and a source of pride for all of France".
  <br>
  <br>
  Saturday's service featured prayer, organ music and hymns from the cathedral's choir.
  <br>
  <br>
  A public concert planned in front of the cathedral featuring Chinese piano virtuoso Lang Lang and possibly US singer and fashion designer Pharrell Williams had to be pre-recorded on Friday night because of the stormy weather. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 US President-elect Donald Trump on Saturday said that the world was "a little crazy" as he met President Emmanuel Macron in Paris ahead of the re-opening of Notre Dame cathedral on his first international trip since his re-election.
 <br>
  <br>
  The two men embraced and shook hands several times on the steps of the French presidential palace, with Trump given a full guard of honour.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It seems like the world is going a little crazy right now and we will be talking about that," Trump told reporters as he prepared to sit down for talks with Macron.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite tensions between the two men during his first term, Trump hailed his ties with the centrist French leader, saying, "We had a great relationship as everyone knows. We accomplished a lot."
  <br>
  <br>
  Macron told Trump it was "a great honour for French people to welcome you" for the re-opening ceremony at Notre Dame, which was devastated by a blaze in 2019 during Trump's first term.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You were president at that time and I remember the solidarity and the immediate reaction," Macron added, speaking in English.
  <br>
  <br>
  When he first took office in 2017, Trump's ties with Macron, then also a fresh face on the world stage, began warmly despite some political differences.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky arrived at the Elysee Palace soon after and the trio posed for pictures before commencing talks.
  <br>
  <br>
  They held trilateral talks on topics including the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East, as well as trade. (AFP)

 US national champion Amber Glenn stunned three-time world champion Kaori Sakamoto to win women's gold ahead of five Japanese figure skaters at the ISU Grand Prix final on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Glenn extended her lead from the short programme in the free skating final in south-eastern France, scoring a total of 212.07 points after two performances which both included her signature triple axel jump.
  <br>
  <br>
  The elite six-skater competition included five Japanese skaters with Mone Chiba taking silver with 208.85 points and defending champion Sakamoto bronze with 201.13.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sakamoto had not been beaten in a major competition since the 2022 Grand Prix final.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 24-year-old Olympic bronze medallist paid for a fall on a triple toeloop which cost her points in the short programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  Glenn, 25, who won both her Grand Prix events in Angers, France and China this year, had not won an international event before this season and steps into the spotlight just over a year ahead of the 2026 Winter Olympics.
  <br>
  <br>
  She becomes the first American woman to win the Grand Prix final, the third major event in the skating calendar after the Olympics and world championships, since Alissa Czisny in 2010.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Defending champion Ding Liren and his teenage challenger Gukesh Dommaraju of India remained even on Saturday with only four games to go in their World Chess Championship match.
 <br>
  <br>
  The score is deadlocked at five points each after 10 games in the 14-match series as both agreed to a draw.
  <br>
  <br>
  Each player has won one game apiece, with Ding taking the opening match on November 25 and Guksesh coming back to defeat the champion in game three. The rest ended in draws.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ding, 32, gained an early advantage on Saturday playing with the white pieces but the game soon fizzled to a draw as neither player made any inroads after 36 moves.
  <br>
  <br>
  As the tournament neared the homestretch, both players admitted that each move will be crucial.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Now, the cost of one game is higher than it was maybe ... a few games before," the 18-year-old Gukesh said after the match.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But my approach and my goal is still the same: to play good games in every single game."
  <br>
  <br>
  Ding said "there's not so much room to make mistakes" anymore and every loss "will result in a very bad situation."
  <br>
  <br>
  If both remain tied after 14 rounds, the match will move to a tie-breaker, which will be played on December 13.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ding beat Russia's Ian Nepomniachtchi last year to become the world champion in Kazakhstan.
  <br>
  <br>
  At his age, Gukesh is the youngest player in history to compete in the World Championship and he is looking to surpass Garry Kasparov as the youngest undisputed world chess champion. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 An opposition-led motion to impeach South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol over his brief declaration of martial law failed on Saturday as it did not meet the required quorum after his party boycotted the vote.
 <br>
  <br>
  "With a total of 195 votes, the number of members who voted did not reach the required two-thirds majority of the total members. Therefore, I declare that the vote on this matter is not valid," National Assembly speaker Woo Won-shik said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Opposition parties, which hold 192 seats in the 300-seat parliament, earlier filed the impeachment motion, which needed 200 votes to pass and went to the vote on Saturday evening.
  <br>
  <br>
  But almost all 108 members of Yoon's People Power Party (PPP) filed out of the chamber before the vote, prompting critical shouts from the opposition -- with one yelling "Where are you going?" and others calling them "accomplices to insurrection".
  <br>
  <br>
  Only three PPP members cast ballots.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, nearly 150,000 people were estimated by police to have filled the streets around the National Assembly, demanding that lawmakers impeach Yoon for his sudden imposition of martial law four days earlier, which plunged South Korea into turmoil.
  <br>
  <br>
  For hours, people poured into the area around parliament where on Tuesday night soldiers were helicoptered in as part of Yoon's short-lived bid to subvert civilian rule.
  <br>
  <br>
  Before the vote, Yoon, 63, apologised for the turmoil but said he would leave it to his party to decide his fate. (Agencies)
