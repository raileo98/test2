<div class="itemFullText">
 Liverpool moved closer to the Premier League title with a 1-0 win in the Merseyside derby against Everton, while Manchester City beat Leicester 2-0 to bolster their bid to reach the Champions League.
 <br>
  <br>
  With just eight games left, Liverpool sit 12 points clear of second-placed Arsenal, who beat Fulham 2-1 on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arne Slot's side had lost their previous two games in the League Cup final against Newcastle and the Champions League last 16 against Paris Saint-Germain.
  <br>
  <br>
  But they got back on track in their march towards a record-equalling 20th English title and first since 2020 in Slot's maiden season in charge.
  <br>
  <br>
  Having gone over two months without a goal, Diogo Jota was Liverpool's hero as he ended his drought in the 57th minute, slotting home from Luis Díaz's flick.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was an especially sweet win for Liverpool after their stormy 2-2 draw at Everton in February, which featured a last-gasp equaliser for David Moyes' team.
  <br>
  <br>
  At the Etihad Stadium, City coped just fine without Norway striker Erling Haaland, who will be sidelined for up to seven weeks after suffering an ankle injury in Sunday's FA Cup quarter-final win at Bournemouth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pep Guardiola's men took just two minutes to go in front against second-bottom Leicester, who have lost seven successive league games.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jeremy Doku and Savinho combined to carve open the Leicester defence before Jack Grealish slotted home from close range for his first league goal since December 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  Grealish's long-awaited goal was missed by hundreds of City fans, who stayed outside the stadium for the first nine minutes in protest at the club's deal with a third-party ticket resale company.
  <br>
  <br>
  The protestors did get to see City double their advantage in the 29th minute as Egypt forward Omar Marmoush lashed home after Leicester goalkeeper Mads Hermansen made a hash of dealing with Ruben Dias's pass.
  <br>
  <br>
  City are up to fourth place, one point ahead of fifth-placed Newcastle and two in front of sixth-placed Chelsea, who face Tottenham in their game in hand on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The top four qualify for the Champions League automatically, while fifth place is likely to also provide a berth in Europe's elite club competition.
  <br>
  <br>
  Newcastle beat Brentford 2-1 to maintain the party mood after the prolonged celebrations of their first major trophy for 56 years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eddie Howe's side were back in action for the first time since beating Liverpool in the League Cup final.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alexander Isak met Jacob Murphy's cross with a typically predatory strike in first-half stoppage time at St James' Park.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brentford levelled through Bryan Mbeumo's 66th-minute penalty after Newcastle keeper Nick Pope tripped Yoane Wissa.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Sandro Tonali lashed home from Harvey Barnes' assist in the 74th minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  Aston Villa also remain in the hunt for a Champions League place after winning 3-0 at Brighton.
  <br>
  <br>
  Marcus Rashford struck in the 51st minute, accelerating onto Morgan Rogers' pass for his third goal in his last two games.
  <br>
  <br>
  Marco Asensio killed off Brighton in the 78th minute and Donyell Malen netted in added time to lift Villa into seventh place, two points behind Newcastle.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Southampton wasted a chance to avoid becoming the worst team in Premier League history after a 1-1 draw with Crystal Palace at St Mary's. (AFP)

    Israel to seize 'large areas' of Gaza
   </title>

<img alt="Israel carries out deadly air strikes in southern and central Gaza. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798686_1_20250402213633.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Israel said on Wednesday it would expand its military operations and seize "large areas" of the Gaza Strip where rescuers said 34 people were killed in Israeli strikes, including on a United Nations building.
 <br>
  <br>
  Defence Minister Israel Katz said Israel would bolster its military presence in the Palestinian territory to "destroy and clear the area of terrorists and terrorist infrastructure".
  <br>
  <br>
  The operation would "seize large areas that will be incorporated into Israeli security zones", he said in a statement, without specifying how much territory.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gaza's civil defence agency said at least 19 people were killed, including nine children, when an Israeli strike "targeted an UNRWA (UN agency for Palestinian refugees) building housing a medical clinic in Jabalia refugee camp".
  <br>
  <br>
  The Israeli army said in a statement that it struck Hamas militants "inside a command and control centre" in north Gaza's Jabalia. It separately confirmed the building housed a UN clinic.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Palestinian foreign ministry, based in the occupied West Bank, condemned the "massacre at the UNRWA clinic in Jabalia" and called for "serious international pressure" to halt Israel's widening offensive.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel has on several occasions conducted strikes on UNRWA buildings housing displaced people in Gaza, where fighting has raged for most of the past 18 months.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Israeli military accuses Hamas of hiding in school buildings where thousands of Gazans have sought shelter – a charge denied by the Palestinian militant group.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel also carried out deadly air strikes in southern and central Gaza on Wednesday. The civil defence said dawn strikes killed at least 13 people in Khan Yunis and two in Nuseirat refugee camp.
  <br>
  <br>
  Katz warned last week that the military would soon "operate with full force" in more parts of Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  In February, he announced plans for an agency to oversee the "voluntary departure" of Palestinians from the territory.
  <br>
  <br>
  That followed Israel's backing of a proposal from US President Donald Trump for the United States to take over the territory after relocating its 2.4 million Palestinian inhabitants. The proposal outraged Gazans and drew widespread international condemnation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel resumed intense bombing of Gaza on March 18 before launching a new ground offensive, ending a nearly two-month ceasefire. (AFP)

    Govt seeks interest in ecotourism projects

<img alt="The government wants to develop Pak Nai into an ecotourism destination. Photo: Development Bureau" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798669_1_20250402192137.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Development Bureau announced on Wednesday that it is inviting expressions of interest for three major ecotourism projects in outlying islands and coastal areas.
 <br>
  <br>
  This is the first time in recent years that the government has released large areas of land to build new attractions for tourism and recreation.
  <br>
  <br>
  The projects are: transforming the Ex-Lamma Quarry site into a high-end lakeside resort; developing a new Eco-Recreation Corridor in South Lantau; and creating ecotourism nodes at Tsim Bei Tsui and Pak Nai.
  <br>
  <br>
  A bureau spokesperson said officials are seeking market input before starting statutory planning procedures, to ensure the projects better align with market interests.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Ex-Lamma Quarry project envisions a luxury resort complex featuring a 5-hectare artificial lake, a marina that can accommodate 150 to 200 yachts, as well as low-density housing development.
  <br>
  <br>
  To ensure coordinated planning, officials aim to have a single developer manage the site.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 9.3-hectare South Lantau Eco-Recreation Corridor – spanning Cheung Sha, Pui O, Shui Hau and Shek Pik – will feature adventure resorts and ecotourism facilities.
  <br>
  <br>
  Developers may choose to develop the entire corridor or focus on individual facilities.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Tsim Bei Tsui and Pak Nai nodes, covering 87 and 33 hectares respectively, will become tourist spots featuring restaurants, wellness centres and holiday resorts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Multiple developers can participate in this project, and local villagers will have the opportunity to become business partners.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bureau will hold briefing sessions for each project on April 14, and interested parties have until July 2 to submit their expressions of interest.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials said the three projects are expected to cost tens of billions of dollars each.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government plans to open the Ex-Lamma Quarry project for bidding in the second half of 2026, and expects it will take around six to seven years to complete.

<img alt="CK Hutchison has announced plans to sell its ports, including assets along the Panama Canal. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798683_1_20250402211035.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office (HKMAO) on Wednesday reposted an article by the Ta Kung Pao newspaper voicing opposition to CK Hutchison's plans to sell dozens of ports, including strategic assets along the Panama Canal.
 <br>
  <br>
  The article said CK Hutchison is an important Hong Kong-based firm, and it should bear its basic responsibilities and fix its mistakes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The piece included views from various political and business leaders, including vice-chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and former chief executive CY Leung who said national interests are most important.
  <br>
  <br>
  He questioned if the US government would give the green light if China wants to buy US chip enterprises and the firms are willing to sell.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing officials in charge of SAR affairs have reposted a number of commentaries at the Ta Kung Pao newspaper, criticising the proposed sale to a US consortium led by investment firm BlackRock.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police said on Wednesday more suspects have been arrested in connection with the murder of a 52-year-old man in Fo Tan last month.
 <br>
  <br>
  One of the suspects is a 25-year-old man who was taken into custody in Thailand earlier and has since returned to Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officers said he was arrested near Pattaya and sent back to the SAR on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police believe he was one of two people who carried out the attack.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Wednesday afternoon, the suspect was taken to Fo Tan where officers reconstructed the case.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officers said he will be charged soon.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police also revealed that two others were arrested earlier on suspicion of assisting offenders.
  <br>
  <br>
  So far, eight out of the nine suspects linked to the case have been arrested by Hong Kong or mainland police, including a 76-year-old man and his son who allegedly planned the attack.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking in a media briefing, superintendent Li Muk-yik said the remaining suspect, who allegedly served as a lookout, had fled to the mainland and remains at large.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also said the force was able to identify all the suspects after going through surveillance cameras.
  <br>
  <br>
  Li added that the probe has been challenging.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The suspects [allegedly] put fake licence plates on taxis [as they fled]. They were very cautious before and after the incident," he told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They had [allegedly] changed their clothes and the vehicles several times after they fled."
  <br>
  <br>
  Li said the case was triggered by disputes over money.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Rescue teams from the SAR and the mainland have joined hands in finding a survivor in the quake-rattled Myanmar city of Mandalay.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 52-year-old man had been trapped in the rubble of a hotel for more than 120 hours.
  <br>
  <br>
  The joint rescue came five days after the earthquake, beyond what is typically considered the critical "golden" period for finding survivors.
  <br>
  <br>
  The man was found in stable condition and has been transferred to local medical facilities for treatment.
  <br>
  <br>
  This marks the ninth survivor rescued by the national team since their deployment to Myanmar.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a Facebook post, security minister Chris Tang expressed gratitude to members of both the national and SAR squads.
  <br>
  <br>
  Deputy chief fire officer Cheu Yu-kok, who led the 51-strong SAR team, said they spared no effort in the search and rescue work.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The team will grasp every opportunity, never give up and do its best to find the remaining survivors," he said.

    Tibet tourist numbers soar to all-time high

<img alt="The Potala Palace in Lhasa is a top tourist attraction. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798638_1_20250402164919.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Visitor numbers to the Tibet region reached 63 million last year, its highest ever.
 <br>
  <br>
  Travel agencies in Hong Kong, meanwhile, said more people from the SAR have visited Tibet since the launch of a direct flight in February.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Potala Palace in Lhasa is considered a must-see attraction by many travellers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking in an interview with RTHK, Kunga Tashi, deputy director at the palace's management office, said the number of tourists has increased notably after the pandemic, rising by up to 30 percent each year over the past two years.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said there are moves to limit the number of visitors, to ensure better tourism experience and protect the landmark.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If we look at 2024, the number of trips was about 2.01 million. We have set restrictions on the visitor headcount to the palace, capped at 7,000 each day," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The number of visits by Hong Kong travellers to Tibet is on the rise after a direct flight service between the SAR and Lhasa was launched in late February.
  <br>
  <br>
  This came after Beijing announced the expansion of the Individual Visit Scheme last year to allow residents from Lhasa to visit the SAR on a solo basis, instead of being part of a tour group.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some SAR agencies told RTHK more people have expressed interest in heading to Tibet since the launch of the direct flight, and group tours have been fully booked through May.
  <br>
  <br>
  A Hong Kong visitor travelling to Lhasa told RTHK that she enjoyed visiting the region.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have just arrived from the Nyingchi area... I think Lhasa is a must-visit city if you travel to Tibet," she said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A Singaporean teenager allegedly planning to kill dozens of Muslims outside several mosques has been detained, the city-state's Internal Security Department (ISD) said on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 17-year-old boy was detained in March, the ISD said in a statement, adding that he had regarded white supremacist Brenton Tarrant – who in 2019 had killed worshippers at mosques in New Zealand – as a "hero".
  <br>
  <br>
  ISD also said he had "identified as an 'East Asian supremacist'", and had decided on five mosques across Singapore for his post-Friday prayer attacks.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This boy wanted to kill at least 100 Muslims, so that he can kill more Muslims than Tarrant had killed. He also wanted to live-stream his attacks," Home Minister K Shanmugam said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When he was arrested... he had already made a number of attempts to get a gun. He told ISD quite openly if he had gotten a gun, he would have carried out his attacks."
  <br>
  <br>
  The teen had been in online contact with 18-year-old Nick Lee, who was detained in December for having similar plans.
  <br>
  <br>
  The multicultural country has seen several cases in recent years where young Singaporeans have been detained for allegedly making attack plans following exposure to extremist content online.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2024, authorities arrested a teenage boy who was allegedly planning an Islamic State group-inspired stabbing attack at a busy suburb.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the same statement Wednesday, the ISD also said a 15-year-old girl was placed under a restriction order in February, forbidding her from travelling nor having access to the internet without the approval of the ISD director.
  <br>
  <br>
  It alleged that between July 2023 and December 2024, the girl was in at least eight short-term romantic online relationships with overseas-based Islamic State group supporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "She went to pledge allegiance to an ISIS chatbot," said Shanmugam.
  <br>
  <br>
  "She wanted to fight and die for ISIS, she looked up flights to go to Syria, she thought of how she was going to save money to plan for her travels."
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that the trend of rising radicalism and extremism of young people via the internet was "concerning".
  <br>
  <br>
  ISD said "self-radicalisation can happen very quickly".
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the case of the 15-year-old, it only took weeks," it said, appealing for the public to "be vigilant to signs". (AFP)

 China strongly urges all parties in Myanmar to ensure the safety of earthquake relief workers and supplies from China and other countries, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  In response to a query at a daily press briefing, Guo Jiakun said relief supplies provided by the Red Cross Society of China have arrived in Myanmar and are on their way to the disaster-stricken area of Mandalay.
  <br>
  <br>
  "At present, relief workers and supplies are safe," Guo said.
  <br>
  <br>
  That came after Myanmar's junta said earlier in the day that its troops had fired warning shots when a Chinese Red Cross convoy failed to stop while approaching a conflict area to deliver aid to earthquake victims.
  <br>
  <br>
  The group of nine vehicles was approaching Ommati village in northern Shan State on Tuesday night, and failed to stop when signalled by soldiers, junta spokesman Zaw Min Tun said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "From a distance of around 200 metres, security forces used a light to try to halt them but they did not stop," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The security forces fired three gunshots aiming at the sky."
  <br>
  <br>
  International aid and rescue workers have been coming in to Myanmar, including from its close ally China, since Friday's 7.7-magnitude quake, which has killed close to 2,800 people and left thousands homeless.
  <br>
  <br>
  But access to the worst-hit areas has been hindered by wrecked roads, poor telecommunications and ongoing violence between the junta and rebel militias.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zaw Min Tun said the convoy belonged to the Chinese Red Cross and that the junta was investigating the incident.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shan state has been the scene of intense fighting between the junta and ethnic minority armed groups which have seized control of large areas of territory. (AFP/Xinhua)

 China on Wednesday warned the Philippines against threatening "regional peace" after the United States said it had approved the possible sale of US$5.58 billion in F-16 fighter jets to Manila.
 <br>
  <br>
  "The Philippines' defence and security cooperation with other countries should not target any third party or harm the interests of a third party," Foreign Ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Nor should it threaten regional peace and security or exacerbate regional tensions."
  <br>
  <br>
  The US State Department said it was green-lighting a sale that includes 20 F-16 jets and related equipment to the Philippines, a treaty-bound ally of the United States. (AFP)

 The psychological well-being of Hong Kong's secondary school pupils improved slightly in the last academic year but was still worse than before the pandemic, the Department of Health said on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  About 430,000 children in primary and secondary education received student health services in the 2023/24 school year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Data from the department's annual report shows 2.8 percent of secondary pupils reported having had plans to take their own lives, while 1.3 percent said they had actually attempted suicide.
  <br>
  <br>
  This figures were up from the 2.5 percent and 1.1 percent recorded in 2018/19.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is self-reported, so it may not represent the whole story. Some students may not wish to tell in the questionnaire... It may be underestimated or overestimated," said community medicine consultant Chuang Shuk-kwan.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If they say yes to the attempted suicide or planned suicide, we are very concerned and we will provide them individual counselling, and if necessary, we will refer them to the specialist or even A&E departments, if there is indeed an emergency."
  <br>
  <br>
  Dr Chuang also said that over 40 percent of primary school students and 80 percent of secondary school students spent two or more hours per day using electronic screens for recreational purposes.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said the increased screen time among students may worsen their vision.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Commerce chief Algernon Yau on Wednesday stressed that merging the city's public broadcaster and the government's public relations office might not be the most effective way to cut expenditure, saying the two bodies do not overlap in their functions.
 <br>
  <br>
  In response to questions from lawmaker Junius Ho on the feasibility of combining RTHK and the Information Services Department (ISD), the secretary for commerce and economic development said a merger might be "counterproductive" when it comes to the administration's overall public relations work.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Merging the two departments with distinct functions may not be the most effective way to increase revenue and reduce expenditure in terms of overall operations," he told the legislature.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The public may confuse the role of RTHK, as a public service broadcaster, with that of the ISD, as the government promoter. This may be counterproductive to the government's overall public relations works, which is not advisable."
  <br>
  <br>
  New People's Party lawmaker Regina Ip said the two departments should increase the use of artificial intelligence to reduce manpower, suggesting there could be redundancy given her past interviews with the public broadcaster.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yau said in response that RTHK has been using artificial intelligence to produce its programmes to cut spending.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another lawmaker, Carmen Kan, urged RTHK to better promote the administration's policies, to which the commerce minister said the public broadcaster is introducing a brand new show on top of existing current affairs programmes.

 Chinese electric vehicle battery giant CATL said on Wednesday that it will partner with state-owned oil giant Sinopec to build 10,000 battery swap stations.
 <br>
  <br>
  As part of a strategic deal signed in Beijing, the two companies will build at least 500 battery swap stations this year, according to a company statement, which did not give a timeline to set up these stations.
  <br>
  <br>
  The partnership will be based on CATL's "choco-swap" battery swapping and Qiji chassis battery-swapping solution to "break through the driving range bottlenecks of passenger vehicles and heavy-duty trucks," the company said. (Reuters)

    New police chief will lead force well: Regina Ip

<div class="itemFullText">
 Executive Council convenor Regina Ip on Wednesday said she believes new police commissioner Joe Chow will lead the force effectively.
 <br>
  <br>
  Ip, who's also the New People's Party chairwoman, congratulated Chow on his appointment.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said she is not too familiar with him, but has observed his performance in the Executive Council.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Because of his rich experience in policing, along with his good cooperation with Raymond Siu, who has just stepped down from his post, I am very confident that he will definitely lead the force effectively by upholding the spirit of honour, duty and loyalty," Ip said.
  <br>
  <br>
  With the United States hitting another six SAR and mainland officials with sanctions this week, Ip said Chow would be dedicated to his duties and unaffected by such intimidation if he were also to be sanctioned.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, former security minister Lai Tung-kwok, who's now a New People's Party lawmaker, pointed out that Chow is a "very suitable candidate" for the position.
  <br>
  <br>
  The police chief joined the force in 1995 and rose through the ranks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lai told RTHK that all through the force's history the post of commissioner has always been filled from within its ranks "for very obvious reasons".
  <br>
  <br>
  The police, he said, "needs an experienced and capable officer to lead the force, and they have a very well-established succession plan.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Given Joe's long outstanding service within the force, I think he is a very suitable candidate."
  <br>
  <br>
  One of Chow's key targets is to promote smart policing, which Lai said is crucial.
  <br>
  <br>
  This is because smart policing is the only viable solution for the force to deliver the best performance with limited, or even reduced, allocations of resources available within the government, he added.

 China's embassy in Bangkok called on the country's companies operating abroad to comply with local laws after a Chinese construction firm came under scrutiny over a deadly building collapse in Friday's earthquake.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 30-storey skyscraper, set to house Thai government offices, collapsed in Bangkok when a 7.7-magnitude earthquake struck neighbouring Myanmar.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have to investigate where the mistake happened," said Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra, who has ordered a probe into the materials used at the construction site and its safety standards.
  <br>
  <br>
  "What happened from the beginning since it was designed?" she said earlier. "How was this design approved? This was not the first building in the country."
  <br>
  <br>
  The development near Bangkok's popular Chatuchak market was a joint project involving China Railway No 10 Engineering Group (Thailand), an offshoot of China Railway Group.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Chinese embassy in Thailand late on Tuesday expressed "deepest condolences" for the collapse and urged firms to "strictly" comply with Thai laws.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Newly appointed Commissioner of Police Joe Chow has vowed to prioritise safeguarding national security, modernising law enforcement and consolidating team culture in the force.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to the media after succeeding Raymond Siu on Wednesday, Chow emphasised the importance of enhancing public awareness of national security.
  <br>
  <br>
  "After five years of the enactment of the national security law, I think, still, the society or even some members of the public... we want them to understand more about what we mean by national security," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is by far the most important because after all we understand... if we don't have any national security, I don't think that we have a very stable society at all."
  <br>
  <br>
  The police chief also said he would prioritise smart policing initiatives by leveraging technology to improve operational efficiency, work effectiveness and the quality of services.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also highlighted the need to cultivate cohesion within the force by fostering shared values and the sense of belonging through improved career development opportunities and more comprehensive support to officers.
  <br>
  <br>
  When asked about recent sanctions imposed on his predecessor, Chow stressed the importance of focusing on enhancing police operations amid adversity, rather than succumbing to fear.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think everyone can see that the US government has used sanctions, which is a barbaric tactic, in an attempt to intimidate public officials, especially members of the police force," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Its objective is to suppress us and divert our focus from national security.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This very reaction underscores that the measures we are implementing are effective and successful. Thus, it becomes even more important for us to intensify our efforts"
  <br>
  <br>
  Chow added that he will lead the police force with unwavering courage to confront the challenges.

    Seoul braces for clashes over Yoon ruling

<img alt="Police officers get ready for a potential showdown on Friday between pro and anti-Yoon supporters near the entrance of the Constitutional Court in Seoul. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798612_1_20250402141524.jpg&q=80">

<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korean police will mobilise "all available resources" to prevent violence when a court rules on Friday on the fate of impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol, with top tourist sites to close and embassies warning citizens to stay away.
 <br>
  <br>
  The country's Constitutional Court will issue a ruling on whether to strip Yoon of office over his abortive declaration of martial law, which has already seen him suspended by lawmakers and arrested on insurrection charges.
  <br>
  <br>
  The court in downtown Seoul has become a flashpoint, with near-constant protests in the area until the police moved on Tuesday to seal off the streets to head off possible clashes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The situation has become more grave than ever," Lee Ho-young, acting chief of the Korean National Police Agency, said on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hundreds of thousands of people for and against Yoon have poured onto Seoul's streets every weekend, with die-hards on each side also setting up tent camps and staging all-night protests.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police are concerned that whatever verdict is announced, some people "may become agitated and engage in extreme or violent protests", said Lee during a meeting with top police officials.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon's supporters stormed a court building in January after a judge extended the suspended president's detention. He was later released from custody on procedural grounds.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The police will mobilise all available resources to ensure the safety of the public and to prevent the situation from escalating into serious social conflict," said Lee.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Seoul, more than 14,000 riot police will be deployed.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than a dozen nearby schools and several shops in the neighbourhood will close on the day of the verdict due to safety issues.
  <br>
  <br>
  Major tourist sites such as the Gyeongbok and Changdeok palaces, within walking distances from the court, will also be shuttered, the Korean Heritage Service said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Chinese embassy in Seoul warned its nationals to keep away from local political protests.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Do not participate, do not linger, do not watch," it posted on its social media channels.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Do not publicly express or forward political comments, and try to avoid verbal or physical confrontations with local people."
  <br>
  <br>
  Acting President Han Duck-soo urged political leaders to refrain from making remarks that could incite or encourage illegal protests or violence.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Regardless of the outcome, we must calmly and rationally accept the court's decision," he said during a meeting with ministry officials.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Now is a time to prioritise the stability and survival of our community over political advantages or disadvantages," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  If Yoon is stripped of office by the court, it will trigger elections which must be held within 60 days. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Rescuers on Wednesday pulled a man alive from the rubble five days after Myanmar's devastating earthquake, as calls grew for the junta to allow more aid in and halt attacks on rebels.
 <br>
  <br>
  The shallow 7.7-magnitude earthquake on Friday flattened buildings across Myanmar, killing more than 2,700 people and making thousands more homeless.
  <br>
  <br>
  Several leading armed groups fighting the military have suspended hostilities during the quake recovery, but junta chief Min Aung Hlaing vowed to continue "defensive activities" against "terrorists".
  <br>
  <br>
  UN agencies, rights groups and foreign governments have urged all sides in Myanmar's civil war to stop fighting and focus on helping those affected by the quake, the biggest to hit the country in decades.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hopes of finding more survivors are fading, but there was a moment of joy on Wednesday as a man was pulled alive from the ruins of a hotel in the capital Naypyidaw.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 26-year-old hotel worker was extracted by a joint Myanmar-Turkish team shortly after midnight, the fire service and junta said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dazed and dusty but conscious, the man was pulled through a hole in the rubble and put on a stretcher, video posted on Facebook by the Myanmar Fire Services Department shows. (AFP)

    Actor Val Kilmer loses bout with pnemonia

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 American actor Val Kilmer, who was first propelled to fame with "Top Gun" and went on to starring roles as Batman and Jim Morrison, has died at age 65, the New York Times reported.
 <br>
  <br>
  The cause of death was pneumonia, his daughter Mercedes Kilmer told the Times on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said he had been diagnosed with throat cancer in 2014 and later recovered.
  <br>
  <br>
  Originally a stage actor, Kilmer got his start on the big screen with Cold War spoof "Top Secret!" in 1984.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two years later, he gained fame as the cocky, if mostly silent aviator Iceman in "Top Gun", playing a rival to Tom Cruise's Maverick.
  <br>
  <br>
  A versatile actor whose career spanned decades, Kilmer got a shot at leading man roles in Oliver Stone's "The Doors" and took a turn as the masked Gotham vigilante in "Batman Forever", playing Bruce Wayne after Michael Keaton and before George Clooney.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kilmer was the youngest person ever accepted to New York's fabled Juilliard school and longed to make serious films. But he found himself in a series of schlocky blockbusters and expensive flops in the early 2000s.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chastened by a decade or more of low-budget movies, he was mounting a comeback in the 2010s with a successful stage show about Mark Twain that he hoped to turn into a film, when he was struck by cancer.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Val", a documentary about his stratospheric rise and later fall in Hollywood showed him rasping for air, premiered at the Cannes film festival in 2021.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kilmer recently returned to movie theaters in 2021 with a cameo reprising his role as Iceman in "Top Gun: Maverick", the long-awaited sequel to the 1986 hit. (AFP)

<img alt="Bondi beach in Sydney was hit by a 5.5-metre wave. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798598_1_20250402124618.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Sydney beachfront properties were flooded and coastal infrastructure damaged after a large swell combined with a king tide to batter the Australian shore, officials said on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Several homes were evacuated at Botany Bay in Sydney’s south around midnight as waves surged across the coast, according to New South Wales State Emergency Service spokesman Andrew Edmunds.
  <br>
  <br>
  Further north at Sydney’s premier Bondi Beach, the coast was lashed by a 5.5-metre swell, officials said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Windows were shattered at Bondi Icebergs Swimming Club, a waterfront pool, gymnasium and restaurant complex.
  <br>
  <br>
  CCTV footage showed waves bursting through glass doors after 11 pm on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It has just been devastating,” club general manager Bob Tate said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I’ve been a member for 50 years at Bondi. I’ve never seen this sort of thing before.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You know, the sheer magnitude of the level of water and the power of the water coming through must’ve just been horrendous.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Tate added that on the pool deck around 15 glass panels were splintered, floors were damaged, and cupboards and firehoses were ripped off the walls. It was “quite extraordinary,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  South of Botany Bay at Cronulla Beach, lifeguard Steve Winner said the beach, along with parts of the pavement behind it and electrical infrastructure, had been damaged by four-metre waves.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities warned on Wednesday of further hazardous surf with the potential to cause coastal erosion and damage from the Illawarra region south of Sydney to the Hunter region north of Sydney. (AP)

    Beijing puts store in EVs for shoring up power grids

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China plans to launch pilot projects in nine cities that would use the country's growing fleet of electric vehicles as batteries to shore up power supply on the grid during spikes in demand, according to a government announcement on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The move follows on rules issued last year by state planner the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) to strengthen the integration of new energy vehicles with the grid amid concerns the rapid adoption of EVs would overwhelm the generation and transmission systems.
  <br>
  <br>
  The majority of the 30 projects in cities including Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen and Guangzhou are vehicle-to-grid or V2G, according to the announcement by the NDRC and energy regulator.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cars would act as batteries, storing power and sending it back into the grid.
  <br>
  <br>
  Grid-connected cars could also adjust their charging times to avoid peak periods and provide critical services such as frequency regulation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Providing those services could potentially become an alternative revenue stream for homeowners or operators of charging stations.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to the notice, power grid companies are responsible for setting up the pilots, and provincial governments should lead the development of charging facilities.
  <br>
  <br>
  The energy regulator is tasked with supporting the participation of grid-connected vehicle applications in power trading.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last year, NDRC said it would set up over 50 pilot programmes by 2025.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, industry experts say there are a range of hurdles to overcome before the large-scale adoption of V2G, such as developing viable business models.
  <br>
  <br>
  NDRC also said in the 2024 rule that battery technologies need to be improved. (Reuters)

    Trump-backed candidate loses Wisconsin court election

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Democratic-backed candidate for Wisconsin Supreme Court defeated a challenger endorsed by US President Donald Trump and billionaire Elon Musk, touting her victory as a win against powerful interests and cementing a liberal majority for at least three more years.
 <br>
  <br>
  Susan Crawford, a Dane County judge who led legal fights to protect union power and abortion rights and to oppose voter ID, stood on stage surrounded by the court's four current liberal justices and celebrated her win as a victory for democracy while also taking a dig at Musk.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Growing up in Chippewa Falls, I never could have imagined that I would be taking on the richest man in the world for justice in Wisconsin,” Crawford said. “And we won.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Musk and groups he backed had spent more than US$21 million in an effort to defeat Crawford. Musk even traveled to Wisconsin two days before the election to personally hand over US$1 million checks to two voters.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Today Wisconsinites fended off an unprecedented attack on our democracy, our fair elections and our Supreme Court,” Crawford said in her victory speech.
  <br>
  <br>
  “And Wisconsin stood up and said loudly that justice does not have a price, our courts are not for sale.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Crawford defeated Republican-backed Brad Schimel in a race that broke records for spending, was the highest-turnout Wisconsin Supreme Court election ever and became a proxy fight for the nation’s political battles.
  <br>
  <br>
  Musk was silent on his X platform in the wake of Crawford’s victory, reposting a message about Vietnam and tariffs but nothing on the Supreme Court contest.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump, Musk and other Republicans lined up behind Schimel, a former state attorney general.
  <br>
  <br>
  Democrats including former president Barack Obama and billionaire megadonor George Soros backed Crawford .
  <br>
  <br>
  The first major election in the country since November was seen as a litmus test of how voters feel about Trump’s first months back in office and the role played by Musk, whose Department of Government Efficiency has torn through federal agencies and laid off thousands of workers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Musk traveled to Wisconsin on Sunday to make a pitch for Schimel.
  <br>
  <br>
  Crawford was beating Schimel by more than eight points, based on unofficial results.
  <br>
  <br>
  Turnout exceeded 52 percent of the voting age population, topping the record set in 2023 of nearly 40 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Spending was on its way to surpass US$100 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  Schimel told his supporters he had conceded to Crawford, leading to yells of anger. One woman began to chant, “Cheater, cheater!”
  <br>
  <br>
  “No,” Schimel said. “You’ve got to accept the results.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The court can decide election-related laws and settle disputes over future election outcomes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Crawford embraced the backing of Planned Parenthood and other abortion rights advocates, running ads that highlighted Schimel’s opposition to the procedure.
  <br>
  <br>
  She also attacked Schimel for his ties to Musk and Republicans, referring to Musk as “Elon Schimel” during a debate.
  <br>
  <br>
  Schimel’s campaign tried to portray Crawford as weak on crime and puppet of Democrats who, if elected, would push to redraw congressional district boundary lines to hurt Republicans and repeal a GOP-backed state law that took collective bargaining rights away from most public workers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Voters in Eau Claire seemed to respond to both messages. Jim Seeger, a 68-year-old retiree, said he voted for Schimel because he was concerned about redistricting.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jim Hazelton, a 68-year-old disabled veteran, said he had planned to abstain but voted for Crawford after Musk, whom he called a “pushy billionaire”,  and Trump got involved.
  <br>
  <br>
  “He’s cutting everything,” Hazelton said of Musk.
  <br>
  <br>
  “People need these things he’s cutting.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Crawford’s win keeps the court under a 4-3 liberal majority, as it has been since 2023. A liberal justice is not up for election again until April 2028, ensuring liberals will either maintain or increase their hold on the court until then.
  <br>
  <br>
  Crawford thanked each of the current liberal justices and hugged each of them after her win. One of the four is retiring, creating the open seat she won.
  <br>
  <br>
  The court likely will be deciding cases on abortion, public sector unions, voting rules and congressional district boundaries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Who controls the court also could factor into how it might rule on any future voting challenge in the perennial presidential battleground state, which raised the stakes of the race for national Republicans and Democrats.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump endorsed Schimel just 11 days before the election.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last year the court declined to take up a Democratic-backed challenge to congressional lines, but Schimel and Musk have said that if Crawford won, the court would redraw congressional districts to make them more favorable to Democrats.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Milwaukee, 22-year-old college student Kenneth Gifford said he feels that Trump has done damage to American institutions and that Musk is trying to buy votes.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I want an actual, respectable democracy,” he said. (AP)

    Drivers' pay rises once joining taxi fleet: operator

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The operator of a licensed taxi fleet said drivers’ income had significantly increased since the launch of a new premium cab scheme.
 <br>
  <br>
  But it also expressed concern there were not enough cabbies participating.
  <br>
  <br>
  To improve the quality of taxi services, the Transport Department has granted conditional licences to five operators to form premium fleets.
  <br>
  <br>
  SynCab is among two fleets that have piloted a trial run.
  <br>
  <br>
  People who reserve a ride from a licensed fleet of premium taxis can opt to not pay by the meter and negotiate a fare with the driver instead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on an RTHK programme on Wednesday, the company’s executive director, Sonia Cheng, said their fleet began operations in January and they had already noted a rise in drivers’ income.
  <br>
  <br>
  “When we look at the numbers, average drivers used to be paid, for example, HK$146 when they charge by the meter. For orders in our fleet, the average fare can reach HK$268. This is 84 percent higher than the usual drivers. Over the past three months, we have provided 44,000 passenger trips,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cheng said 30 percent of their customers made bookings on their ride hailing platform and this is one thing many drivers struggle to adjust to as they used to take instant orders from people flagging down a taxi on the street.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked about the timeline for starting a full operation, she said their fleet currently has about 100 taxis and needs at least 150 more to fulfil the government's requirement.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the same programme, Ho Chi-keung from the Motor Transport Workers General Union said from his understanding, drivers were not so enthusiastic about joining a licensed fleet.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There are three main reasons: firstly, they got used to their current work mode. They may face problems with their roster after joining a fleet,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Secondly, it's about the holidays. Some drivers are now working three or four days a week, so it could be hard for them to adjust. It’s also about the deposit. They may need to pay a deposit once joining the fleet.”
  <br>
  <br>
  "That’s why drivers are adopting a wait-and-see attitude.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho said fleet operators should be more proactive in approaching the drivers and to explain to them the relevant terms, including whether a basic salary and holiday are provided and whether there's an employment relationship.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Transport Department has said that the five operators need to commence full services by July to receive the official licence.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters, transport minister Mable Chan said the department has allowed room for fleet operators and drivers to negotiate how they collaborate.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The fleet operators should have their own ideas in how to attract drivers. I hope improvements can be made through greater market competition," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Overall speaking, when the Transport Department granted the conditional licences earlier, we cautiously reviewed the individual proposals. We preserved some flexibility," Chan added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The drivers and operators may not establish an employment relationship. But they share the same vision."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said she has high hopes that the operators will be well-prepared by July.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Stephen Curry scored 52 points and Draymond Green added a triple-double as the Golden State Warriors clinched a crucial 134-125 victory over the Memphis Grizzlies.
 <br>
  <br>
  Curry, the NBA's all-time leader in three-point shooting, once again demonstrated his long-range prowess, draining 12-of-20 attempts from outside the arc at Memphis's FedExForum.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 37-year-old's dazzling shooting performance helped the Warriors vault over the Grizzlies into fifth place in the Western Conference standings, edging them closer to an automatic playoff berth.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Warriors improved to 44-31 while the Grizzlies dropped to sixth place with a 44-32 record. The top six finishers in the West qualify automatically for the postseason.
  <br>
  <br>
  Curry's masterpiece – his second 50-point game of the season and the 15th of his career – was backed by a triple from defensive linchpin Green and 27 points from Jimmy Butler.
  <br>
  <br>
  Green finished with 13 points, 10 rebounds and 12 assists.
  <br>
  <br>
  Warriors coach Steve Kerr lavished praise on Curry's virtuoso display that has left Golden State firmly on course for the playoffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The guy's 37 years old, it's incredible," Kerr said. "Fifty-two points with people draped all over him all game long. The conditioning, the skill, the audacity, the belief, it's incredible to watch Steph at work. "I can't believe he's still doing this at this age. But he's put the work in and he's still got it."
  <br>
  <br>
  Grizzlies interim coach Tuomas Iisalo, who took over the team last week following the shock dismissal of Taylor Jenkins, was similarly effusive of Curry's performance.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's a sight to behold how he operates," Iisalo said, revealing that the team had been helpless to stop a first-quarter onslaught from Curry that included 19 points.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the first quarter we had a specific strategy that we do not want him to get three-point shots – and he found a way to get going anyway. It's very hard to stop a player of that caliber," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Once he gets into that zone, it's very difficult to get him," he continued. "I mean, we're talking about the best movement shooter of all time."
  <br>
  <br>
  Memphis, who trailed by as many as 17 points in the first quarter, were left ruing their inability to sustain a second-half rally which saw them open up a four-point lead with just under four minutes remaining.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ja Morant led the Grizzlies' scoring with 36 points while Jaren Jackson Jr. added 22.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Everybody's hurting in that locker room right now," Iisalo said. "It really hurts when you put everything on the line and you come up a little short. But that's life, that's sports."
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere, Giannis Antetokounmpo scored 37 points as the Milwaukee Bucks snapped a four-game losing streak with a 133-123 victory over the Phoenix Suns.
  <br>
  <br>
  Devin Booker scored 39 points for Phoenix but it was not enough to prevent the Suns from falling to a fourth consecutive defeat – a late-season mini-slump that has imperiled their playoff hopes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Suns are now in 11th place in the West with a 35-41 record, trailing the 10th-placed Sacramento Kings (36-39). Teams ranked 7th to 10th in the conference standings advance to a four-team play-in tournament that determines the final two playoff tickets.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the Indiana Pacers became the latest team to clinch their playoff place after the Atlanta Hawks slumped to a 127-113 home defeat to the Portland Trail Blazers.
  <br>
  <br>
  The result ensured that the Pacers, fourth in the Eastern Conference with a 44-31 record, are guaranteed a top-six finish. (AFP)

    'Subsidised homes give hope to youngsters'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Housing Winnie Ho on Wednesday said authorities are rolling out about 50,000 subsidised residential flats in the next five years to make it easier for youngsters to own a home.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on RTHK’s Overview Policy programme, Ho said although it is difficult for young people to afford a private residential flat, the mindset that youngsters needed to start queuing for public housing when they are 18 years old must be changed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Highlighting the importance of Home Ownership Scheme (HOS) flats, she said it is essential to have a continuous housing supply.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho pointed out the government had rolled out 9,000, 8,000 and 7,000 HOS flats in 2022, 2023 and 2024 respectively, adding that the flats the government has in the pipeline could give them hope.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Looking ahead, we will gradually roll out 45,000 units in the next five years, with the supply from Hong Kong Housing Society, there could be nearly 50,000 flats.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It will give hope for young people to afford to buy their own home, and to strive for upward social mobility, so they won’t try lowering their income just to comply with the asset limits for public housing."
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister said the average price for last year’s HOS flats was HK$2.7 million, and people can get a mortgage of up to 90 percent from banks, meaning they need to save over HK$300,000 for a downpayment with a monthly repayment of around HK$11,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It’s not that unattainable,” Ho added.

 A 25-year-old Hong Kong man wanted by the police for his alleged involvement in a murder in Fo Tan last month has been arrested in Pattaya, Thailand.
 <br>
  <br>
  He will be deported from the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thai media quoted the country's Immigration Bureau as saying that officers made the arrest at a rented house in a beach town on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The man, identified only as Truong, was with his Thai girlfriend at the time.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was reported that Hong Kong authorities had sought assistance from Thailand after an arrest warrant was issued.
  <br>
  <br>
  A 52-year-old man was certified dead after an attack by two men on Lai Wo Lane last month.
  <br>
  <br>

<img alt="Joe Chow takes over as new police chief from his retiring predecessor Raymond Siu. Photo courtesy of the Hong Kong Police Force" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798573_1_20250402103051.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Beijing has named Joe Chow as the new Commissioner of Police, replacing Raymond Siu.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chow was appointed by the State Council following a nomination and suggestion put forward by Chief Executive John Lee, according to Xinhua News Agency on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  He takes over the reins of the force on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The new police chief joined the force in 1995 as an inspector and spent most of his career in criminal investigation and intelligence gathering.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was assigned temporarily to Interpol in France between 2012 and 2013 as a criminal intelligence officer.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chow, who had been a deputy regional commander of Kowloon West at one stage, was known for leading a police operation at the Polytechnic University during the 2019 protests.
  <br>
  <br>
  He further rose through the ranks with a series of promotions since 2020 and assumed the number-two position in the force by 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  As deputy police chief, his public appearances included hosting press conferences relating to test runs for the Kai Tak Sports Park.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, Chief Executive John Lee pointed to Chow's "extensive experience" in a number of areas.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He has a distinguished performance and possesses proven leadership skills. I am confident that he will capably lead the police force in meeting the challenges ahead," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Siu ends his decades-long career with the force by taking his leave on Wednesday. He first took charge of the force in 2021 and had his tenure extended by two years when he reached the retirement age in 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Lee's statement, the chief executive expressed heartfelt appreciation, saying: "Since taking up the appointment as Commissioner of Police in June 2021, Mr Siu has made commendable efforts in maintaining Hong Kong as one of the safest cities in the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He has demonstrated unswerving dedication and determination to safeguarding Hong Kong and upholding the rule of law in dealing with the social unrest... Under his eminent leadership, the police force has continued to excel as a world-class professional law enforcement agency."

    US senator makes record books with 25-hour talk-a-thon

<div class="itemFullText">
 A Democratic US lawmaker shattered a record for the longest speech in Senate history, staying on his feet for more than 25 hours to deliver a fiery protest against President Donald Trump's "unconstitutional" actions.
 <br>
  <br>
  Senator Cory Booker's display of endurance – to hold the floor he had to remain standing and could not even go to the bathroom – recalled the famous scene in Frank Capra's 1939 film classic "Mr Smith Goes to Washington."
  <br>
  <br>
  The longest Senate speech on record before Booker's feat on Tuesday was delivered by South Carolina's Strom Thurmond, who filibustered for 24 hours and 18 minutes against the Civil Rights Act of 1957.
  <br>
  <br>
  Booker, only the fourth Black senator to be popularly elected to the body, blew past that deadline, his voice still strong but emotional as he topped out at 25 hours and five minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The public galleries of the Senate chamber gradually filled as the moment he broke the record approached, with more Democratic lawmakers joining the session – although Republicans largely stayed away.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is a moral moment. It's not left or right. It's right or wrong," Booker said as he wrapped up.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also quoted his mentor John Lewis, a 1960s civil rights movement leader, who urged campaigners to get into "good trouble," before finally pronouncing "Madam President, I yield the floor."
  <br>
  <br>
  The 55-year-old New Jersey native had found a moment for some humour as he passed the record, joking: "I want to go a little bit past this and then I'm going to deal with some of the biological urgencies I'm feeling."
  <br>
  <br>
  A handful of people gathered outside the US Capitol brandishing signs with messages like "Thank you Senator Booker."
  <br>
  <br>
  Although Booker's talk-a-thon was not actually blocking the majority Republican Party from holding votes in the Senate, as would be the case in a true filibuster, his defiance quickly became a rallying point for beleaguered Democrats.
  <br>
  <br>
  Booker, a former presidential candidate, seized command in the chamber at 7 pm on Monday (7 am Hong Kong time on Tuesday) and finished at 8:05 pm on Tuesday (8:05 am on Wednesday).
  <br>
  <br>
  He lashed out at Trump's radical cost-cutting policies that have seen his top advisor Elon Musk, the world's richest person, slash entire government programs without consent from Congress.
  <br>
  <br>
  The senator said Trump's aggressive seizing of ever-more executive power had put US democracy at risk.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Unnecessary hardships are being borne by Americans of all backgrounds," Booker said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And institutions which are special in America, which are precious and which are unique in our country, are being recklessly – and I would say even unconstitutionally – affected, attacked, even shattered.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In just 71 days the president of the United States has inflicted so much harm on Americans' safety, financial stability, the core foundations of our democracy," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he had words of encouragement for Trump opponents, saying as he concluded that "the power of the people is greater than the people in power."
  <br>
  <br>
  Booker later went into detail about how he withstood the physical demands of the speech.
  <br>
  <br>
  "My strategy was to stop eating. I think I stopped eating Friday and then to stop drinking the night before I started on Monday," he said in the Capitol.
  <br>
  <br>
  The approach "had its benefits and had its really downsides... different muscle groups start to really cramp up" with dehydration, he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement sent by his office, Booker added that he was "tired and a little hoarse."
  <br>
  <br>
  Democratic lawmakers, in the minority in both the Senate and House of Representatives, have struggled over how to blunt Trump's efforts to downsize government, ramp up deportations and shred much of the country's political norms.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I just want to thank you for holding vigil for this country all night," Senator Raphael Warnock told Booker on the floor.
  <br>
  <br>
  Booker dedicated much of his speech to criticizing Trump's policies, but to pass the time he also recited poetry, discussed sports and entertained questions from colleagues.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If you love your neighbor, if you love this country, show your love. Stop them from doing what they're trying to [do]," he said. (AFP)

    Mass layoffs at major US health agencies

<img alt='US Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr said "Americans are getting sicker every year". File photo: Reuters' src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798553_1_20250402090430.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Mass layoffs began at the major US health agencies on Tuesday as the Trump administration embarks on a sweeping and scientifically-contested restructuring that will cut 10,000 jobs.
 <br>
  <br>
  US Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr said the layoffs were part of a major reform of his department, aiming to refocus efforts on chronic disease prevention.
  <br>
  <br>
  Calling it a "difficult moment for all of us," Kennedy said "our hearts go out to those who have lost their jobs."
  <br>
  <br>
  "But the reality is clear: what we've been doing isn't working," he added, complaining that "Americans are getting sicker every year" despite increasing spending at the federal agencies guiding US health policy.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to photos and testimonials posted on social media, employees learned of their dismissal early on Tuesday morning by email or by having their access badges not working when they showed up to work in the morning.
  <br>
  <br>
  The layoffs affect the Department of Health and Human Services and the federal agencies it oversees, such as those in charge of approving new drugs (FDA), responding to epidemics (CDC) or medical research (NIH).
  <br>
  <br>
  According to US media reports, several senior officials from these agencies, including Jeanne Marrazzo, who had replaced Anthony Fauci as head of one of the NIH's branches, have been offered reassignment to isolated locations in Alaska or Oklahoma.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The FDA as we've known it is finished, with most of the leaders with institutional knowledge and a deep understanding of product development and safety no longer employed," said Robert Califf, a former FDA commissioner during the Obama and Biden administrations.
  <br>
  <br>
  The move comes despite the country facing its worst measles outbreak in years and mounting fears that bird flu could spark the next human pandemic.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kennedy has alarmed health experts with his rhetoric downplaying the importance of vaccines and even suggesting that avian influenza should be allowed to spread freely among America's poultry. (AFP)

    Volcano erupts in southwestern Iceland

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A volcano in southwestern Iceland - that has erupted repeatedly for more than a year - again belched lava and smoke into the air on Tuesday, just hours after authorities evacuated the few remaining residents of a nearby fishing village.
 <br>
  <br>
  The eruption began at 9:45 am local time, triggering warning sirens in the town of Grindavik where webcams showed molten rock spewing toward the community. It had subsided by late afternoon, though the volcano was still active, Iceland's Met Office said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police and civil defence officials evacuated Grindavik and the Blue Lagoon geothermal spa, one of Iceland’s biggest tourist attractions, after an early morning earthquake swarm suggested an eruption was imminent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The community, located on the Reykjanes Peninsula, was largely evacuated in November 2023 when the volcano came to life after lying dormant for some 800 years.
  <br>
  <br>
  About 40 homes were evacuated on Tuesday, though police reported that some residents refused to leave their homes.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Those individuals who choose to remain in the town don't seem to consider that I have 50 people involved in this operation, some of whom are volunteers,” Ulfar Luovíksson, police commissioner in South Iceland, told local broadcaster RUV. “I would ask that more consideration be shown towards civil defence.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Iceland sits above a volcanic hot spot in the North Atlantic . The most disruptive incident in recent times was the 2010 eruption of the Eyjafjallajokull volcano, which spewed clouds of ash into the atmosphere and disrupted trans-Atlantic air travel for months.
  <br>
  <br>
  Flights were not affected by Tuesday's eruption. (AP)

    Bielefeld shock holders Leverkusen in German Cup

<img alt="Bielefeld players celebrate winning their German Cup semi-final match against Bayern Leverkusen. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798544_1_20250402073801.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 German Cup holders Bayer Leverkusen suffered a shock 2-1 elimination at Arminia Bielefeld in the semi-finals of the competition.
 <br>
  <br>
  Xabi Alonso's side were heavily favoured to reach their second successive final but were outclassed from start to finish by their underdog opponents.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jonathan Tah's 17th-minute goal was cancelled out by a Marius Woerl strike for the hosts three minutes later.
  <br>
  <br>
  Maximilian Grosser's goal in first-half stoppage time would prove the difference for Bielefeld, who have now beaten four top-division opponents on their way to the final.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bielefeld, who have never made a German Cup final, became just the fourth third-division team to reach the showpiece event.
  <br>
  <br>
  Should Bielefeld win in Berlin in May – they will face either RB Leipzig or Stuttgart – the club will be rewarded with a Europa League spot next season.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We didn't need luck at all because we were on the front foot the whole time," home coach Michel Kniat said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kniat said he "normally wouldn't have a drink with the players, but tonight I'll make an exception", adding that "nobody will go to sleep in this city tonight".
  <br>
  <br>
  Leverkusen's Robert Andrich said it was "by far our worst game of the season" and added that "Bielefeld deserved the win tonight, which means we did plenty of things wrong".
  <br>
  <br>
  Leverkusen coach Alonso came into the game having never lost in 10 matches in the competition and needed just one more victory to beat Louis van Gaal's all-time record set as Bayern Munich manager.
  <br>
  <br>
  Everything seemed to go according to plan when Leverkusen took the lead after 17 minutes, Tah tapping in unmarked at the far post.
  <br>
  <br>
  The hosts hit back almost immediately however, Woerl taking advantage of a sloppy clearance attempt by Piero Hincapie to curl the ball home.
  <br>
  <br>
  As the half wore on, Leverkusen were unable to make their possession count, with Bielefeld fast and threatening on the counter.
  <br>
  <br>
  The hosts once again caught Leverkusen napping to take the lead moments before halftime, Grosser hammering in a Louis Oppie free kick from close range.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bielefeld continued to out-energise their opponents, fighting in the duels and giving Leverkusen few chances to drag themselves back into the game.
  <br>
  <br>
  Patrick Schick, so often Leverkusen's late hero over the past two seasons, had a chance to level the scores while unmarked after 81 minutes but hit a header against the post.
  <br>
  <br>
  This year's German Cup is one of the more open in recent memory, with recent champions Bayern Munich, Borussia Dortmund and Eintracht Frankfurt all suffering early eliminations from the competition.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Wednesday, RB Leipzig play away at Stuttgart in the other semi-final.
  <br>
  <br>
  Leipzig, who have won two of the past three German Cups, will be managed by interim coach Zsolt Low, who took over after Marco Rose was sacked on Sunday. (AFP)

    Wall Street braces for 'Liberation Day'

<img alt="All the nervousness in the market helped push the price of gold to records - it briefly topped US$3,175 per ounce. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798541_1_20250402064055.jpg&q=85">

<div class="itemFullText">
 US stocks finished mixed on Tuesday on a quiet trading day as investors braced for Donald Trump's tariff announcement, which he has dubbed "Liberation Day".
 <br>
  <br>
  The US president has not unveiled the details of his plan, leaving traders guessing ahead of the announcement, which the White House has now penned for Wednesday at 4pm local time in Washington (2000 GMT), after Wall Street markets close.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped less than 0.1 percent to 41,989, while the broad-based S&P 500 shook off a recent slump to close up 0.4 percent at 5,633.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tech-rich Nasdaq Composite also finished in the green, gaining 0.9 percent to 17,449, a day after posting its worst quarter since 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  All the nervousness in the market helped push the price of gold to records, and it briefly topped US$3,175 per ounce - that’s up from less than US$2,700 at the start of the year.
  <br>
  <br>
  In stocks, Tesla charged 3.6 percent higher a day ahead of reporting how many vehicles it delivered during the first three months of the year.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the losing end of Wall Street was Johnson & Johnson, which dropped 7.6 percent after a US bankruptcy court judge denied the company’s settlement plan related to baby powder containing talc. It’s the third time the company’s attempt to resolve the baby powder settlement through bankruptcy has been rejected by courts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lululemon Athletica led the market lower with a drop of 14.2 percent, even though the seller of athletic apparel reported a stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected.
  <br>
  <br>
  Oxford Industries, the company behind the Tommy Bahama and Lilly Pulitzer brands, likewise reported stronger results for the latest quarter than expected but still saw its stock fall 5.7 percent. (Agencies)

<img alt="Antonio Rudiger, right, was among the scorers for Real Madrid. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798540_2_20250402062922.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Real Madrid edged into the Copa del Rey final with a thrilling 4-4 draw against Real Sociedad after extra-time, securing a 5-4 aggregate semi-final victory.
 <br>
  <br>
  Antonio Rudiger decided the pulsating tie with a header in the 115th minute, with Madrid to face Barcelona or Atletico Madrid in the final.
  <br>
  <br>
  Real Sociedad, trailing 1-0 from the first leg, took the lead through Ander Barrenetxea, but Endrick's fine chip pulled the 20-time winners level.
  <br>
  <br>
  A David Alaba own goal and Mikel Oyarzabal's deflected effort helped La Real open up a lead on the Spanish champions but Madrid battled back with goals from Jude Bellingham and Aurelien Tchouameni.
  <br>
  <br>
  Oyarzabal grabbed his second in stoppage time to force extra-time but his side could not hold off Madrid until penalties, with Rudiger's header the final word.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm very happy because it was a really hard game with many comebacks and in the end my goal," Rudiger said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For me (the goal) was easy, (I made a) good movement, the corner was very good and because of that we're in the final," he added. "It's a hard season but we're in another final and we will win it."
  <br>
  <br>
  Ancelotti brought Vinicius Junior and Rodrygo Goes back into his starting lineup, leaving Kylian Mbappé on the bench to rest, with Endrick taking his place in an all-Brazilian attack.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 18-year-old wonderkid striker who netted the only goal in the first leg, was active in the opening phases, sending a dangerous overhead kick narrowly wide of Álex Remiro's far post.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bellingham also threatened for the hosts but it was Real Sociedad who took the lead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Barrenetxea broke in behind Lucas Vázquez to reach Pablo Marin's flick-on and drilled a low finish home to put the Basques level in the tie.
  <br>
  <br>
  Real Madrid soon found their equaliser. Vinicius played a sensational through ball down the left flank with the outside of his foot, sending Endrick in on goal.
  <br>
  <br>
  The youngster, top scorer in the Copa del Rey, produced a gorgeous lobbed finish over Romero for his fifth in the competition.
  <br>
  <br>
  Real Sociedad appealed for a penalty before the break when Takefusa Kubo went down in the box after being held by Vinicius, but the referee did not concur.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ancelotti brought on Mbappé for Endrick, looking for a goal to shut the tie down for good. However, it was the visitors who were creating the better chances.
  <br>
  <br>
  Madrid goalkeeper Andriy Lunin made a superb save to deny Martin Zubimendi and Oyarzabal wastefully fired the rebound wide.
  <br>
  <br>
  Real Sociedad moved ahead on the night when Alaba deflected Marin's cross through Lunin's legs and into his own net after 72 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Austrian defender, who returned from a long-term injury in January, was also involved in Real Sociedad's third, deflecting Oyarzabal's shot past Lunin.
  <br>
  <br>
  It sparked Madrid in to action, with Vinicius turning his marker brilliantly, driving forward and crossing for Bellingham to strike in the 82nd minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  Four minutes later and Los Blancos pulled level on the night with Tchouameni's header badly fumbled by Remiro into his own net.
  <br>
  <br>
  Just when it seemed Real Sociedad were out they managed to force extra-time, with Oyarzabal heading home Sergio Gómez's free-kick in the 93rd minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  Remiro saved well from Bellingham before the end of the regulation 90 minutes, with the pace slower, inevitably, as the game restarted.
  <br>
  <br>
  Real Sociedad's Jon Olagasti was booked for hacking down Vinicius as he threatened to escape on the left, with the visitors working hard to hold off the European champions.
  <br>
  <br>
  With five minutes remaining Rudiger sent Madrid through to the final with a fine header from Arda Guler's corner past the helpless Remiro.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Wednesday Atletico Madrid host Barcelona in the second leg of the other semi-final, with the teams level at 4-4 on aggregate. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump kept the world's leading economies on edge on Tuesday as he made final preparations for a "Liberation Day" announcement of sweeping new tariffs that could trigger a global trade war.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump has promised to be "very kind" when he unveils the so-called reciprocal tariffs on Wednesday, but uncertainty reigned over which countries would be targeted and by how much.
  <br>
  <br>
  His plan has prompted vows of retaliation from major economies - including the European Union and Canada - and fears that it could unleash a recession at home and abroad.
  <br>
  <br>
  The White House said Trump had "made a decision" but was still putting the finishing touches on the measures.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He is with his trade and tariff team right now, perfecting it to make sure this is a perfect deal for the American people and the American worker," Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told a briefing.
  <br>
  <br>
  The White House would not confirm reports in US media that Trump was considering across-the-board tariffs of around 20 percent, rather than different amounts for different countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Leavitt said the tariffs would take effect "immediately" after the announcement, meaning there would be no time for foreign leaders to negotiate carve-outs before they start.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Republican billionaire, a fan of tariffs for decades, indicated on Monday night that the tariffs would be lower than what other countries would be charging the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're going to be very nice, relatively speaking, we're going to be very kind," he said in the Oval Office.
  <br>
  <br>
  Critics warn that the strategy risks a global trade war, provoking a chain reaction of retaliation.
  <br>
  <br>
  America's trading partners have been preparing to respond, even as they continue efforts to make last-minute negotiations with Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are going to be very deliberate in terms of the measures we take, to fight for Canada," Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, who spoke to Trump last week, said on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The European Union, which Trump has accused of trying to "screw" the United States, said on Tuesday it still hoped to negotiate a solution - but that "all instruments are on the table" to retaliate if necessary.
  <br>
  <br>
  British Prime Minister Keir Starmer spoke with Trump on "productive negotiations" towards a UK-US trade deal. Vietnam said on Tuesday it would slash duties on a range of goods to appease Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The president is always up to take a phone call, always up for a good negotiation," Leavitt said. (AFP)

    French court to hear far-right leader's appeal

<img alt="Marine Le Pen on Monday was given a prison term and fine after being convicted of a fake jobs scheme at the EU parliament. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798529_1_20250402032757.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A French appeals court said on Tuesday it would examine Marine Le Pen's case within a timeframe that could potentially allow the far-right leader to contest the 2027 presidential election if her conviction is overturned.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a court ruling many commentators called a political earthquake, Le Pen on Monday was given a prison term and fine after being convicted of a fake jobs scheme at the EU parliament.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the most serious part of the conviction was a five-year ban - effective immediately - on standing for office, which eliminates her from the race.
  <br>
  <br>
  Addressing her lawmakers on Tuesday, Le Pen, who considered herself the favourite in the 2027 election in which President Emmanuel Macron cannot stand again, accused "the system" of rolling out "the nuclear bomb" to end her presidential hopes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If they use such a powerful weapon against us, it's obviously because we're about to win an election," said Le Pen, 56. "We won't let this happen."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Paris Court of Appeal said later on Tuesday that it would examine Le Pen's case "within a timeframe that should allow a decision to be reached in the summer of 2026".
  <br>
  <br>
  This could mean that the new trial would be held by early 2026 at the latest, and that the decision would therefore be handed down well before the 2027 presidential election, in which Le Pen wants to run for the fourth time.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement signed by the chief justice, Jacques Boulard, and the attorney general, Marie-Suzanne Le Queau, the court said it had received three appeals against the rulings handed down on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The announcement was made after Justice Minister Gerald Darmanin, speaking during a tense parliament session, expressed hope that Le Pen's appeal would be heard within the "most reasonable timeframe".
  <br>
  <br>
  "I personally hope that if Mrs Le Pen lodges an appeal, this new judgement at the Paris Court of Appeal can take place within the most reasonable timeframe," Darmanin told parliament.
  <br>
  <br>
  Analysts said the court decision could deepen France's political crisis and cast a shadow on the upcoming 2027 polls.
  <br>
  <br>
  Le Pen's National Rally (RN), which is the largest single party in parliament, can complicate life for Prime Minister Francois Bayrou, who does not have a majority in the lower house National Assembly.
  <br>
  <br>
  If Le Pen loses her appeal, there is also a "plan B", a candidacy by her protege and RN party leader Jordan Bardella, a 29-year-old with a slick television and social media presence. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Nottingham Forest beat Manchester United 1-0 to close in on Champions League football next season as Bukayo Saka scored in Arsenal's 2-1 win over Fulham on his return from injury.
 <br>
  <br>
  Former United winger Anthony Elanga came back to haunt his former club with a stunning solo effort after just five minutes at the City Ground to earn all three points for Nuno Espirito Santo's side.
  <br>
  <br>
  Third-placed Forest extend their lead over Newcastle in sixth to 10 points.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thanks to the strong performance of English sides in European competitions this season, the top five will almost certainly qualify for the Champions League.
  <br>
  <br>
  Forest are two-time European champions but have not played in the continent's elite competition since they were holders in 1980.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elanga was discarded by United in 2023 after a bright start to his career at Old Trafford, but is one of many Forest success stories fulfilling his potential under Nuno.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Swedish international collected possession deep inside his own half but showed blistering pace to burst into the United box before firing low past Andre Onana.
  <br>
  <br>
  Just a year after battling to narrowly avoid relegation, Forest are enjoying an unexpected fairytale season that also includes progressing to the FA Cup semi-finals for the first time in 34 years.
  <br>
  <br>
  They had been forced through 120 minutes and penalties to beat Brighton in Saturday's quarter-final and were also without top scorer Chris Wood due to injury.
  <br>
  <br>
  Forest fatigued in the second half, but United were undone by a familiar lack of cutting edge going forward.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ruben Amorim resorted to sending on centre-back Harry Maguire as a makeshift striker in the closing stages and he nearly grabbed an equaliser in stoppage time when his shot was cleared off the line by Murillo.
  <br>
  <br>
  United remain without two consecutive Premier League wins all season with the Red Devils languishing down in 13th.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal maintained some pressure on leaders Liverpool by cutting the gap at the top to nine points.
  <br>
  <br>
  Saka stole the headlines by coming off the bench to head in on his first appearance since December 21.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mikel Merino's deflected effort had given Arsenal a first-half lead. However, victory came at a cost as key defender Gabriel Magalhães limped off injured.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rodrigo Muniz pulled a goal back in stoppage time, but defeat is a blow to Fulham's ambitions of European football next season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Just one week away from the Gunners' Champions League quarter-final, first leg against Real Madrid, the sight of Gabriel pulling up with a hamstring problem added to Mikel Arteta's injury woes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal are already without forwards Kai Havertz and Gabriel Jesus due to season-ending injuries.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Merino has proved an able deputy as a stand-in striker.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Spanish midfielder took his tally to five goals in eight games in his new role, albeit with the aid of a big deflection to open the scoring on 37 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Saka's introduction was greeted with the biggest cheer of the night until that point at the Emirates Stadium when he replaced Ethan Nwaneri 25 minutes from time.
  <br>
  <br>
  The England international took just eight minutes to net his 10th goal of the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Saka was in the right place to head in from close range after Gabriel Martinelli flicked on Merino's cross.
  <br>
  <br>
  At the bottom of the table, Wolves pulled ever closer to survival with a 1-0 win over West Ham.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jorgen Strand Larsen scored the only goal at Molineux as Wolves moved 12 points clear of the relegation zone. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Tourism minister Rosanna Law said on Tuesday any plans to expand Hong Kong Disneyland with public funding should be carefully considered, especially in the current economic climate.
 <br>
  <br>
  She made the comment as lawmakers discussed the theme park's record-breaking profits and visitor numbers last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  During the Legislative Council economic development panel meeting, some councillors noted the park saw a significant growth in mainland and overseas visitor numbers last year, and that officials should think about relaunching Disneyland's second phase development.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Law noted that besides financing, authorities should proceed with caution.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If the upward trend continues, will the shareholders have the investment appetite for another project within the current theme park, or even the park's second phase development?" she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For these things, we need to observe a bit more, like whether the source markets of visitors really keep growing in a stable manner."
  <br>
  <br>
  Other lawmakers asked the park about its plans to attract more visitors from the Middle East.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong Disneyland's managing director, Michael Moriarty, noted that a pretty high proportion of visitors from the region visit the theme park.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If you were to look at our attendance from arrivals in the Middle East, it's one out of every three person on every plane. So I think we are very attractive to our guests in the Middle East," he told lawmakers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Moriarty added that besides Halal food, the park also offers praying facilities for Muslims.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Beijing's Office for Safeguarding National Security in Hong Kong has issued a stern warning against the United States for sanctioning six officials, saying such punitive actions are simply "a piece of waste paper."
 <br>
  <br>
  The US placed Dong Jingwei, the director for the Office for Safeguarding National Security in Hong Kong, along with five other SAR officials on its sanctions list.
  <br>
  <br>
  A spokesperson for the office on Tuesday said Washington's sanctions were "nothing but a piece of waste paper."
  <br>
  <br>
  The spokesperson said: "[The office] strongly condemned the actions of the United States and sternly warned that any attempt by external forces to interfere in Hong Kong's efforts to safeguard national security would be up against a brick wall."
  <br>
  <br>
  Washington should stop its bullying tactics as soon as possible, the spokesperson added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office said sanctions from the US would not undermine the determination of central and SAR authorities in safeguarding national security and the city's rule of law.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing's liaison office, for its part, said it's only natural and necessary for the Hong Kong government to target anti-China rioters who sought to endanger national security.

    Far-right party chief calls for rally over Le Pen ban

<img alt="Marine Le Pen with Jordan Bardella at the Elysee presidential palace in Paris in August. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798485_1_20250401174939.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Far-right party chief Jordan Bardella called on the French to rally this weekend to protest against a ruling that banned Marine Le Pen from running for public office for five years after being found guilty of embezzling European Union funds.
 <br>
  <br>
  Monday's ruling was a catastrophic setback for Le Pen, the long-time National Rally (RN) leader, who had been the front-runner in opinion polls for the 2027 presidential election.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I believe today that the French must be outraged, and I tell them: Be outraged!" Bardella told Europe 1 radio and CNews TV over a ruling that far-right leaders said was biased and undemocratic.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We'll take to the streets this weekend. We're organising leaflet distributions, democratic, peaceful, calm mobilisations," he said, without giving details.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bardella could become the RN's de facto candidate for the 2027 election. But Le Pen suggested she was not yet ready to hand him the baton, saying on Monday: "I'm not going to let myself be eliminated like this."
  <br>
  <br>
  Bardella backed her on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said she would appeal as soon as possible against what she described as a politicised ruling aimed at blocking her presidential bid. Le Pen has run three times for president and had said 2027 would be her final run for top office.
  <br>
  <br>
  The judge in the court hearing on Monday, Benedicte de Perthuis, said Le Pen had been "at the heart" of a scheme to misappropriate more than 4 million euros (US$4.3 million) of EU funds.
  <br>
  <br>
  The lack of remorse by Le Pen and other defendants was among reasons that prompted the court to ban them from running for office with immediate effect, de Perthuis said.
  <br>
  <br>
  She was given a four-year prison sentence - two years of which are suspended and two years to be served under home detention - and a 100,000-euro (US$108,200) fine, but they will not apply until her appeals are exhausted.
  <br>
  <br>
  Appeals in France can take months or even years.
  <br>
  <br>
  The defendants were not accused of pocketing the money but rather of using it illegally to pay the party's staff back home instead of EU parliamentary assistants. They denied wrongdoing and said the money was used legitimately.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite outrage over the ruling among the far right in France, Europe and beyond who were joined in their condemnation of what they called judicial overreach, an opinion poll showed a majority of French people agreed with the ruling.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some politicians, including former Socialist President Francois Hollande, said it was important to respect the independence of the judicial system.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fifty-seven percent of those interviewed by Elabe pollsters said the ruling was normal considering what Le Pen was accused of, while 42 percent considered it was politically biased.
  <br>
  <br>
  The poll, carried out for BFM TV, also showed that 42 percent of voters were happy with the ruling, with 29 percent unhappy - while 29 percent did not care.
  <br>
  <br>
  President Emmanuel Macron and his minority, centre-right government were yet to react officially.
  <br>
  <br>
  Before the ruling, mainstream politicians including Prime Minister Francois Bayrou had said they were ill at ease with the idea that any ban on Le Pen could be enforced immediately and stop her from running in 2027.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the streets of Paris, and in Le Pen's stronghold of Henin-Beaumont, in northern France, reactions were mixed.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's a shame, it's a shame because we needed a different president, we needed the RN to win," 56-year-old resident Pascal Walkowiak said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another resident, 60-year-old Isabelle, said: "Too bad for her. I think it's a good thing because she made mistakes. And well, there you go, she can't represent us, actually." (Reuters)

 Hong Kong, China snooker star Ng On-yee said a decision by the government last week allowing billiards to retain its Tier A status will help the players as well as the sport's overall development.
 <br>
  <br>
  The SAR snooker queen returned to Hong Kong on Tuesday after defending her title at the British Open in Walsall, England with a hard-fought 4-3 victory over Mink Nutcharut of Thailand.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters at the airport, Ng said maintaining billiards' Tier A status not only provides important recognition for athletes, but also allows coaches to develop better training programmes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Two key factors allowed me to play more freely in this tournament – first, having already secured my World Snooker Tour qualification early, and second, knowing that snooker would maintain its status at the Sports Institute. These significantly reduced my pressure," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ng added that the move will give more confidence to young athletes developing their careers.
  <br>
  <br>
  She also spoke about getting into the right frame of mind in the British Open final when her opponent rallied from a 3-0 deficit to force a decisive seventh and final frame.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When I was leading 3-0, I started thinking just one more frame to win, and that's when I got a bit tight.
  <br>
  <br>
  "After being pulled back to 3-3, I told myself to stop over-thinking – just treat it like the first frame again.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Focus on taking every chance that comes, forget what's happened before, and concentrate completely on the current frame."
  <br>
  <br>
  Ng will next play in the World Women’s Snooker Championship 2025 in Dongguan between May 20 and 27.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police have arrested two people after busting a cannabis production facility in Ta Kwu Ling.
 <br>
  <br>
  Cannabis plants and buds worth HK$5 million were seized in a raid on Monday at a three-storey house in Ping Yeung village.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officers said they found the cannabis spread across five rooms on the first and second floors.
  <br>
  <br>
  "At the same time, we also found that each room was installed with equipment which enhanced the cultivation of cannabis. These included powerful sun lamps, light-blocking cloths, insulation cotton and fertilisers," said inspector Ng Ka-wai.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the plants were able to produce up to 90kg of cannabis buds per year, with a street value of HK$20 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  A 43-year-old woman was detained at the scene on suspicion of cultivating cannabis plants and trafficking in dangerous drugs.
  <br>
  <br>
  A 42-year-old man was arrested in Yuen Long the same day on the same charges.
  <br>
  <br>
  The pair are due to appear before a magistrate in Fanling on Wednesday.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The English Schools Foundation (ESF) on Tuesday proposed to raise tuition fees by an average of 4.8 percent in the coming academic year.
 <br>
  <br>
  Parents will have to pay about HK$650 to HK$750 more per month, depending on the grade their children are in.
  <br>
  <br>
  The international school group said the proposed increase is linked to continued uncertainty in the Hong Kong economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We know that the Hong Kong economy, like that of the world more generally, continues to face uncertainties,” ESF's chief executive Belinda Greer said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We honour that trust by controlling our costs and making sure that every dollar, every cent is spent for the benefit of our students and their futures.”
  <br>
  <br>
  She added that the group has taken into consideration the question of affordability while making sure that teaching quality will not be affected.

    Xiaomi hands over data in fatal SU7 crash in Anhui

<img alt="Xiaomi' SU7 has outsold Tesla's Model 3. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798464_1_20250401165627.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Xiaomi said on Tuesday that it was actively cooperating with police after a fatal accident involving a SU7 electric vehicle on Saturday and that it had handed over driving and system data.
 <br>
  <br>
  The incident marks the first major accident involving the SU7 sedan, which Xiaomi launched last March and since December has outsold Tesla's Model 3 on a monthly basis.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xiaomi's shares, which had risen by 34.8 percent year to date, closed down 5.5 percent on Tuesday, underperforming a 0.2 percent gain in the Hang Seng Tech index.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xiaomi did not disclose the number of casualties but said initial information showed the car was in the Navigate on Autopilot (NOA) intelligent-assisted driving mode before the accident and was moving at 116kmh.
  <br>
  <br>
  A driver inside the car took over and tried to slow it down but then collided with a cement pole at a speed of 97kmh, Xiaomi said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The accident in Tongling in eastern Anhui province killed the driver and two passengers, Chinese financial publication Caixin reported on Tuesday citing friends of the victims.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a rundown of the data submitted to local police posted on a Weibo account of the company, Xiaomi said NOA issued a risk warning of obstacles ahead and its subsequent immediate takeover only happened seconds before the collision.
  <br>
  <br>
  Local media reported that the car caught fire after the collision.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xiaomi did not mention the fire in the statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xiaomi began manufacturing EVs last year with the launch of the SU7 sedan after selling smartphones, household appliances and smart gadgets for most of its 15-year history.
  <br>
  <br>
  The company has two versions of smart driving systems on its SU7 EVs.
  <br>
  <br>
  The higher-end LiDAR-mounted version, as opposed to the pure vision version, enables urban navigation features such as collision avoidance and special vehicle recognition.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xiaomi said the car involved in the accident was a standard version of the SU7, which has the less-advanced smart driving technology without LiDAR. (Reuters)

<img alt="Alice Mak described the current district councils as having unprecedented transparency. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798466_1_20250401165907.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Home affairs minister Alice Mak said on Tuesday that the number of cases a district councillor handles in a year may not fully reflect the actual work done.
 <br>
  <br>
  More than a year after councillors took office following revamped district-level polls, their first annual work reports were recently made public.
  <br>
  <br>
  When asked why some of them handled more than a thousand cases and some little more than a hundred, Mak said circumstances can vary and some cases could be more complicated than others.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last year, the authorities also introduced a new scheme where councillors have to meet the public regularly, for the people to file complaints or seek help.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister said some residents have complained that the sessions, held at community centres, were rather inconvenient.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mak said officials have made changes to the scheme in a couple of districts, and they will try to adopt such changes in more communities.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We hope we can make things more convenient....The people said 'Of course I won't go there, I'd rather find the councillor in his or her office near my home'," she told reporters after attending an event.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So we're trying to improve this by asking councillors to take turns in setting up street booths as 'mobile reception rooms', so the public can contact them easier."
  <br>
  <br>
  Various local media reports have noted that the public and the press could only check the work reports in a district council office and not online, and they couldn't take pictures of the reports, including documents on expenses.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mak stressed that the arrangements follow established practice.
  <br>
  <br>
  She described the current-term councils as having unprecedented transparency, saying there have never been so many systemic statistics available regarding the work of district councillors.

    Junta leader fears worse to come as toll passes 2,700

<div class="itemFullText">
 Aid groups in the worst-hit areas of Myanmar said there was an urgent need for shelter, food and water after an earthquake that killed more than 2,700 people, but said the country's civil war could prevent help reaching those in need.
 <br>
  <br>
  The death toll had reached 2,719 and is expected to rise to more than 3,000, Myanmar's military leader Min Aung Hlaing said in a televised address on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said 4,521 people were injured, and 441 were missing.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 7.7 magnitude quake, which hit around lunchtime on Friday, was the strongest to hit the Southeast Asian country in more than a century, toppling ancient pagodas and modern buildings alike.
  <br>
  <br>
  In neighbouring Thailand, rescuers pressed on with searching for life in the rubble of a collapsed skyscraper in Bangkok, but acknowledged time was against them.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Myanmar's Mandalay area, 50 children and two teachers were killed when their preschool collapsed, said the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the hardest-hit areas ...communities struggle to meet their basic needs, such as access to clean water and sanitation, while emergency teams work tirelessly to locate survivors and provide life-saving aid," the UN body said in a report.
  <br>
  <br>
  The International Rescue Committee said shelter, food, water and medical help were all needed in places such as Mandalay, near the epicentre of the quake.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Having lived through the terror of the earthquake, people now fear aftershocks and are sleeping outside on roads or in open fields," an IRC worker in Mandalay said in a report.
  <br>
  <br>
  The civil war in Myanmar, where the junta seized power in a coup in 2021, has complicated efforts to reach those injured and made homeless by the Southeast Asian nation's biggest quake in a century.
  <br>
  <br>
  Amnesty International said the junta needed to allow aid to reach areas of the country not under its control. Rebel groups say the junta has conducted airstrikes after the quake.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Myanmar's military has a longstanding practice of denying aid to areas where groups who resist it are active," Amnesty's Myanmar researcher Joe Freeman said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It must immediately allow unimpeded access to all humanitarian organisations and remove administrative barriers delaying needs assessments."
  <br>
  <br>
  The junta's tight control over communication networks and the damage to roads, bridges and other infrastructure caused by the quakes have intensified the challenges for aid workers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thai officials said a meeting of regional leaders in Bangkok this week would go ahead as planned, although the junta's Min Aung Hlaing may attend by teleconference.
  <br>
  <br>
  Before the quake struck, sources said the junta chief had been expected to make a rare foreign trip to attend the summit in Bangkok on Thursday and Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Myanmar's capital Naypyitaw, rescue workers saved a 63-year-old woman from the rubble of a building on Tuesday, but hope was fading of finding many more survivors of the violent earthquake, compounding a humanitarian crisis caused by a bloody civil war.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Myanmar fire department in the Naypyitaw said the woman was successfully pulled from the rubble early on Tuesday, 91 hours after being buried when the building collapsed in the 7.7 magnitude earthquake.
  <br>
  <br>
  The earthquake's epicenter was near the country's second-largest city Mandalay.
  <br>
  <br>
  Those figures are widely expected to rise, but the earthquake hit a wide swath of the country, leaving many areas without power, telephone or cell connections and damaging roads and bridges, leaving the full extent of the devastation hard to assess.
  <br>
  <br>
  Most of the reports so far have come from Mandalay and Naypyitaw.
  <br>
  <br>
  The World Health Organization said overall, more than 10,000 buildings are known to have collapsed or been severely damaged in central and northwest Myanmar. (Reuters/AP)

    Three killed in Beirut as Israel targets top militant

<img alt="The airstrike targeted a Hezbollah militant in the top three floors of a building in south Beirut. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798455_1_20250401160916.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 At least three people were killed and seven wounded in an Israeli airstrike on Beirut's southern suburbs on Tuesday, the Lebanese health ministry said, further testing a shaky four-month ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Israeli military said in a statement that it attacked a Hezbollah militant "who had recently directed Hamas operatives and assisted them."
  <br>
  <br>
  The attack took place a few days after a previous strike by Israel on the southern suburbs of the Lebanese capital, a Hezbollah stronghold known as the Dahiyeh.
  <br>
  <br>
  There was no immediate statement from Hezbollah on the identity of the target.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lebanese President Joseph Aoun condemned the latest Israeli airstrike, calling it a "dangerous warning" that signals premeditated intentions against Lebanon.
  <br>
  <br>
  Aoun said Israel's growing "aggression" requires Lebanon to intensify diplomatic outreach and mobilise international allies in support of the country's full sovereignty.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lebanese Prime Minister Nawaf Salam also condemned the Israeli strike and said it was a flagrant breach of UN Resolution 1701 and the ceasefire arrangement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nawaf said that he has been closely monitoring the aftermath of the strike in coordination with the ministers of defence and interior.
  <br>
  <br>
  The strike appeared to have damaged the upper three floors of a building in Beirut's southern suburbs, with the balconies of those floors blown out.
  <br>
  <br>
  The glass on the floors below was intact, indicating a targeted strike. Ambulances were at the scene to recover casualties.
  <br>
  <br>
  There was no evacuation warning issued for the area ahead of the strike, and families fled in the aftermath to other parts of Beirut, according to witnesses.
  <br>
  <br>
  November's ceasefire agreement halted the year-long conflict and mandated that southern Lebanon be free of Hezbollah fighters and weapons, that Lebanese troops deploy to the area and that Israeli ground troops withdraw from the zone.
  <br>
  <br>
  But each side accuses the other of not entirely living up to those terms.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US-brokered truce has looked increasingly flimsy lately. Israel delayed a promised troop withdrawal in January and said that it had intercepted rockets fired from Lebanon in March, which led it to bombard targets in Beirut's southern suburbs and southern Lebanon.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Iran-aligned Hezbollah has denied any involvement in the rocket firings. (Reuters)

 Hong Kong's university entrance exams began on Tuesday, with some candidates arriving early to avoid potential issues with the electronic check-in system.
 <br>
  <br>
  Nearly 4,000 students registered for the first written exam in visual arts at venues across the city. They needed to use the "Check-in Smart" app before taking the exams.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last year, there were technical glitches with both the "Check-in Smart" app and "i-Invigilation". Exam officials have since dropped the app for invigilators.
  <br>
  <br>
  At an exam venue in Kwun Tong, candidates arrived up to an hour before the scheduled start time, carrying art supplies and drawing boards.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[The Check-in Smart app] wasn't successful last year. But we rehearsed at school so it's okay. Having the admission form is fine anyway. If something goes wrong for one person, it affects everyone, so it's not a big deal," one student said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Examinations and Assessment Authority rolled out an updated version of the app following last year's technical failures.
  <br>
  <br>
  Around 55,000 students have registered for the DSE exams this year, a 10 percent increase from last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm nervous and couldn't eat breakfast. I haven't been sleeping well. After all, it's the first day of exams," said one student.
  <br>
  <br>
  Core subjects including Chinese, English, mathematics, and citizenship and social development will start from Wednesday.

    Australia hit by floods in inland area size of France

<div class="itemFullText">
 Whole herds of cattle have drowned in vast inland floods sweeping across the Australian outback, officials said on Tuesday, as the muddy tide drenched an area the size of France.
 <br>
  <br>
  Swollen rivers burst their banks after unusually heavy downpours last week over outback Queensland, an arid region home to some of the country's largest cattle ranches.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials said more than 100,000 livestock – cattle, sheep, goats and horses – had been swept away, were missing, or had drowned.
  <br>
  <br>
  "These are only early indications of the magnitude of this disaster and while these preliminary numbers are shocking, we are expecting them to continue to climb as flood waters recede," said state agriculture minister Tony Perrett.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's heartbreaking to consider what western Queenslanders will be going through over the weeks and months as they discover the full extent of losses and damage – and start the long slog to start again."
  <br>
  <br>
  Researchers have repeatedly warned that climate change amplifies the risk of natural disasters such as bushfires, floods and cyclones.
  <br>
  <br>
  Flood waters stretched some 500,000 square kilometres across sparsely populated western Queensland, Perrett said, a landmass roughly equivalent to France.
  <br>
  <br>
  Industry body AgForce told local media some cattle ranches may have lost almost 100 percent of their herd.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government Bureau of Meteorology said some towns had recorded as much as 500 millimetres of rain in the space of a week – their typical yearly total.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Unfortunately, more rainfall is on the way," forecaster Dean Narramore said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The reason why we are so concerned about that is because we have numerous flood warnings current for much of Queensland."
  <br>
  <br>
  Muddy livestock survived by crowding together on the few small hills cresting above the flood waters, photos posted to social media showed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Queensland's fire department used helicopters to drop bales of fodder near surviving animals cut off from food.
  <br>
  <br>
  The state's primary industries department said some 4,000 kilometres of road had been flooded – a distance greater than the famed Route 66 connecting Chicago to Los Angeles.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rising waters on Tuesday morning encircled the remote outpost of Thargomindah, which describes itself as Australia's farthest town from the sea.
  <br>
  <br>
  A makeshift dirt flood levy was dug around the town to protect its 200 residents.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Preparations are well under way, including securing food deliveries, ensuring the airport has enough aircraft fuel and if need be an evacuation point and accommodation," the shire council said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our shire's isolated properties are stocked with food and supplies and doing okay under the circumstances."
  <br>
  <br>
  Australia's so-called "channel country" is one of the nation's biggest cattle fattening grounds.
  <br>
  <br>
  Most of the time its sweeping plains are dry and inhospitable.
  <br>
  <br>
  But cattle gorge themselves on the pastures that sprout whenever wet season rains fill the dry creek beds – or channels – that snake through the region. (AFP)

<img alt="At the CinemaCon in Caesars Palace in Las Vegas are, from left, Sam Mendes, Paul Mescal, Joseph Quinn, Barry Keoghan and Harris Dickinson. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798436_1_20250401134811.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Sam Mendes will release four movies about The Beatles in the same month, the director has announced, with Paul Mescal playing Paul McCartney and Harris Dickinson portraying John Lennon in "the first bingeable theatrical experience."
 <br>
  <br>
  The "four-film cinematic event," hitting theaters in April 2028, will each focus on a different member of the legendary British pop quartet, with Barry Keoghan playing Ringo Starr and Joseph Quinn as George Harrison.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Each one is told from the particular perspective of just one of the guys," Mendes told the CinemaCon movie theater convention in Las Vegas.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They intersect in different ways – sometimes overlapping, sometimes not.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They're four very different human beings.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Perhaps this is a chance to understand them a little more deeply.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But together, all four films will tell the story of the greatest band in history."
  <br>
  <br>
  Filming is about to begin, and is expected to take more than a year, said Mendes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The exact order in which the movies will be released has not yet been revealed.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'd been trying to make a film about the Beatles for years, but I had temporarily given up," explained "American Beauty" Oscar-winner Mendes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I just felt the story of the band was too huge to fit into a single movie, and that turning it into a TV mini-series just somehow didn't feel right."
  <br>
  <br>
  The announcement came at the start of the CinemaCon trade convention, where movie theater owners gather annually in Las Vegas to hear Hollywood studios' plans for the coming months and years.
  <br>
  <br>
  While 2025 had been widely touted as the year that the movie industry would bounce back, the box office has so far endured a terrible start, reeling from high-profile flops like Disney's live-action "Snow White" and sci-fi "Mickey 17."
  <br>
  <br>
  The US$1.3 billion taken in North America receipts so far is seven percent below an already lean first quarter of last year, which was itself derailed by the previous year's massive Hollywood strikes. (AFP)

<img alt="Members of the DAB handed in petitions at the US consulate in Central. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798432_1_20250401131459.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Local political groups have denounced Washington's move to put six mainland and Hong Kong officials on its sanctions list.
 <br>
  <br>
  Members of the DAB on Tuesday staged a protest outside the US consulate in Central.
  <br>
  <br>
  The party’s vice-chairman Holden Chow, who was among the demonstrators, called the sanctions an "ill-intentioned" move to suppress China.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The US government has spread a lot of falsehoods against the Hong Kong government and our judiciary too, especially over the verdicts for those criminals who are found guilty in court because of national security cases,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It's sort of a political move with the aim of suppressing China.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The Commissioner’s Office of the Foreign Ministry in Hong Kong earlier said China will take strong and resolute countermeasures in response to the wrong moves by the US side.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chow said this may include counter-sanctions.
  <br>
  <br>
  “And I'm sure that when they carry out the counter sanctions or other measures to counter the US ill-intentioned move, they will be effective,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Business and Professionals Alliance also strongly condemned the sanctions and urged Washington to stop meddling in China's internal matters.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, it accused the Trump administration of ignoring the fact that Hong Kong has maintained a stable business environment for global investors, including American businesses, since the city’s national security law was put in place.
  <br>
  <br>
  It called on the business community and all sectors of society to stand united, support the governance of the SAR and safeguard national security.
  <br>
  <br>
  The sanctions also triggered strong words from the Federation of Trade Unions (FTU).
  <br>
  <br>
  The FTU said Washington's "shameless act" will be spurned by people around the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  Its president Stanley Ng said the US is simply shooting itself in the foot with the sanctions.

    Over 100 injured in Kuala Lumpur gas pipeline fireball

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A massive fire caused by a gas pipeline leak forced people from their homes and injured more than 100 during Eid celebrations near Malaysia's capital on Tuesday, fire officials said.
 <br>
  <br>
  The inferno, which was visible kilometres away, was caused by "a gas pipeline leak stretching approximately 500 metres," said fire officials in Selangor state near Kuala Lumpur.
  <br>
  <br>
  The valve to the affected pipeline belonging to Malaysia's state-run oil firm Petronas has been shut off, the fire officials said.
  <br>
  <br>
  While the early morning blaze was coming under control in the afternoon, more than 100 people were injured, the fire department said.
  <br>
  <br>
  About 60 of the injured were hospitalised, Selangor deputy police chief Mohamad Zaini Abu Hassan was quoted as saying by local broadcaster Astro Awani.
  <br>
  <br>
  No deaths were reported but about 50 houses were affected by the blaze, the fire department said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Residents were enjoying a public holiday for Eid celebrations in Muslim-majority Malaysia when they were forced to flee the suburban area.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nizam Mohamad Asnizam, 49, who lives 100 metres from the site of the fire, fled from his house with his family in his car.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When I woke up, I saw the fire raging, with an extraordinary sound. I have never experienced a fire with this kind of sound. The sound was terrifying. It felt like a jet engine was next to me," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Stepping on the floor was like stepping on a hot wok. The heat was like putting your head in an oven, it felt like I was burning."
  <br>
  <br>
  Dashcam footage shared online showed a column of fire from what appears to be an explosion, creating a massive fireball that shot into the sky.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another video shared online showed a residential area covered in smoke while a huge fire blazed in the background. Singed trees and melted cars are also seen in the video.
  <br>
  <br>
  Selangor Chief Minister Amirudin Shari said in a Facebook post that a temporary relief centre had been set up at a nearby mosque.
  <br>
  <br>
  He warned the public to stay away from the area affected by the fire while investigations and rescue work were being carried out. (AFP)

    US sanctions have 'no impact' on Paul Lam

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Justice Paul Lam has stressed sanctions imposed by the United States "had no impact on him" and didn't affect his work and life, saying the best way to respond is to "remain calm and collected."
 <br>
  <br>
  Lam, along with five other mainland and Hong Kong officials, were the latest to be placed on Washington's sanctions list.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Tuesday, he said the grounds for imposing sanctions are "completely untenable."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lam also called Washington's move a blatant act of hegemony and bullying that was an attempt to deter those involved in safeguarding national security.
  <br>
  <br>
  To respond, he said, one should safeguard national security and interests, as well as Hong Kong's stability and prosperity more resolutely.

    'Schools welcome proposed NET scheme changes'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A school representative said on Tuesday that proposed changes to the Native-speaking English Teacher (NET) scheme gives headteachers more flexibility.
 <br>
  <br>
  From the next academic year, schools could be able to either keep their existing NET, or opt for a grant from the Education Bureau to employ at least one NET and native-English-speaking teaching assistants or related services.
  <br>
  <br>
  Primary schools can get HK$900,000 for one year, while secondary schools will receive up to HK$1 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  "HK$900,000 divided by 12 months, that would be around HK$70,000 a month. That would be enough to hire teachers with no teaching experience, and there would be [money] remaining for schools to hire teaching assistants or get other education services," Cheung Chok-fong, who chairs the Subsidised Primary School Council, said on an RTHK programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This allows schools to choose whether to keep their own NET, or get the cash funding from the bureau. Schools can then make more flexible arrangements," she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cheung said she hoped the bureau will also look into streamlining applications for subsidies, such as housing allowances, to reduce administration work within schools.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on the same programme, lawmaker Tang Fei expressed concern that proposed stricter requirements for future NETs would reduce the number of applicants.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials are suggesting that such teachers be required to hold a bachelor's degree majoring in English, a postgraduate teaching qualification and a certificate in teaching English as a second or foreign language.
  <br>
  <br>
  Currently, applicants only need a degree in any subject and the teaching English certificate.

 Veteran Al Horford turned back the clock to help the NBA champion Boston Celtics notch a ninth straight victory and nab a franchise first with a 117-103 win over the Grizzlies in Memphis.
 <br>
  <br>
  Horford, 38, led the Celtics scoring with 26 points off the bench.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jayson Tatum added 25 points and 14 rebounds and the Celtics defense stymied the Grizzlies in the second half to complete a perfect 6-0 road trip – the longest unbeaten road swing in the club's history.
  <br>
  <br>
  Boston, second in the Eastern Conference behind the Cleveland Cavaliers, won all six games by double digits.
  <br>
  <br>
  Horford scored his season-high, draining six of Boston's 21 three-pointers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's a lot of fun," Horford said. "It's pretty amazing for me to be in this position and I'm just trying to have fun with it and enjoy with my team."
  <br>
  <br>
  Ja Morant scored 26 points for the Grizzlies, who led by as many as 11 in the first half and regained the lead early in the third.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ultimately, however, they couldn't keep pace and lost ground in their fight with the Los Angeles Lakers for fourth place in the West.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the Oklahoma City Thunder, already assured of the Western Conference top seed, racked up their 10th straight victory with a 145-117 pounding of the Chicago Bulls.
  <br>
  <br>
  Isaiah Joe came off the bench to score 31 points – leading seven Thunder players to score in double figures as Oklahoma City improved to 28-1 against Eastern Conference opponents – the NBA record for most wins by a team against an opposing conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We all have the same goal in mind," said Joe, who made eight of the Thunder's 23 three-pointers. "We know what we want to do at the end of the day and we know how to get there. We've just got to keep stacking days, stacking games."
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere, the Indiana Pacers rallied from 16 points down in the third quarter to beat the Sacramento Kings 111-109 and maintain their grip on fourth place in the East.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tyrese Haliburton scored 18 points and handed out 11 assists, drilling a three-pointer with just over one minute remaining that gave Indiana the lead for good.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Los Angeles Clippers, eighth in West but locked in a battle with Golden State and Minnesota for sixth place and direct entry to the playoffs, clawed out a gritty 96-87 victory over the Magic in Orlando.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kawhi Leonard and Norman Powell scored 21 points each and Ivica Zubac added 18 points and 20 rebounds – including nine on the offensive end – to help the Clippers finally seize control in a game that featured 15 lead changes in the first three quarters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Paolo Banchero scored 26 points and Franz Wagner added 21 for the Magic, who remained in eighth place in the East.
  <br>
  <br>
  The top six teams in the each conference advance to the playoffs while teams ranked from seventh to 10th play a mini-tournament to determine the final two playoff slots.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Miami Heat climbed to ninth – ahead of the Bulls – with a fifth straight victory, beating the Wizards 120-94 in Washington.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bam Adebayo scored 28 points and grabbed 12 rebounds and Tyler Herro added 27 points for the Heat, whose current winning streak comes on the heels of a 10-game skid. (AFP)

<img alt="In a 3-2 ruling, the Court of Final Appeal overturns former lawmaker Lam Cheuk-ting's acquittal. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798417_1_20250401121740.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's top court has overturned the acquittal of a former lawmaker for revealing that a police officer who was on duty during clashes in Yuen Long amid the 2019 protests was facing an anti-graft probe.
 <br>
  <br>
  Ruling in favour of the government, the Court of Final Appeal restored Lam Cheuk-ting's conviction and sentence on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2022, the former lawmaker was sentenced to four months in prison for disclosing an inquiry by the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) into misconduct allegations against a police officer, Yau Nai-keung.
  <br>
  <br>
  A High Court judge later quashed Lam's conviction on three counts of disclosing probe details under the Prevention of Bribery Ordinance.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the Department of Justice was granted permission to take the appeal against the former lawmaker's acquittal to the top court.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Court of Final Appeal's ruling centred on two possible interpretations of a section under the ordinance, which stipulates protections against the disclosure of bribery and corruption probes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ordinance bans anyone with knowledge of an ongoing corruption investigation from disclosing the identity of the person involved, or the fact that the individual is subject to a probe.
  <br>
  <br>
  One interpretation, the bench said, adopted "a literal approach" that confined protections against the disclosure of bribery and corruption probes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The other, which read the ordinance contextually and purposively, required "nothing more than the disclosure of the existence of an investigation that is underway".
  <br>
  <br>
  The court's decision was split three against two, with the majority – Chief Justice Andrew Cheung, Justice Roberto Ribeiro and non-permanent judge James Allsop – ruling that Lam's disclosure of a misconduct probe fell within the scope of the anti-graft ordinance.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Their Lordships preferred the second construction as it better reflected the statutory intent to preserve the efficacy or integrity of ICAC investigations into corruption offences and to protect the reputation of subject persons," the judgement said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Such an interpretation was preferable because "either the disclosure of fact or details may prejudice the investigation," Ribeiro wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  Echoing his fellow judge, Cheung said simply revealing the fact that an individual was under investigation would amount to a prohibited disclosure.
  <br>
  <br>
  Judges Joseph Fok and Johnson Lam disagreed, saying the law specifically refers to the disclosure of someone who's under a corruption investigation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Noting a previous amendment of the ordinance that narrowed the scope of law, Fok said the purpose of the current section was to protect the integrity of a bribery probe "rather than an ICAC investigation in general."

<div class="itemFullText">
 The People's Liberation Army (PLA) Eastern Theater Command on Tuesday started to conduct joint exercises around Taiwan Island.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Eastern Theater Command organised its army, navy, air and rocket forces to close in on the island from multiple directions, said Senior Colonel Shi Yi.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to Shi, these drills mainly focus on sea-air combat-readiness patrols, joint seizure of comprehensive superiority, assault on maritime and ground targets, and blockade of key areas and sea lanes to test the joint operation capabilities of the troops.
  <br>
  <br>
  The drills serve as a stern warning and forceful deterrent against "Taiwan independence" separatist forces, and are a legitimate and necessary action to safeguard China's sovereignty and national unity, Shi said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Taiwan Affairs Office spokeswoman Zhu Fenglian said the military exercises serve as a resolute punishment for Lai Ching-te authorities' blatant "Taiwan independence" provocations.
  <br>
  <br>
  "'Taiwan independence' means war, and pursuing 'Taiwan independence' means pushing the people of Taiwan into a perilous situation," Zhu said.
  <br>
  <br>
  She also said the mainland's countermeasures specifically target separatist activities advocating "Taiwan independence" and are not directed at the broader population of Taiwan. (Xinhua)

<img alt="Jane Street is said to be in talks with Hongkong Land to take over two more floors in Central. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798414_1_20250401120606.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Jane Street, one of the world's largest quant trading firms and market makers, is planning a sharp increase in Hong Kong office space, two people familiar with the matter said.
 <br>
  <br>
  The New York-based firm is negotiating with landlord Hongkong Land to lease two more floors at Chater House, an office tower in Central, they said.
  <br>
  <br>
  If the deal materialises, Jane Street will occupy six floors of the 30-storey building, totalling over 110,000 sq ft of office space, compared to just two-and-a-half floors a year ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jane Street and Hongkong Land declined to comment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite rising Sino-US tensions, China has regained popularity as an investment destination and Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index surged 15 percent in the first quarter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Average daily turnover shot to US$28 billion for the first two months of the year, a 70 percent jump from the same time last year, data shows.
  <br>
  <br>
  Citadel Securities and Tower Research Capital have also been recruiting and expanding their offices in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jane Street employs 400 people in the city, one of the people said, adding that its Hong Kong-based team covers not just the mainland and Hong Kong but also Japan, Singapore and Australia.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is hiring for more than 40 roles in Hong Kong, the firm's website shows.
  <br>
  <br>
  Known for high-frequency trading and its dominance of the exchange traded funds market, Jane Street has seen explosive growth in recent years.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is a registered market maker on the Hong Kong bourse and was approved to trade yuan-denominated shares in Hong Kong in 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  The firm earned around US$6.1 billion in the first half of last year, nearly double that of the same period a year earlier, Bloomberg reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jane Street plans to take the two floors used by Point72 Asset Management, according to one of the people.
  <br>
  <br>
  Point72 is moving out because it wants more office space, local media have said. (Reuters)
