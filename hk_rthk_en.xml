<div class="itemFullText">
 A court in Vietnam on Tuesday upheld a death sentence for real estate tycoon Truong My Lan after rejecting her appeal against a conviction for embezzlement and bribery in a high-profile US$12 billion fraud case, state media reported.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lan, the chairwoman of real estate developer Van Thinh Phat Holdings Group, was sentenced to death in April for her role in what was Vietnam's biggest financial fraud case on record.
  <br>
  <br>
  The High People's Court in Ho Chi Minh City determined there was no basis to reduce Lan's death sentence.
  <br>
  <br>
  If Lan is able to return three-quarters of the money embezzled while on death row, it is possible the sentence could be commuted to life imprisonment, local media said.
  <br>
  <br>
  She is one of the most famous business executives and state officials jailed in the country's lengthy anti-graft campaign known as "Blazing Furnace".
  <br>
  <br>
  "The consequences Lan caused are unprecedented in the history of litigation and the amount of money embezzled is unprecedentedly large and unrecoverable," the prosecution was quoted as saying at the appeal hearing by state-run online newspaper VietnamNet.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The defendant's actions have affected many aspects of society, the financial market, the economy," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  State media cited Lan's lawyer as saying she had many mitigating circumstances, including "having admitted guilt, showing remorse and paying back part of the amount of money embezzled", but prosecutors said that was insufficient.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lan still has the right to request a review under Vietnam's retrial procedures.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lan's arrest in 2022 sparked a run on one of the country's largest private banks by deposits, Saigon Joint Stock Commercial Bank, which was at the centre of the fraud and largely owned by Lan through her proxies. (Reuters)

    'HKU community pharmacy for education, research use'

<img alt="Pharmacy professor Ian Wong (second left) says the community facility's purposes are to provide education to students and help with research.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The University of Hong Kong (HKU) on Tuesday said its community pharmacy merged pharmaceutical services with education and research, which is different from other medical dispensaries in the city.
 <br>
  <br>
  Located at the medical school's campus in Pok Fu Lam, the community pharmacy opened its doors in November, serving mainly Queen Mary Hospital patients as well as HKU staff and students.
  <br>
  <br>
  The medical facility, which is the city's first teaching community pharmacy on a university campus, offers a number of prescription-only medications and drugs for minor ailments.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jovan Chow, a third year pharmacy student at HKU, said he was able to learn by observing how pharmacists interact with patients.
  <br>
  <br>
  "My biggest takeaway from [working at] the community pharmacy is actually the soft skills I acquired during my time here... I have more opportunities to have a glance of how community pharmacies operate," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ian Wong, professor of pharmacology and pharmacy at the university's medical faculty, said the facility goes beyond serving those seeking help.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The main duties and core functions of a university are teaching, research, and knowledge transfer," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our pharmacy's mission is also to [give] the best education to our students, and secondly, is to make use of this pharmacy to conduct research, so that we can help our patients and citizens to optimise the use of medicine. And finally, providing services is actually a knowledge transfer, so that we make use of our knowledge to treat our patients."

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday said he believes the Northern Metropolis project will bring a good return on investment and the public will be able to share the fruits of the development.
 <br>
  <br>
  Last week, more than 80 enterprises and developers signed an expression of interest for the development, along with separate agreements for projects worth some HK$100 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are very confident that the Northern Metropolis development plan will invite and attract a lot of interest," Lee told reporters before heading into the weekly Executive Council meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will be also developing the San Tin Technopole. There will also be a university city and different pockets of land, and all these will add together to create extra value for Hong Kong. All these projects will bring a good return on investment."
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked whether there will be penalties for enterprises that sign agreements but don't invest, Lee said he believes these investments will pay off well in the long run.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Of course, we have to look very far ahead in the future. Some investment periods may be as long as five to 15 years," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CE added that he hopes to find innovative ways to ensure regular citizens also benefit from these investments.

    Cut education spending to reduce deficit: economist

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A local economist on Tuesday suggested the government reduce spending on education to save money.
 <br>
  <br>
  Financial Secretary Paul Chan earlier revised the estimated government deficit for the current financial year, doubling it to around HK$100 billion due to poor performance in the asset markets.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on an RTHK radio programme, Terence Chong, executive director of Chinese University's Lau Chor Tak Institute of Global Economics and Finance, said the government could link education spending to the student population.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If the number of students drops, there's no reason for the government to increase education expenditure," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Should we think about reforming education spending and pegging it against the student population? If student numbers fall, shouldn't we reduce spending?"
  <br>
  <br>
  He said it would be difficult for the government to save money by cutting civil servant pay or reducing the civil service establishment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chong said such a move would only lead to government workers opting to work in the private sector instead, with public services affected as a result.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, lawmaker Wendy Hong said the government could consider recovering education costs from non-local university students.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong, who's a member of Legco's financial affairs panel, said such students are only charged HK$150,000 to HK$180,000, even though the annual cost of their education is HK$300,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is a gradual process. Of course, with the increased cost, their interest to come and study in Hong Kong might be reduced. We can offer scholarships at the same time to attract those in the top-tier," she said.

    Golf club ruling won't affect housing supply: CE

<div class="itemFullText">
 A court ruling overturning the approval of an environmental study on building flats on Fanling golf course won't significantly affect Hong Kong's public housing supply over the next decade, Chief Executive John Lee said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a decision handed down on Monday, the High Court called on the authorities to consult the public again on plans to build public flats on 9.5 hectares of the century-old course.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee said while overall housing goals over the next 10 years won't change, the ruling will affect how many homes they can build at the golf course and how long it will take.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Following the judgment, in terms of the number of public housing units, the density and the delay in the housing production, we are seeing a significant impact. And that means the government will have to conduct a holistic assessment," he said before the weekly Executive Council meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CE told reporters that officials have secured land to produce more than 308,000 public housing units in the next 10 years.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The change in relation to the public housing development on Fanling golf course should not pose a major change to the public housing production target," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee said the government will conduct analyses before deciding the way forward, including whether to launch an appeal.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee said on Tuesday that the government will introduce different measures to spur economic growth amid a larger-than-expected budget deficit, describing the central government's move to allow Shenzhen residents to visit Hong Kong more often as coming at just the right time.
 <br>
  <br>
  On Monday, the financial secretary changed the deficit forecast for the current financial year from HK$48.1 billion to around HK$100 billion, citing lower revenue due to poor asset market performances and a drop in profits tax.
  <br>
  <br>
  For his part, Lee stressed that officials will cut spending and formulate measures to increase revenue -- but they'll be cautious with the measures so as to reduce the impact on the public.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the visa rule change for Shenzhen residents is among many measures exemplifying the country's strong backing for the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There are also new growth points, for example, the third runway system, which has been commissioned. Next year, Kai Tak Sports Park will also be commissioned. A lot of international major events will take place in Hong Kong," Lee told reporters ahead of the weekly Executive Council meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  "All these will stimulate our economy and increase government revenue. The government, meanwhile, also continues to consolidate our status as an international financial trade and shipping centre."
  <br>
  <br>
  The CE said he will hold a Q&A session in the legislature next Thursday, and one of the topics will be economic growth and expanding Hong Kong's international network.
  <br>
  <br>
  On tourism, Lee said operations have been smooth since Beijing restored multi-entry visas for Shenzhen residents on Sunday, and many people, he said, look forward to visiting the SAR "whenever they want".
  <br>
  <br>
  The CE noted that some trade representatives have expressed optimism that the measure will inject life into the local economy, noting that there are "waves of activities" coming up over the Christmas period.
  <br>
  <br>
  These, Lee said, include Hong Kong WinterFest, international horse races, panda carnivals and a real-life gathering and adventure for an online mobile game this weekend.
  <br>
  <br>
  The chief executive also said law enforcement agencies are determined to stop the return of parallel goods trading in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said consumption patterns of mainland residents have changed, and nowadays they can find many quality and cheap products through online stores.

    Petaia quits Australian rugby for NFL 'dream'

<img alt="Australia's Jordan Petaia (R) is tackled by Georgia's Mirian Modebadze during the France 2023 Rugby World Cup. File photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1781859_1_20241203112910.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Australian international Jordan Petaia said Tuesday he has quit rugby to chase his NFL dream, joining a growing list of players setting their sights on the lucrative American sport.
 <br>
  <br>
  Petaia has earned 31 caps for the Wallabies since his 2019 debut, and is considered one of Australian rugby's most promising backline talents.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The decision to step away from rugby hasn't been easy and one that took a great deal of consideration," the 24-year-old said in a statement on social media.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It feels like the right time in my career to pursue this dream I've had for a long time," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Les Kiss, Petaia's club coach at the Queensland Reds, said he was "one of the most dynamic players in Australia, if not the world."
  <br>
  <br>
  The NFL said Petaia had joined its International Player Pathway program, which gives stars from other sports the chance to be signed by one of 32 teams in the league.
  <br>
  <br>
  Starting in January, he will spend 10 weeks learning the game in Florida before he gets the chance to impress scouts at a "pro day" in March.
  <br>
  <br>
  Petaia follows in the footsteps of Australian Jordan Mailata, a little-known rugby league player signed by the Philadelphia Eagles in 2018 after coming through the programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mailata, who has impressed during his six years with the Eagles, signed a US$66 million contract extension earlier this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Welsh speedster Louis Rees-Zammit stunned the rugby world in January when he quit the sport on the eve of the Six Nations and announced his NFL ambitions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rees-Zammit was used sparingly in pre-season games, and was cut from the Kansas City Chiefs' 53-man playing roster.
  <br>
  <br>
  Six athletes have made active rosters for NFL teams after completing the pathway program, according to the NFL. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Foreign Minister Wang Yi said anti-subsidy tariffs imposed by the European Union on Chinese electric vehicles violated the principles of fair competition and free trade during talks with his German counterpart Annalena Baerbock in Beijing on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  China urged Germany and Europe to view its development objectively and rationally, adopt an active and pragmatic policy towards China, and properly handle trade disputes through dialogue and consultation, according to Xinhua News Agency.
  <br>
  <br>
  Baerbock, for her part, said Germany supports the continuation of negotiations between China and the EU to try to find a mutually acceptable solution.
  <br>
  <br>
  On China-Germany ties, Wang said Beijing has always regarded Berlin as an important partner, and that differences between the two countries should not become obstacles to cooperation or lead to confrontation.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Arsenal are set to host Manchester United in the FA Cup third round next month in a meeting of the competition's two most successful clubs.
 <br>
  <br>
  United are the holders after winning it for the 13th time last season, while Arsenal lifted the last of their record 14 trophies in 2020.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tie is set for the weekend of January 11-12 at the Emirates Stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  Manchester City, winners in 2023 and runners-up in May, host fourth-tier Salford, owned by United's 'Class of 92' made up of David Beckham, the Neville brothers, Paul Scholes, Ryan Giggs and Nicky Butt.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool are also at home to League Two opponents in Accrington Stanley.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chelsea play Morecambe, the fourth division's bottom side, while Newcastle play other League Two strugglers Bromley.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tottenham were drawn away to Tamworth, who are one of only two non-league clubs left in the competition. Fellow National League side Dagenham and Redbridge are away to second-tier Millwall.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the third round the 44 clubs from the Premier League and Championship enter the competition, joining the 20 lower-league and non-league sides who won in the previous round. (AFP)

 Italy will host the Davis Cup Finals from 2025 to 2027, the International Tennis Federation announced on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The eight-team men's event, called the "Final 8", was won this year by Jannik Sinner's Italy, who triumphed in Spain last month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Malaga has hosted the event since 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are delighted to partner with the FITP (Italian Tennis Federation) for the Davis Cup Final 8," said ITF president David Haggerty.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Italy has a rich history in tennis and a proven ability to host world-class sporting events," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 2025 finals will be staged in Bologna.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are thrilled to have been selected as hosts," Angelo Binaghi, president of the FITP, said. "We look forward to welcoming the best teams in the world to our country next November and for the next three years." (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Cristiano Ronaldo watched on from the stands as already-qualified Al Nassr lost for the first time in this year's Asian Champions League Elite as they were beaten 2-1 in injury time by Qatar's Al Sadd on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Portuguese star, 39, was reportedly rested for the fixture in Riyadh given the Saudi club had secured their place in the knockout stages last week, with three rounds of the group phase remaining.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ronaldo scored twice against Al Gharafa, another Qatari side, last time out, and then netted a double again in the Saudi Pro League on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the Al Nassr captain was omitted from Stefano Pioli's matchday squad for the visit of Al Sadd.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ronaldo, who has 15 goals in 18 appearances for his club this season, was spotted at Al Awwal Park sitting alongside his mother Dolores Aveiro and his partner Georgina Rodriguez.
  <br>
  <br>
  Al Sadd took the lead eight minutes into the second half through Akram Afif, when the reigning AFC Player of the Year raced from the halfway line onto a long ball.
  <br>
  <br>
  Afif outpaced defender Mohammed Al Fatil and finishing low past Brazil goalkeeper Bento.
  <br>
  <br>
  Al Nassr drew level on 80 minutes, once Brazilian youngster Wesley's low cross was turned into his own goal by Al Sadd defender Romain Saiss.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, there would be a huge sting in the tail for Al Nassr, when Afif was tripped inside the hosts' penalty area and substitute Adam Ounas converted from the spot in the 99th minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  With the defeat, Al Nassr stay third in the Western Region group stage, while Al Sadd move fourth to also claim a spot in the last 16.
  <br>
  <br>
  The top eight teams qualify for the knockout stages.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fellow Saudi side Al Ahli remain top – even if they surrendered their 100 percent record in this year's tournament – thanks to an Ivan Toney double that secured a 2-2 draw with Iran's Esteghlal in Jeddah.
  <br>
  <br>
  The England striker twice equalised for the hosts from the penalty spot, with the first coming deep into first-half injury time and the second converted in the 86th minute. Esteghlal had Mohammed Hossein Eslami sent off five minutes before.
  <br>
  <br>
  It represented a second successive Champions League Elite match in which Toney has scored twice following his double last week against Asian champions Al Ain. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The future of the planet is at stake during hearings at the top United Nations court, a representative for Vanuatu said on Monday, opening a historic case that aims to set a legal framework on how countries should tackle climate change.
 <br>
  <br>
  More than 100 countries and organisations are set to present before the International Court of Justice (ICJ) over the next two weeks, the highest number ever.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The outcome of these proceedings will reverberate across generations, determining the fate of nations like mine and the future of our planet," said Vanuatu's representative for climate change, Ralph Regenvanu.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This may well be the most consequential case in the history of humanity," Regenvanu told the 15-judge bench in the panelled hall of the Peace Palace in The Hague.
  <br>
  <br>
  Activists hope the ICJ opinion will have far-reaching legal consequences in the fight against climate change, impacting ongoing court cases as well as domestic and international legislation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Others fear the UN-backed request for a non-binding advisory opinion will have limited impact - and it could take the UN's highest court months, or even years, to deliver.
  <br>
  <br>
  A handful of protesters gathered outside the Peace Palace, near a big screen reading "We are watching".
  <br>
  <br>
  Demonstrators had hung banners saying: "Biggest problem to the highest court" and "Fund our future, climate finance now."
  <br>
  <br>
  The presentations at the scenic Peace Palace come days after a bitterly negotiated climate deal at the COP29 summit in Azerbaijan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wealthy polluting countries ultimately agreed to find at least US$300 billion a year by 2035 to help poorer nations transition to cleaner energy sources and prepare for increasing climate impacts such as extreme weather.
  <br>
  <br>
  Developing countries condemned the pledge as too little, too late, and the summit's final deal failed to include a global pledge to move away from burning planet-heating fossil fuels. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 France's Michel Barnier faced an abrupt end to his premiership on Monday after key opposition parties said they would back a no-confidence motion against his government after only three months in power.
 <br>
  <br>
  Certain that the National Assembly would deny him a majority backing the government's social security financing plan for next year, Barnier forced through the bill without a vote, using executive powers under article 49.3 of the French constitution.
  <br>
  <br>
  The conservative premier, who formed a minority government in September after an inconclusive general election, has lived under the constant threat of a no-confidence vote that could force him to quit.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government could be toppled as early as Wednesday, when a vote is expected.
  <br>
  <br>
  Barnier called it "a moment of truth in which everybody must take their responsibilities", warning against lawmakers putting "partisan interests" before the "best interest of the nation".
  <br>
  <br>
  Far-left opposition party LFI said immediately it would bring a no-confidence motion which the far-right National Rally (RN) - the largest single party in France's parliament - said it would vote in favour of, after accusing Barnier of failing to negotiate on some of the bill's provisions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Key to any such vote is Marine Le Pen, the parliamentary leader of the RN that has opposed several parts of the government's 2025 budget plan, including the social security financing bill submitted to the assembly on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a last-ditch concession to the RN, Barnier's office said it was scrapping plans for a less generous prescription drug reimbursement policy from next year.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the nod to Le Pen's concerns was not enough to avert the no-confidence motion for Barnier, who has little hope of finding any left-wing support. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 US stocks had a strong day on Monday, the first trading day in December, with the Nasdaq and S&P 500 closing at fresh record highs, and the Dow dipping slightly.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average was the only major Wall Street index to fall on Monday, dipping 0.3 percent to close at 44,782.00.
  <br>
  <br>
  The S&P 500 rose 0.2 percent to close at a new record of 6,047.15, while the Nasdaq rose 1.0 percent to an all-time high of 19,403.95.
  <br>
  <br>
  "From a technical standpoint, the market is still in very good shape," Jack Ablin from Cresset Capital told AFP. "And December also coincides with... a favourable seasonal trend as well."
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're just getting back to a mega cap growth stocks again," Ablin said. "And it may be because investors don't expect rates to come down as quickly as they originally thought."
  <br>
  <br>
  Ablin said the market was favouring those companies because they have "no debt or very little debt."
  <br>
  <br>
  "And so when they think rates are going to stay high, then they want the companies that aren't borrowing much," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among individual stocks, Super Micro Computer surged 28.7 percent after a probe into an auditor's concerns about governance and transparency issues found "no evidence" of misconduct at the firm.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another firm to rise was chip manufacturing equipment firm Applied Materials, which saw its share price rise by 4.9 percent. (AFP)

    Dozens dead in stampede at Guinea football match

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A deadly stampede at a football match killed at least 56 people in Guinea's second city N'Zerekore, the government said.
 <br>
  <br>
  The events at Sunday's match, which were initially reported as clashes between fans, were triggered after a player was sent off at the end of the game, witnesses said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The match in the southeastern city was the final of a tournament organised in honour of Guinea's junta leader, Mamady Doumbouya, who seized power in a 2021 coup and has installed himself as president.
  <br>
  <br>
  The opposition has accused the junta of using sport for political ends.
  <br>
  <br>
  Witnesses said fans invaded the pitch following the referee's decision, with some attacking the stand designated for officials, prompting the intervention of security forces.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Protests of dissatisfaction with refereeing decisions led to stone-throwing by supporters, resulting in fatal stampedes," said a government statement which was read out on national television.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hospital services have put the provisional death toll at 56, with several others injured," it added, describing the incident as a "tragic event".
  <br>
  <br>
  "The government assures the public that investigations will be carried out to establish who is responsible for this unfortunate event," the statement said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Young people also set fire to a police station overnight, according to public television.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prime Minister Amadou Oury Bah condemned the "incidents that marred the match between the teams of Labe and N'Zerekore", in a post on Facebook.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The government is following the situation and reiterates its call for calm so as not to impede hospital services from aiding the injured," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Local media reported that hospital wards and a morgue were overwhelmed by the injured and dead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Such tournaments and other public gatherings have become common in the West African nation, in what is widely seen as a campaign to promote Doumbouya's candidacy in any future presidential election.
  <br>
  <br>
  The military seized power by force in September 2021 by overthrowing civilian President Alpha Conde.

 The Office of the Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Monday said it hopes Hong Kong youngsters can have a greater understanding of the nation's foreign affairs through an annual knowledge contest.
 <br>
  <br>
  The theme of the 17th edition of the Hong Kong Cup Diplomatic Knowledge Contest is "Love Diplomacy, Love the World".
  <br>
  <br>
  The contest is jointly organised by the commissioner's office, the Education Bureau and the Better Hong Kong Foundation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at the kick-off ceremony, Deputy Commissioner Li Yongsheng said the contest is an important platform for students to learn more about China's foreign policy.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The year of 2025 marks the 80th anniversary of the founding of the United Nations and the 70th anniversary of the Bandung Conference. These two events are of great significance in the history of diplomacy," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The contest aims to encourage Hong Kong youth to further understand major-country diplomacy with Chinese characteristics, and think of how to make greater and more contributions to the country's foreign affairs."
  <br>
  <br>
  A study tour to Beijing and Gansu Province was held in July for the winning teams of the 16th edition.
  <br>
  <br>
  Director of Broadcasting Eddie Cheung said RTHK produced three episodes of the tour, to be aired on three Thursdays starting this week.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I believe students who joined the tour were able to combine the knowledge in their textbooks with their insight from the study tour, integrating their love for the country and Hong Kong, and tell good stories of our country," Cheung said.
  <br>
  <br>
  A Form three student from St. Paul's College said he will be participating in the upcoming contest and hopes he can do better this time round.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I read more about the news in the world and I also read books about the diplomatic policies of China," he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Last year, I didn't go to the final competition, so this year, I wish I can get a better result in the online quiz and can get the chance to attend the final competition."
  <br>
  <br>
  Applications will open on December 9. The first round of the contest will be held in March next year, and the final will take place in May.

    Court halts Fanling golf course flats plan

<img alt="The High Court says overturning the administration's decision can lead to re-conducting the public consultation and seeking comments from environmental advisers. File photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1781778_2_20241202200228.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The High Court has overturned the government's approval of an environmental study into plans to build public flats on part of the Fanling Golf Course, calling on authorities to consult the public on the matter again.
 <br>
  <br>
  Judge Russell Coleman on Monday handed down the judgement after the Hong Kong Golf Club filed a legal challenge against an environmental impact assessment (EIA) report that would set the stage for building public housing units on 9.5 hectares of the century-old course.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said overturning the administration's decision could lead to re-conducting the public consultation and seeking comments from environmental advisers "with the benefits of the fruits of that re-consultation".
  <br>
  <br>
  The club had argued that a public consultation exercise had not been carried out properly or fairly, saying authorities had been allowed to submit additional information during the assessment but people's responses to the submissions were not taken into account.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As a matter of fact, the public were only consulted on part of the EIA report in its final form. That is contrary to the requirement of the EIA Ordinance," Coleman wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In short, I find that the fairness and integrity of the process, set out in the EIA Ordinance properly construed, demanded re-consultation once the additional information was produced to form part of the EIA report."
  <br>
  <br>
  The director of environmental protection gave conditional approval to the assessment in May last year, before the Town Planning Board rezoned the site from "residential" to "undetermined" use temporarily.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials had attached a number of conditions to the assessment's approval, including having the Civil Engineering and Development Department revise its layout plan to preserve about 0.4 hectares of woodland "as far as practicable".
  <br>
  <br>
  The judge said imposing such a condition “subject to the caveat of practicability” was problematic.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Until the exercise of revision is actually performed, it cannot be known whether the stated current plan [can] be maintained," he wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the High Court judge also rejected part of the club's contention, including an argument that the approval was unlawful because it failed to require the project proponent to carry out mitigation measures identified in the assessment report.
  <br>
  <br>
  The court earlier suspended the environmental review on an interim basis until the judicial challenge was resolved.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong Golf Club said it welcomed the judgement, saying the Fanling site is an internationally renowned and world-class venue with significant ecological and cultural value.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The three championship courses – which include the old course – are integral parts of the Fanling site, which is an irreplaceable sports facility and is key to Hong Kong’s ability to attract major golf tournaments," the club said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  It added the course will host a series of events next year, such as the LIV golf tournament and golf competitions for the National Games, which "play a critical role" in driving the city's sports scene.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Moving forward, the club will utilise the three championship courses to the best of their potential with a view to supporting the government policy that advocates the 'shaping of tourism with sports' and the further development of Hong Kong's mega-event economy," the club said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Environmental Protection Department said it will study the judgement and announce whether it would appeal "at an appropriate time".

    Consultation on subdivided flats plan begins

<img alt="Under the proposals, subdivided flats will have to have a floor area of at least eight square metres and a minimum ceiling height of at least 2.3 metres.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A two-month consultation exercise on proposed regulations aimed at ridding the city of poor quality subdivided flats began on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  At a housing panel meeting, several lawmakers said they were concerned landlords might start renovations ahead of the new legislation, leaving existing tenants homeless.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lawmaker Gary Zhang, a panel member, said the government needs to take the opportunity to hear what the public thinks about the policy.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We roll out this policy out of a very good will to ensure the basic humanity level at our housing situation. But if we cannot manage the transition, well I'm afraid ultimately we might cause some people to lose their homes, lose their residences,” he told RTHK after the meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  Deputy Financial Secretary Michael Wong, who leads the Task Force on Tackling the Issue of Subdivided Units, said he doesn't think such evictions will be a big problem.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We have talked to different parties earlier and heard about such sayings. But we haven't found any signs of a widespread issue. Also we have emphasised multiple times that under the existing landlord and tenant ordinance, the protection for tenants is still here. If any landlords break the rules and evict their tenants please let us know, we will address that seriously,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to the proposed policy, subdivided flats will have to have a floor area of at least eight square metres and a minimum ceiling height of at least 2.3 metres.
  <br>
  <br>
  Landlords caught renting out substandard flats would face jail terms of up to three years, as well as a maximum fine of HK$300,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials told lawmakers that they will consult the public on how long the grace period should be for landlords to modify their flats to meet the new requirements.
  <br>
  <br>
  During the meeting, some lawmakers said they were worried people might simply switch to renting beds or guest rooms instead, which could be even more cramped than subdivided flats.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong said the government will look into other relevant policies to address potential issues.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A local creative studio is hosting an exhibition called "Panda Go! Fest HK" showcasing 2,500 panda sculptures at various iconic locations across the SAR on weekends in December and during Christmas.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a welcoming ceremony, SK Lam, founder of All Rights Reserved, said the exhibition will be held at the Avenue of Stars, Ngong Ping 360, Ocean Park and Sun Yat Sen Memorial Park.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Based on our past 10 years of experience and also the recent experience we had with [Doraemon], we think these are the more accessible areas that the public can go and visit," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lam also said the team has created six new panda characters inspired by the Ocean Park panda family, consisting of Ying Ying and Le Le, new arrivals currently named An An and Ke Ke, as well as the newborn twins.
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted that the company introduced a giant panda installation a decade ago, featuring 1,600 panda sculptures to symbolise the existing panda population at that time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lam added that thanks to global conservation efforts, the giant panda population has since increased to over 2,500, encompassing both wild and captive pandas.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The local stock market ended higher on Monday with the benchmark Hang Seng Index up 0.65 percent to close at 19,550.
 <br>
  <br>
  Analysts said the gains were driven by encouraging manufacturing data and expectations of continued policy support from Beijing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sentiment was buoyed by data that showed China's factory activity expanded last month, with Beijing's stimulus blitz since September starting to trickle through.

<div class="itemFullText">
 An impeachment complaint was filed on Monday against Philippine Vice President Sara Duterte, who is facing a legal storm over a death threat she made against the president, the alleged misuse of government funds by her office and other criminal accusations.
 <br>
  <br>
  The impeachment bid filed by several prominent opponents and activists in the House of Representatives accuses Duterte of violating the country’s Constitution, massive corruption and other “high crimes,” including the death threats she made against the president, his wife and the speaker of the House of Representatives.
  <br>
  <br>
  The vice president's legal troubles have unfolded in the backdrop of her increasingly bitter political feud with President Ferdinand Marcos Jr and his allies.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said in online news conference on November 23 that she had contracted an assassin to kill Marcos, his wife and Speaker Martin Romualdez if she were killed, a threat she warned was not a joke.
  <br>
  <br>
  She later said she was not threatening him but was expressing concern for her own safety. (AP)

    HK Island to get 'smart and green' transit line

<img alt="The Transport and Logistics Bureau says the 'smart and green mass transit system' it has opted for is more cost effective than a heavy rail project.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Transport officials say they hope to kick-start construction projects for a transit line linking HKU and Wong Chuk Hang MTR stations in 2027.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a paper submitted to Legco, the Transport and Logistics Bureau said rather than the heavy rail originally proposed, the new plan for the South Island Line (West) is to build a "smart and green mass transit system" using viaducts, along with a tunnel through the hilly terrain between Queen Mary Hospital and HKU.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 7.5-kilometre line will also pass through Aberdeen, Tin Wan, Wah Fu and Cyberport and will serve 130,000 residents and 50,000 people working in the areas, officials said.
  <br>
  <br>
  No expected completion date was given.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bureau said it hopes to begin detailed planning and design for the project next year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lawmaker Gary Zhang, who's a former railway engineer, said he expects construction work to be completed within five to six years' time.
  <br>
  <br>
  He pointed out that the capacity of the mass transit system is much lower than the original.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The new smart [and] green system - capacity could reach around 8,000. But normally the optimal capacity could be something around 5,000," he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So the capacity, yes, would be a disadvantage. But construction costs would be much much lower."

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police in Georgia fired tear gas and water cannon on Sunday on a fourth straight day of pro-EU protests that drew tens of thousands of people, as the prime minister rebuffed calls for new elections.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Black Sea nation has been rocked by turmoil since the governing Georgian Dream party claimed victory in October 26 parliamentary polls that the pro-European opposition said were fraudulent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The turmoil has deepened since Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze announced on Thursday that Georgia was shelving accession talks with the European Union until 2028, sparking a wave of protests in the capital, Tbilisi, and other cities.
  <br>
  <br>
  The opposition is boycotting the new parliament, while pro-EU President Salome Zurabishvili has asked the constitutional court to annul the election result, declaring the new legislature and government "illegitimate".
  <br>
  <br>
  Critics accuse Georgian Dream, in power for more than a decade, of having steered the country away from the EU in recent years, an accusation it denies.
  <br>
  <br>
  The interior ministry has said about 150 demonstrators have been arrested in this latest protest wave, while the Georgian Young Lawyers' Association put the number at 200.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police in some instances have chased protesters through the streets, beating them and firing rubber bullets and tear gas.
  <br>
  <br>
  Waving European and Georgian flags, tens of thousands rallied outside parliament on Sunday evening.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some demonstrators tossed fireworks and stones at riot police, while others banged on the metal door blocking parliament's entrance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police later fired water cannon, but were unable to disperse the crowds.
  <br>
  <br>
  Late at night, riot police in full gear moved in, using tear gas and water cannon to disperse the rally.
  <br>
  <br>
  The leader of the opposition United National Movement party, Levan Khabeishvili, told journalists that he was attacked by around 15 masked police officers attempting to detain him, but said he had managed to escape with the help of protesters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another protest took place outside the offices of Georgia's Public Broadcaster, widely accused of acting as a propaganda tool for the ruling party.
  <br>
  <br>
  The broadcaster conceded to the protesters' demand to grant Zurabishvili airtime, which it had previously denied her.
  <br>
  <br>
  Simultaneous protests took place in cities across Georgia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fuelling popular anger, Kobakhidze ruled out new parliamentary elections, saying that "the formation of the new government based on the October 26 parliamentary elections has been completed".
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier this week, the party nominated far-right former football international Mikheil Kavelashvili for the largely ceremonial post of president.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Zurabishvili told AFP in an exclusive interview on Saturday that she would not step down until last month's contested parliamentary elections are re-run.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brussels has not recognised the outcome of the October elections, and demanded an investigation into "serious electoral irregularities".
  <br>
  <br>
  The European Parliament has called for a re-run and for sanctions against top Georgian officials, including Kobakhidze.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zurabishvili on Saturday said that she was "the only legitimate institution in the country", and that "as long as there are no new elections... my mandate continues".
  <br>
  <br>
  Constitutional law experts have questioned the legitimacy of the new parliament, citing the fact it approved its own credentials in violation of a requirement to await a court ruling on Zurabishvili's bid to annul the election results.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hundreds of public servants, including from the ministries of foreign affairs, defence and education, as well as a number of judges, issued joint statements protesting Kobakhidze's decision to postpone EU accession talks. (AFP)

    Left-wing looks set for gains in Romanian election

<div class="itemFullText">
 Romania's ruling leftist Social Democrats (PSD) looked set to win the most votes in a parliamentary election on Sunday, fending off a resurgent far-right movement that challenged the country's pro-Western orientation, partial results showed.
 <br>
  <br>
  The vote is the second of three consecutive ballots for both a new parliament and a new president, after the first round of the presidential election on November 24 saw an independent far-right candidate, Calin Georgescu, emerge from relative obscurity to become the frontrunner.
  <br>
  <br>
  His unexpected win ushered in support for ultra-nationalist, hard-right parties, some with overt pro-Russian sympathies, which political analysts said could undermine Romania's support for Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  If final results confirm the preliminary count, a pro-Western coalition led by the PSD would likely have enough seats in parliament to form a government, although the far right would be a substantial force in the legislature.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, a broad coalition would be difficult to form amid disagreements over reforms and measures needed to rein in the country's gaping budget deficit, now the highest in the EU at eight percent of economic output.
  <br>
  <br>
  After a campaign dominated by voters' concerns over budget problems and the cost of living, the election pitted the far-right contenders against pro-European mainstream parties that have angered their voters with infighting and corruption allegations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Far-right parties have also used Romania's championing of Ukraine to stoke fears the war could spill over the border unless the country halts its support, as well as resentment over alleged preferential treatment for refugees from Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  Romania has the EU's biggest share of the population at risk of poverty, and swathes of the country need investment to attract jobs. (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Monday said Hong Kong would continue to leverage its advantages under the One Country, Two Systems framework and use its global network to become an international education hub.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lee made his remarks while addressing the Global University Presidents and Leaders Summit, where attendees included leaders and presidents from more than 50 global universities.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Our unique advantages spring from One Country, Two Systems. Thanks to this unique principle, we enjoy unwavering support from our country together with global connectivity," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Hong Kong attracts students from more than 100 countries. Over half of the academic staff in our institutions comes from outside Hong Kong. And we are building on that solid foundation, the Hong Kong SAR government endeavors to develop Hong Kong into an international post-secondary education hub,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CE noted the SAR has five universities among the world's top 100, and three in Asia's top 10.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added the government would continue to promote the “study in Hong Kong brand” as well as encourage local universities to seek more collaboration with overseas and mainland institutions, especially with other cities in the Greater Bay Area.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at the same occasion, the director of the central government's liaison office, Zheng Yanxiong, said under support from the central government, Hong Kong has upheld its universities' independence and academic freedom since the city's return to the motherland.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also expressed hope that local universities would work even more closely with their global counterparts.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I hope local universities will seize the opportunity at this forum to deepen their connections with the global higher education sector, enhancing mutual understanding, respect and trust, as well as collaboration in joint programmes and academic exchanges,” Zheng said.

    Govt expects deficit to balloon to HK$100bn

<img alt="Paul Chan has revised the government's budget deficit estimate this year to around HK$100 billion." src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1781721_1_20241202122432.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government has doubled its estimated deficit for the current financial year to around HK$100 billion, citing lower revenue mainly due to poor asset market performances.
 <br>
  <br>
  When Financial Secretary Paul Chan announced his budget in February, he forecast a shortfall of a little more than HK$48 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he told lawmakers on Monday that as well as relatively poor asset market performances, revenue from profits tax is lower because firms aren't doing too well at present.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the latest estimate was made after considering revenue from government bonds and repayments due.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Due to geopolitical tensions and other uncertainties, the asset markets continue to be under pressure and this has somewhat affected the revenue from land sales and stamp duty," Chan said at a financial affairs panel meeting in the legislature.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We'll continue to consider our fiscal balance as well as long-term needs of our society. We'll put in place arrangements with a view to restoring fiscal balance in the coming few years."
  <br>
  <br>
  He said SAR officials have met credit rating agencies and they agree with the government's assessment that it shouldn't try to reverse the deficit in one to two years as that would "bring a major shock to the society".
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said the government is conducting transitional fiscal consolidation, mainly by cutting expenditure, while raising revenue is considered to be supportive only.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister said US President-elect Donald Trump's economic policies could contribute to global uncertainties next year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said Trump's threat to impose new tariffs against different countries, including China, could affect Hong Kong's re-exports of mainland goods to the US.
  <br>
  <br>
  The secretary also reassured lawmakers that they need not worry too much about the government's dwindling fiscal reserves, saying the key is "taking care of our own business".

<img alt="A vehicle on fire in the aftermath of what the White Helmets said was an strike on Idlib, with the Syrian government vowing to drive out rebel forces from northwest Syria.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 At least 25 people were killed in northwestern Syria in air strikes carried out by the Syrian government and Russia, the Syrian opposition-run rescue service known as the White Helmets said early on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Russian and Syrian jets struck the rebel-held city of Idlib in northern Syria on Sunday, military sources said, as President Bashar al-Assad vowed to crush insurgents who had swept into the city of Aleppo.
  <br>
  <br>
  The army also said it had recaptured several towns that rebels had overrun in recent days.
  <br>
  <br>
  Insurgents led by jihadi group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham launched a two-pronged attack on Aleppo and the countryside around Idlib last Wednesday, before moving toward neighbouring Hama province.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Sunday, government troops created a “strong defensive line” in northern Hama, as they attempted to stall the insurgents’ momentum, according to Britain-based opposition war monitor the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.
  <br>
  <br>
  The surge in fighting has raised the prospect of another violent, destabilising front reopening in the Middle East at a time when Israel is fighting Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, conflicts that have repeatedly threatened to ignite an even wider regional war.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also risks drawing Russia and Turkey — each with its own interests to protect in Syria — into direct heavy fighting against each other.
  <br>
  <br>
  The insurgents announced their offensive last Wednesday, just as a ceasefire started between Hezbollah and Israel that raised some hope tensions in the region might be calming.
  <br>
  <br>
  The surprise offensive is an embarrassment for Assad, and it comes at a time when his allies — Iran and groups it backs and Russia — are preoccupied with their own conflicts.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to a statement from Assad’s office, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi reassured the Syrian leader during a visit to Damascus that Tehran was ready to support the government in their counter-offensive.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arab leaders, including Jordan’s King Abdullah II and United Arab Emirates President Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, have also called Assad to express their solidarity.
  <br>
  <br>
  The civil war, which has killed hundreds of thousands of people and displaced many millions, has ground on since 2011 with no formal end.
  <br>
  <br>
  Most of the heavy fighting stopped years ago after Iran-backed militias and Russian air power helped Assad win control of all major cities. (Agencies)

    'Shallow waters contributed to whale's death'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department revealed on Monday that Hong Kong's shallow waters was a factor leading to the death of a whale in Tai O.
 <br>
  <br>
  The stranded animal passed away despite rescue efforts by a team of veterinarians.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on an RTHK radio programme, Assistant Director (Fisheries & Marine Conservation) Jim Chu pointed out that beaked whales usually inhabit deep waters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Its natural habitat is in waters with a depth of between 300 metres and even a kilometre. The waters of Hong Kong are only around tens of metres deep," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Around Tai O, the water depth is around 10 metres or less. So these conditions are totally unsuitable for these animals to survive."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chu revealed the cetacean was first discovered in Yi O on Saturday afternoon, before it appeared in Tai O in the evening.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities also said that a canvas bag was discovered inside the whale, and Chu said it was not known for how long it had been inside the animal's digestive system.
  <br>
  <br>
  But as the bag was still in good shape, it showed the cetacean was unable to digest it.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chu also said autopsy showed the whale's stomach did not have any food, and it is likely this was due to the bag blocking its digestive system.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added the Response Plan to the Sighting of non-resident Cetaceans in Hong Kong Waters was activated for the first time during this incident.
  <br>
  <br>
  It aims to minimise the nuisance caused by people to external species and provide emergency assistance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Taison Chang, chairman of the Hong Kong Dolphin Conservation Society, told the same programme the animal was likely a tropical bottlenose whale.
  <br>
  <br>
  He believes the cetacean, measuring six to seven metres long, was an adult whale.

    OSC funding helps care home support ageing residents

<div class="itemFullText">
 A residential care home serving people with disabilities for almost six decades in Hong Kong is seeking support to enhance its care services for ageing residents.
 <br>
  <br>
  Home of Loving Faithfulness is one of the 11 beneficiaries of this year's Operation Santa Claus (OSC), and has been providing life-long care for children and adults with special needs since 1965.
  <br>
  <br>
  What sets this facility apart is its commitment to lifetime care, accepting residents as young as six years old and allowing them to stay indefinitely, the home's Superintendent Matthew Chu said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chu said the charity has launched a project called Lifelong Services to address the increasing challenges in caring for elderly residents who experience deteriorating body functions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When they age, the need for their caring [becomes] more challenging because sometimes their swallowing is not very good. Sometimes they have difficulties in excreting their urine," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chu said the charity operates entirely on donations without government subsidies and it will use the funds from OSC to hire more staff and bring in professional services.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will [use] the funds to hire additional staff and also we will [hire] professional services like occupational therapist services to come in to help these residents to maintain their health."
  <br>
  <br>
  Jointly organised by RTHK and South China Morning Post, OSC funds charitable projects that focus on children and youth, the elderly, the community, those with physical and mental disabilities, medical projects, and those concerning the environment.
  <br>
  <br>
  If you wish to make a donation, please visit the Operation Santa Claus website at https://oschk.org/.

  The pair, currently called An An and Ke Ke, are both five years old and showed their distinct personalities during the visit.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ke Ke climbed up to her wooden platform and leisurely ate her bamboo leaves. An An was much more playful – he walked around exploring his habitat and rolled around on the ground while eating.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ponyo, who works at the park's Whiskers Village, explained how to tell the pandas apart.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For Ke Ke, she is like a princess. She loves to have her me time, and she's a bit curious about the environment outside, and she would like to stay a little bit quiet.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But for An An, he's just like a boy. He's very strong, and he's very curious [about the] outside, and he would like to discover outside, see what is going on."
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 22,600 suggestions have poured in for a naming contest of these national treasures, with the winning names set to be announced at the official debut ceremony on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hongkongers will be able to meet the pandas when their home opens to the public this Sunday.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Donovan Mitchell scored 35 points and the Cleveland Cavaliers avenged a heartbreaking loss with a 115-111 victory over Boston on Sunday in a matchup of the NBA's top teams.
 <br>
  <br>
  Mitchell scored 20 points in the fourth quarter as the Cavs rallied from 14 points down in the second half to defeat the reigning NBA champions.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Cavaliers started the season 15-0 but suffered their first loss at Boston last month by 120-117 and dropped their two prior games, both losses to Atlanta, before staging a fightback home triumph.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For us, we've got to go out there and make a statement," Mitchell said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They beat us in the NBA Cup. No excuse. We've got to go out there and try to build – we had two losses that really hurt," he went on to say. "We weren't playing like ourselves – we needed this win."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Cavs improved to 18-3 to stay atop the Eastern Conference while the Celtics fell to 16-4 as Cleveland snapped their seven-game win streak.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You've got to trust your work and what we've been working on since training camp. That's the biggest thing," Mitchell said. "That's what you saw tonight, and that's what it's going to continue to be."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Celtics were without starting guards Jaylen Brown due to illness and Derrick White with a sprained right foot.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Just because they've got two guys down, they've got a lot of guys who are capable," Mitchell said. "You've got to respect them – they're champions for a reason."
  <br>
  <br>
  Cleveland led 51-49 at half-time but the Celtics dominated the third quarter for an 84-72 lead entering the fourth, Jayson Tatum scoring 17 of his 33 points in the third period to lead Boston.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mitchell responded for Cleveland, including a floater that gave the Cavs a 103-101 lead with 67 seconds remaining and concluded his run of 11 consecutive Cavaliers points.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The biggest thing is you've just got to pick your spots, find your moments throughout the game," said Mitchell. "They kind of went on a run and in the fourth quarter I started to make my imprint.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tatum missed a layup and Mobley followed with a dunk for a 105-101 Cavs lead. Porzingis responded with two free throws with 26 seconds to play but Mitchell sank two free throws of his own for a 107-103 Cavs lead.
  <br>
  <br>
  The teams traded free throws late until Pritchard deliberately missed one trying to get a rebound, but he committed a lane violation and Mitchell added two final free throws to seal the victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  "At the end of the day, we executed on both ends of the floor," said Mitchell.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I scored offensively but we were getting stops and finding ways to get rebounds, loose balls, different things," he added. "That's what ultimately ended up getting us the W." (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Netherlands' Sifan Hassan and Botswana's Letsile Tebogo were named World Athletes of the Year on Sunday after they both scooped multiple medals at the Paris Olympics.
 <br>
  <br>
  Hassan won the women's marathon in an Olympic record time of 2.22:55. She also claimed bronze medals in the 10,000m and 5000m events.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Thank you to the fans, to everybody who voted," Hassan, also awarded women's out of stadium athlete of the year, said in Monaco.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I never thought I was going to win this one – this year was crazy," she added. "It's not only me, all the athletes have been amazing. I'm really grateful. What more can I say?"
  <br>
  <br>
  Tebogo, meanwhile, also made history in the French capital as he became the first African to win the Olympic men's 200-metre title and earned Botswana their first ever Olympic gold medal.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also set a national record of 9.86 when finishing sixth in the 100-metre final before being part of Botswana's silver medal-winning men's 4x400-metre team.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It feels amazing to know that the fans are always there for us athletes. It was a great year," Tebogo, also named men's track athlete of the year, said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This means a lot. It's not just about the team that is around you, there are a lot of fans out there that really want us to win something great for the continent," the 21-year-old went on to say.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was a real surprise to hear my name because I didn't expect this." (Reuters)

    Eagles top Ravens, Steelers edge Bengals in Cincinnati

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Philadelphia Eagles on Sunday broke out of a tight encounter with the Baltimore Ravens to record their 10th win of the NFL season.
 <br>
  <br>
  Star running back Saquon Barkley burst for a 25-yard rushing touchdown to put his team 21-12 up mid-way through the fourth quarter.
  <br>
  <br>
  A 35-yard Jake Elliott field goal extended the lead to 12 points and although Lamar Jackson found Isaiah Likely with an 11-yard touchdown pass in the final seconds it was too late for a Ravens comeback as the Eagles won 24-19.
  <br>
  <br>
  Baltimore kicker Justin Tucker's woes were evident again as he missed two field goals and an extra point.
  <br>
  <br>
  Barkley, enjoying an outstanding year after being traded by the New York Giants, put up 107 yards on 23 carries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Geno Smith returned to haunt the New York Jets as he led the Seattle Seahawks to a 26-21 victory, clinched by Zach Charbonnet's 8-yard rushing score in the fourth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Former Jet Smith threw for 206 yards and a touchdown while opposite number Aaron Rodgers threw for 185 yards and two touchdowns.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Pittsburgh quarterback Russell Wilson continued his renaissance, throwing for 414 yards and three touchdowns as the Steelers won 44-38 at the Cincinnati Bengals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wilson, a Super Bowl winner with Seattle in 2014, was released by Denver last year and signed on a one-year veteran minimum deal with the Steelers.
  <br>
  <br>
  But having earned the starting role in Pittsburgh ahead of Justin Fields, the 36-year-old is spearheading the team's strong push towards the playoffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wilson's 25-yard touchdown pass to Pat Freiermuth at the end of the third quarter was a reminder of his enduring quality, scrambling out of the pocket and finding his receiver with a fine pass on the run.
  <br>
  <br>
  That score gave the Steelers a 34-24 lead heading into the fourth, and a 21-yard fumble recovery returned by Payton Wilson put them in firm control.
  <br>
  <br>
  Although Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow threw two touchdowns in the final quarter, either side of a 30-yard Chris Boswell field goal for the Steelers, Pittsburgh held on for a crucial win against their divisional rivals.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Steelers lead the AFC North on 9-3 with the Baltimore Ravens second on 8-5.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are working for something and it matters to us, it matters, it was a great day," said Wilson.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are still learning, still growing – there is still a lot more to do," he added. (AFP)

<img alt="Hunter Biden was convicted earlier this year of lying about his drug use when he bought a gun, and pleaded guilty in a separate tax evasion trial. File photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1781679_1_20241202091448.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 President Biden on Sunday issued an official pardon for his son Hunter, who is facing sentencing for two criminal cases related to tax evasion and the purchase of a firearm.
 <br>
  <br>
  "No reasonable person who looks at the facts of Hunter's cases can reach any other conclusion than Hunter was singled out only because he is my son -- and that is wrong," the president said in a statement, calling it "a miscarriage of justice."
  <br>
  <br>
  The younger Biden was convicted earlier this year of lying about his drug use when he bought a gun -- a felony -- and has also pleaded guilty in a separate tax evasion trial.
  <br>
  <br>
  The pardon comes after Biden has repeatedly said he wouldn't intervene in his son's legal troubles. The White House press secretary said as recently as September that Biden wouldn't issue a pardon for Hunter.
  <br>
  <br>
  At the same time, criminal cases against President-elect Donald Trump have come to a standstill after a sweeping ruling on presidential immunity by the Supreme Court -- all but ensuring Biden's Republican rival will likely never see a jail cell, even after his landmark conviction for falsifying business records in May.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I said I would not interfere with the Justice Department's decision-making, and I kept my word even as I have watched my son being selectively, and unfairly, prosecuted," Biden said in Sunday's statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The charges in his cases came about only after several of my political opponents in Congress instigated them to attack me and oppose my election," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I believe in the justice system, but as I have wrestled with this, I also believe raw politics has infected this process and it led to a miscarriage of justice." (AFP)

    Man Utd thrash Everton to give Amorim perfect start

<img alt="Ruben Amorim during Man United's Premier League match against Everton. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1781659_1_20241202053549.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ruben Amorim refused to rule out a top-four challenge after enjoying a dream home Premier League debut as Manchester United thrashed Everton 4-0 thanks to doubles from Marcus Rashford and Joshua Zirkzee on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Portuguese's first Premier League game in charge at Ipswich last weekend showed how much work he has ahead as United blew an early lead to draw 1-1 at Portman Road.
  <br>
  <br>
  But they cut loose against another opponent struggling at the wrong end of the table to the delight of the home crowd as chants of Amorim's name rang around Old Trafford in the closing stages.
  <br>
  <br>
  The former Sporting Lisbon boss made six changes from Thursday's rollercoaster 3-2 win over Bodo/Glimt and was rewarded with a performance full of attacking verve that has been so often lacking from the Red Devils this season.
  <br>
  <br>
  United are up to ninth place, within touching distance of the top four, and Amorim knows a challenge to qualify for the Champions League would be a good first impression at his new club.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's hard for me. If I say no, you will say that I cannot be a Manchester United coach," he said. "I said this many times, I will be judged about the place that we finish. I know that. But let's focus just on the next game and look at the performance."
  <br>
  <br>
  Rashford has found his form under the new boss with three goals in as many games.
  <br>
  <br>
  The England international opened the floodgates on 34 minutes when his effort deflected in off Jarrad Branthwaite.
  <br>
  <br>
  United had tried to sign Branthwaite during the summer transfer window, but his first half to forget continued when he was dispossessed by Amad Diallo before Zirkzee struck his first goal since the opening day of the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Having scored inside two minutes of Amorim's first two games in charge, United this time took just seconds to net from the restart for the second half.
  <br>
  <br>
  Diallo played in Rashford, who showed impressive pace and then poise to beat Jordan Pickford.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zirkzee had netted just once in 18 previous appearances since joining from Bologna.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dutchman looked a different player after the confidence boost of his first goal and rounded off the scoring after the impressive Diallo again won possession and provided the assist.
  <br>
  <br>
  Victory lifts United up to ninth and within four points of the top four.
  <br>
  <br>
  Much tougher challenges are to come, starting with a daunting trip to Arsenal on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  But for a fan base starved of excitement in recent times, Amorim's home Premier League bow delivered exactly what United supporters craved.
  <br>
  <br>
  Amorim saluted the influential Diallo's contribution to United's victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He was really good again. He's in a great moment, but that moment starts with Ruud (van Nistelrooy). I just take advantage of his work with Amad," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He was really good defending and really good attacking, so he has to continue to play like that," Amorim added.
  <br>
  <br>
  By contrast, Everton remain just two points above the relegation zone ahead of a devilishly difficult run of fixtures over the festive period. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Liverpool opened up a nine-point lead at the top of the Premier League as Manchester City's crisis deepened in a 2-0 defeat at Anfield on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Cody Gakpo's 12th-minute goal was scant reward for the Reds' first-half domination and they sealed an 18th win in 20 games under Arne Slot thanks to Mohamed Salah's penalty.
  <br>
  <br>
  City are now 11 points off the runaway leaders down in fifth and winless in seven games, including six defeats.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal and Chelsea are Liverpool's closest challengers as City appear set to lose their crown as English champions after winning an unprecedented four consecutive titles.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pep Guardiola was taunted with chants of "you're getting sacked in the morning" in the closing stages.
  <br>
  <br>
  The City boss responded by showing six fingers, one for each of his Premier League title wins in the past seven seasons.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Guardiola insisted he is not living in the past as he looks to turnaround the worst run of his managerial career.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When you win you laugh, when they win, they laugh. It's part of the game," said Guardiola on his interaction with the crowd.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Now it will be so difficult to repeat (winning the title) this season but all the club, we will reflect together, to try and come back strong," said Guardiola.
  <br>
  <br>
  City's only point since October 26 even felt like a defeat as they blew a 3-0 lead in the final 15 minutes to draw 3-3 with Feyenoord in the Champions League in midweek.
  <br>
  <br>
  Guardiola responded by dropping goalkeeper Ederson, while Kyle Walker and Ruben Dias were restored to the defence.
  <br>
  <br>
  But there was no response from the defending champions as they were blown away in the opening stages.
  <br>
  <br>
  City could barely get out of their half in the opening quarter and the goal duly arrived when Gakpo bundled in Salah's enticing cross to the back post.
  <br>
  <br>
  Virgil van Dijk hit the post and powered another big headed chance inches wide as the chances continued to come for Liverpool.
  <br>
  <br>
  Even during City's finest seasons under Guardiola, they have struggled to contain the power of the Anfield crowd.
  <br>
  <br>
  City's only away win against Liverpool since 2003 remains behind closed doors during the coronavirus-impacted 2021/22 season.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Today really stood out," said Slot on whether this was his finest day as Liverpool boss to day. "The culmination of the energy we had and the energy the crowd had."
  <br>
  <br>
  Guardiola's men did at least manage to stem the bleeding either side of half-time, but should still have been punished several times on the counter-attack.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stefan Ortega saved from Gakpo and Trent Alexander-Arnold, either side of a stunning Salah miss when one-on-one with the German goalkeeper.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another turnover deep inside their own half finally cost City the decisive second goal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Salah had fired wide from the spot in Wednesday's 2-0 Champions League win over Real Madrid.
  <br>
  <br>
  This time the Egyptian found the bottom corner for his 13th goal of the season to round off Liverpool's dream week.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Real Madrid and Manchester City have been and are so good, with managers that have won so many trophies, so it is always nice to come out of those situations as a winner," added Slot.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But they were able to win every single three days," he said. "We understand what we want to achieve is more than this winning once or twice, even against these big teams, if you want to win big things."
  <br>
  <br>
  Guardiola emptied Jeremy Doku, Savinho, Jack Grealish and Kevin De Bruyne off the bench in the second half in search of a lifeline.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, City's reliance on Erling Haaland for goals was again evident as he was marked out of the game by Van Dijk, who had been imperious until a late lapse of concentration should have gifted City a consolation.
  <br>
  <br>
  He presented the ball to De Bruyne, but he could not beat the in-form Caoimhin Kelleher. (AFP)

    Tote bag found in dead whale during necropsy

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Agriculture, Fisheries, and Conservation Department (AFCD) on Sunday said a tote bag was found inside a whale, which died earlier in the day.
 <br>
  <br>
  The whale had become stranded in shallow waters near Tai O.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bag, measuring 88 by 52 centimetres, was found in the whale's digestive system during a necropsy conducted by vets from Ocean Park, alongside AFCD officials.
  <br>
  <br>
  The preliminary results of the necropsy pointed to it being a male beaked whale of six-to-seven metres in length.
  <br>
  <br>
  Taison Chang is the chairman of the Hong Kong Dolphin Conservation Society. He says the tote bag could have played a role in the whale's death.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The size of the bag is quite large. It is likely to cause malnutrition over time, as it is difficult for the whale to eat other things. This is likely one of the reasons for it being so weak, leading to its accidental entry into Hong Kong waters and ultimate stranding," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The AFCD says the whale showed signs of injury, which could have been sustained when it became stranded.
  <br>
  <br>
  The cause of death and the exact species of the whale are yet to be confirmed.

    Kuwait ruler urges immediate Gaza ceasefire

<img alt="Emir Sheikh Meshal al-Ahmad al-Sabah (left0 also called on the international community to provide protection for innocent civilians. File photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1781644_1_20241201212541.jpg&q=65">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Kuwait's ruler on Sunday urged an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, as he addressed a summit of the Gulf Cooperation Council held after nearly 14 months of war in the Palestinian territory.
 <br>
  <br>
  Emir Sheikh Meshal al-Ahmad al-Sabah called on the international community to implement "an immediate ceasefire, providing international protection for innocent civilians and ensuring the opening of safe corridors and the arrival of urgent humanitarian aid".
  <br>
  <br>
  The meeting of the six-member GCC comes at a time of acute and ongoing uncertainty for the Middle East following Hamas's October 7, 2023 attack on Israel and a subsequent war on Gaza, which has repeatedly threatened spillover into a wider regional conflagration.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sheikh Meshal hit out at what he characterised as the "double standards in the application of relevant international laws, charters and resolutions" which he said had undermined "the region's security and stability".
  <br>
  <br>
  He said Kuwait was "optimistic" about a ceasefire agreed between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon that he said would contribute "to reducing escalation in the region".
  <br>
  <br>
  Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar and other countries also welcomed last week's a truce after a year of conflict that killed thousands in Lebanon and caused mass displacement on both sides of the border.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fighting escalated in September after continuous cross-border strikes, initiated by Iran-backed Hezbollah in support of Hamas.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Kuwaiti ruler spoke in support of Saudi's work to form a global body pushing for an independent Palestinian state and lauded "positive and constructive" work by Iran and the GCC.
  <br>
  <br>
  Saudi Arabia had appeared close to a normalisation deal with Israel prior to October 2023 but Riyadh indicated it was unwilling to move ahead while Israel pursued its campaign in Gaza, hardening its position in recent months saying it would not recognise Israel without an independent Palestinian state.
  <br>
  <br>
  Anxious about being drawn into tit-for-tat strikes between Israel and nearby Iran, also precipitated by fighting in Gaza, the wealthy and traditionally western-allied Gulf monarchies have sought to cultivate improved relations with Tehran.
  <br>
  <br>
  An Israeli air raid on Iran in October was the most recent in a series of retaliatory attacks between the two countries. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Sai Kung District Office on Sunday said a laptop and a mobile phone belonging to one of its care teams have been stolen. The office says the devices contain the personal data of hundreds of people.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, the Sai Kung District Office said it received the theft report from the Sai Kung Hang Hau East Sub-district Care Team on Saturday. It said the laptop and the mobile phone contain the names and phone numbers of hundreds of people, some with addresses and ID card numbers.
  <br>
  <br>
  The district office said the items, used by the Hang Hau District Festival and Special Event Preparatory Committee, had been in a locked room at the Hang Hau Rural Committee office on Hang Hau Road. It said the door lock had been broken.
  <br>
  <br>
  The office said both electronic devices and files were protected by high-strength passwords, so the risk of data leakage should be relatively low.
  <br>
  <br>
  The office has reported the case to the police and the privacy watchdog.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police have classified the case as burglary.

    Centre-right parties to retain power in Ireland

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The incumbent centre-right parties Fianna Fail and Fine Gael looked set to retain power in Ireland as vote counting in the European Union member's general election resumed on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  With around 45 seats of the new 174-seat lower chamber of parliament decided, the parties were ahead of the main opposition party, the left-wing nationalist Sinn Fein.
  <br>
  <br>
  Local media projected Fianna Fail, led by the experienced Micheal Martin, 64, would win the largest vote share and over 40 seats.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fine Gael, whose leader Simon Harris, 38, is the outgoing prime minister (taoiseach), were in second place according to projections, with Sinn Fein in third.
  <br>
  <br>
  To form a majority, a party or coalition requires at least 88 seats.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both centre-right parties have repeatedly ruled out entering a coalition with Sinn Fein.
  <br>
  <br>
  The centre-left opposition Labour party is seen by Fine Gael and Fianna Fail as the most likely junior coalition party, according to local media.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Green Party was the third member of the previous coalition but its support collapsed nationwide, with all but one seat likely to be lost.
  <br>
  <br>
  At the last general election in 2020, the pro-Irish unity Sinn Fein -- the former political wing of the paramilitary Irish Republican Army -- was the most popular party but could not find willing coalition partners.
  <br>
  <br>
  That led to weeks of horse-trading, ending up with Fine Gael, which has been in power since 2011, agreeing a deal with Fianna Fail.
  <br>
  <br>
  During the last parliamentary term, the role of prime minister rotated between the Fianna Fail and Fine Gael leaders.
  <br>
  <br>
  The final seat numbers, which will not be confirmed until early next week, will determine whether Harris returns as taoiseach or Martin takes the role under a rotation arrangement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The new parliament is due to sit for the first time on December 18, but following coalition talks a new government is not expected to be formed until the new year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The three-week campaign, launched after Harris called a snap election on November 8, was dominated by rancour over housing supply and cost-of-living crises, health, public spending, and the economy. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's Olympic fencing champions Edgar Cheung and Vivian Kong are among the winners of the annual Fencing World Cup, after topping the rankings of their respective disciplines over the past season.
 <br>
  <br>
  The pair received their awards at this year's International Fencing Federation Congress in Uzbekistan.
  <br>
  <br>
  At the end of the 2023-24 season, Cheung topped the men's foil table for the first time in his career.
  <br>
  <br>
  He won gold at the Paris Olympics for the SAR and finished on top of Grand Prix events in Turin and Shanghai.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I am really happy to win this award, and I would like to sincerely thank everyone who has helped and supported me," Cheung wrote on social media.
  <br>
  <br>
  For Kong, who announced her retirement from professional fencing after winning gold in the Olympics, she returned to the world number one spot in women's individual epee.
  <br>
  <br>
  She made history at the Paris Games, clinching the first-ever gold medal in the individual epee event for Hong Kong, China.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kong also reached the top of the rankings in the 2018-19 season.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SAR team's fencing coach, Greg Koenig, attended the ceremony and called the pair "the pride of Hong Kong".

<img alt="Kaja Kallas, who took office on Sunday with a visit to Ukraine, said " src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1781619_1_20241201173234.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The EU's new foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas on Sunday warned Georgian authorities over violence against demonstrators protesting the government's decision to shelve its bid to join the bloc.
 <br>
  <br>
  "It is clear that using violence against peaceful protesters is not acceptable, and the Georgian government should respect the will of the Georgian people," Kallas told journalists.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When it comes to European Union, then this clearly has consequences on our relationship with Georgia."
  <br>
  <br>
  Kallas, who took office on Sunday with a visit to Ukraine, said "options" had been put forward to the EU's 27 member states on how to respond, including potentially imposing sanctions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have different options. But of course, we need to come to agreement," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Violent clashes erupted on Saturday outside Georgia's parliament between police and demonstrators protesting the government's decision to delay European Union membership talks amid a post-election crisis, AFP reporters witnessed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thousands of people gathered in Georgia's capital Tbilisi on Saturday for a third night of protests that saw dozens arrested.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Black Sea nation has been rocked by turmoil since the ruling Georgian Dream party claimed victory in an October 26 parliamentary election that the pro-European opposition said was fraudulent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chaotic scenes unfolded for hours as police chased defiant protesters through the streets of central Tbilisi, beating them and making arrests.
  <br>
  <br>
  Masked officers in riot gear fired rubber bullets, tear gas and water cannons as they moved in to disperse protesters hurling fireworks, while flames were seen coming from a window of the parliament building.
  <br>
  <br>
  Demonstrators erected barricades on Tbilisi's main avenue.
  <br>
  <br>
  The interior ministry said "the actions of some individuals present at the protest became violent" and that police would "respond appropriately and in accordance with the law to every violation".
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 100 people have been arrested in the last two days.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze's announcement on Thursday that Georgia would not seek accession talks with the EU until 2028 ignited a furious reaction from the opposition. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A community group on Sunday called on the government to allow more non-elderly single people to get public housing.
 <br>
  <br>
  According to the Society for Community Organisation (SoCo), about 91,000 non-elderly one-person applicants were waiting to be allocated a public housing unit as of September.
  <br>
  <br>
  A maximum of 2,200 units, or about 10 percent of new public housing units made available, are allocated to them each year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Deputy director of SoCo Sze Lai-shan said that should be raised to up to 30 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Now the government use age in the points system when they [applicants] are waiting for public housing, and the quota for non-elderly persons is very low," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think the government should suspend the points system, and increase the quota allocated to non-elderly single people so it is more fair for them, maybe at least to 20 or 30 percent. It would be more fair and not affect families and elderlies too much."
  <br>
  <br>
  While the average waiting time for public housing units is 5.5 years, Sze said that did not include non-elderly one-person applicants who often have to wait for more than 10 years before being assigned a flat.
  <br>
  <br>
  A 57-year-old man surnamed Suen, who rents a cubicle apartment, said he has been on the waiting list for 16 years.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Four years ago I was 20 points short [on the points system] to be allocated a flat, two years ago I was still 20 points short, and recently I still find myself missing 20 points. How long do I still have to live in this apartment?" he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "No government subsidies are available, and we have to wait longer for public housing, and we are also not eligible to apply for Light Public Housing," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  SoCo also called on the government to include non-elderly one-person applicants in a cash allowance scheme for those who have been on the public housing waiting list for at least three years.

    Make every dollar count, says audit director

<img alt="Director of Audit Nelson Lam says the Audit Commission will focus more on checking public organisations and funds in the future. File photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1781597_2_20241201154734.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Government departments and public organisations should take the lead in cutting cost and increasing revenue in light of a budget deficit, the director of audit said.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a TVB programme, Nelson Lam noted there is less corruption in the public sector these days, and government workers are being more careful with spending.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lam said the Audit Commission will therefore focus more on public organisations and funds going forward, especially when it comes to big projects involving a lot of public money.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have been looking at whether spending is economical or not. In fact, we will pay more attention to larger expenditures and those involving more public funds," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the Nano and Advanced Materials Institute, under the Innovation and Technology Commission, bearing the cost of the allowance beyond the permitted amount incurred in some business trips as revealed by the latest audit report, Lam said that affected the government's overall expenditure and image.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For us, it's quite surprising. I find it strange why people still make these kinds of mistakes. But I want to emphasise one thing – I hope all public servants understand that when you work in public service, it should be for the public good, not for personal gain," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lam also said future audit work may require cross-border data sharing because of greater cooperation between Hong Kong and Guangdong, including the expansion of elderly healthcare vouchers to mainland cities.

    'Stranded whale might be hurt before entering HK'

<div class="itemFullText">
 An injured whale that died after being stranded in Tai O might have been hurt or fallen sick before entering Hong Kong waters, a marine conservationist said on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Taison Chang, chairman of the Hong Kong Dolphin Conservation Society, believed it could be a rare Longman's beaked whale.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Even before the whale entered Hong Kong waters, it could be sick and got lost, that's why it's found in Hong Kong waters. It's very possible that the whale had some kind of disease or got injured by other reasons," he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department had activated a response plan to rescue the whale after it was sighted in the waters near Tai O on Saturday evening.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When we saw the animal near the evening time in Hong Kong, the animal was already very weak and did not behave normally," Chang said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities said the whale, with a wound on its body, was found to be extremely weak during sedation administered for further diagnosis, and it subsequently died in the early hours of Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chang also said the conditions were unfavourable for the stranded cetacean to leave.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When the residents in Tai O first saw this animal, the tide was very low. That's why when we saw a lot of photos or videos online, the animal was mostly stranded almost on the sand or on land already.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It made the situation very difficult for the animal, even if the animal had the ability to swim," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  A necropsy will be carried out on Sunday to determine the cause of death.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan said the resumption of multi-entry permits for Shenzhen residents visiting Hong Kong will boost the local tourism, retail and catering industries.
 <br>
  <br>
  From Sunday, more than 10 million people in Shenzhen will be allowed to visit the SAR as many times as they like, reversing a policy that limited such trips to once per week.
  <br>
  <br>
  Writing on his weekly blog, Chan said the move will make it easier for people to travel and strengthen economic ties between Hong Kong and Shenzhen.
  <br>
  <br>
  A series of measures by the central government to support the SAR's tourism and efforts by local shops and restaurants to improve their services will boost the Hong Kong economy, Chan added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong's economy has shown moderate overall growth this year, but consumption and export of services still need further improvement," he wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  The finance chief also noted that the new three-runway system at the airport and plans to increase international destinations will consolidate the city's position as an international aviation hub.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Macau's chief executive-elect Sam Hou-fai has pledged to work with Hong Kong in leveraging the advantages of the two SARs to foster development.
 <br>
  <br>
  "On whether we and Hong Kong could complement each other's strengths and foster mutual development, I think there's huge potential in this," Sam said in a press conference on Sunday flanked by his incoming cabinet.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said he will meet with Chief Executive John Lee after he assumes office on December 20.
  <br>
  <br>
  "After I take office, I'll talk to Chief Executive John Lee about how the two SARs can – on each side of the Pearl River and under our common constitutional and political system – fully leverage our respective advantages to foster development.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We'll also look at how we can leverage our strengths and seek opportunities, while integrating into the nation's development, as we strive for achievements for both SARs."
  <br>
  <br>
  Sam and his governing team met the media a day after Beijing approved his nominations and appointed principal officials for the new term of the Macau government.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The formation of this government's principal officials and prosecutor-general embodies the spirit of 'upholding fundamental principles and breaking new ground', which completely aligns with the requirements I set out for principal officials," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The incoming Macau leader added his government will respond to issues the public is most concerned about, and work on key tasks relating to the city's long-term development.

    'Obstruction' blocking pact on plastic pollution

<img alt="Environmentalists have demanded stronger commitments to fight plastic waste at the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee in Busan. File photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1781577_1_20241201094724.jpg&q=40">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 France on Sunday accused a handful of countries of obstructing negotiations in South Korea to reach the world's first treaty to curb plastic pollution.
 <br>
  <br>
  "We also are worried by the continuing obstruction by the so-called like-minded countries," Olga Givernet, France's minister delegate for energy, told reporters, referring to a group of mostly oil-producing nations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nearly 200 countries are in the port city of Busan for negotiations on a deal to curb plastic pollution, with only a few hours left on the clock.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Finding an agreement for us on (an) ambitious treaty that reduces plastic pollution remains an absolute priority for France," Givernet said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are planning on pushing it, pushing it again."
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 90 percent of plastic is not recycled, while plastic production is expected to triple by 2060.
  <br>
  <br>
  Efforts to reach the landmark agreement have been locked over several key sticking points, particularly reducing production and phasing out chemicals believed or known to harm human health.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 100 countries back those measures and insist a treaty without them will fail to solve the pollution crisis.
  <br>
  <br>
  But around a dozen nations -- mostly producers of plastic precursors derived from fossil fuels -- are strongly opposed.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We still have a few hours left in these negotiations, there is time to find common ground, but Rwanda cannot accept a toothless treaty," said Juliet Kabera, director general of the Rwanda Environment Management Authority.
  <br>
  <br>
  The latest draft text remains full of opposing views and contradictory language, and a promised new version after long hours of negotiations into Saturday night has not yet been published.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will continue to fight for an ambitious outcome in Busan," Givernet said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have still a few hours to discuss and make contributions and be certain that our determination (is) to carry on with the negotiation process until the last hour." (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Arsenal thrashed West Ham 5-2 on Saturday to climb up to second in the Premier League, while Justin Kluivert scored the first ever Premier League hat-trick of penalties in Bournemouth's 4-2 win at Wolves.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Gunners have struck 13 goals in a week to refind their form and cut the gap to runaway leaders Liverpool, who host struggling defending champions Manchester City in Sunday's blockbuster clash, to six points.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are back to our best form. We look fluid and dynamic we are all enjoying football right now," said Bukayo Saka, who shone with a goal and two assists.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It has been a top week for us. We have built a lot of momentum and we want to go on to the next few games."
  <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal scored four times before the break in a 6-0 rout at the London Stadium last season and went one better this time as all the goals came in a manic first half,
  <br>
  <br>
  Gabriel Magalhaes' threat from set-pieces is well-known but the Brazilian was inexplicably not picked up to head in Saka's corner on 10 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Saka then teed up Leandro Trossard to double the lead before he stepped aside for Martin Odegaard to score Arsenal's third from the penalty spot.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kai Havertz slotted in from Trossard's pass to make 4-0 after just 36 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another heavy home defeat increased the pressure on West Ham boss Julen Lopetegui.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hammers flickered into life with two goals in two minutes through Aaron Wan-Bissaka and a brilliant Emerson Palmieri free-kick.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Saka restored the three-goal advantage from the spot after Gabriel was felled from another corner.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kluivert made history at Molineux to curtail Wolves' mini-revival.
  <br>
  <br>
  There were three goals inside eight minutes as the Dutchman opened the scoring, Jorgen Strand Larsen replied for Wolves before Milos Kerkez made it 2-1 for the visitors.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kluivert made it 3-1 just 10 minutes later and completed his hat-trick 16 minutes from time after Evanilson also set a record by winning a third penalty.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I was not completely sure I should allow him to take the third one," said Bournemouth boss Andoni Iraola.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is difficult, every time you shoot the first one, you give information to the keeper."
  <br>
  <br>
  Strand Larsen pulled another goal back for Wolves, but Gary O'Neil's men slip back into the relegation zone.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brentford continued their stunning home form to thrash Leicester 4-1 in front of the Foxes' in-coming manager Ruud van Nistelrooy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Facundo Buonanotte had put the visitors in front in west London.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Brentford roared back to make it six wins and one draw from seven home league games this season -- the best points return in the Premier League.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoane Wissa started the comeback before Schade took centre stage.
  <br>
  <br>
  The German had only scored two Premier League goals since joining the Bees in 2023 but matched that tally before half-time to put the home side in front.
  <br>
  <br>
  Schade then rounded off the scoring to show Van Nistelrooy the scale of the task that awaits him ahead of his first game in charge at home to West Ham on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The shining star today was Kevin Schade," said Brentford manager Thomas Frank.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I celebrated so much his first because I know how hard it's been for him because he's had so many injuries and he's wanting to play in the team.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chris Wood's emphatically struck penalty was enough to get Forest back to winning ways and leave Ipswich still in the bottom three.
  <br>
  <br>
  Crystal Palace edged out of the relegation zone on goal difference thanks to late drama in a 1-1 draw against Newcastle.
  <br>
  <br>
  Marc Guehi, who had been the subject of multiple bids from Newcastle during the transfer window, put the Magpies in front early in the second half with an own goal.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the England defender redeemed himself as from his cross Daniel Munoz powered home a header at the back post. (AFP)

 A stranded whale has died near Tai O despite efforts by a team of veterinarians to help it.
 <br>
  <br>
  A spokesman for the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) said on Sunday that veterinarians from Ocean Park had carried out an initial assessment and found that the whale was injured.
  <br>
  <br>
  "During sedation administered for further diagnosis, the veterinarians found the whale in extremely weak condition," the spokesman said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the whale subsequently died during the diagnostic procedures at around midnight.
  <br>
  <br>
  The spokesman added that AFCD staff and Ocean Park vets will examine the carcass to determine the cause of death.

    Gaza rescuers say 3 aid workers die in Israeli strike

<div class="itemFullText">
 Gaza's civil defence agency said three aid workers were killed in an Israeli air strike in the Hamas-run territory on Saturday but the Israeli army said it killed a "terrorist."
 <br>
  <br>
  The agency said the aid workers killed were Palestinian employees of World Central Kitchen (WCK). The US aid group did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Israeli army said it had "struck a vehicle with a terrorist that took part in the murderous October 7 massacre," referring to the militant group Hamas's unprecedented attack on Israel last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The claim that the terrorist was simultaneously a WCK worker is being examined," it added in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Civil defence agency spokesman Mahmud Bassal said the bodies of "at least five dead were transported (to hospital), including (those of) the three employees of World Central Kitchen."
  <br>
  <br>
  "All three men worked for WCK and they were hit while driving in a WCK jeep in Khan Younis," Bassal said, adding that the vehicle had been "marked with its logo clearly visible."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Israeli army insisted its strike in the main southern city hit "a civilian unmarked vehicle and its movement on the route was not coordinated for transporting of aid."
  <br>
  <br>
  In April, an Israeli air strike killed seven WCK staff – an Australian, three Britons, a North American, a Palestinian and a Pole.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel said it had been targeting a "Hamas gunman" in that strike but the military admitted a series of "grave mistakes" and violations of its own rules of engagement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The October 2023 attack resulted in the deaths of 1,207 people, most of them civilians, according to a tally of Israeli official figures.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel's retaliatory military offensive has killed 44,382 people in Gaza, according to figures from the territory's health ministry which the United Nations considers reliable. (AFP)

    Saudi Arabia all but certain to host 2034 World Cup

<img alt="Saudi Arabia is planning massive sports infrastructure projects if its bid is successful. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1781554_1_20241130214244.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Saudi Arabia's bid to host the 2034 World Cup was considered "medium risk" for human rights by Fifa in its evaluation report, which said implementing reforms could take "significant time and effort."
 <br>
  <br>
  The release of the report on Saturday comes ahead of the Fifa Congress on December 11, when a vote will be held to select the hosts for the 2030 and 2034 World Cups.
  <br>
  <br>
  Saudi Arabia is the lone candidate for 2034 while Morocco, Spain and Portugal have formed a joint bid for the 2030 tournament, with Uruguay, Argentina and Paraguay all set to host a match as part of the centenary edition.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Saudi bid "presents a very strong all-round proposition, reflected in the results of the technical evaluation, which assesses the proposed infrastructure (both sporting and general) as well as its commercial potential," Fifa said in its report.
  <br>
  <br>
  But football's world governing body cautioned, "in terms of human rights, the undertaking involved in implementing the various measures... particularly in certain areas, could involve significant effort and time."
  <br>
  <br>
  Fifa said that was the basis for the elevated risk rating for a bid that received an average score of 4.2 out of 5 – higher than the combined bid by the United States, Canada and Mexico for the 2026 World Cup.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is important to note that the bid involves significant opportunities for positive human rights impact," added Fifa.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There is good potential that the tournament could serve as a catalyst for some of the ongoing and future reforms and contribute to positive human rights outcomes for people in Saudi Arabia and the region that go beyond the scope of the tournament itself."
  <br>
  <br>
  Saudi Arabia has yet to build several proposed stadiums for a tournament that could be held in winter, as was the case in Qatar.
  <br>
  <br>
  Human rights, a source of deep controversy at the 2022 World Cup in neighbouring Qatar, threatens to become a major talking point once again in the run-up to 2034.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rights groups highlight mass executions in Saudi Arabia and allegations of torture, as well as restrictions on women under the conservative country's male guardianship system.
  <br>
  <br>
  Free expression is severely restricted, with some people handed lengthy jail terms over critical posts on social media.
  <br>
  <br>
  Saudi Arabia, which is hosting several high-profile events including Formula One and the WTA Finals tennis, is often accused of "sportswashing" – using sport to divert attention from its rights record. (AFP)

    Serbia denies involvement in Kosovo canal blast

<img alt="Kosovo police guard the site of Friday's explosion. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1781556_1_20241130215305.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Kosovo stepped up security measures around "critical" infrastructure on Saturday after an explosion at a key canal feeding two of its main power plants, as neighbouring Serbia rejected accusations it had staged the blast.
 <br>
  <br>
  The explosion occurred on Friday near the town of Zubin Potok in a Serb-dominated area in Kosovo's troubled north, damaging the canal supplying water to cooling systems at two coal-fired power plants that generate most of Kosovo's electricity.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prime Minister Albin Kurti called a security meeting late on Friday, saying: "This is a criminal and terrorist attack aimed at damaging our critical infrastructure."
  <br>
  <br>
  "The attack was carried out by professionals. We believe it comes from gangs directed by Serbia," he added without providing any evidence.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government later issued a statement echoing his allegations, saying that "initial indications suggest" the explosion had been "orchestrated by the Serbian state, which has the capacity to carry out such a criminal and terrorist attack."
  <br>
  <br>
  Kosovo also "approved additional measures to strengthen security around essential infrastructure and services, such as bridges, transformers" and other sites, it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Serbia slapped back on Saturday, condemning the attack, while calling the accusation "premature" and "baseless."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Such destructive actions are unacceptable and threaten the fragile stability we are striving to maintain," Serbian Foreign Minister Marko Djuric said on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Serbia unequivocally demands responsibility for the perpetrators of this reckless attack," he added, while suggesting the Kosovar "regime" could be behind the blast and calling for an internationally-led investigation.
  <br>
  <br>
  The main political party representing Serbs in Kosovo, Serb List, also condemned the attack "in the strongest possible terms."
  <br>
  <br>
  Pictures from the scene published by local media showed water leaking heavily from one side of the reinforced canal, which runs from the Serb-majority north of Kosovo to the capital Pristina and also supplies drinking water.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, electricity supplies to consumers were running smoothly on Saturday morning, with authorities having found an alternative method for cooling the plants, Kosovo's Economy Minister Artane Rizvanolli said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Repair work was ongoing, authorities said. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 South Africa had to overcome determined resistance from Sri Lanka's batsmen before winning the first Test by 233 runs at Kingsmead on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Set a massive 516 runs to win, Sri Lanka were bowled out for 282.
  <br>
  <br>
  Left-arm fast bowler Marco Jansen, the destroyer in Sri Lanka's record-low first innings of 42, took four for 73 to finish with match figures of 11 for 86.
  <br>
  <br>
  In contrast to the first innings, the tourists made the South Africans work for their wickets on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dinesh Chandimal (83) and captain Dhananjaya de Silva (59) put on 95 for the sixth wicket and kept South Africa in the field for most of the morning after resuming at 101 for five.
  <br>
  <br>
  The breakthrough for South Africa came when De Silva chipped a catch to midwicket off left-arm spinner Keshav Maharaj.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kusal Mendis made an attacking 48 before he became Jansen's 10th victim of the match, caught behind by Kyle Verreynne.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chandimal and De Silva took advantage of the best batting conditions of the match against bowlers who were not as effective as they had been when the ball was shiny and new.
  <br>
  <br>
  South Africa were also without all-rounder Wiaan Mulder, who was ruled out of the rest of the series with a broken finger.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chandimal, who was 29 not out overnight, continued to defy the bowlers on the ground where he marked his Test debut with two half-centuries 13 years ago. He made his 83 off 174 balls before being caught and bowled by Gerald Coetzee. (AFP)

    Greenpeace activists board tanker in plastic protest

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Greenpeace activists boarded a tanker off South Korea on Saturday in an action intended to draw attention to calls for a treaty to curb plastic pollution, the environmental group said.
 <br>
  <br>
  Nearly 200 countries are in Busan to negotiate the deal, but there is little sign of agreement with just a day left before talks are due to end.
  <br>
  <br>
  Greenpeace said the tanker Buena Alba, anchored off the Hanwha TotalEnergies complex, was scheduled to pick up propylene, which is used to manufacture plastic.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The activists boarded the vessel peacefully and met no reaction from the vessel crew," said Greenpeace spokeswoman Angelica Pago.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We painted 'PLASTIC KILLS' on the side of the vessel and the climbers successfully set up a camp," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They intend to stay in order to continue putting pressure on the negotiators to resist fossil fuel and petrochemical industry interference in the talks and to deliver a treaty that firmly cuts plastic production."
  <br>
  <br>
  A spokesman for South Korea's coast guard said police had been "deployed on the ship, and we are making warning announcements to facilitate a safe disembarkation."
  <br>
  <br>
  He said a "thorough investigation" would be carried out to determine if there were any "illegal elements" to the protest.
  <br>
  <br>
  Attempts to reach an agreement on curbing plastic pollution have stalled over several key sticking points, including whether to cut new plastic production.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dozens of countries, backed by environmental groups, insist a treaty without production cuts will fail to solve the problem, but a group of largely oil-producing states is fiercely opposed.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The brave activists that boarded that vessel today show the courage and should inspire governments here to hold the line and do what everyone knows is obvious," Greenpeace delegation head Graham Forbes told reporters in Busan.
  <br>
  <br>
  The negotiations have reached a "pivotal moment," he said, but "a handful of governments... are looking backwards and refusing to take the steps necessary for us all to advance."
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think we are at a very risky moment right now of being sold out, and that would be an absolute catastrophe," Forbes said. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Sri Lanka's consumer prices fell by 2.1 percent in November, the highest deflation rate recorded by the economically fragile island nation since 1961, official data showed on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  An unprecedented financial crash in 2022 brought months of consumer goods shortages, with inflation peaking at nearly 70 percent that year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since then, a US$2.9 billion bailout loan from the International Monetary Fund, tax hikes and other austerity measures have slowly made headway in repairing the island's economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Headline inflation will remain negative in the next few months, deeper than previously projected, mainly due to larger downward adjustments in energy prices and reduction in volatile food prices," Sri Lanka's central bank said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bank said inflation was likely to return to its target level of five percent in the coming months.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sri Lanka had already seen deflation of 0.8 percent in October and 0.5 percent in September.
  <br>
  <br>
  President Anura Kumara Dissanayake, who was elected in September, has vowed to maintain the IMF bailout programme negotiated by his predecessor that includes higher taxes and cuts to state spending. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Georgia on Saturday said 107 people were arrested during a second day of protests sparked by the government's decision to delay European Union membership talks amid a post-election crisis.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Black Sea nation has been rocked by turmoil since the ruling Georgian Dream party claimed victory in an October 26 parliamentary election that the pro-EU opposition said was fraudulent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The interior ministry said 107 people were detained for "disobedience to lawful police orders and petty hooliganism."
