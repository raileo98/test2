<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan visited two mainland firms in Beijing on Friday, highlighting Hong Kong's role as a gateway for business expansion and global market access.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chan first visited a leading pop-culture entertainment company listed in Hong Kong, which operates popular intellectual property (IP) artistic toys. He toured the company's thematic park and met with senior management to discuss their business development.
  <br>
  <br>
  He welcomed the firm's plans to expand its physical retail network in Hong Kong and diversify services, noting that the SAR government is reviewing tax deductions for acquiring IP usage rights to boost the industry.
  <br>
  <br>
  Later, Chan visited a high-precision artificial intelligence (AI) firm specialising in intelligent sensing solutions for smart traffic management, autonomous driving, perception robots, and low-altitude economic applications.
  <br>
  <br>
  The company, with projects in cities such as Beijing and Shanghai, plans to establish its international headquarters and a global R&D centre in Hong Kong while preparing for a listing. Chan encouraged the firm to utilise Hong Kong's capital, talent, and professional services to expand internationally.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan was due to attend the China Development Forum on Saturday and speak at the thematic seminar.

    Fatah movement urges Hamas to cede power in Gaza

<img alt="Mahmoud Abbas's Fatah movement says the very existence of Palestinians in Gaza depends on Hamas giving up control. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796966_1_20250322215125.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas's Fatah movement called on its Islamist rivals Hamas on Saturday to relinquish power in order to safeguard the "existence" of Palestinians in the Gaza Strip.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Hamas must show compassion for Gaza, its children, women and men," said Fatah spokesman Monther al-Hayek.
  <br>
  <br>
  He called on Hamas to "step aside from governing and fully recognise that the battle ahead will lead to the end of Palestinians' existence" if it remains in power in Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamas seized power in Gaza in 2007 from the Fatah-dominated Palestinian Authority, and subsequent attempts at reconciliation have failed.
  <br>
  <br>
  The territory has been devastated by an Israeli offensive in retaliation for the assault by Hamas and other Palestinian militants on Israel on October 7, 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  Following disagreements over the next steps in a January 19 ceasefire in the Gaza war, Israel resumed air strikes on Tuesday, followed by ground operations the day after.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Friday, Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz threatened to annexe parts of Gaza unless Hamas frees the remaining Israeli hostages seized in the October 7 attack.
  <br>
  <br>
  Of the 251 hostages taken that day, 58 are still being held, including 34 the Israeli military says are dead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamas's 2023 attack on Israel resulted in 1,218 deaths, mostly civilians, according to Israeli figures.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nearly 50,000 people in Gaza have been killed in the war, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 At least three firefighters and a public servant have been killed in a wildfire in South Korea, prompting the government to declare a state of emergency in southeastern regions, authorities said on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The fire, which began in Sancheong County on Friday afternoon, prompted the deployment of 304 personnel, along with 20 helicopters, according to South Korea's Interior Ministry.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 200 residents in 15 southern villages have been told to evacuate, it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Four people – three firefighters and one public servant – have been confirmed to be dead," said a fire agency official.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wildfires occurred in several other areas across the country, with 16 instances reported on Saturday alone, according to the Korea Forest Service.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Interior Ministry later declared a state of emergency in Ulsan and North and South Gyeongsang provinces, due to "the extensive damage caused by simultaneous wildfires across the country."
  <br>
  <br>
  The forest agency has issued "severe" fire warnings, its highest level, in 12 locations, including North and South Gyeongsang provinces, Busan and Daejeon.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sancheong, in South Gyeongsang province, is about 250 kilometres southeast of Seoul.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sections of the highways in the region have been closed as a safety measure, according to local reports.
  <br>
  <br>
  Choi Sang-mok, South Korea's acting president, told relevant agencies to "mobilise all available equipment and personnel to quickly extinguish" the fire, his office said. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Two people including a girl were killed in an Israeli attack on a southern Lebanese town on Saturday, state media reported, after Israel launched air strikes in response to cross-border rocket fire.
 <br>
  <br>
  "The Israeli enemy strike on the town of Touline resulted... in the death of two people, including a girl, and the injury of eight others, including two children," the National News Agency cited the health ministry's emergency unit as saying, describing it as a "preliminary toll."
  <br>
  <br>
  NNA had earlier reported a toll of one killed in Touline.
  <br>
  <br>
  It came as the Israeli military said it was launching air strikes on Hezbollah strongholds in Lebanon after intercepting cross-border rocket fire.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Israeli military said three rockets were fired from Lebanon into northern Israel, setting off air raid sirens in the region for the first time since a November ceasefire between Israel and the Iran-backed Hezbollah.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lebanese Prime Minister Nawaf Salam warned the country risked being dragged into a "new war" after months of relative calm following a November 27 ceasefire between Israel and Lebanon. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Pope Francis will make his first public appearance on Sunday with a blessing and a wave from a window at Rome's Gemelli Hospital where he was admitted on February 14.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 88-year-old pontiff has been battling pneumonia in both lungs after being hospitalised for breathing difficulties.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Pope Francis intends to wave and offer a blessing from the Agostino Gemelli hospital in Rome after Angelus prayers," The Vatican said on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The pope has stopped using an oxygen mask. After an earlier series of breathing attacks, his breathing has improved and the Vatican said on Monday he was spending short moments breathing on his own.
  <br>
  <br>
  For most of the pope's hospital stay, including critical stages, the Vatican was publishing daily bulletins on the health of Francis, who had part of one lung removed as a young man.
  <br>
  <br>
  The pope's illness and the long spell in hospital have raised questions over who might lead the busy schedule of religious events leading up to Easter, the holiest period in the Christian calendar. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Heathrow Airport said it was "fully operational" on Saturday but delays and cancellations were expected as Europe's busiest air hub resumed operations after a power station fire caused travel mayhem.
 <br>
  <br>
  The electricity substation blaze knocked out power at the London airport, closing it for most of Friday before some flights began to arrive and take off later in the evening.
  <br>
  <br>
  The shutdown affected thousands of passengers around the world and raised serious questions about the reliability of one of the UK's most critical pieces of infrastructure.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We can confirm that Heathrow is open and fully operational today," an airport spokesperson said on Saturday morning.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Teams across the airport continue to do everything they can to support passengers impacted by yesterday's outage at an off-airport power substation."
  <br>
  <br>
  About 1,350 flights were affected by Friday's closure, according to the Flightradar24 tracking website. Around 120 Heathrow-bound planes were in the air when the closure was announced and had to be diverted.
  <br>
  <br>
  Delays and cancellations were likely on Saturday as airlines scrambled to clear a backlog of flights.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have hundreds of additional colleagues on hand in our terminals and we have added flights to today's schedule to facilitate an extra 10,000 passengers travelling through the airport," the spokesperson said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Passengers travelling today should check with their airline for the latest information regarding their flight."
  <br>
  <br>
  British Airways said it expected to operate around 85 percent of its scheduled flights at the airport throughout the day. The airline would normally run about 600 arrivals and departures on a Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are planning to operate as many flights as possible to and from Heathrow on Saturday, but to recover an operation of our size after such a significant incident is extremely complex," a BA spokesperson said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We expect around 85 percent of our Saturday Heathrow schedule to run, but it is likely that all travelling customers will experience delays as we continue to navigate the challenges posed by Friday's power outage at the airport."
  <br>
  <br>
  Restrictions on overnight flights have been temporarily lifted to help ease congestion, according to the UK's transport department. (AFP)

 A secondary school said on Saturday that some students and teachers taking part in an exchange tour on the mainland have fallen ill.
 <br>
  <br>
  Those affected are part of a group that includes 120 students from the Po Leung Kuk Lo Kit Sing (1983) College who are on a three-day trip to Zhaoqing.
  <br>
  <br>
  The school said some people had developed gastroenteritis symptoms, such as vomiting and fever since Friday night.
  <br>
  <br>
  The school said they are receiving treatment at a local hospital and are in stable condition.
  <br>
  <br>
  It added that it had notified the Education Bureau, the Centre for Health Protection and parents regarding the incident, and also taken measures to reduce the risk of infection to others.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Kevin Durant scored 42 points as the Phoenix Suns reignited their playoff hopes with a 123-112 upset of the Eastern Conference-leading Cleveland Cavaliers on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  A superb performance from Durant secured a third straight victory for Phoenix as they aim to muscle their way into the postseason picture in the Western Conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  Durant erupted for 19 points in a third-quarter burst of scoring that took the game beyond Cleveland's grasp, with the Suns opening up a 98-79 lead heading into the fourth quarter which they never looked like letting slip.
  <br>
  <br>
  The win lifted Phoenix into 10th place in the Western Conference and into the play-in tournament reckoning.
  <br>
  <br>
  The top six teams in each NBA conference qualify automatically for the playoffs, while teams placed from 7th to 10th play in a mini-tournament to determine the final two playoff berths.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is the best team in the league," Durant said of Cleveland following the Suns win.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We've been struggling and we know we've got the toughest schedule for the last 10 games," he added. "So we just wanted to dial in and make sure we kept building on the work we've done over the last week."
  <br>
  <br>
  Cleveland's fourth consecutive loss leaves the second-placed Boston Celtics just five wins behind the Cavs at the top of the East.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Celtics improved to 51-19 after thrashing the Utah Jazz 121-99 on the back of 27 points from Kristaps Porzingis and 26 points from Jayson Tatum.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Detroit Pistons' progress towards the playoffs suffered a jolt in a surprising 123-117 defeat on the road to the struggling Dallas Mavericks.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Mavs – whose season has been blown off course by the trade of Luka Doncic to the Lakers and a season-ending injury to Kyrie Irving – powered to a precious victory thanks to 31 points from Spencer Dinwiddie and 27 from PJ Washington.
  <br>
  <br>
  The result leaves Dallas perched on the edge of playoff contention in 11th place with a 34-37 record in the Western Conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  Detroit occupy the sixth and last automatic playoff berth in the East.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite the loss, the Pistons will fancy their chances of locking down a postseason ticket given a vastly superior record – 39-32 – to seventh-placed Atlanta (33-36).
  <br>
  <br>
  In the Western Conference, the Oklahoma City Thunder celebrated their successful clinching of the number 1 seeding on Thursday with a ruthless 141-106 beatdown of the Charlotte Hornets.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Thunder were assured of top spot in the West despite not playing on Thursday after the Los Angeles Lakers' defeat to Milwaukee.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shai Gilgeous-Alexander finished with 30 points as no fewer than eight OKC players finished in double figures in a wire-to-win which leaves the Thunder with a 58-12 record at the top of the West.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thunder coach Mark Daigneault said he wanted to see his team play with the same intensity for the remainder of the regular season as they build towards the playoffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We got to play with a sense of purpose – you can't coast into the postseason," Daigneault said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was a great 48-minute effort. We played to our standards on both ends of the floor."
  <br>
  <br>
  With OKC already assured of top spot, Houston boosted their hopes of clinching second place in the West after rallying from 11 points down to squeeze past the Miami Heat, winning 102-98 on the road to bag their ninth consecutive win.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fred VanVleet was the key man for Houston, finishing with 37 points after a devastating exhibition of long-range shooting.
  <br>
  <br>
  VanVleet drained nine-of-11 attempts from outside the arc as the Rockets improved to 46-25.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Minnesota Timberwolves remain hard on the heels of the sixth-placed Golden State Warriors (41-29) in the race for the playoffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Wolves, who are one place behind Golden State, improved to 41-31 after a 134-93 pasting of the New Orleans Pelicans.
  <br>
  <br>
  In another upset, the Portland Trail Blazers outgunned the injury-hit Denver Nuggets 128-109. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Department of Health said on Saturday that a 35-year-old woman remains in a critical condition, after she was sedated before a tooth extraction at a dental clinic in Central two months ago.
 <br>
  <br>
  Deep sedation was used before the surgery, and the woman failed to wake up after the extraction.
  <br>
  <br>
  She was sent to hospital immediately.
  <br>
  <br>
  After the incident, the clinic stopped offering sedation to patients.
  <br>
  <br>
  The clinic also reported the sentinel event to the department and it has submitted an investigation report as requested.
  <br>
  <br>
  The department will decide whether or not to take any further action.
  <br>
  <br>
  During the investigation, the department also found that the clinic did not properly manage patients’ medical records and medication, nor implement effective infection control.
  <br>
  <br>
  To ensure patient safety, the department has requested that the clinic improve its procedures.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Thousands of people flocked to Ocean Park on Saturday as they can now see the panda twins and their mother, Ying Ying, all in one go.
 <br>
  <br>
  Visitors who collect an entry ticket can meet the pandas for three minutes, though all tickets for the last session at 4:20 pm were gone by noon.
  <br>
  <br>
  The park distributed more than 3,000 entry tickets in total.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lau, a frequent visitor, said she arrived one and a half hours before the park opened.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I want to capture the first moments of the panda twins, and I'm really looking forward to seeing Ying Ying with her babies. That’s why I need to arrive early,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another tourist, Chan and her husband spent HK$1,500 each for a special, 30-minute visit before the park opened.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I think it’s worth the price. Because the panda twins will grow up and the money will be used to take care of them. So we think it’s ok,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Her husband said it’s a remarkable experience seeing Ying Ying licking her babies clean.

<img alt="Foreign Minister Wang Yi and South Korea's Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul shake hands as Japan's Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya looks on. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796925_1_20250322153847.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Foreign Minister Wang Yi said on Saturday that China, Japan and the South Korea have agreed to further strengthen communication, enhance mutual trust, and deepen cooperation.
 <br>
  <br>
  Wang made the remarks in Tokyo while meeting the press together with Japanese Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya and South Korean Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul, after attending the 11th China-Japan-ROK Trilateral Foreign Ministers' Meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  Noting that the three countries fully affirmed the positive progress made in their cooperation since the Ninth China-Japan-ROK Trilateral Summit, Wang said they agreed that against the backdrop of a complex and turbulent international landscape and sluggish recovery of the world economy, it is necessary and responsible for the three sides to further strengthen communication, enhance mutual trust, deepen cooperation, and provide more stabilising factors for regional peace and development.
  <br>
  <br>
  First, Wang said, they agreed to consolidate the momentum of cooperation. The three countries will stay true to the original aspiration of cooperation, focus on the Trilateral Cooperation Vision for the Next Decade, and expand new areas, cultivate new growth drivers, and create new highlights of cooperation on the basis of implementing the cooperation centred on six key areas determined by the leaders' meeting last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The three parties had useful communication on holding the 10th China-Japan-ROK Trilateral Summit this year, and will strive to create favourable conditions and atmosphere for this purpose.
  <br>
  <br>
  Second, they agreed to promote regional economic integration. The three countries will continue to communicate on restarting the negotiations on the trilateral free trade agreement, promoting the expansion of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, and maintaining the stability and smoothness of regional production and supply chains.
  <br>
  <br>
  The three countries will keep pace with the times to build a highland of scientific and technological innovation in Asia and promote the development of new quality productive forces.
  <br>
  <br>
  Third, they agreed to deepen exchanges and mutual learning. The three countries will hold the China-Japan-ROK Year of Cultural Exchange from 2025 to 2026, strive to increase the number of people-to-people exchanges among the three countries to 40 million by 2030, and consolidate the public opinion basis for trilateral cooperation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Strengthening cooperation in social welfare, green and low-carbon development and other fields can bring more and better benefits to the people of the three countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fourth, they agreed to enhance multilateral cooperation. The three countries will strengthen coordination and cooperation under mechanisms such as ASEAN Plus Three and the East Asia Summit, promote "Trilateral+X Cooperation" to the surrounding areas, and drive common development in the region.
  <br>
  <br>
  They will support each other in hosting Apec meetings, promote open regionalism, uphold multilateralism and free trade, and push for more universally beneficial and inclusive economic globalisation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang added that the three countries fully affirmed the work of the Trilateral Cooperation Secretariat, and agreed to extend the term of the Secretariat's consultative committee, looking forward to the Secretariat playing a greater role in promoting trilateral cooperation. (Xinhua)

    Online vehicle licence renewals up by 80 percent

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Transport Department on Saturday said it received almost 37,000 online applications for vehicle licence renewals in the first two months of the year, a more than 80 percent year-on-year increase.
 <br>
  <br>
  The department rolled out an enhanced scheme in December last year to simplify the licensing process.
  <br>
  <br>
  Following the change, the vehicle licence is no longer printed with an expiry date, so vehicle owners don't need to replace it with a new one after each renewal.
  <br>
  <br>
  A QR code is printed on the licence instead, allowing vehicle owners to scan and check their expiry date.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vehicle owners also no longer need to present the vehicle registration document when applying for a licence renewal. They can even skip uploading their third-party insurance certificate if the application is made online.
  <br>
  <br>
  Currently, the department has issued more than 190,000 such new vehicle licences.

    Scheme aims to identify patients with high cholesterol

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Commissioner for primary healthcare Pang Fei-chau said on Saturday that it is expected more patients will be detected with high cholesterol after a government-led primary healthcare scheme expands to cover blood lipid testing from Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Chronic Disease Co-Care Pilot Scheme, launched in November 2023, was set up to detect chronic diseases at an early stage. Under the scheme, the government will subsidise residents aged 45 or above with no known medical history of diabetes or hypertension, to undergo screenings for high blood sugar and high blood pressure.
  <br>
  <br>
  So far, over 60,000 people have been screened under the pilot scheme, and nearly 40 percent were diagnosed with diabetes, high blood sugar, or high blood pressure.
  <br>
  <br>
  Starting from Friday, the screenings will be expanded to blood lipid testing so people can find out whether they have high cholesterol.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on an RTHK programme, Pang said it is thought four percent of those screened might have high cholesterol.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said treatment would have to be tailored to their needs.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Three highs affect our cardiac health. If a person already has diabetes and also has high cholesterol, his or her risk of heart and blood vessel disease is high,” Pang said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “However, if a person only has high cholesterol, the risk is different. Therefore, we will reassess the cardiac risk for people who have three highs,” he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eligible residents can undergo the screenings through pairing with a family doctor of their choice. Residents will be charged a co-payment fee of about HK$150 for doctor consultations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pang said about 650 doctors have joined the scheme. He hopes they can share their experiences with industry peers so more doctors can join the scheme.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lewis Hamilton dominated from pole position to take his maiden victory for Ferrari in the sprint race at the Chinese Grand Prix on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Hamilton, on just his second race weekend for the Scuderia, took the chequered flag ahead of McLaren's Oscar Piastri and Red Bull's Max Verstappen.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamilton emerged from his car after the finish line to a crescendo of cheers from the massed Shanghai fans who unfurled huge banners displaying the Englishman's number 44.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think people underestimate the steep climb it is to get into a new team, understand a new team," said a delighted Hamilton.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So it is great to come here and feel more comfortable in the car as in Melbourne I really didn't feel comfortable in the car.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It felt great today, I got a good start. I don't feel the pressure, I know the team wants to win and it means everything to them.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Rome wasn't built in a day, so one day at a time."
  <br>
  <br>
  His former teammate at Mercedes, George Russell, was fourth and his current teammate Charles Leclerc was fifth in the other Ferrari.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yuki Tsunoda in an RB was sixth, Kimi Antonelli of Mercedes was seventh and championship leader Lando Norris, who struggled for pace, took a solitary point in eighth for McLaren.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamilton got away safely from pole after setting a blistering lap record on Friday at the resurfaced 5.451km Shanghai International Circuit.
  <br>
  <br>
  By the end of lap three he was 1.1 seconds ahead and out of DRS range from Verstappen with Piastri a further 1.6 seconds back.
  <br>
  <br>
  Norris started sixth but was caught up in traffic on turn five and dropped to ninth, outside the points, as he was passed by Antonelli, Tsunoda and Lance Stroll.
  <br>
  <br>
  Russell took advantage of the melee to nip past Leclerc into fourth place.
  <br>
  <br>
  Verstappen ran in second but was put under huge pressure by Piastri with five laps to go.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Both of my front tyres are dead," the Dutch reigning world champion complained on team radio.
  <br>
  <br>
  On lap 16 Piastri got past Verstappen at the hairpin and set off after Hamilton.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the Australian could not make inroads and the Englishman managed his tyres to perfection in the clean air at the front of the field. (AFP)

    SAR government preparing WTO complaint

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development Algernon Yau said on Saturday that the government is preparing to file a complaint to the World Trade Organization (WTO) regarding US tariffs.
 <br>
  <br>
  The US has imposed an additional 20 percent duty on goods from Hong Kong, the same as for mainland China.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a Commercial Radio programme, Yau accused Donald Trump’s government of violating WTO agreements, which state that the SAR is a separate customs territory.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The executive orders of the US government noted that they are imposing new tariffs on goods from mainland China. But the Department of Homeland Security and Customs said the rule includes products of Hong Kong. This is a violation of the WTO agreement and it is completely wrong to mingle Hong Kong goods with those of China,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister said the levies have a minimal impact on Hong Kong, noting the US has had a trade surplus of US$270 billion with the SAR over the past decade.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yau also said that despite rising geological tension between the US and China, foreign investors still have confidence in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  “In the last two years we’ve seen an increase of more than 900 foreign enterprises. And in 2024, there were 539 more, creating more than 7,000 jobs and HK$67 billion in investments."
  <br>
  <br>
  Yau said the administration would continue to help local businesses find new opportunities in emerging markets, including ASEAN and Latin America.

 Former heavyweight champion George Foreman, who fought and lost against Muhammad Ali in boxing's iconic 1974 "Rumble in the Jungle" before reclaiming the title two decades later, died on Friday aged 76, his family announced in a statement.
 <br>
  <br>
  "With profound sorrow, we announce the passing of our beloved George Edward Foreman Sr, who peacefully departed on March 21, 2025, surrounded by loved ones," Foreman's family said in a statement posted on the boxer's official Instagram page.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are grateful for the outpouring of love and prayers, and kindly ask for privacy as we honour the extraordinary life of a man we were blessed to call our own."
  <br>
  <br>
  Born in Texas on January 10, 1949, Foreman grew up in Houston. The man who raised him was frequently absent and often drunk. Foreman only found out that J. D. Foreman was not his biological father after he won the world heavyweight when his real father, a decorated Second World War veteran, got in touch.
  <br>
  <br>
  As an adolescent Foreman flirted with crime and dropped out of school at 16.
  <br>
  <br>
  "At 13-years-old, George was about 6-foot-2, 200 pounds and the terrorist in the neighbourhood," his younger brother Roy told the BBC in 2024. "And when you're bigger and stronger and think you're better than everyone else, you take things."
  <br>
  <br>
  At 16, he took up boxing.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I wanted to a football player," Foreman said on his website. "I tried boxing just to show my friends that I wasn't afraid. Well, 25 fights and one year later, I was an Olympic gold medallist."
  <br>
  <br>
  At the Mexico Games in 1968, the 19-year-old Foreman bludgeoned his way to the super-heavyweight gold. As he celebrated his final victory, 10 days after fellow African Americans Tommie Smith and John Carlos had made a black power salute following the 200m track final, Foreman waved an American flag in the ring.
  <br>
  <br>
  At 6-foot-4 (1.93m), 'Big George' was larger and stronger than the other leading heavyweights of the time. He was light on his feet, but slugged his way through the professional ranks, to earn a heavyweight title shot against champion Joe Frazier, demolishing the champion in two rounds.
  <br>
  <br>
  By the time he fought his third title defence over 15 rounds against Ali in October 1974 in Kinshasa, Foreman was unbeaten in 40 professional bouts. He had won all but three inside the distance and had not needed to develop stamina.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ali's 'rope-a-dope' tactics, exhausted the big man who lost in eight rounds.
  <br>
  <br>
  The defeat punctured Foreman's intimidating aura, not least, in his own mind.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I just couldn't believe I'd lost the world title," he said later. "It was the most embarrassing moment of my life. It went from pride to pity. That's devastating."
  <br>
  <br>
  His campaign for another title shot ended when he lost on points to another contender, Jimmy Young in March 1977 on a hot night in Puerto Rico.
  <br>
  <br>
  Foreman fell ill after the fight and said he sensed God telling him to change his life.
  <br>
  <br>
  He retired, aged 28 and became an ordained minister. When he announced his comeback 10 years later, bald where he had once sported an afro and flabby instead of chiseled, it seemed like a boxing gimmick. He wrote later that he needed money for his youth centre.
  <br>
  <br>
  - Knockout -
  <br>
  <br>
  Over the next three years he fought 21 times, mostly against mediocre opponents, winning every bout, 20 of them inside the distance.
  <br>
  <br>
  A big name in a weakened and fragmented division, he earned a title shot against Evander Holyfield in 1991 and then against Tommy Morrison two years later, losing both on points.
  <br>
  <br>
  In November 1994 he faced Michael Moorer, who had dethroned Holyfield. In the same shorts he had worn 20 years and six days earlier against Ali, Foreman was trailing badly when he caught Moorer on the chin in the 10th for a knockout. At 45 years and 299 days old he was the oldest heavyweight world champion.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was stripped of first his WBA title and then his IBF title for refusing to fight nominated opponents but won three more fights and was still 'lineal' world champion when he lost on points to Shannon Briggs in 1997, aged 48, and retired again.
  <br>
  <br>
  He fought 81 times as a professional, winning 76, 68 of those by a knockout.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 1994, he put his name to the "George Foreman Lean Mean Fat-Reducing Grilling Machine", appearing smiling and friendly in the TV ads, becoming a celebrity outside boxing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Foreman, who hosted a 1996 TV programme 'Bad Dads', married four times, fathering 10 children and adopting two.
  <br>
  <br>
  He named all his five sons George Edward, explaining that he wanted them to know, "'If one of us goes up, then we all go up together, and if one goes down, we all go down together!'" (AFP)

 The MTR says Light Rail services are returning to normal after several routes in Tin Shui Wai were disrupted on Saturday morning.
 <br>
  <br>
  It took maintenance staff about four hours to fix an overhead line near Tin Yuet, which had been damaged by a crane lorry at around 7:30 am.
  <br>
  <br>
  Routes 705, 706 and 751 were diverted as a result.
  <br>
  <br>
  The MTR asked people to use other forms of public transport while laying on free shuttle buses for affected passengers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police later arrested the 41-year-old crane lorry driver on suspicion of dangerous driving. The force said no one was hurt in the incident.

    French film star Depardieu to go on trial next week

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 French actor Gerard Depardieu faces trial on Monday over alleged sexual assaults of two women on a film set, a case placing one of the world's best known movie stars at the heart of France's broader reckoning over sexual violence.
 <br>
  <br>
  A towering figure of French cinema, Depardieu has faced a growing number of sexual assault allegations in recent years. Depardieu, 76, has consistently denied any wrongdoing, and this would be the first case for which he would be standing trial.
  <br>
  <br>
  Depardieu's lawyer, Jeremie Assous, said the case was based on "false accusations" against his client, adding that the movie star was expected to attend the two-day trial after an initial hearing was postponed due to his ill health.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prosecutors say the assaults took place during the filming in 2021 of "Les Volets Verts" (The Green Shutters).
  <br>
  <br>
  They accuse Depardieu of groping one of the women on the film set, pulling her towards him and trapping her with his legs before touching her waist, hips and breasts while saying obscene words. Three people witnessed the scene, prosecutors say.
  <br>
  <br>
  They say the second woman was groped by Depardieu on set and in the street.
  <br>
  <br>
  The women's identities have not been revealed.
  <br>
  <br>
  The alleged assaults occurred while Depardieu was under formal investigation over accusations of raping a young actress in 2018. A trial has been requested by prosecutors in the case.
  <br>
  <br>
  A lawyer for one of the women said her client was scared to come forward against Depardieu.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There's a fear, because he's a cinema giant," said Carine Durrieu-Diebolt. "It's a struggle between David and Goliath and they are afraid of retaliation as they all work in cinema but at a much lower level than Depardieu."
  <br>
  <br>
  The lawyer for the second plaintiff did not reply to requests for comment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Depardieu's trial could be the highest-profile #MeToo case to come before the courts in France, a country where the protest movement over sexual violence has struggled to gain the same traction as in the United States. (Reuters)

    Boeing wins contract for next generation US fighter

<img alt='Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth (right) said the new aircraft said the new aircraft "sends a very direct, clear message to our allies."

<div class="itemFullText">
 Donald Trump announced on Friday that Boeing has been awarded the contract for the Air Force's next-generation stealth fighter plane, which the 47th US president said would be named the F-47.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Nothing in the world comes even close to it, and it'll be known as the F-47. The generals picked a title, and it's a beautiful number, F-47," said Trump at the White House.
  <br>
  <br>
  The contract aims to develop the replacement for the F-22 jet, which has been in operation for some two decades, with a new, more advanced aircraft able to operate alongside uncrewed drones.
  <br>
  <br>
  "After a rigorous and thorough competition between some of America's top aerospace companies, the Air Force is going to be awarding the contract for the Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) platform to Boeing," Trump said in televised remarks in the Oval Office.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the price of the contract could not be revealed for security reasons.
  <br>
  <br>
  Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth, speaking alongside Trump, said the new aircraft "sends a very direct, clear message to our allies that we're not going anywhere and to our enemies that... we will be able to project power around the globe unimpeded for generations to come."
  <br>
  <br>
  The announcement is a boon for Boeing, which faced a difficult last year in which it struggled with a lengthy labour strike and safety problems on its civilian airliners.
  <br>
  <br>
  The NGAD effort was paused in 2024 over cost concerns, a major focus of the Trump administration, which has tasked billionaire donor Elon Musk with slashing government spending through the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).
  <br>
  <br>
  The Congressional Budget Office estimated in 2018 that the NGAD airframe could cost up to US$300 million apiece—significantly more than various other aircraft currently in the US inventory.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2024, "officials cast doubt on whether the Air Force could afford to develop the NGAD alongside programs including the B-21 Raider bomber and the Minuteman III ICBM replacement," the Congressional Research Service said in a report earlier this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The F-47 will replace the F-22 Raptor, which features stealth technology, a high degree of manoeuvrability, and the ability to supercruise, or maintain supersonic flight without afterburners. (AFP)

 China and Japan should enhance mutual trust and cooperation to provide global stability amid complex international challenges, Foreign Minister Wang Yi said on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Wang, also a member of the Communist Party's Political Bureau, made the remarks during a meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba.
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted that since Ishiba took office, China-Japan ties have improved, highlighted by a productive meeting between President Xi Jinping and the Japanese leader in Lima, Peru.
  <br>
  <br>
  China and Japan, both with important influence, should work together to build a better future for Asia, Wang added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang urged Japan to uphold the principles of four key political documents, safeguard the political and legal foundations of bilateral ties, and honour commitments on historical issues, including Taiwan.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also called for constructive engagement as the 80th anniversary of Chinese People's War of Resistance against Japanese Aggression approaches.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ishiba reiterated Japan's commitment to strengthening ties, recognising the significance of bilateral agreements, and deepening cooperation to benefit both nations. (Xinhua)

    Separate fees for radiology services 'minimal': HA

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Requiring patients to pay separately for tests and scans at public hospitals will leave them with a "minimal" financial burden as such services will still be "highly subsidised" by the government, health officials say amid plans to adjust medical fees.
 <br>
  <br>
  Currently, the government covers the cost of diagnostic radiology services at public hospitals.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government has said it may charge separately for services such as computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, although emergency and hospitalised patients will remain exempt.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials say they hope hospital fees can be adjusted to a level where there would be a reasonable co-payment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Michael Wong, a director at the Hospital Authority, said Hongkongers will likely be asked to pay a certain amount for "more complicated" radiology services, but this should not cost them too much.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This co-payment should still be a highly subsidised amount [from the government]. The public should expect the co-payment to be minimal, and [it] will not affect most of the patients," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If the patients really have some financial difficulties in paying that small amount, they can still apply for a fee exemption or reduction."
  <br>
  <br>
  Introducing a co-payment model could be a way to tackle patient no-shows, Wong said, with around 10 percent of them missing scheduled appointments for medical imaging tests like CT and MRI scans.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hopefully, [we] could reduce this proportion of patients defaulting their attendance, and they could release the appointments for some other patients," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Paul Lee, who chairs the authority's coordinating committee in radiology, said there were also cases of patients attending a scheduled appointment despite no longer requiring a check-up.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some of them, who had scheduled for a scan due to certain symptoms presented at the time of the medical consultation, had been treated for and recovered from their ailments before they could undergo the test, Lee explained.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Thomas Tuchel made a winning start to his England reign without delivering on his promise of a vibrant new era as the Three Lions beat Albania 2-0 in their opening World Cup qualifier on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Tuchel had urged England to play without fear after claiming they were "afraid" in a scathing assessment of their Euro 2024 runners-up finish under his predecessor Gareth Southgate.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the early returns were underwhelming as Tuchel's side dominated possession at Wembley without providing much entertainment for the sell-out 82,378 crowd.
  <br>
  <br>
  While it is far too early to judge Tuchel, the German -- England's third non-British manager -- must know significant improvements are needed on the road to next year's World Cup.
  <br>
  <br>
  Aged 18 years and 176 days, Myles Lewis-Skelly made history in the first half when the Arsenal defender became the youngest player to score on his England debut.
  <br>
  <br>
  That was the highlight of an inconsistent England display which was hard to distinguish from the erratic fare served up by Southgate during his eight years in charge.
  <br>
  <br>
  England captain Harry Kane, who played under Tuchel at Bayern Munich last season, netted late in the second half to put a more flattering gloss on the Group K opener.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 31-year-old's 70th international goal came just 24 hours after England's record scorer claimed people were "bored" of his achievements.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tuchel was greeted with a banner unfurled by fans with the slogan "Welcome to the home of football Thomas" as he walked out of the tunnel before kick-off.
  <br>
  <br>
  True to his word, Tuchel did not sing the English national anthem after saying he had to "earn the right" and there were few songs of praise for Tuchel as Wembley started to empty well before the final whistle.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tuchel, whose side host Latvia on Monday, at least avoiding become the first England boss since Bobby Robson in 1982 to fail to win his first match.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tuchel gave debuts to Lewis-Skelly and Newcastle defender Dan Burn, who scored in Sunday's League Cup final win at Wembley, while Marcus Rashford was given a starting berth after his revival on loan at Aston Villa.
  <br>
  <br>
  All three looked comfortable in Tuchel's 4-2-3-1 formation but England could only muster a workmanlike start.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tuchel stood in the technical area making occasional notes and clapping vigorously when England followed his demand for a high press to win the ball back.
  <br>
  <br>
  The German was even more animated in the 20th minute as his decision to select Lewis-Skelly paid rich dividends.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jude Bellingham was the catalyst as he deftly turned to find space in midfield before stroking a sublime pass towards Lewis-Skelly, who timed his run perfectly to slot home from close-range.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tuchel pumped his arms in celebration, with a sheepish grin spreading across his face.
  <br>
  <br>
  The smile was nearly wiped from his face when Burn's miscued block from Qazim Laci's cross hit the bar in a panicked sequence that ended with the defender heading off the line.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bellingham's diving header was repelled by Thomas Strakosha before Kane's follow-up was brilliantly blocked by Berat Djimsiti.
  <br>
  <br>
  Burn almost reprised his Wembley goal against Liverpool last weekend with a towering header that clanged off the bar.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tuchel's hope that England would play with more intensity wasn't helped by the soporific atmosphere, a stark contrast the Premier League passion he wants his team to emulate.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kane headed narrowly wide from Bellingham's cross after the interval, but England laboured to kill off an Albania side content to sit deep.
  <br>
  <br>
  They finally landed the knockout blow in the 77th minute as Declan Rice's cross reached Kane and he swivelled to curl into the far corner from 10 yards. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The foreign ministers of Germany, France and Britain called late on Friday for an "immediate return" to a Gaza ceasefire, as Israel's military pressed its renewed offensive in the Palestinian territory.
 <br>
  <br>
  Israel on Tuesday began a fresh assault on the war-battered enclave, shattering the relative calm since a January 19 ceasefire.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The resumption of Israeli strikes in Gaza marks a dramatic step backward for the people of Gaza. We are appalled by the civilian casualties and urgently call for an immediate return to a ceasefire," the ministers said in a joint statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The joint appeal came after Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz threatened Friday to annex parts of the Gaza Strip if Hamas did not release the remaining Israeli hostages being held there.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ministers -- Germany's Annalena Baerbock, France's Jean-Noel Barrot and Britain's David Lammy -- called on "all parties to re-engage with negotiations to ensure the ceasefire is implemented in full and becomes permanent".
  <br>
  <br>
  They said Hamas must release the dozens of hostages remaining in the Palestinian territory and that the group "must neither govern Gaza nor be a threat to Israel anymore".
  <br>
  <br>
  The allies said Israel must "fully respect international law" and allow the flow of aid into the territory. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks closed higher Friday after fluctuations, shaking off ongoing economic uncertainty including those triggered by US President Donald Trump's tariff plans -- following his comments that these will contain some flexibility.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.1 percent to 41,985.35, and the broad-based S&P 500 edged up 0.1 percent as well to 5,667.56.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tech-focused Nasdaq Composite Index jumped 0.5 percent to 17,784.05.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There is certainly some hesitation, as we still have a lot of the trade uncertainties ahead of us with the April 2nd reciprocal tariff announcements," said Angelo Kourkafas of Edward Jones.
  <br>
  <br>
  On April 2, Trump has promised reciprocal levies tailored to each US trading partner, to remedy practices deemed unfair by Washington.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the president told reporters Friday that "there'll be flexibility" in his plans, and markets appeared to react with some relief at day-end.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kourkafas cautioned however that "we don't know what's going to happen necessarily, how long it's going to last, which could keep volatility elevated."
  <br>
  <br>
  Among individual companies, shares in package delivery firm FedEx closed 6.5 percent down after it lowered forecasts for this year, noting weakness and uncertainty in the US industrial economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Athletic footwear and apparel giant Nike saw its shares fall by 5.5 percent after earlier reporting a decline in quarterly revenues. (AFP)

    Flights at London Heathrow resume after power outage

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Flights at Britain's Heathrow resumed late on Friday after a fire knocked out its power supply and shut Europe's busiest airport for the day, stranding tens of thousands of passengers and causing travel turmoil worldwide.
 <br>
  <br>
  Heathrow said its teams worked tirelessly to reopen the world's fifth-busiest airport after it was forced to close entirely after a huge fire engulfed a nearby substation on Thursday night, with travellers told to stay away.
  <br>
  <br>
  The airport had been due to handle 1,351 flights on Friday, flying up to 291,000 passengers, but planes were diverted to other airports in Britain and across Europe, while many long-haul flights returned to their point of departure.
  <br>
  <br>
  Heathrow said there would be a limited number of flights on Friday, mostly focused on relocating aircraft and bringing planes into London.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Tomorrow morning, we expect to be back in full operation, to 100 percent operation as a normal day," said Heathrow chief executive Thomas Woldbye. "What I'd like to do is to apologise to the many people who have had their travel affected ... we are very sorry about all the inconvenience."
  <br>
  <br>
  Police said that after an initial assessment they were not treating the incident as suspicious, although enquiries remained ongoing. London Fire Brigade said its investigations would focus on the electrical distribution equipment.
  <br>
  <br>
  The closure not only caused misery for travellers but provoked anger from airlines, which questioned how such crucial infrastructure could fail.
  <br>
  <br>
  The industry is now facing the prospect of a financial hit costing tens of millions of pounds, and a likely fight over who should pay.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You would think they would have significant back-up power," one top executive from a European airline told Reuters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Heathrow's Woldbye said back-up systems and procedures had worked as they should.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This (power supply) is a bit of a weak point," he told reporters outside the airport. "But of course contingencies of certain sizes we cannot guard ourselves against 100% and this is one of them."
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked who would pay, he said there were "procedures in place", adding "we don't have liabilities in place for incidents like this".
  <br>
  <br>
  British transport minister Heidi Alexander said the incident had been out of Heathrow's control.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They have stood up their resilience plans very swiftly and have been working in close collaboration with all the emergency responders and the airline operators," she told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Airlines including JetBlue, American Airlines, Air Canada, Air India, Delta Air Lines, Qantas, United Airlines, IAG-owned British Airways and Virgin were diverted or returned to their origin airports in the middle of the night, according to data from flight analytics firm Cirium.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shares in many airlines, including US carriers, fell.
  <br>
  <br>
  Aviation experts said the last time European airports experienced disruption on such a large scale was the 2010 Icelandic volcanic ash cloud that grounded some 100,000 flights.
  <br>
  <br>
  While flights are restarting, it will be some time before all scheduled passenger services return to normal.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have flight and cabin crew colleagues and planes that are currently at locations where we weren’t planning on them to be," said Sean Doyle, chief executive of British Airways, the biggest carrier at Heathrow which had 341 flights scheduled to land there on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Unfortunately, it will have a huge impact on all of our customers flying with us over the coming days."
  <br>
  <br>
  Britain's Department for Transport said it had temporarily lifted restrictions on overnight flights to ease congestion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Passengers stranded in London and facing the prospect of days of disruptions were scrambling to make alternate travel arrangements.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's pretty stressful," Robyn Autry, 39, a professor, who had been due to fly home to New York. "I'm worried about how much is it going to cost me to fix this."
  <br>
  <br>
  Prices at hotels around Heathrow jumped, with booking sites offering rooms for 500 pounds (US$645), roughly five times the normal price levels.
  <br>
  <br>
  Airline executives, electrical engineers and passengers questioned how Britain's gateway to the world could be forced to close by one fire, however large.
  <br>
  <br>
  Heathrow and London's other major airports have been hit by other outages in recent years, most recently by an automated gate failure and an air traffic system meltdown, both in 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  Philip Ingram, a former intelligence officer in the British military, said Heathrow's inability to keep operating exposed vulnerability in Britain's critical national infrastructure.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is a wake-up call," he told Reuters. "There is no way that Heathrow should be taken out completely because of a failure in one power substation."
  <br>
  <br>
  Willie Walsh, the head of the global airlines body IATA and a former head of British Airways, said Heathrow had once again let passengers down.
  <br>
  <br>
  Heathrow said it had diesel generators and uninterruptible power supplies in place to land aircraft and evacuate passengers safely. Those systems all operated as expected. But with the airport consuming as much energy as a small city, it said it could not run all its operations safely on back-up systems.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prime Minister Keir Starmer's spokesperson said there were questions to answer about how the incident occurred and there would be a thorough investigation. (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Counter-terror police on Friday launched a probe into an electricity substation fire that shut down Heathrow airport causing travel chaos for passengers around the world and the cancellation or diversion of hundreds of flights from Europe's busiest air hub.
 <br>
  <br>
  Heathrow plies routes to around 80 countries and some 1,350 flights had been due to land or take off from the airport's five terminals on Friday, according to the online flight tracking website Flightradar24.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some 230,000 passengers a day and 83 million a year use Heathrow, making it one of the world's busiest airports.
  <br>
  <br>
  London's Metropolitan Police said the force's Counter Terrorism Command was leading enquiries given the "impact this incident has had on critical national infrastructure."
  <br>
  <br>
  "While there is currently no indication of foul play we retain an open mind at this time," a spokesman added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Firefighters were called to the "highly visible" blaze at the substation shortly after 2320 GMT on Thursday and around 70 were sent to battle the fire, which was brought under control by 0800 GMT.
  <br>
  <br>
  Witnesses saw water cannons were still being used at the smoking fire site at around 1300 GMT.
  <br>
  <br>
  UK Energy Secretary Ed Miliband promised that the government would do all it could to restore power to Heathrow quickly, as questions were raised about the airport's "resilience."
  <br>
  <br>
  The shutdown left many frustrated passengers struggling to make alternative arrangements.
  <br>
  <br>
  Around 120 Heathrow-bound planes were in the air when the closure was announced, according to Flightradar24.
  <br>
  <br>
  The UK's second busiest airport, Gatwick, said it would accept some flights from Heathrow. Others were diverted to European airports including Shannon in southwestern Ireland, Frankfurt, and Paris Charles de Gaulle.
  <br>
  <br>
  London Fire Brigade deputy commissioner Jonathan Smith said firefighters had worked "tirelessly in challenging and very hazardous conditions."
  <br>
  <br>
  He told reporters the fire had involved a "transformer comprising of 25,000 litres of cooling oil fully alight" posing a hazard due to the substation's "still live high voltage equipment."
  <br>
  <br>
  One resident near the substation recalled hearing a "massive explosion" as the power cut out just before midnight while another reported seeing a "bright flash of white."
  <br>
  <br>
  Around 150 people were evacuated from nearby properties because of the fire.
  <br>
  <br>
  The outage left 100,000 homes without power overnight. By morning, power had been restored to all but around 4,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  As the scale of the disruption began to emerge, Miliband faced questions about how one fire could shut down an entire airport.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the electricity distribution network National Grid had told him they had not seen "anything like the scale" of what happened.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But it makes Heathrow look quite vulnerable and therefore we've got to learn lessons, as I say, about not just Heathrow but how we protect our major infrastructure," he told ITV News.
  <br>
  <br>
  Willie Walsh, director general of the airline industry trade association IATA, said the closure was "yet another case of Heathrow letting down both travellers and airlines."
  <br>
  <br>
  "How is it that critical infrastructure – of national and global importance – is totally dependent on a single power source without an alternative? If that is the case – as it seems – then it is a clear planning failure by the airport," he said on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  Flights from all over the world were affected by the closure and aviation consultant Philip Butterworth-Hayes said it would cost "more than £50 million (US$64.7 million)" to the airport and airlines.
  <br>
  <br>
  Situated 25 kilometres west of central London, Heathrow's main flight destinations last year were Dublin, Los Angeles, Madrid and New York. (AFP)

<img alt="Hong Kong Investment Corporation has signed a strategic partnership deal with Shanghai-based startup StarFive to speed up RISC-V chips' adoption in the SAR. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796829_2_20250321182218.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan said on Friday a strategic partnership between the government-backed investment firm and a mainland chipmaker will speed up adoption of the popular RISC-V chips in the city.
 <br>
  <br>
  The remarks came as Chan delivered a keynote speech at the signing ceremony to mark the deal between Hong Kong Investment Corporation (HKIC) and Shanghai-based semiconductor start-up, StarFive, which produces the chips.
  <br>
  <br>
  RISC-V is an open-source architecture that is used to design a range of less-sophisticated chips and allows developers to configure and customise their chip designs.
  <br>
  <br>
  It's considered capable of challenging Intel's x86 architecture's domination of the personal computer market as well as the Arm Holdings architecture that dominates the smartphone markets.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at the event via a recorded video, Chan said that based on the characteristics of the RISC-V architecture as well as Hong Kong's strengths, the two sides could together reach new heights in creating new industries and forging global cooperation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As the application of open-source large language models, such as that of DeepSeek's, become more inclusive and flexible, combining it with the supply and applications of RISC-V open-source chips will mean a great reduction in cost and a great increase in their flexibilities," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Of course, as the RISC-V technology is now being developed at a fast speed, there's a need to further enrich [its relevant] industrial clusters and for accelerated international collaboration. This will allow Hong Kong to fully leverage our advantages under One Country, Two Systems," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, HKIC chief executive Clara Chan said the collaboration with StarFive will bring co-operation between the tech firm and local universities and institutes, while bringing new employment opportunities.
  <br>
  <br>
  StarFive, she added, will also give priority to the SAR as its potential listing venue in the future.
  <br>
  <br>
  The deal came as Beijing has been doubling down on the use of the RISC-V architecture as a bet to strengthen its domestic chip industry and reduce reliance on foreign suppliers.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, it's not known how much HKIC has invested in the six-year-old RISC-V chipmaker.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Sunday, Chan also said in his weekly blog that the design and application of RISC-V open source chips is an important part of strategic planning for Hong Kong's future.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Last year was the deadliest year for migrants, with nearly 9,000 people dying worldwide, the United Nations said on Friday, calling the "tragedy... unacceptable and preventable".
 <br>
  <br>
  "At least 8,938 people died on migration routes worldwide in 2024," the fifth year that numbers have reached record highs, the UN's migration agency said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The tragedy of the growing number of migrant deaths worldwide is both unacceptable and preventable," said Ugochi Daniels, the deputy director of the International Organization for Migration (IOM).
  <br>
  <br>
  "Behind every number is a human being, someone for whom the loss is devastating," Daniels said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The actual number of migrant deaths and disappearances is likely much higher, as many have gone undocumented because of the dearth of official sources," the IOM said.
  <br>
  <br>
  It added that the identities and other details of the majority of victims were unknown.

  Asia, Africa and Europe had record numbers of people dying in 2024 with 2,778, 2,242 and 233 respectively.
  <br>
  <br>
  A total of 2,452 people were recorded as dying in the Mediterranean Sea, the main gateway for those trying to reach Europe, it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Final data were not available yet for the Americas but figures so far show at least 1,233 people died.
  <br>
  <br>
  These included "an unprecedented 341 lives lost in the Caribbean in 2024 and a record 174 deaths of migrants crossing the Darien" jungle between Colombia and Panama.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Darien jungle was at one point the main migratory corridor for people trying to reach the United States. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Opener Hasan Nawaz struck a record-breaking maiden century on Friday as Pakistan crushed New Zealand by nine wickets in the third Twenty20 to keep the series alive.
 <br>
  <br>
  After scoring a duck in each of the two opening games – the first innings of his international career – Nawaz rebounded with a stunning 105 not out in Auckland as the tourists raced to 207-1 in response to New Zealand's 204.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 23-year-old's ton came off 44 balls, the fastest by any Pakistan player in a T20 international.
  <br>
  <br>
  It ensured his team reached the target with four full overs to spare, in a stark reversal of form after heavy losses in Christchurch and Dunedin.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nawaz put his early failures behind him with a sparkling knock featuring shots all around the wicket, including a series of audacious ramp shots.
  <br>
  <br>
  He admitted he was worried about his selection prospects after two failures and thanked captain Salman Agha and vice-captain Shadab Khan for showing faith in his ability.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The way I got out in the first two matches, I was very disheartened, but the captain and Shadab supported me, told me I am a match-winning player and that helped me," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I wanted to score my first run in international cricket, that's what I was thinking. After I scored one run, the pressure was released and I wanted to win the game."
  <br>
  <br>
  The right-hander peppered the short Eden Park boundaries with 10 fours and seven sixes, bringing up victory with successive fours off Kyle Jamieson in the 16th over.
  <br>
  <br>
  The first of those shots took Nawaz to 100, five balls faster than the previous Pakistan record-holder – Babar Azam against South Africa in 2021.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fellow opener Mohammad Haris scored 41 off 20 while captain Salman Agha was unbeaten on 51 off 31.
  <br>
  <br>
  New Zealand captain Michael Bracewell conceded they had few answers to halt Nawaz.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You've got to tip your hat to Nawaz there, the way that he played was unbelievable," Bracewell said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's pretty tough to defend out here but when a guy plays like that, it's really tough."
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier, New Zealand looked well placed after Mark Chapman hit a rapid 94 before they were dismissed in their final over.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chapman dominated after New Zealand were asked to bat, tallying 11 fours and four sixes from just 44 balls faced.
  <br>
  <br>
  The rest of the home side's batsmen struggled to get going, aside from Bracewell's 31.
  <br>
  <br>
  Experienced seamer Haris Rauf bowled Bracewell and finished with Pakistan's best figures of 3-29.
  <br>
  <br>
  Game four of the five-match series is in Mount Maunganui on Sunday. (AFP)

<img alt="Lewis Hamilton in a Ferrari during the sprint qualifier. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796819_1_20250321175331.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A "gobsmacked" Lewis Hamilton obliterated the Shanghai lap record to take a stunning pole position on Friday for the Chinese Grand Prix sprint in only his second race weekend with Ferrari.
 <br>
  <br>
  Hamilton, who has won a record six Chinese Grands Prix, flew round the resurfaced 5.451km Shanghai International Circuit in 1min 30.849sec.
  <br>
  <br>
  His lap easily beat the 1:32.238 set in 2004 at the inaugural Chinese GP by fellow seven-time world champion Michael Schumacher, also in a Ferrari.
  <br>
  <br>
  Reigning world champion Max Verstappen of Red Bull, who won both the sprint and main race in China last year, was second fastest 0.018sec behind and McLaren's Oscar Piastri was third.
  <br>
  <br>
  Charles Leclerc was fourth as Ferrari showed a big improvement from Melbourne, where Hamilton was 10th and Leclerc eighth -- the Scuderia's worst season-opening performance since 2009.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm just a bit gobsmacked, taken back by it. I didn't know when we would get to this position," said Hamilton, who emerged from his car to a huge ovation from the Chinese fans.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I started out straight away with a better feeling in the car. I can't believe we are at the front, ahead of a McLaren which has been so fast throughout winter testing, Australia and even today."
  <br>
  <br>
  A big surprise was Melbourne winner Lando Norris, whose McLaren had been fastest by almost half a second in morning practice ahead of Leclerc, Piastri and Hamilton.
  <br>
  <br>
  Norris was sixth after he ran wide and aborted his final flying lap.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I made a mistake. I locked up in the last corner," admitted Norris, who complained his car was not to his liking.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Just too many mistakes but just too difficult of a car to drive," the Englishman said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Verstappen said he was fortunate to be second on the grid for the sprint race.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The lap was very good. I don't even think we should have been on the front row anyway so I'm very happy to be second," said the four-time world champion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mercedes' George Russell was fifth with his teammate Kimi Antonelli seventh behind Norris.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yuki Tsunoda's RB, Alex Albon's Williams and Lance Stroll's Aston Martin rounded out the top 10.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ferrari team principal Fred Vasseur said it was difficult to understand the difference between Friday's sessions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Sometimes McLaren had a huge gap, sometimes not so. Let's analyse it. We have a lot of work to do," Vasseur told Sky Sports F1.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For sure it's a good feeling and gives a positive energy to the team and Lewis, but I always see the negative side."
  <br>
  <br>
  All the cars were obligated to run medium-compound tyres in the first two sprint qualifying sessions, termed SQ1 and SQ2.
  <br>
  <br>
  Red Bull rookie Liam Lawson had a bad start to his weekend, failing to get out of the first session after having a lap time deleted for exceeding track limits and the New Zealander will start 20th and last.
  <br>
  <br>
  Also eliminated after the first session were the Alpine pair of Jack Doohan and Pierre Gasly, Haas's Esteban Ocon and the Sauber of Nico Hulkenberg.
  <br>
  <br>
  In SQ2, Fernando Alonso was 11th in the Aston Martin and missed out on the top-10 shootout.
  <br>
  <br>
  Also eliminated were Oliver Bearman's Haas, the Williams of Carlos Sainz, Gabriel Bortoleto in a Sauber and Isack Hadjar's RB.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 19-lap sprint race will take place on Saturday morning before grand prix qualifying later the same day.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sunday sees the Chinese Grand Prix over 56 laps. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee said the government will soon offer land for private development in Hong Kong-Shenzhen Innovation and Technology Park, now that the first three buildings in zone's Hong Kong Park have been completed.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lee's remarks came as he attended the topping-out ceremony for the No 8 and 9 laboratory buildings in the zone in Lok Ma Chau Loop, which also saw the successful completion of the No 11 talent accommodation building.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the completion of the buildings marks a milestone for technological collaboration between the Hong Kong and Shenzhen governments and paves the way for the zone to become a world-class cluster.
  <br>
  <br>
  He called for more private firms to participate in jointly developing the high-tech area.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will soon select suitable sites this year and seek private development plans to make use of the market forces to accelerate the development of the park, and we will complete the detailed planning of the second phase of the park within this year," Lee said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With the gradual completion of the park, it will provide more room for the development of more innovation and technology enterprises and talents, and I call on all sectors from society as well as market forces to actively participate [in the park's development]," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, Lee, who chairs the park's steering committee, said a second edition of the committee's meeting was held yesterday to speed up planning and usage of the three buildings, and authorities are now going all out with development plans for five more planned buildings.
  <br>
  <br>
  The first batch of tenants, including companies specialising in bio-health technology and data science, is expected to be move in and start operating during the second half of the year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier, the government also said it is earmarking HK$3.7 billion to assist the park's construction.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee, meanwhile, noted that the SAR government will continue to explore the possibility of eliciting policy support from the mainland to enhance the free flow of personnel, resources, capital and data to assist with cross-border collaboration.

    Police launch citywide crackdown on careless driving

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Friday said they will launch a citywide operation next week to tackle inattentive driving, following an increase in fatal traffic accidents in the first three months of this year.
 <br>
  <br>
  Officers said there were 21 fatal accidents from January to March, up around 40 percent from the same period last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a press conference, the force said most cases involved motorcyclists and truck drivers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan Sin-hang, a chief inspector with the force, explained the reasons for the increase.
  <br>
  <br>
  “One of the reasons may be because of the end of the new year and there may be a lot of deliveries for the truck drivers. So maybe they're in a hurry, and so they neglected the situation on the road,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “They failed to pay attention to the road situation and maybe they didn't maintain a safe distance with the cars in front of them, or they didn't pay attention before they cut into the other lane, and also speeding.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Starting next week, police will launch a stringent enforcement operation across Hong Kong to combat careless driving, speeding, and jaywalking.
  <br>
  <br>
  The force also reported 18,355 traffic accidents in 2024, involving 23,659 injuries, most of which were minor.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A French aeronautic services company on Friday said it is working with the Airport Authority (AA) to develop the SAR into Asia’s first aircraft parts processing and trading hub.
 <br>
  <br>
  The French firm, Elior Group, signed a memorandum of understanding with the authority last month to explore the possibility of providing services such as aircraft dismantling, parts recycling and related training in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  Its chairman Daniel Derichebourg said the company is looking forward to developing and exploring new opportunities in Hong Kong, and expanding its businesses across Asia.
  <br>
  <br>
  The company also said it will discuss the topic of training local talents with the Hong Kong International Aviation Academy.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The city has always been a prime location for foreign investment and international conglomerates,” said Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development Algernon Yau in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Hong Kong will continue to play its unique role of connecting the mainland and the world to attract more companies from around the world to set up in the city,” he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alpha Lau, the director-general of investment promotion at InvestHK – which will help Elior set up its Asia headquarters in Hong Kong – said: “The signing of this MoU is a testament to global businesses confidence in the Hong Kong market."
  <br>
  <br>
  She added the move reaffirms "that Hong Kong is the ideal destination for companies to establish or expand their operations in the region”.
  <br>
  <br>
  And transport minister Mabel Chan said she is pleased about the collaboration, which will enrich the SAR’s position as an international aviation hub and support the aviation development in the country and Asia.

    Well-off public housing tenants to pay more

<img alt="Cleresa Wong said the higher rental charges for well-off tenants are aimed at bringing about a fairer use of public resources and not at raising government revenue. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796794_1_20250321160610.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A Housing Authority committee tightened rules on Friday for well-off public housing tenants, raising the likelihood that their rent would more than double.
 <br>
  <br>
  The new measures, which will be implemented in October, could also see hundreds of well-off households required to move out in four years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Currently, households that earn two to five times the income limit are paying 1.5 times to double the standard rent.
  <br>
  <br>
  After the changes, they'd have to pay 2.5 to 4.5 times the normal rate.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials said that within a four-year period, if a tenant's income is twice found to be between four to five times the limit, the tenants will have to move out.
  <br>
  <br>
  As for those who earn five times the limit, the rule remains that they must return the flat immediately.
  <br>
  <br>
  The chairwoman of the authority's subsidised housing committee, Cleresa Wong, said the government is expected to receive around HK$1.5 billion more a year as a result of the changes.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, she stressed that the move is not about raising government revenue but about ensuring a fair use of public resources and ensuring all tenants have a similar income-to-rent ratio.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As a result of this review, generally well-off tenants will now be paying roughly 11 percent of their household income as their rental housing expenses," Wong said after a committee meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The 'ables' should pay more."
  <br>
  <br>
  The rental changes, she added, will affect around five percent of public rental tenants, or around 40,000 households.
  <br>
  <br>
  She also said rules for well-off tenants to buy subsidised flats are also being relaxed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Those earning four to five times the limit will keep their status as green form applicants for four more years after they'd moved out of public housing.

 A South Korean court on Friday ruled against popular K-pop girl group NewJeans, which had sought to sever ties with their label ADOR over what they called "mistreatment" by the company.

  The group, which now calls themselves NJZ and is to appear in Hong Kong's ComplexCon this weekend, made headlines in November by announcing their decision to leave ADOR, whose parent company HYBE is behind K-pop sensation BTS.
  <br>
  <br>
  The label later filed for an injunction to maintain its status as the managing agency of NewJeans, requesting that the Seoul Central District Court prohibit the group's members from engaging in independent commercial activities.
  <br>
  <br>
  The court sided with ADOR, issuing a ruling that the group, now branding themselves as NJZ, must not pursue independent endeavours.
  <br>
  <br>
  The court said that if the group "unilaterally terminate their exclusive contract" with ADOR, and change their name autonomously, the label would suffer "significant damages".
  <br>
  <br>
  The group's actions would also "severely damage not only the brand value of NewJeans but also ADOR's reputation as a management company," the court added.
  <br>
  <br>
  NewJeans made their debut in 2022 and the K-pop phenomenon is among HYBE's most successful acts.
  <br>
  <br>
  NewJeans and ADOR have been caught in the heated contract dispute since August, following allegations that HYBE forced out the group's star producer, Min Hee-jin.
  <br>
  <br>
  The band issued an ultimatum for Min's reinstatement, which HYBE declined.
  <br>
  <br>
  In response, the members took their grievances public, accusing the label of intentionally sabotaging their careers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Band member Hanni alleged last year that the group experienced workplace harassment, such as "deliberate miscommunications and manipulation regarding multiple areas" while working with ADOR.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is not the type of work ethic we respect and not one we want to be a part of, and to continue working under a company with no intention of protecting NewJeans would only do us harm," she said at the time.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the court on Friday said that based on the claims and evidence submitted by the group, it is "difficult to conclude that ADOR has sufficiently violated the essential obligations of the exclusive contract."
  <br>
  <br>
  ADOR welcomed the court's "judicious" decision, and said they "eagerly anticipate meeting with the artists for a heartfelt conversation at the earliest opportunity".
  <br>
  <br>
  "With our status as NewJeans' exclusive agency now legally affirmed, we are fully committed to supporting the artists going forward," it said. (With additional reporting from AFP)

    HKMU launches Cantonese opera translation library

<img alt="The team behind the Cantonese opera translations says they pay special attention to the culture and history behind the stories. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796790_1_20250321154817.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Metropolitan University on Friday launched a new online library that features English translations of classic Cantonese opera scripts.
 <br>
  <br>
  The project started a year ago and the initial collection includes scripts from the renowned Cantonese opera “Forty Years of Cherished Love”, which tells the tragic love story of the poet Lu You and his wife Tang Wan in the Song dynasty.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kelly Chan, director of the university’s Ina Ho Cantonese Opera Research Centre and head of the team, said she hopes the translations will bring Cantonese opera to a broader audience.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan – who is also a language and translation professor – noted that the team has also included explainers to certain translations to make it easier for English readers to understand.
  <br>
  <br>
  “If you see the Chinese term ‘milky way', what does that mean, especially for westerners? Does it mean silver river? There's actually a love story behind, for the cowherd and the weaving girl, so that would be more beneficial for people who did not really know this tradition.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Sheryl Zhang, who is part of the translation team, said one challenge is to balance language and cultural context.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Their love story was so sorrowful and carries grief. In the translation, we had to pay so much attention to the emotions, the cultural, and particularly, historical phase behind the story.
  <br>
  <br>
  The nine-member team is currently working on translating more works, including selections from the opera adaptation of “The Dream of the Red Chamber”.
  <br>
  <br>
  Their full collection is currently only available to the university’s students and staff, though people who are interested in the works can reach out to the university to request full access to the library.

<img alt="Fans queue for limited-edition Labubu toys created by Hong Kong artist Kasing Lung. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796791_1_20250321154832.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A global pop culture festival ComplexCon has returned to Hong Kong for a second year, with organisers expecting the stronger lineup to bring in more visitors.
 <br>
  <br>
  The three-day event was held outside the United States for the first time last year, attracting over 30,000 visitors.
  <br>
  <br>
  The organiser said it expects visitor numbers to hit 35,000 this year, as it has a stronger live concert lineup that includes American record producer Metro Boomin and the well-known K-pop group NJZ.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, a Seoul district court ruled on Friday against NJZ in its attempt to leave the ADOR label and prohibited the group from "pursuing independent endeavours."
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement made hours after the ruling, NJZ said the group will be participating in ComplexCon.
  <br>
  <br>
  This year’s festival also features a marketplace for trendy products, with fans queuing for limited-edition goods of the Labubu toy created by Hong Kong artist Kasing Lung.
  <br>
  <br>
  A tourist from the United States said he had been to ComplexCon in Las Vegas before and it was different with that in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The one in Las Vegas was really big, but this one still is really nice. We got the VIP ticket, so we can get in early and see what's here,” he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I'm here for some Labubu stuff. We've been all over Hong Kong looking for Labubu things. We went to all the Pop Marts. Everything was sold out. So it's really nice that this is open right now.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The ComplexCon marketplace is also a platform for NJZ to release their first-ever merchandise following a name change from NewJeans.
  <br>
  <br>
  A 15-year-old Hong Kong fan of the group said he arrived early to get the goods as they are very limited.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I have already queued for like 40 minutes already. I really want the keychain and the T-shirt,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I've been really liking them for a long time, [since] I was 12 or 13. I already wanted to come before they said NJZ is coming. So it's like a bonus for the event.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The festival, which opens on Friday, ends on Sunday at the AsiaWorld-Expo in Chek Lap Kok.

    Cathay Pacific cancels flights to London

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Cathay Pacific said on Friday it cancelled two flights from Hong Kong to London, due to the temporary closure of Heathrow Airport.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Cathay Pacific flights CX239 and CX253 from Hong Kong to London on 21 March have been cancelled," a statement by the airline said.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, CX251 and CX255, due to depart Hong Kong for London late Friday, will operate normally.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, all flights from London to Hong Kong operated by the airline have also been cancelled.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are assessing the situation and will keep our customers informed with the latest updates," the statement said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some affected passengers at the Hong Kong International Airport were left frustrated with the airline's arrangements.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsie Slade, who is returning home to London, said it was "chaos" with Cathay staff members giving her different instructions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I can't understand why they can't just say: 'wait here and we will sort it out for you'," she told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another passenger surnamed Choi said he understood it was a rare incident, but noted there's room for improvement in the airline's response.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I have travelled for 40 years and never had this experience," he said. "They said it's not their problem. That triggered us."
  <br>
  <br>
  Others, including a passenger surnamed Siu, decided to look for alternative ways of getting to London.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I used about 25 minutes to finish booking another flight [that is] a week later... I have plenty of time," he said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Italy's Olympic bronze medallist Andy Diaz Hernandez produced a stunning early effort of 17.8 metres to capture the triple jump gold medal in the first final of the world indoor athletics championships on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Cuban-born European champion broke the Italian record with his first jump of the day and comfortably staved off his challengers, with China's Zhu Yaming taking the silver with a distance of 17.33 metres.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brazil's Almir Dos Santos grabbed the bronze with 17.22 metres, while defending champion Hugues Fabrice Zango of Burkina Faso only managed fourth place with 17.15 metres in Nanjing's Cube.
  <br>
  <br>
  Diaz Hernandez fouled in the second round before deciding not to take his third, fourth and fifth attempts. He returned for the sixth round, merely running through, however, soaking up the cheers from the crowd. (Reuters)

    Norris chalks up fastest practice lap in Chinese GP

<img alt="Mechanics work on Lando Norris' car in the pits during the first practice session of the Formula One Chinese Grand Prix at the Shanghai International Circuit. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796771_1_20250321132157.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lando Norris was fastest in practice on Friday for the Chinese Grand Prix, the championship leader lapping almost half a second quicker than Ferrari's Charles Leclerc, with McLaren team-mate Oscar Piastri third.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lewis Hamilton was fourth quickest as Ferrari bounced back from a dismal opening race in Australia last weekend to split the dominant McLaren duo ahead of sprint race qualifying later on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Norris won in Melbourne and McLaren would have had a one-two if not for Piastri's late spin, which handed defending four-time world champion Max Verstappen second in his Red Bull.
  <br>
  <br>
  Verstappen, who won both the sprint race and the grand prix in Shanghai last year, struggled and aborted his final lap on soft tyres leaving him only 16th fastest.
  <br>
  <br>
  Norris clocked 1min 31.504sec around the resurfaced 5.451km Shanghai International Circuit, where long turns and heavy braking zones are notoriously punishing on tyres.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was 0.454sec ahead of Leclerc with Piastri 0.195 further back.
  <br>
  <br>
  The conditions were a contrast to last weekend's wet and wild season-opener in Melbourne that saw several crashes and stints under the safety car.
  <br>
  <br>
  The session was the teams' only opportunity to hone their set-ups before Friday afternoon's sprint qualifying.
  <br>
  <br>
  Times tumbled as the new asphalt rubbered in.
  <br>
  <br>
  The "big four" teams – Red Bull, McLaren, Ferrari and Mercedes – all battled for early supremacy, swapping fastest times on the medium compound tyres.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was a much improved session for Ferrari after Melbourne, where the seven-time world champion Hamilton came home only 10th after the team strategists gambled and lost on leaving him out on slick tyres in rain.
  <br>
  <br>
  Leclerc was eighth with Ferrari's five points representing their worst season-opening performance since 2009.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rookie Jack Doohan failed to complete a lap on his debut and had more woe in Shanghai when his Alpine lost power, bringing out the red flags 13 minutes from the end of the session.
  <br>
  <br>
  At that point all the teams had run only on medium tyres.
  <br>
  <br>
  When the session resumed with eight minutes to go it saw a congested dash from the pit lane to record a qualifying simulation lap as everyone bolted on the faster softs.
  <br>
  <br>
  George Russell's Mercedes was fifth fastest.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nico Hulkenberg's Sauber was sixth, with Alex Albon's Williams, Fernando Alonso's Aston Martin, Kimi Antonelli's Mercedes and Yuki Tsunoda's RB making up the rest of the top 10.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 19-lap sprint race will take place on Saturday morning before grand prix qualifying later the same day.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sunday sees the main race over 56 laps. (AFP)

    HK$3bn scheme to support academic research: CE

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Friday said the city will soon launch a HK$3 billion scheme to support local academic and scientific research, as authorities ramp up efforts to transition Hong Kong into a global innovation and technology centre.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lee made the remarks at the opening of the International Academicians Hong Kong Forum in Wan Chai, where he noted that the role of scholars and scientists is critical in aiding Hong Kong's technological transition, amid evolving and unprecedented global challenges.
  <br>
  <br>
  The forum also marked the founding of the International Alliance of Academicians (IAA).
  <br>
  <br>
  "Knowledge knows no borders, our shared challenges require shared solutions. The government is committed to cultivating a dynamic environment, one that champions innovation and technology, in every sector and industry, every institution and corner of our community," he told participants.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will soon launch a Frontier Technology Research Support Scheme, worth HK$3 billion, or nearly US$400 million. It will help fund groundbreaking basic research driven by world-class researchers and academics," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that the completion of the first three buildings in the Hong Kong-Shenzhen Innovation and Technology Park will also help provide the "hardware" for local I&T development, and that the alliance could serve as the "soft power".
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, Nancy Ip, President of the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, who chairs the IAA, said that Hong Kong is an ideal base for the alliance.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Given its international status and dynamic academic and research sectors, Hong Kong is ideally positioned to foster scientific cooperation among leading scholars from around the world. This global alliance will also solidify Hong Kong's reputation as an international innovation and technology centre," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The IAA alliance is made up of 100 academics from around the world, and aims to enhance global collaboration among scientists and academics.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Vinicius Junior struck a dramatic winner in the ninth minute of stoppage time to give Brazil a 2-1 win over Colombia in their South American World Cup qualifier.
 <br>
  <br>
  The five-time world champions had taken a sixth-minute lead in Brasilia through a Raphinha penalty only for Luis Diaz's fine 41st-minute strike for Colombia to level the game on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Colombia enjoyed the most pressure in the second half but were ultimately sunk by the Real Madrid winger's dramatic winner.
  <br>
  <br>
  The victory leaves Brazil well positioned in second place in the 10-team CONMEBOL qualifying group, four points behind leaders Argentina who travel to Uruguay on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  A foul from Daniel Munoz on Vinicius resulted in the early penalty for Brazil and Raphinha, taking a short run-up, confidently slotted home the spot-kick to give the home side an early lead.
  <br>
  <br>
  But four minutes before the break, James Rodriguez found Liverpool's Diaz on the left and the winger moved inside before driving it home into the far, bottom corner of the net.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rodriguez had an opening in the 68th minute, after a smart move from Colombia, but the playmaker's shot was comfortably dealt with by Alisson Becker.
  <br>
  <br>
  Diaz's Liverpool team-mate Becker had to go off injured in the 78th minute, with an apparent concussion, after a collision with Colombia's Davinson Sanchez which resulted in the defender being stretchered off.
  <br>
  <br>
  While Colombia enjoyed the bulk of attacking possession, Brazil remained a threat and Guilherme Arana flashed a shot wide in the 82nd minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Alisson injury had created the lengthy stoppage time and Vinicius took advantage with his fiercely struck effort taking a slight deflection off a defender's head and flying in.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Today's goal is a bit of relief, a bit of happiness. Playing for the national team is something you can't explain," said Vinicius.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Every time we come here, it's like it's the first time".
  <br>
  <br>
  Brazil face old rivals Argentina on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was a bitter ending for a Colombia side who sit in sixth place still with work to do in qualifying.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We kept Brazil in their half, I think we deserved more again, but that's the way it is. I have a lot of doubts about the refereeing decisions, which I'm not going to comment on," said Colombia coach Nestor Lorenzo.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We played a great game and came away with nothing again. We conceded a very early goal again," he lamented.
  <br>
  <br>
  In other South American qualifiers on Thursday, Paraguay beat bottom-placed Chile 1-0 in Asuncion, a result that left La Roja rooted to the bottom of the table.
  <br>
  <br>
  Veteran 41-year-old striker Paolo Guerrero was on target as Peru beat Bolivia 3-1 to move off the bottom.
  <br>
  <br>
  Andy Polo opened the scoring in the 37th minute before Guerrero found the target on the stroke of half-time. (AFP)
  <br>
  <br>
  Bolivia pulled one back with a Miguel Terceros penalty in the 58th minute before Edison Flores restored the two-goal cushion in the 82nd minute.

    All eyes on safety in low-altitude test runs

<div class="itemFullText">
 Transport chief Mable Chan said on Friday most pilot projects in Hong Kong's first-ever low-altitude economy test run will be operated manually and within the line of sight.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Low-altitude Economy Regulatory Sandbox trials will test airspace management, flight operations and emergency responses to support the use of unmanned aircraft.
  <br>
  <br>
  The initial phase, comprising 38 projects, is set to begin next month at Science Park, Cyberport and on some outlying islands.
  <br>
  <br>
  One project will be a food delivery test run between Science Park and Ma On Shan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan told an RTHK radio programme that safety is the top priority, noting that drones are equipped with propellers and backup systems.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Based on safety and risk-based principles, we will begin by operating gradually within visual range," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For future beyond line-of-sight flights covering longer distances, we aim to advance further based on flight data collected from line-of-sight runs and assessments of safety considerations.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In terms of tech and innovation research, some laboratories at universities are currently developing safety features for these drones.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They've developed various self-defence mechanisms for the drones.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Also, when one drone is in operation, another drone will monitor it nearby at the same time."
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on another radio programme, Chan said officials will study the possibility of developing a low-altitude economy in the Northern Metropolis.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government plans to amend regulations to increase drone weight limits from 25 kilogrammes to 150kg to allow more advanced drones to carry heavier loads.

 Hong Kong has seen its winding-up orders hitting the highest level in more than 15 years.
 <br>
  <br>
  Data released by the Official Receiver's Office on Friday showed that 66 winding-up orders were made by the court in February, up 83 percent from a year earlier and an increase of 14 percent on a monthly basis.
  <br>
  <br>
  That's the highest monthly figure since September 2009.
  <br>
  <br>
  As for bankruptcy petitions, the figure stood at 787 in February, an increase of 21.5 percent year on year but a 3.9 percent drop from January.
  <br>
  <br>
  For the first two months of the year taken together, the number of bankruptcy petitions reached 1,606, 15 percent higher from the same period a year earlier.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Russian President Vladimir Putin's top security adviser Sergei Shoigu has arrived in North Korea and plans to meet its leader Kim Jong-un, the Tass news agency reported on Friday, his latest visit amid dramatic advances in security ties between the countries.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Tass report did not have further details and North Korea's state media have not reported on Shoigu's arrival.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shoigu, former defence minister until May last year, had earlier made visits to Pyongyang as North Korea geared up to deploy troops to fight for Russia in its war against Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  US and South Korean officials have said North Korea has deployed more than 10,000 troops who were sent into combat in Russia's eastern Kursk region and also shipped heavy weapons including artillery and ballistic missiles.
  <br>
  <br>
  North Korea is believed to have received military and civilian technology and economic assistance from Moscow in return.
  <br>
  <br>
  Neither Pyongyang nor Moscow has acknowledged Pyongyang's deployment of troops and weapons, but said they had continued to implement a strategic partnership treaty signed by the countries' leaders in June last year that includes a mutual defence pact. (Reuters)

    London's Heathrow airport closes due to power outage

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Britain's Heathrow Airport on Friday said it would be closed until midnight after experiencing a significant power outage due to a fire at a nearby electrical substation supplying the airport.
 <br>
  <br>
  "To maintain the safety of our passengers and colleagues, Heathrow will be closed until 23h59 on 21 March," Heathrow Airport said in a post on X, adding that passengers are advised not to travel to the airport.
  <br>
  <br>
  There was no clarity on when power may be reliably restored, a Heathrow spokesperson told Reuters in an email, and added they expect significant disruption over the coming days.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eurocontrol, which manages air traffic control operations across Europe, said on its operations website that no arrivals were being allowed at Heathrow due to the power outage and there were diversion plans in place for flights.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to flight tracking website FlightRadar24, some diversions to other airports were already occurring, with Qantas Airways sending its flight from Perth to Paris and a United Airlines New York flight heading to Shannon, Ireland.
  <br>
  <br>
  A United Airlines flight from San Francisco was due to land in Washington, DC rather than London.
  <br>
  <br>
  Heathrow was the world's second-busiest international airport in 2024 behind Dubai, according to travel data firm OAG.
  <br>
  <br>
  The London Fire Brigade said its crews were tackling the fire in Hayes in west London and had evacuated around 150 people from the area as a precaution. (Reuters)

    N Korea tests new anti-aircraft system

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 North Korea test-fired its latest anti-aircraft missile system in a drill watched by leader Kim Jong-un, state media reported on Friday, as the nuclear-armed state lashed out at US-South Korea joint drills.
 <br>
  <br>
  The launch proved the system's "combat fast response," the Korean Central News Agency said, and came a day after South Korea wrapped up a major annual joint military exercise with the United States, known as Freedom Shield.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kim praised the latest anti-aircraft system, saying North Korea's army would be "equipped with another major defence weapon system with laudable combat performance," the news agency wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  It did not specify where the test took place.
  <br>
  <br>
  Seoul said last week the North fired "multiple unidentified ballistic missiles" after it began the joint drills involving US soldiers stationed in South Korea.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a separate statement on Thursday, an official for the North's defence ministry denounced the military exercise as "no more than a rehearsal of war of aggression."
  <br>
  <br>
  Pyongyang also carried out a test-launch of strategic cruise missiles in the Yellow Sea in late February, which it said showed off "counterattack capabilities."
  <br>
  <br>
  The most recent Freedom Shield exercise featured a collaborative drill focused on countering weapons of mass destruction, specifically targeting nuclear, chemical, biological, and radioactive threats.
  <br>
  <br>
  Relations between Pyongyang and Seoul have been at one of their lowest points in years, with the North launching a flurry of ballistic missiles last year in violation of UN sanctions.
  <br>
  <br>
  South Korean and Western intelligence agencies have said that more than 10,000 soldiers from the reclusive North were sent to Russia last year to help it fight a shock Ukrainian offensive into the Kursk border region.
  <br>
  <br>
  Seoul's spy agency said last month that the North has sent more soldiers to Russia and re-deployed several to the frontline in Kursk.
  <br>
  <br>
  A report by Seoul's defence ministry said the North was "continuing to provide weapons, ammunition and other military support to Russia following its troop deployment in the Ukraine war". (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Third seed Coco Gauff crushed fellow American Sofia Kenin 6-0 6-0 at the Miami Open, the former U.S. Open champion producing a flawless display to reach the third round.
 <br>
  <br>
  Gauff, aiming to win her maiden Miami title, won 84 percent of her first-serve points, saved the one break point she faced and converted six of her nine break points in the 47-minute match.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I was definitely playing well today, and maybe she wasn't playing her peak great tennis," Gauff said on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I don't think anyone who is playing their best tennis will have that scoreline today, so I'm not going to sit here and say she played her best tennis."
  <br>
  <br>
  Up next for Gauff, who was eliminated in the round of 16 at Indian Wells last week, will be Ashlyn Krueger who stunned seventh seed Elena Rybakina 6-4 2-6 6-4 for the first top-10 win of her career.
  <br>
  <br>
  Top seed and two-times Grand Slam champion Aryna Sabalenka, playing her first match since losing to Mirra Andreeva in the Indian Wells final, broke Bulgarian Viktoriya Tomova six times en route to a 6-3 6-0 win.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sabalenka will face qualifier Elena-Gabriela Ruse in the third round after the Bulgarian advanced with a 6-4 6-4 victory over Polish 29th seed Magdalena Frech.
  <br>
  <br>
  Italy's Jasmine Paolini and Olympic champion Zheng Qinwen also advanced, and Canada's Leylah Fernandez beat American Alycia Parks 7-6(1) 6-3.
  <br>
  <br>
  Naomi Osaka beat 24th seed Liudmila Samsonova 6-2 6-4.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the men's side, Reilly Opelka earned his first ATP Masters 1000 win since 2022 with a 6-3 7-6(4) triumph over American wild card Christopher Eubanks and will face Indian Wells finalist Holger Rune in the second round.
  <br>
  <br>
  China's Bu Yunchaokete beat Britain's Cameron Norrie 6-4 6-2 without facing a break point and qualifiers Jacob Fearnley and Thiago Agustin Tirante also advanced.
  <br>
  <br>
  Former finalist Kei Nishikori withdrew from his Miami opener after reaching the semi-finals of an ATP Challenger Tour event last week.
  <br>
  <br>
  "My body has not recovered enough from the matches last week. I will now go home and get ready for the clay court season," Nishikori said. (Reuters)

<img alt="McLaren's Lando Norris arrives in Shanghai atop the drivers’ standings for the first time. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796732_1_20250321100549.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 McLaren’s dominance, Lewis Hamilton’s bid to bounce back after a disappointing debut for Ferrari, and the passing of Eddie Jordan have generated headlines as Formula 1 prepares for its first "Sprint weekend" of the season at the Chinese Grand Prix on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lando Norris arrived in Shanghai on top of the drivers’ standings for the first time following his win at the season-opening Australian Grand Prix last Sunday, but it was his qualifying pace for McLaren – and not just holding off Red Bull’s Max Verstappen – that had his rivals on edge ahead of practice.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mercedes driver George Russell went so far as to say McLaren could win every race this season, describing its raw pace advantage as “bigger than Red Bull has ever had”.
  <br>
  <br>
  But, while Norris' teammate Oscar Piastri strongly refuted the claim — stating the form would change between rounds – the rest of the paddock wasn’t so sure.
  <br>
  <br>
  “They're definitely ahead,” Ferrari’s Charles Leclerc said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The gap in qualifying, the gap that there was in Australia is more or less what there is."
  <br>
  <br>
  “I think we are around Mercedes and Red Bull in terms of lap times if we put everything together," Leclerc said, "so there’s still a big chunk to get McLaren then.”
  <br>
  <br>
  For seven-time world champion Hamilton, meanwhile, China is a chance for a reset after a difficult Ferrari debut at Melbourne’s Albert Park last weekend, where he qualified eighth, briefly took the lead, but couldn’t hold onto it because of the team's tire strategy.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the 40-year-old, who is F1's most successful driver with a record 105 GP wins and 104 pole positions, says he still needs more time to bring the full force of his experience to his new team.
  <br>
  <br>
  “As I get more comfortable and more knowledgeable about the car, I can start making more decisions,” Hamilton said of his preferred set up. “I’m having those discussions, and I’m going to lean a little bit more with adding my experience hopefully a bit more in it.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamilton is hopeful that the Australian GP was an outlier for him and for Ferrari.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I hope so,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I think our car looked pretty decent in Australia and even on Saturday morning. So, I think it’s a bit of a one-off.” (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The head of Shin Bet, Israel's domestic intelligence agency, was sacked on Friday, days after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he no longer trusts him, and fallout from a report on the October 7, 2023, Hamas attack.
 <br>
  <br>
  "The government unanimously approved Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's proposal to end ISA Director Ronen Bar's term of office," a statement said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He will leave his post when his successor is appointed or by April 10 at the latest.
  <br>
  <br>
  Netanyahu on Sunday cited an "ongoing lack of trust" as the reason for moving to dismiss Bar, who joined the agency in 1993.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bar, meant to end his tenure next year, was appointed Shin Bet chief in October 2021 by the previous Israeli government that briefly forced Netanyahu from power between June 2021 and December 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  His relations with Netanyahu were strained even before the unprecedented October Hamas attack which sparked the war in Gaza, notably over proposed judicial reforms that had split the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  Relations worsened after the March 4 release of the internal Shin Bet report on the Hamas attack.
  <br>
  <br>
  It acknowledged the agency's own failure in preventing the attack, but also said "a policy of quiet had enabled Hamas to undergo massive military buildup".
  <br>
  <br>
  Bar had already hinted that he would resign before the end of his term, taking responsibility for his agency's failure to prevent the attack.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bar's dismissal provoked the anger of the opposition and led to demonstrations accusing Netanyahu of threatening democracy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Several thousand people braved bad weather late on Thursday to demonstrate outside Netanyahu's private residence in Jerusalem and then the Israeli parliament, where ministers were meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a letter made public on Thursday, Bar said Netanyahu's arguments were "general, unsubstantiated accusations that seem to hide the motivations behind the decision to terminate [his] duties".
  <br>
  <br>
  He wrote the real motives were based on "personal interest" and intended to "prevent investigations into the events leading up to October 7 and other serious matters" being looked at by the Shin Bet.
  <br>
  <br>
  He referred to the "complex, wide-ranging and highly sensitive investigation" involving people close to Netanyahu who allegedly received money from Qatar, a case dubbed "Qatargate" by the media.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bar's dismissal comes after the Israeli army launched a series of massive and deadly bombardments on the Gaza Strip on Tuesday, following a two-month truce and "targeted" ground operations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Netanyahu said the operations were intended to put pressure on Hamas to release the 58 hostages remaining in the territory.
  <br>
  <br>
  In rare criticism of Netanyahu, Israeli President Isaac Herzog said on Thursday that he was worried the resumption of strikes in a time of crisis could undermine "national resilience." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China suffered a narrow 1-0 defeat to Saudi Arabia in a Fifa 2026 World Cup qualifying match on Thursday, leaving it struggling at the bottom of Group C in the Asian zone.
 <br>
  <br>
  The decisive moment came five minutes into the second half when Saudi midfielder Salem Al-Dawsari scored from close range, capitalising on a rebound after Chinese goalkeeper Wang Dalei blocked an initial shot.
  <br>
  <br>
  China's task became even more challenging just before the break when Lin Liangming was shown a red card for a reckless kick to the face of Saudi defender Hassan Kadish.
  <br>
  <br>
  The incident resulted in a lengthy stoppage as Kadish received treatment before being carried off the field on a stretcher.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite dominating possession, the hosts were unable to convert their chances, with a first-half goal by Faisel Al-Ghamdi ruled out by video footage for handball, further compounding their frustrations.
  <br>
  <br>
  After seven matches, China remains at the bottom of Group C with just six points.
  <br>
  <br>
  They will next take on Australia at home on Tuesday and will look to turn their fortunes around. (Xinhua)

    'Coalition of willing' to meet next week on Ukraine

<img alt="French President Emmanuel Macron announced the new meeting after a European Union summit in Brussels. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796727_1_20250321094059.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 French President Emmanuel Macron said leaders of the coalition backing Ukraine would meet again next week, hoping to finalise plans to secure a potential truce in the war with Russia.
 <br>
  <br>
  The huddle in Paris with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky will be the latest in a series of high-stakes gatherings and will come after Kyiv and Moscow hold talks in Saudi Arabia with the United States on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Macron's announcement on Thursday came after London played host to the latest discussions of military top brass from the so-called "coalition of the willing" around Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said plans on policing a possible ceasefire were "coming together" as US President Donald Trump forges ahead with Russia on ending its war on Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  Macron - who along with Starmer has said he is willing to deploy troops to Ukraine - said the meeting next Thursday will be a chance to "fine-tune" work on ensuring any truce is durable.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Zelensky told an EU summit that "nothing had changed" as Moscow has kept up bombardments despite agreeing with Trump to halt strikes on Ukraine's energy system.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zelensky said Russian President Vladimir Putin must "stop making unnecessary demands that only prolong the war", calling on the EU to ramp up arms deliveries and keep sanctions in force.
  <br>
  <br>
  EU leaders vowed in a joint declaration, which was agreed without the support of Russia-friendly Hungary, to step up military support despite Moscow's demands for foreign support to stop.
  <br>
  <br>
  But they stopped short of endorsing a request from Zelensky to give Kyiv US$5.4 billion for artillery shells, in the face of opposition from France and Italy.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Norway, Zelensky said Ukrainian and US officials would meet in Saudi Arabia on Monday to build on US-led efforts to secure an end to the war with Russian, now grinding into its fourth year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Kremlin had earlier confirmed Russian officials would also hold talks with the US side in Saudi Arabia on the same day.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zelensky and Putin both held talks with Trump this week, and have indicated they are prepared to halt attacks on energy infrastructure for 30 days. (AFP)

    World's glacier mass shrank again in 2024, says UN

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 All 19 of the world's glacier regions experienced a net loss of mass in 2024 for the third consecutive year, the United Nations said on Friday, warning that saving the planet's glaciers was now a matter of "survival".
 <br>
  <br>
  Five of the last six years have seen the most rapid glacier retreat on record, the UN's World Meteorological Organization weather, climate and water agency said, on the inaugural World Day for Glaciers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Preservation of glaciers is not just an environmental, economic and societal necessity: it's a matter of survival," said WMO chief Celeste Saulo.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beyond the continental ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica, more than 275,000 glaciers worldwide cover approximately 700,000 square kilometres, said the WMO.
  <br>
  <br>
  But they are rapidly shrinking due to climate change.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The 2024 hydrological year marked the third year in a row in which all 19 glacier regions experienced a net mass loss," the WMO added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Together, they lost 450 billion tonnes of mass, the agency said, citing new data from the Swiss-based World Glacier Monitoring Service (WGMS).
  <br>
  <br>
  It was the fourth worst year on record, with the worst being in 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  At current rates of melting, many glaciers in western Canada and the United States, Scandinavia, central Europe, the Caucasus, and New Zealand "will not survive the 21st century", said the WMO.
  <br>
  <br>
  The agency said that together with ice sheets, glaciers store around 70 percent of the world's freshwater resources, with high mountain regions acting like the world's water towers.
  <br>
  <br>
  If they disappear, that would threaten water supplies for millions of people downstream. (AFP)

<img alt="Foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning urged the US not to impose discriminatory restrictive measures on Chinese students. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796721_1_20250321092239.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Beijing on Thursday demanded protections for Chinese students in the US after a congressional panel asked six American universities to hand over a large amount of detailed information on their students, citing national security concerns.
 <br>
  <br>
  A letter sent to the universities, including Stanford and Carnegie Mellon, alleged that the Chinese government was embedding researchers in top American institutions to gain direct access to sensitive technologies.
  <br>
  <br>
  In response, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said Chinese students account for about one-quarter of all international students in the US and that their activities have promoted “the economic prosperity and technological development of the US.”
  <br>
  <br>
  “This is in the interest of both parties," Mao told reporters at a daily briefing. "We urge the US to stop overstretching the concept of national security, effectively protect the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese students, and not impose discriminatory restrictive measures on Chinese students.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Her remarks came a day after John Moolenaar, chairman of the House Select Committee on the Strategic Competition Between the United States and the Chinese Communist Party, sent a letter to six colleges requesting information on Chinese students enrolled in advanced science and technology programs.
  <br>
  <br>
  The colleges named in Moolenaar's letter were Carnegie Mellon University, Purdue University, Stanford University, the University of Illinois, the University of Maryland, and the University of Southern California.
  <br>
  <br>
  He described America’s student visa system as a Trojan horse for Beijing, providing unrestricted access to the country's top research institutions and posing a direct threat to national security.
  <br>
  <br>
  The letter requested information including the Chinese students' sources of funding, the types of research they're involved in, what schools they previously attended, and “a country-by-country breakdown of applicants, admittances, and enrolments at your university.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Last week, a Republican lawmaker introduced a bill seeking to ban Chinese students from studying in US schools. (AP)

    Trump moves to shut down Department of Education

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump on Thursday signed an executive order aimed at shutting down the Department of Education, a decades-old goal of the American right, which wants individual states to run schools free from the influence of federal government.
 <br>
  <br>
  Surrounded by schoolchildren sitting at desks set up in the East Room of the White House, Trump smiled as held up the order after signing it.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said the order would "begin eliminating the federal Department of Education once and for all."
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're going to shut it down and shut it down as quickly as possible. It's doing us no good," Trump said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're going to return education back to the states where it belongs."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Education Department, created in 1979, cannot be shuttered without the approval of Congress, but Trump's order will likely have the power to starve it of funds and staff.
  <br>
  <br>
  The move is one of the most drastic steps yet in the brutal overhaul of the government that Trump is carrying out with the help of tech tycoon Elon Musk and his Department for Government Efficiency (DOGE).
  <br>
  <br>
  Democrats and educators have slammed the move.
  <br>
  <br>
  The top Democrat in the Senate, Chuck Schumer, called it a "tyrannical power grab" and "one of the most destructive and devastating steps Donald Trump has ever taken."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has cast the move as necessary to save money and improve educational standards in the United States, saying they are lagging behind those in Europe and China.
  <br>
  <br>
  But education has been a battleground for decades in America's culture wars, and Republicans have long wanted to remove control of it from the federal government. (AFP)

    Perisic stars as Croatia stun France in Nations League

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ivan Perisic scored one goal and made another as Croatia beat France 2-0 to seize the upper hand in the first leg of their Uefa Nations League quarter-final tie.
 <br>
  <br>
  Perisic crossed for Ante Budimir to head in the opener at the Stadion Poljud in Split after the home side had squandered an early penalty.
  <br>
  <br>
  With France out of sorts, Perisic made it 2-0 before the break and a Croatia side captained by Luka Modric saw out the victory to take to Paris for the return match on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was not a good night for France as captain Kylian Mbappe made his comeback having not featured in either of the last two international windows, in October and November.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mbappe did have chances, notably seeing a deflected second-half shot from Ousmane Dembele's cutback kept out by a fine Dominik Livakovic save.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Real Madrid superstar has now failed to find the net in his last six appearances for his country, since scoring a penalty in a 1-1 draw with Poland at Euro 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  Les Bleus will now have to find a way of overturning the deficit at the Stade de France on Sunday, otherwise Croatia will be heading to the final four of the Nations League.
  <br>
  <br>
  The semi-finals and final will take place in June and will be hosted by either Italy or Germany, depending on which of those sides emerges victorious from their last-eight encounter.

  France won the Nations League in 2021 but suffered a first ever defeat against Croatia in the group stage of the following year's edition.
  <br>
  <br>
  This latest repeat of the 2018 World Cup final, won 4-2 by the French in Moscow, saw Croatia win a spot-kick just five minutes in.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool centre-back Ibrahima Konate was penalised for a blatant handball inside the area, but Mike Maignan saved Andrej Kramaric's penalty after a long delay due to the goalkeeper having a laser pen shone in his eyes.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, Croatia did get the breakthrough on 26 minutes as Budimir, who has 15 goals in La Liga this season for Osasuna, got in front of William Saliba to connect with a Perisic cross from the left.
  <br>
  <br>
  Budimir's header was blocked by Maignan, but the ball still spun into the net in cruel fashion for the goalkeeper.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was 2-0 in first-half stoppage time as Saliba blocked a shot by Martin Baturina, only for the ball to fall for PSV Eindhoven veteran Perisic to fire in.
  <br>
  <br>
  France made changes, sending on Dayot Upamecano for Konate at the restart and later bringing on Bradley Barcola for Randal Kolo Muani and Michael Olise for Dembele.
  <br>
  <br>
  The latter spent more time on the right flank after the break having previously been deployed more centrally.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, they could not get a goal back and now face a daunting task in trying to recover the tie. (AFP)

 US stocks closed lower on Thursday, as a Fed-related rally lost steam, and traders looked ahead to the prospect of additional tariffs next month.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down less than 0.1 percent at 41,953.
  <br>
  <br>
  The broad-based S&P 500 fell 0.2 percent to 5,662, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index slipped 0.3 percent to close at 17,691.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We started off in the red, went solidly into the green, only to go back into the red, then back into the green and now we're kind of flatlining," CFRA's Sam Stovall told AFP, shortly before markets slipped further into the red.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think investors are basically going to be treading water until April 2," he added, referring to the date at which US President Donald Trump has said he plans to impose reciprocal tariffs on US trading partners.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among individual stocks, professional firm Accenture's shares slumped 6.7 percent after announcing that the Trump administration's efficiency drive had begun affecting its business.
  <br>
  <br>
  The business consulting firm said the cost-cutting drive, led by billionaire Trump ally Elon Musk, had hit its federal services business. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The NBA's Boston Celtics are being sold to the head of a California private equity firm for US$6.1 billion, a record price for a US sports franchise, according to reports by The Boston Globe.
 <br>
  <br>
  The newspaper, citing a league source, said the Celtics ownership had agreed to sell the iconic team to William Chisholm, managing director and co-founder of Symphony Technology Group.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said the US$6.1 billion purchase price is the highest ever offered for a North American sports team, surpassing the US$6.05 billion paid for the NFL's Washington Commanders in 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  The sale of the Celtics, the current NBA champions, still requires the approval of the NBA Board of Governors.
  <br>
  <br>
  The team is one of the most storied in the league's history, with a record 18 championships.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chisholm, a Massachusetts native, is a longtime fan of the team, according to the Globe.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said the new ownership group also includes current Celtics co-owner Robert Hale; Bruce Beal Jr., president of Related Companies; and the global investment firm, Sixth Street.
  <br>
  <br>
  The newspaper said three other buyers had been under consideration: Steve Pagliuca, a Celtics co-owner; Stan Middleman, a co-owner of MLB's Philadelphia Phillies; and The Friedkin Group.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Grousbeck family and Pagliuca purchased the Celtics for US$360 million in 2002.
  <br>
  <br>
  Three NBA teams were sold in 2023 – the Phoenix Suns for US$4 billion, the Milwaukee Bucks for US$3.5 billion and the Dallas Mavericks for US$3.5 billion. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Tesla was removed from the Vancouver International Auto Show in Canada because of safety concerns, the event organisers said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  "The Vancouver International Auto Show has removed Tesla as a participant in this week's event, after the automaker was provided multiple opportunities to voluntarily withdraw," Eric Nicholl, executive director for the auto show said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tesla did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
  <br>
  <br>
  The safety concerns come as protesters across the United States stage demonstrations targeting Tesla's CEO Elon Musk, who is spearheading the Department of Government Efficiency's move to shrink the federal government.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Vancouver Auto Show's primary concern is the safety of attendees, exhibitors, and staff," Nicholl said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Toronto on Monday stopped providing financial incentives for Tesla vehicles purchased as taxis or ride shares due to escalating trade tensions between Canada and the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  The city's mayor said that the decision was meant to target Musk, a close adviser to the US president. Trump has called for Canada's annexation and imposed tariffs on Canadian products, angering Canadians. (Reuters)
