<div class="itemFullText">
 The Republican Party has wrested control of the US Senate from the Democrats, with at least 51 seats in the 100-member upper house of Congress, US networks projected early on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  It gives the GOP a major power centre in Washington and a lead role in confirming the next president’s cabinet, as well as any Supreme Court justice if there is a vacancy.
  <br>
  <br>
  The last time the Republicans had a majority in the Senate was January 2021.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US Capitol is divided into the House of Representatives - where all 435 seats are up for grabs - and a 100-member Senate, which has 34 seats at stake this year. Congressional elections run alongside the White House race.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jim Justice, the sitting Republican governor of West Virginia, delighted Republicans early in the night when he emerged as an easy victor in the Senate race to replace retiring moderate Joe Manchin, an independent who voted with the Democrats.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ohio then moved into the Republican column after longstanding Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown was defeated by Bernie Moreno, a Trump-endorsed businessman and the son of a one-time high-ranking Colombian government official.
  <br>
  <br>
  Democrats were looking to mitigate losses with gains in Texas and Florida, but conceded both as the sitting Republicans notched easy wins.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nonpartisan political finance monitor OpenSecrets reports that US$10 billion has been spent on candidates for Congress this cycle - a touch less than in 2020 but almost twice as much as the US$5.5 billion price tag for the 2024 White House race. (Agencies)

    Hong Kong watches as America decides

<img alt="The American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong hosts a watch party, anticipating results of the US elections. Photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1777771_1_20241106115206.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Many people in Hong Kong were keeping a close watch on the unfolding results of the hotly contested US elections on Wednesday, with opinions here as divided as those in the United States.
 <br>
  <br>
  Dozens of people attended a watch party organised by the American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  One of them, Chris Growney, who works in the financial services sector, thinks a win for Republican candidate Donald Trump would also be a victory for American businesses.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The businesses that are in the States would be treated with better tax efficiency, have better opportunities to create new jobs,” he said. “And ideally, if there are potentially higher tariffs on imports then that could potentially help American businesses."
  <br>
  <br>
  But Diana Parusheva-Lowery, who works in the same sector, believes a Trump victory could mean more restrictions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If there are more tariffs, if there are more investment restrictions, this is going to affect trade flow, investment flow and ultimately capital flow," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But equally, if Kamala Harris wins, she also has her policies towards China, which will also have an effect to which might be similar, might be different."
  <br>
  <br>
  There were also a number of people who still don’t have a preference either for Trump or Democratic candidate Kamala Harris, including businessman Mark Wise.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The US and Chinese economies are intertwined... One candidate is a bit more protectionist in their approach, and another is more in line with traditional, open and free trade between the countries. That could a material difference in the economic situation for both countries, depending on the outcome," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But I'd say that having an election that takes longer than a day is going to be something that no one wants."
  <br>
  <br>
  Eden Woon, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong, said the result will determine the future development of Sino-US ties, which will also have a direct impact on the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It is very important for Hong Kong because Hong Kong has a very close trade relationship with the United States. Historically, it has a very good connection with the United States' civil society and here many people, many businesses have an interest in the United States. So we are also watching to see what happens in this election,” Woon told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other watch parties were being held elsewhere in the territory, including at a pub in Central.
  <br>
  <br>
  Raj, a British shipping worker in Hong Kong, said he's not surprised to see Trump leading early but believed the Democrats will take over eventually.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Republicans always take an early lead... Typically whenever you watch an election like this it always looks like the Republicans are winning, but it's going to be very close, so I think at the end, we're going to see the Democrats coming forward," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I want to follow the results of this election because I think it has an impact geopolitically all over the world.”
  <br>
  <br>
  For James Lockett, chairman of Democrats Abroad and organiser of the event, the early results came as a surprise.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Compared to 2020, by this time, Joe Biden had a big lead because of early voting,” he noted. "My main concern is gun control, it's very important, and also women's rights are very important. Diversity in the workplace is very important to me."
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, a group of university students was paying attention to the elections on the University of Hong Kong campus on Wednesday morning.
  <br>
  <br>
  Peter Lee, an HKU undergraduate, told RTHK that he was at the event to get to know what others thought about the race.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think in here you can [listen] to different voices and you will listen to different people with different opinion or predictions," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think it will be better for me to come here to interact with people rather than just staying at home, just thinking by myself, because election somehow you can predict it, but maybe the real outcome is different from your predictions."
  <br>
  <br>
  Another student, Zhang Yiqiu, said she backs Harris because of her support for women's reproductive rights.
  <br>
  <br>
  She also described the winner-take-all electoral system in the US as "absurd".
  <br>
  <br>
  "To me, it's not fair if someone gets more votes but still they are the losing party... From quite an idealistic point of view, it will be good to eradicate that and just by counting votes only based on the number."
  <br>
  <br>
  Zhang Jiarui, a master's student, said a Trump win would be a bad sign to China's exports.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Trump said they will bring manufacturing industry back to the United States which implies that they will implement some tariffs to China's exports."

    'Rainbow wall' at Choi Hung Estate must go: govt

    <![CDATA[<div>
<img alt="Rosanna Law said officials will study whether the rainbow wall can be restored at the redeveloped Choi Hung Estate. Image: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1777769_1_20241106112709.jpg&q=70">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Housing director Rosanna Law said an iconic rainbow wall of Choi Hung Estate will have to be demolished, but officials will seriously look at restoring the spot after redevelopment.
 <br>
  <br>
  Officials plan on moving the first batch of affected tenants to an estate in Kowloon City as early as four years from now, as an estimated 15 years will be needed to complete the phased renewal of the estate.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to RTHK, Law said the "rainbow" block of Tan Fung House and the sports courts next to it, which is above a multi-storey car park, would have to go.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If we say we retain the rainbow wall and the car park, not only will we have fewer flats in the redeveloped estate, but I think it would be rather difficult in terms of having enough space, to improve the traffic conditions nearby," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But we understand how the public loves this photo spot. Our team of architects will seriously think about ways of restoring this 'rainbow' at the new Choi Hung Estate."
  <br>
  <br>
  Law said authorities made the redevelopment announcement early, so that tenants can be psychologically prepared about having to move out and take part in the process.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said if they don't want to move to Kowloon City and stay nearby, officials will try to accommodate if there are suitable flats available.
  <br>
  <br>
  Law stressed that the second and third phase of the redevelopment - due to begin around 2035 - are still in a conceptual stage.
  <br>
  <br>
  She explained the new blocks were meant to be up to 50-storeys high and officials cannot conduct works such as exploring the ground's foundation until after tenants have moved out.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chief Executive John Lee also announced in his Policy Address last month plans to regulate sub-divided flats while requiring landlords to turn them into "basic housing units".
  <br>
  <br>
  Law said it is illegal for landlords to break existing rental contracts early and force out tenants in the name of renovating the flats and she said tenants can report this to the authorities.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In fact, the government has yet to set the standards [for basic housing units]. We haven't completed our public consultation and enact new laws. Do landlords have to rush to [renovate]?" the director of housing said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I appeal to the landlords, even if you're eager to make sure your flats comply with the new standards, you really should wait a little bit until we have promulgated the new standards. Otherwise you may waste your money."
  <br>
  <br>
  Law said around 40 percent of tenants currently living in the potentially affected sub-divided flats, or around 40,000 households, should be ineligible to apply for public housing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities, she said, will not conduct large-scale law enforcement in future unless officials are confident they can find re-settlements for affected residents.

    Gauff beats Swiatek, Sabalenka earns world number one

<img alt="Gauff during her match against Iga Swiatek of Poland. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1777756_1_20241106093625.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Coco Gauff posted a rare victory over Iga Swiatek to punch her ticket to the semi-finals of the WTA Finals in Riyadh on Tuesday, ensuring Aryna Sabalenka will finish the year as the world number one.
 <br>
  <br>
  Swiatek, the defending champion, was in a direct battle with Sabalenka for the top spot this week but needed a win over Gauff to keep her chances alive of leapfrogging her Belarusian rival.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gauff, 20, entered the contest having lost 11 of her 12 previous meetings with Swiatek, with the American's sole victory coming in Cincinnati last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  But she turned the tables on Swiatek on Tuesday, defeating the second seed 6-3, 6-4 to make it two straight-sets wins from two round-robin matches in Riyadh this week.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It feels great. I knew going into the match that despite our head-to-head I had a lot of confidence going in," said Gauff, who hit 11 double faults during the one-hour 48-minute showdown.
  <br>
  <br>
  With the exception of the opening game of the match, Gauff had break point opportunities in every Swiatek service game in the first set.
  <br>
  <br>
  The American third seed made her move in game seven, breaking for 4-3, and she closed out the set with a second break of serve, taking the lead in 49 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Swiatek needed six break points in a marathon third game of the second set to finally take down the Gauff serve but she couldn't consolidate her advantage.
  <br>
  <br>
  They traded breaks again, as Gauff's double-fault tally went up to double digits and Swiatek racked up the errors.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was Gauff who eventually steadied the ship, and wrapped up the victory on Swiatek's 47th unforced error of the match.
  <br>
  <br>
  Swiatek, a five-time major champion, admits her two-month break between the US Open and the WTA Finals and the fact she is playing her first tournament with her new coach Wim Fissette have made things "a bit more tricky and different than usual".
  <br>
  <br>
  "But I'll force myself to work even better in the next match," the Pole added. (AFP)

    AC Milan topple Champions League holders Real Madrid

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Champions League holders Real Madrid fell to a 3-1 home defeat by AC Milan on Tuesday in the group stage with striker Kylian Mbappé unable to find the net again.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 25-year-old France captain has scored once in his last six matches for Madrid across all competitions, including three losses for Los Blancos.
  <br>
  <br>
  Malick Thiaw headed the Italian side ahead before Vinicius Junior levelled from the penalty spot for the hosts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alvaro Morata struck against his former side to restore Milan's lead before the break and Tijjani Reijnders netted the third to secure Milan's victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  Madrid were unable to bounce back strongly from the 4-0 thrashing by Barcelona in late October, their last outing after Saturday's La Liga match at Valencia was postponed because of devastating floods in the east of Spain.
  <br>
  <br>
  Players from both sides wore t-shirts before the match reading "We are all Valencia" while in one stand a giant Valencia regional flag was unfurled for a minute's silence.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the 90 minutes that followed, Paulo Fonseca's Milan, seventh in Serie A, outclassed Madrid.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are going through a period when our opponents are punishing us a lot and we have to keep working so that this doesn't happen again," Madrid defender Lucas Vazquez told Movistar.
  <br>
  <br>
  Los Blancos have let in nine goals in their last three home matches.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have to be worried, the team's not giving a good account of itself," said Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The team is not compact, we have to be more compact, more organised, we've let in a lot of goals," he added. "We're not well organised on the pitch, and we have to work on that."
  <br>
  <br>
  Milan have won the competition seven times, behind only record 15-time champions Madrid, but have not reached a final since 2007, when Ancelotti led them to the trophy.
  <br>
  <br>
  This victory harked back to their glory days and Fonseca praised his team's bravery.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The players came here with courage, didn't have any fear – in the first half we created plenty, and in the second half we were on the back foot, but we fought together," said the Portuguese coach. "We definitely deserved to win."
  <br>
  <br>
  Ancelotti, who won the Champions League twice as a player and then twice as a coach with Milan, only made one change from the Clasico humiliation, bringing in Luka Modric for Eduardo Camavinga. (AFP)

  US networks, including NBC, have called the state of Pennsylvania for Donald Trump. That puts him on the verge of a decisive victory over Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election. Pennsylvania has a whopping 19 electoral votes.

  Fox News has declared Donald Trump the winner of the US presidential election, the sole network to make the call, after projecting he would win key battlegrounds Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. "Donald Trump elected as the next president of the United States," blared the front page of the Fox News website.

   Share prices and bond yields have surged as the Republican party gained control of the Senate and Trump was leading in the still incomplete vote counts from Tuesday’s election. The full results may not be known for days as officials count all the votes, but investors already were repositioning in anticipation of gains by the Republicans, who took control of the Senate for the first time in four years.

   Americans in multiple states also voted on the issue of abortion on Tuesday. Voters in Missouri cleared the way to undo one of the nation's most restrictive abortion bans in one of four victories for abortion rights advocates, while Florida defeated a similar constitutional amendment, leaving in place a law barring most abortions after the first six weeks of pregnancy. Abortion rights amendments also passed in Colorado and Maryland.
   <br>
   <br>
   The Missouri and Florida results represent firsts in the abortion landscape, which underwent a seismic shift in 2022 when the US Supreme Court overturned Roe v Wade, a ruling that ended a nationwide right to abortion.

   <br>
   RTHK's correspondent in San Francisco Mark Niu said that with the first two swing states going to Trump, Pennsylvania is a must-win for Harris.
   <br>
   <br>
   "Pennsylvania is the most important one with 19 electoral votes, the most of the battleground states. It has become vital that Harris win that state to have any chance at all."
   <br>
   <br>
   Niu noted Republicans are also doing well in congressional races and that there is a high chance that Trump and his party could "come away with a clean sweep", where Republicans control both bodies of Congress and the presidency.

   Kamala Harris' campaign says she will not address her supporters on election night. "You won't hear from the vice president tonight but you will hear from her tomorrow," Cedric Richmond, Harris campaign co-chair, told a watch party at Howard University in Washington.

    Trump has won the key battleground state of Georgia, US media projected, flipping a state that voted Democratic in 2020. CNN and NBC News made the call in the Republican former president's favour.
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>

    <br>
    The Associated Press is reporting that Trump is leading in the battleground state of Georgia by slightly under 120,000 votes with more than 90 percent of the estimated votes counted.
    <br>
    <br>
    Trump is en route to his watch party from Mar-a-Lago in Florida where he’s expected to speak tonight to his gathered supporters, while Harris is not planning to address the public during the night, according to a person familiar with the White House.
    <br>
    <br>
    All polls are closed in the US. According to AP, Trump is ahead with 230 electoral votes, while Harris has 210.

    RTHK's San Francisco correspondent, Mark Niu, says Trump has a commanding lead so far. The Associated Press shows Trump narrowly leading in the battleground state of Pennsylvania, which comes with the most electoral votes at 19. He said this was ironic, given that the state has the third largest Puerto Rican population in the US mainland, and that Trump called it a "floating island of garbage".
    <br>
    <br>
    "In exit polling, it appears that Trump is actually doing well among Latino voters," Niu said.

     Republicans have won control of the US Senate, picking up seats West Virginia and Ohio. And top House races are focused in New York and California, where Democrats are trying to claw back some of the 10 or so seats where Republicans have made surprising gains in recent years.

     US networks are projecting Trump will win North Carolina, the first of seven battleground states. CNN, NBC and ABC News all called the race in Trump's favour in the southeastern state, which he also won in the 2020 election.

      Harris has won California, taking its huge slate of 54 electoral votes, while Trump was projected to win in Idaho and Iowa, US networks said. Harris also won in the West Coast state of Oregon. So far, that gives Trump 211 electoral votes and Harris 153.
      <br>
      <br>
      RTHK's San Francisco correspondent Mark Niu said the race is still far from over and that the wins that have been projected so far were expected. He added that attention is on the key swing states, adding Harris' performance was not as strong as expected.
      <br>
      <br>
      "It's margins in places like Virginia, where Harris is barely winning, when she was expected to dominate that have caused great concern for Democrats."

       Republicans are also vying for control of the US House and Senate. While all eyes are on the White House race, hundreds of congressional elections will determine how much of the next president's agenda gets enacted.
       <br>
       <br>
       Republicans are nudging ahead in their mission to wrest control of the Senate from the Democrats. US media have reported that Republican Bernie Moreno, a onetime car dealer who was born in Colombia, flipped an additional Senate seat for his party, besting a Democratic incumbent who has held the post since 2007. Republicans need to net just two Senate seats to win a majority in the chamber.

       Trump has called into a Wisconsin radio station to say: “I’m watching these results. So far so good". Harris did phone interviews with radio stations in the battleground states, then visited Democratic National Committee headquarters in Washington carrying a box of Doritos – her go-to snack.
       <br>
       <br>
       The closeness of the race and the number of states in play raised the likelihood that, once again, a victor might not be known on election night. Trump said on Tuesday that he had no plans to tell his supporters to refrain from violence if Harris wins, because they “are not violent people”. Federal, state and local officials have expressed confidence in the integrity of the nation’s election systems. And both sides have armies of lawyers in anticipation of legal challenges on and after Election Day.

        "I think if there are more tariffs, if there are more investment restrictions, this is going to restrict trade flows, investment flows and ultimately capital flows. But equally, if Kamala Harris wins, she also has her policies towards China which also have an effect, might be similar, might be different, we hear a lot during this campaign, but what will ultimately materialise is anybody’s guess," she told RTHK.

         Trump and Harris are so far notching early wins in reliably Republican and Democratic states. Polls have closed in Pennsylvania, Georgia, Michigan, Arizona, Wisconsin and North Carolina, six of the seven closely fought battlegrounds expected to decide the election, but the results there were too early to call. But results from the other states are tumbling in with US media projecting wins for Trump in Louisiana and Mississippi. Harris meanwhile, has won the big prize state of Illinois.

            Here in Hong Kong, the American Chamber of Commerce (Amcham) has organised a watch party for people to see the live results coming in for the US elections.
            <br>
            <br>
            Chamber president Eden Woon says the result will determine how the relationship between China and the United States will move forward – which will have a direct impact on Hong Kong as well.
            <br>
            <br>
            “It is very important for Hong Kong because Hong Kong has a very close trade relationship with the United States. Historically, it has a very good connection with the United States’ civil society and here many people, many businesses have an interest in the United States. So we are also watching to see what happens in this election”, he said.

            Businessman Mark Wise is one of those at the party. He says while he does not have a personal preference between Trump and Harris, he just wants to see a decisive victory for a new leader that will take the country forward.

            US investigators are looking into apparent hoax bomb threats that were directed at polling locations in four battleground states - Georgia, Michigan, Arizona and Wisconsin as voting was underway.
            <br>
            <br>
            "None of the threats have been determined to be credible thus far," the FBI said in a statement, adding that election integrity was among the bureau's highest priorities.
            <br>
            <br>
            At least two polling sites targeted by the hoax bomb threats in Georgia were briefly evacuated.
            <br>
            <br>
            Georgia's secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, a Republican, blamed Russian interference for the Election Day bomb hoaxes.
            <br>
            <br>
            "They're up to mischief, it seems. They don't want us to have a smooth, fair and accurate election, and if they can get us to fight among ourselves, they can count that as a victory," Raffensperger told reporters.
            <br>
            <br>
            The Russian embassy in Washington said insinuations about Russian interference were "malicious slander."
            <br>
            <br>
            "We would like to emphasize that Russia has not interfered and does not interfere in the internal affairs of other countries, including the United States," the embassy said in a statement. "As President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly stressed, we respect the will of the American people." (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Novak Djokovic said on Tuesday he will not defend his ATP Finals title due to an "ongoing injury" which has ended the 24-time Grand Slam champion's season.
 <br>
  <br>
  Tennis icon Djokovic was one of four players still battling for one of three remaining places at the season-ending event in Turin, which kicks off on Sunday, but said on social media that he wouldn't be making a bid for a third straight Finals title.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I was really looking forward to being there, but due to ongoing injury I won't be playing next week," Djokovic said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Apologies to those who were planning to see me," the statement added. "Wishing all the players a great tournament. See you soon!"
  <br>
  <br>
  The 37-year-old Serb, currently ranked fifth in the world, sits sixth in "The Race", the ATP's annual rankings to determine the eight competitors at the Finals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jannik Sinner, Alexander Zverev, Carlos Alcaraz, Daniil Medvedev and Taylor Fritz had already qualified before Djokovic's announcement.
  <br>
  <br>
  His retirement from the tournament automatically opens up the final three places to Casper Ruud, Alex de Minaur and Andrey Rublev.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ruud and Rublev are playing in Metz, France this week, with De Minaur in action in Belgrade.
  <br>
  <br>
  Djokovic's withdrawal was not a surprise as he had already pulled out of the Paris Masters, effectively ending what has been a difficult season.
  <br>
  <br>
  He hasn't won a single ATP title in 2024, the first time that has happened since 2006, and has been shoved aside by young stars Sinner and Alcaraz at the top of the game.
  <br>
  <br>
  Djokovic did, however, win singles gold at the Paris Olympics, adding the final major honour which was missing from his record-breaking list of career achievements. (AFP)

    Amorim's Sporting stun Man City in Champions League
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<div>
<img alt="Amorim is celebrated by his players at the end of his final home game with Sporting. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1777733_1_20241106075002.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Viktor Gyokeres's hat-trick fired Sporting Lisbon to a stunning 4-1 rout of Manchester City in the Uefa Champions League as Ruben Amorim showed why Manchester United were so keen to lure him to Old Trafford.
 <br>
  <br>
  Sporting manager Amorim accepted United's offer to replace Erik ten Hag,  and will officially take charge of the troubled Premier League club on November 11.
  <br>
  <br>
  Regarded as one of Europe's brightest young managerial minds, the 39-year-old delivered a tantalising glimpse of his acumen as Sporting exposed injury-hit City's defensive weaknesses.
  <br>
  <br>
  Phil Foden put City ahead in the opening moments at the Jose Alvalade stadium, but the visitors wasted a string of chances to increase their lead and Sporting made them pay.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gyokeres equalised before half-time and Maximiliano Araujo bagged Sporting's second after the break before Gyokeres's penalty capped their incredible fightback with two penalties.
  <br>
  <br>
  Erling Haaland squandered a chance to give City a second half lifeline when his penalty hit the bar.
  <br>
  <br>
  Amorim said United fans might think "the new Alex Ferguson has arrived" if his team beat City.
  <br>
  <br>
  After the turbulent end to Ten Hag's reign – he was sacked in October with United languishing in the bottom half of the table – Amorim clearly faces a huge task to restore the club to the glory they enjoyed in the Ferguson era.
  <br>
  <br>
  Comparisons with United's legendary former boss should be shelved for now, but Sporting's spirited victory will have fans counting down the days until his arrival.
  <br>
  <br>
  Amorim, who led Sporting to two Portuguese titles in four years, is set to take charge of his first United game at Ipswich on November 24.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pep Guardiola will get his chance for revenge in Amorim's first Manchester derby at the Etihad Stadium on December 15.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Guardiola has plenty to work on before then as he looks for solutions to City's unexpected three-game losing streak.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We had a fantastic first half, now we are struggling to score. We create and concede when the opponents don't do much," Guardiola said. "At 2-1 down, many things can happen. Emotionally, we were not stable enough – and in this competition, you have to be stable."
  <br>
  <br>
  Premier League champions City suffered a first top-flight defeat of the season against Bournemouth on Saturday, three days after losing to Tottenham in the League Cup.
  <br>
  <br>
  Amid the absences of Rodri, Jack Grealish, Ruben Dias, John Stones and Oscar Bobb, City have lost their momentum in dramatic fashion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Their first defeat in four games in this season's Champions League shouldn't be fatal to their European ambitions, but Guardiola will be desperate for a positive reaction at Brighton on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  City's heaviest defeat since 2020 meant, for only the second time in the Guardiola era, they had suffered three consecutive losses in a single season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sporting, meanwhile, have 10 points from four Champions League games as Amorim leaves them in rude health. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks rose on Tuesday, bouncing back from the prior session's declines in a benign session held as voters went to the polls in the US presidential election.
 <br>
  <br>
  Forecasters have for weeks pointed to a neck-and-neck contest between Vice President Kamala Harris and former president Donald Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  "What the market is saying is that the economy has continued to hold up even in the face of all this uncertainty that we have," said Victoria Fernandez, chief market strategist at Crossmark Global Investments, who pointed to a host of potentially market-moving policy areas affected by the results.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones finished up 1.0 percent at 42,221.
  <br>
  <br>
  The S&P 500 gained 1.2 percent to 5,782, while the Nasdaq jumped 1.4 percent to 18,439.
  <br>
  <br>
  All 11 sectors of the S&P 500 pushed higher, led by consumer discretionary and industrial stocks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Large technology equities also advanced, including Netflix, which won 1.1 percent despite a raid of the company's offices in Paris and Amsterdam on Tuesday as part of a tax fraud probe, according to a judicial source.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Boeing dropped 2.6 percent as a machinist union voted to accept the company's latest contract offer, ending a more than seven week strike that closed two assembly plants in the Seattle area. The new contract includes a 38 percent wage hike. (AFP)

 Queen Camilla, wife of the Britain's King Charles, has been forced to pull out of her planned engagements this week after suffering a chest infection, Buckingham Palace said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Camilla, 77, is resting at home while she recovers but no further details of her illness have been given, as is usual with royal medical issues.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Her Majesty The Queen is currently unwell with a chest infection, for which her doctors have advised a short period of rest," a palace spokesperson said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With great regret, Her Majesty has therefore had to withdraw from her engagements for this week, but she very much hopes to be recovered in time to attend this weekend’s Remembrance events as normal." (Reuters)

    WHO: Over 100 patients in Gaza to be evacuated

<img alt="The medical evacuees will be transported to the Kerem Shalom crossing on Wednesday. File photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1777697_1_20241105210917.jpg&q=30">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The World Health Organization (WHO) said on Tuesday a large-scale medical evacuation was planned from Gaza this week, with more than 100 seriously ill and injured patients due to leave the war-ravaged territory.
 <br>
  <br>
  The WHO said that, alongside its partners, it would evacuate as many as 113 patients on Wednesday, with most going to the United Arab Emirates and some heading to Romania for specialised care.
  <br>
  <br>
  If it goes ahead, it would be the largest evacuation from Gaza since October 2023, according to data from the UN health agency.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rik Peeperkorn, the WHO's representative in the Palestinian territories, said he was hopeful the evacuation would go ahead.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said efforts were currently under way to bring patients from various hospitals across the Gaza Strip to the Gaza European Hospital near Khan Yunis in the south.
  <br>
  <br>
  They will be transported to the Kerem Shalom crossing on early Wednesday and then flown on to the UAE and Romania, Peeperkorn told reporters in Geneva, via video link from Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  Those on the list figure among up to 14,000 people currently waiting in Gaza to be evacuated out of the territory for medical reasons.
  <br>
  <br>
  Around half of them have sustained trauma injuries in the war and the others are suffering from serious illnesses such as cancer, he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since the war in Gaza began following Hamas' deadly October 7, 2023 attack inside Israel, fewer than 5,000 people have been granted medical evacuations out of the territory.
  <br>
  <br>
  Only 282 have meanwhile been able to leave since Israel shuttered Gaza's main Rafah border crossing in early May, Peeperkorn said, adding that around a third of them had been children.
  <br>
  <br>
  Peeperkorn lamented the "ad hoc" access to desperately-needed medical evacuations from Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  "What we need is regular access... which would be properly supported, facilitated and not made unnecessarily dangerous," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We need medical corridors, and the first medical corridor we basically request to be restored is the traditional referral pathway from Gaza to East Jerusalem and the West Bank, and... a second medical corridor to Egypt should be open again, and maybe to Jordan."
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamas's October 7 attack resulted in the deaths of 1,206 people, mostly civilians, according to a tally of Israeli official figures.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel's retaliatory campaign has killed 43,391 people in Gaza, most of them civilians, according to Gaza health ministry figures which the United Nations considers to be reliable. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Labour Department (LD) said it was investigating a fatal industrial incident in Kowloon City in which a worker fell to his death while dismantling scaffolding at a building.
 <br>
  <br>
  The incident happened on Tuesday afternoon, when the man fell onto the canopy on the first floor while dismantling a bamboo scaffold at the external wall of the building on Ma Tau Kok Road.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was declared dead in hospital.
  <br>
  <br>
  The department said it issued suspension notices to the contractors involved and stopped all scaffolding work.

  <br>
  "The contractors cannot resume the work until the LD is satisfied that measures to abate the relevant risks have been taken," it wrote in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The department added that it will try to find out what caused the incident and who might be responsible, and take legal actions if there is any violation of work safety legislation.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong Construction Industry Employees General Union expressed regret over the tragedy.
  <br>
  <br>
  It urged employers to provide workers with safety equipment such as full-body safety harness and lifelines to prevent similar cases.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Tourism minister Kevin Yeung said on Tuesday that Hong Kong recorded nearly a million arrivals of non-mainland visitors last month, the most so far this year for a single month.
 <br>
  <br>
  He said total visitor arrivals in October topped 4 million, with non-mainland tourists exceeding 950,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  For the first 10 months of the year, tourist arrivals reached 36.6 million, a 37 percent jump from the same period last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a Legco panel meeting, lawmakers discussed the idea of promoting horse-racing tourism, which was included by Chief Executive John Lee in his Policy Address.
  <br>
  <br>
  Third Side councillor Tik Chi-yuen expressed concerns that the move could encourage gambling, especially among the younger generation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeung said the aim is not to encourage people to gamble.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our target is the tourists... Horse-racing is an attractive event in their eyes," the secretary for culture, sports and tourism said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He described the SAR as the only place in the region that can host world-class, distinguished races.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the Kai Tak Sports Park which is set to come into use in the first quarter of 2025, Election Committee councillor Chan Siu-hung asked whether officials can ensure that shops and facilities near the park will enjoy a high usage rate during days when mega events are not being held.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan noted the nearby cruise terminal could go very quiet at times.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeung said you can't compare the two. He said the sports park is a public facility, and individuals and groups can book and use the facilities there on non-game days.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Election Day voting began in the United States on Tuesday after an extraordinary, and for many unnerving, presidential race that will either make Kamala Harris the first woman president in the country's history or hand Donald Trump a comeback that sends shockwaves around the world.
 <br>
  <br>
  As the first polling stations opened, Democratic vice president Harris, 60, and Republican former president Trump, 78, were dead-even in the tightest and most volatile White House contest of modern times.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bitter rivals spent their final day of the campaign frenetically working to get their supporters out to the polls and trying to win over any last undecided voters in the swing states expected to decide the outcome.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite a series of head-spinning twists in the campaign – from Harris's dramatic entrance when President Joe Biden dropped out in July, to Trump riding out two assassination attempts and a criminal conviction – nothing has broken the deadlock in the opinion polls.
  <br>
  <br>
  Polling stations opened from 6.00am in states including Virginia, North Carolina and New York. Tens of millions of voters are expected to cast their ballots, on top of the more than 82 million people who have already voted early in the preceding weeks.
  <br>
  <br>
  A final outcome may not be known for several days if the results are as close as the polls suggest, adding to the tension in a deeply divided nation.
  <br>
  <br>
  And there are fears of turmoil and even violence if Trump loses, and then contests the result as he did in 2020, with barriers erected around the White House and businesses boarded up in Washington.
  <br>
  <br>
  The world is anxiously watching, as the outcome will have major implications for conflicts in the Middle East, for Russia's war in Ukraine, and for tackling climate change which Trump calls a hoax.
  <br>
  <br>
  Harris and Trump are effectively tied in the seven main swing states: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the eve of the vote, Harris went all-in on the must-win state of Pennsylvania, rallying on the Philadelphia steps made famous in the "Rocky" movie and declaring: "momentum is on our side."
  <br>
  <br>
  However "this could be one of the closest races in history – every single vote matters," cautioned Harris, who was joined by celebrities including Lady Gaga and Oprah Winfrey.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump, who would become the first convicted felon and oldest person to win the presidency, cast himself as the only solution to an apocalyptic vision of the country in terminal decline and overrun by "savage" migrants.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With your vote tomorrow, we can fix every single problem our country faces and lead America – indeed, the world – to new heights of glory," Trump told his closing rally in Grand Rapids in the key swing state of Michigan, after touring North Carolina and Pennsylvania. (AFP)

    'Preserve collective memory of Choi Hung Estate'

<img alt="Wong Tai Sin district councillor Godfrey Ngai says a colourful exterior wall and a basketball court at Choi Hung Estate should be preserved. File photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1777676_1_20241105175551.jpg&q=20">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 District councillors have urged officials to think of ways to keep alive the heritage and collective memory of Choi Hung Estate, which is set to be redeveloped in three phases over about two decades.
 <br>
  <br>
  The first phase of the facelift for the rainbow-themed housing complex, built in the 1960s and famous for its colourful exterior wall and photogenic basketball court, involves three blocks and two vacant school sites.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a Wong Tai Sin district council meeting on Tuesday to discuss the redevelopment plan, councillor Godfrey Ngai said the exterior wall and the basketball court should be preserved.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We propose setting up a Choi Hung museum in the new [Choi Hung] estate, which would include the estate's existing iconic signage, retro vending machines and nostalgic items... This would help preserve the unique features and collective memory of Choi Hung Estate,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another councillor, Deannie Yew, said she is worried about the wall effect, after Secretary for Housing Winnie Ho revealed earlier that the blocks at the future estate will be over 50-storey high.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If each building is going to be 50 storeys high, it would be like a 'giant' in the district because many buildings in the area aren't that tall. In such a densely populated area, wouldn't this potentially create the wall effect?" she questioned.
  <br>
  <br>
  In response, chief architect Tim Li from the Housing Department said a study has already taken the wall effect into consideration, and 50-storey designs are not new.
  <br>
  <br>
  Li added that each redevelopment cycle of Choi Hung Estate would take about seven years, which includes moving residents out, tearing down old buildings and building new foundations.

 Local stocks on Tuesday overcame early losses to finish more than 2 percent higher, thanks partly to fresh confidence towards the Chinese economy.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Hang Seng Index gained 439 points to 21,006, its highest finish in three weeks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Most blue chips and tech plays closed higher.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mainland stocks also did well, finishing at four-week highs, after Premier Li Qiang expressed confidence in the country's economic recovery.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A senior Beijing official overseeing Hong Kong affairs on Tuesday said the territory’s economic development has been recognised internationally and that the SAR has unlimited opportunities.
 <br>
  <br>
  Zhou Ji, executive deputy director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, also hailed Chief Executive John Lee’s leadership in supporting the economy, seeking development opportunities and improving people’s livelihoods.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong's economy has continued to expand. Its external economic and trade relations have also continued to improve. And the capital market is full of vitality," Zhou told the China International Import Expo in Shanghai.
  <br>
  <br>
  “These achievements have also been fully recognised and highly praised by the international community.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Citing recent data on the city’s economy and competitiveness, Zhou added that Hong Kong is full of business opportunities and development potential.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also said Beijing would continue to work with different departments to roll out measures beneficial to the SAR, while supporting cooperation between the city and Shanghai.
  <br>
  <br>
  At the same event, Chief Executive John Lee said Hong Kong could become a financing platform for mainland enterprises. He said there are more than 2,000 mainland firms in the city with more than 1,400 listed on the city’s bourse.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Among them were nearly 200 Shanghai companies that had a market value of more than HK$2 trillion. This fully demonstrates that Hong Kong can become an investment and financing platform serving the development of Shanghai and mainland enterprises," Lee said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We welcome more Shanghai and mainland enterprises to use Hong Kong to go global and achieve mutual development."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee led a delegation that included Financial Secretary Paul Chan and commerce minister Algernon Yau to attend the seventh edition of the expo, where he toured the Hong Kong exhibition area and reported to Premier Li Qiang on the city's development.
  <br>
  <br>
  The finance chief, for his part, said Hong Kong is a prime treasury centre with a free flow of capital.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan added that the SAR could facilitate the allocation of funds for mainland firms that set up their headquarters in Hong Kong, while providing tax concessions.

<div class="itemFullText">
 RTHK has learnt that Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office director Xia Baolong will hold a seminar on Hong Kong’s development in Shenzhen on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Sources have suggested Chief Executive John Lee, the director of Beijing’s liaison office Zheng Yanxiong, representatives of Hong Kong’s chambers of commerce and some international firms will participate in the seminar.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last month, Xia met HSBC group chairman Mark Tucker, and expressed the hope that the bank could actively participate in the nation’s high-quality development, and contribute to Hong Kong’s prosperity and development.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xia also met Jardine Matheson’s executive chairman Ben Keswick last week and said he hopes the group could help boost the international community’s understanding of Hong Kong.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Tickets for the upcoming Hong Kong Rugby Sevens – the first to be held at the Kai Tak Stadium – went on sale on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The tournament, scheduled for March 28 to 30, will be among the first major sporting events held at the 50,000-seat stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  Organisers said three-day passes for the tournament – which took place at the Hong Kong Stadium for decades – are priced at HK$1,950 for adults, and HK$950 for children 12 and under.
  <br>
  <br>
  A small amount of single-day tickets are also available via online ticket-seller, Klook, priced at up to HK$1,200.
  <br>
  <br>
  Event organisers Hong Kong China Rugby said prices are frozen at 2019 levels and that a HK$750 pass will grant priority access to the new South Stand and cover a free flow of drinks.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[We hope] the opportunity to be at one of the first events at the stadium, as well as the increased stadium capacity of the venue, will draw thousands of new fans to experience Hong Kong’s biggest party in the city’s biggest stadium," organisers said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tickets for last year’s sevens were sold out for the first time since the end of the pandemic.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Kamala Harris and Donald Trump made their final case on Monday in the hours before Election Day, when voters will either choose America's first woman president or hand the Republican an unprecedented comeback.
 <br>
  <br>
  With polls showing a dead heat, Trump promised to lead the United States to "new heights of glory" while Harris said the "momentum is on our side", as the rivals held their last rallies of the 2024 race in crucial battleground states.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Democratic Vice President finished on a high note in Philadelphia in the must-win state of Pennsylvania, with a rally on the steps immortalised by the boxing movie "Rocky". "This could be one of the closest races in history – every single vote matters," said Harris, who was joined by celebrities, including Lady Gaga and Oprah Winfrey.
  <br>
  <br>
  She also referenced the film, telling thousands of supporters that "here at these famous steps" she was paying "tribute to those who start as the underdog and climb to victory".
  <br>
  <br>
  Harris, 60, has repeatedly said she is the underdog, having only joined the race three months ago after President Joe Biden dropped out. But she insisted she would win.
  <br>
  <br>
  Former president Trump brought several family members up on stage at his closing rally in Grand Rapids, Michigan.

  "With your vote tomorrow, we can fix every single problem our country faces and lead America – indeed, the world – to new heights of glory," he told the crowd, as the clocks ticked over into Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump, 78, also called on people to turn up on election day, saying his supporters can "put ourselves in a position to win, which we can do very easily if we show up".
  <br>
  <br>
  The world is watching as the outcome will have major implications for conflicts in the Middle East and the war in Ukraine, and for tackling climate change.
  <br>
  <br>
  And with Trump having narrowly survived an assassination attempt in July and police foiling a second alleged plot, the fears of violence are very real.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Federation of Hong Kong and Kowloon Labour Unions on Tuesday urged bosses to give their workers a raise of 5.5 percent next year.
 <br>
  <br>
  The group noted its recent survey of more than 1,100 workers showed that more than six out of ten interviewees got an average pay rise of 4.5 percent this year, while most of the rest saw their salaries frozen.
  <br>
  <br>
  Over half of all respondents said they were unhappy with the salary adjustment, and over 70 percent think their pay should be adjusted based on inflation, the group said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The federation’s chairman Lam Chun-sing said the group had scaled back its expectations compared to last year after looking at factors such as inflation, the business situation and economic growth.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We suggest a salary increase of 5.5 percent, which is a little bit lower than last year because last year we suggested an increase of six percent,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Because last year the inflation was much higher than this year and also this year some of the sectors also face some challenges because of the economic situation.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Lam noted while the transportation sector saw bigger salary increases, some employees in industries like construction and catering faced a salary freeze.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think this is because of the economic situation... Also for the construction industry, some private construction projects are also delayed.”

    Rank outsider Knight's Choice wins the Melbourne Cup

<img alt="Irish jockey Robbie Dolan (left), high fives a fan after riding horse Knight's Choice to victory. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1777635_1_20241105144009.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Rank outsider Knight's Choice upset favourite Buckaroo on Tuesday to win the A$8 million (US$5.25 million) Melbourne Cup, earning Irish jockey Robbie Dolan a debut victory in Australia's "race that stops a nation".
 <br>
  <br>
  The five-year-old Australian-bred gelding came home by a nose in a photo finish ahead of Japanese raider Warp Speed and the Jamie Kah-ridden Okita Soushi in the energy-sapping two-mile handicap at Flemington.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Pinch me, I'm dreaming," said 28-year-old Dolan, a part-time singer who was riding in the famous race for the first time. "It is incredible. I can't believe it. I don't even know what to say."
  <br>
  <br>
  "I didn't know what to expect, but I feel like I've ridden it 10 times because I have ridden it in my head 100 times," he added. "I can't put it into words – it's the biggest race in the world."
  <br>
  <br>
  It was a huge breakthrough for Dolan, who was previously best-known for appearing on The Voice, an Australian singing show.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'll be singing tonight after a few beers," he said, overcome with emotion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Buckaroo, priced as the A$7.00 favourite, finished ninth while the fancied Vauban could only manage 11th on a warm and sunny day, with the track firm.
  <br>
  <br>
  A cultural institution in Australia, the Melbourne Cup has been run since 1861 and is considered so important it is a public holiday in its host state of Victoria.
  <br>
  <br>
  Held in front of a bumper crowd, drinking and socialising took priority over racing for many, with the sound of popping champagne corks accompanying the thundering of hooves.
  <br>
  <br>
  Breaking from barrier six, the John Symons and Sheila Laxon-trained Knight's Choice, an 80-1 shot, settled towards the back of the 23-strong pack behind early leader Just Fine.
  <br>
  <br>
  With 1,000m to go, Just Fine was still ahead but was slowly reeled in down the home straight and finished last, with Knight's Choice surging from 20th at the final turn for a thrilling victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was a second win for Laxon, who became the first woman to train a Melbourne Cup winner in 2001 with Ethereal.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He did, he did," she said, lavishing praise on Dolan. "We didn't give him instructions, he knew what to do."
  <br>
  <br>
  Symons added: "I was worried. He got further back than we talked about, but great ride. What a thrill. What a thrill."
  <br>
  <br>
  Mark Zahra, who rode the last two Melbourne Cup winners – Without a Fight and Gold Trip – was denied a hat-trick aboard Circle of Fire, finishing sixth.
  <br>
  <br>
  And Kerrin McEvoy's bid for a record-equalling fourth win was also unsuccessful, with his horse Absurde fifth. A record four women jockeys took part with Kah faring best on Okita Soushi.
  <br>
  <br>
  Michelle Payne is the only woman rider to win the Melbourne Cup after she steered Prince of Penzance to victory in 2015.
  <br>
  <br>
  There was one withdrawal by stewards before the race started with French import Athabascan found to have an irregular heartbeat, reducing the field to 23. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korea has fined Facebook-parent Meta more than US$15 million for illegally collecting sensitive user information from nearly a million people without consent and sharing it with advertisers, the country's data watchdog said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The firm, which also owns Instagram, ran afoul of laws prohibiting the use of information on political opinions, religious beliefs and people's sex life unless the individual provides explicit consent, Seoul's Personal Information Protection Commission added.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said that the tech giant collected sensitive information from around 980,000 domestic users in South Korea through their Facebook profiles.
  <br>
  <br>
  This included details about their religious beliefs and whether they are in a same-sex relationship.
  <br>
  <br>
  The watchdog said it had confirmed that such information was provided to advertisers by Meta, with around 4,000 advertisers using it.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meta "analysed user behaviour data, including pages liked and ads clicked on Facebook", to create and implement targeted advertising related to "sensitive themes" such as transgender issues, homosexuality and North Korean defectors, officials said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The commission said on Tuesday it had decided to fine Meta 21.6 billion won or US$15.6 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  It added that it "also ordered the company to establish legal grounds for processing sensitive information, implement safety measures, and respond diligently to users' requests for access to their personal data". (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Harry Wilson struck twice in stoppage time to give Fulham a dramatic 2-1 victory over west London rivals Brentford on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Vitaly Janelt had blasted the Bees in front against the run of play midway through the first half.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fulham were frustrated until added time when substitute Wilson flicked home the equaliser and then head in a winner at the death.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was an amazing feeling to come on and get the two goals to win the game. We deserved it, we kept them pinned in throughout," said Wilson.
  <br>
  <br>
  Victory lifts Marco Silva's men up to ninth and just three points off the top four.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brentford had been headed for the top half themselves until the late turnaround, but instead remain in 12th.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fulham failed to make the most of a purposeful start as Reiss Nelson was denied by Mark Flekken.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brentford had barely threatened prior to going in front on 24 minutes when Janelt took aim from distance and fired a blistering shot past Bernd Leno.
  <br>
  <br>
  Emile Smith Rowe wasted a big chance to reply immediately and the home side struggled to break through Brentford's mass ranks of defence after half-time.
  <br>
  <br>
  It took until Fulham's 25th attempt on goal to beat Flekken, as Wilson's inventive effort looped over the Dutch goalkeeper from Adama Traore's cross.
  <br>
  <br>
  Moments later, the Welsh international had a fortuitous second.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wilson's attempted header came off his shoulder to wrong-foot Flekken and flew into the top corner.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They both went in, but not how I would have wanted" Wilson added. "The first one I just helped it on to the back post, and the second one was more lucky." (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Deputy Financial Secretary Michael Wong on Tuesday said the airport’s three-runway system, which opens on November 28, will strengthen Hong Kong’s status as an aviation hub.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at the Super Terminal Expo, Wong said the Hong Kong International Airport would be able to handle 120 million passengers and 10 million tonnes of cargo annually after the launch of the third runway, more than double the current figures.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the airport currently connects the SAR with nearly 200 global destinations, and that he expects airlines to make use of the new runway to introduce new routes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It will make Hong Kong an even stronger aviation hub and allow us to serve the region and beyond even better. And for you as key stakeholders in the world's aviation and logistics communities, this means Hong Kong will provide you with a lot of business and profit opportunities," Wong said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[The authorities] will proactively engage new and existing aviation partners, and markets in Belt and Road countries, including those in the Middle East and Asean."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Airport Authority said it successfully conducted safety checks at the airport in the past few months.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Airport Authority continues to take forward the preparatory work for the commissioning of the three-runway system, including an aircraft crash and rescue exercise on the Centre Runway in the early hours of October 15," it wrote in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  It added that the airport’s expanded Terminal 2 will be put into service in phases from the end of 2025.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Darius Garland poured in 39 points as the Cleveland Cavaliers fended off a late Milwaukee surge to beat the Bucks 116-114 on Monday and push their perfect NBA record to 8-0.
 <br>
  <br>
  Garland drilled a step-back three-pointer to put Cleveland up 113-111 with 45 seconds to play, then fed Jarrett Allen for a dagger layup as the Cavs, who led by as many as 19 in the second quarter, matched the franchise's best start to a season – also achieved in 1976.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's hard to get one win, so eight is crazy," Garland said. "I'm happy we got eight – we've got to keep this thing going."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Bucks, with two-time NBA Most Valuable Player Giannis Antetokounmpo sitting out with an adductor strain, dropped their sixth straight game – coming up short again after a one-point home loss to the Cavs on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Milwaukee point guard Damian Lillard scored 14 of his 36 points in the third quarter as the Bucks battled back to lead 91-89 heading into the fourth.
  <br>
  <br>
  They pushed the lead to eight points midway through the fourth, but a three-pointer from Garland ignited a 10-0 scoring run that put the Cavs up by two. Lillard would briefly put Milwaukee back in front but the Cavs had enough.
  <br>
  <br>
  Evan Mobley added 17 points and Allen finished with 14 points, 15 rebounds and a massive block on Lillard with eight seconds to play that sealed the win.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We had to fight for 48 minutes," Garland said. "We knew they were going to come out in the second half and try to be more aggressive – it was a great all-around team effort."
  <br>
  <br>
  On a busy night that saw every team in action before a pause for the US presidential election on Tuesday, the Detroit Pistons upset the Los Angeles Lakers 115-103 while the reigning champion Boston Celtics romped past the Hawks 123-93 in Atlanta.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Golden State Warriors welcomed Stephen Curry back from a three-game injury absence with a 125-112 victory over the Wizards in Washington.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Detroit, Cade Cunningham scored 17 points with 11 rebounds and 11 assists for the third triple-double of his career and Jaden Ivey scored 26 points to power the Pistons to their third win of the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Anthony Davis scored 37 points for the Lakers, but appeared to be troubled by a left foot or ankle injury in the fourth quarter.
  <br>
  <br>
  LeBron James scored 20 points with eight rebounds and 11 assists, but the Pistons seized the lead in the first quarter and remained in control the rest of the way.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Warriors led all the way in Washington, with Curry scoring a team-high 24 points in his first game since he tweaked his left ankle on October 27. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto will visit China this week, the Foreign Ministry said on Tuesday, on his first foreign tour as he seeks a more prominent position for Jakarta on the world stage.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 73-year-old ex-general's state visit will take place from Friday to Sunday, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Hua Chunying said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prabowo was sworn in on October 20, pledging to stick to Jakarta's traditionally non-aligned foreign policy while making the world's fourth-most populous nation more active abroad.
  <br>
  <br>
  On his first planned foreign visits since taking power, Prabowo will also travel to Peru and Brazil for the Apec and G20 summits.
  <br>
  <br>
  He is also expected to go to the United States and Britain, newspaper Kompas reported last month, citing presidential palace sources.
  <br>
  <br>
  After his February election win, Prabowo used his eight-month transition period to visit more than a dozen countries – including China – to showcase a more active foreign policy than his predecessor Joko Widodo, who focused more on domestic issues like the economy. (AFP)

    North Korea stages more missile launches

<div class="itemFullText">
 North Korea fired a barrage of short-range ballistic missiles into the sea on Tuesday, its neighbours said, as it continued its weapons demonstrations hours before the US presidential election.
 <br>
  <br>
  Japanese Defence Minister Gen Nakatani said at least seven North Korean missiles flew as far as 400 kilometres with a maximum altitude of 100 kilometres.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said they landed in the waters between the Korean Peninsula and Japan.
  <br>
  <br>
  “North Korea’s actions, including a series of repeated missile launches, threaten the peace and safety of Japan, the region and the international community,” Nakatani said.
  <br>
  <br>
  South Korea's military also detected several missile launches by North Korea and subsequently boosted its surveillance posture.
  <br>
  <br>
  The North Korean missiles could be used to target key facilities in South Korea, including US military bases there.
  <br>
  <br>
  The launches came days after North Korean leader Kim Jong-un supervised a flight test of the country’s newest intercontinental ballistic missile designed to reach the US mainland.
  <br>
  <br>
  In response to that launch, the United States flew a long-range B-1B bomber in a trilateral drill with South Korea and Japan on Sunday in a show of force.
  <br>
  <br>
  That drew condemnation from Kim’s powerful sister Kim Yo-jong, who on Tuesday accused North Korea’s rivals of raising tensions with “aggressive and adventuristic military threats.”
  <br>
  <br>
  South Korean officials have said that North Korea was likely to dial up its military displays around the US presidential election to command the attention of Washington.
  <br>
  <br>
  South Korea’s military intelligence agency said last week that North Korea has also likely completed preparations for its seventh nuclear test.
  <br>
  <br>
  Outside officials and analysts say North Korea eventually hopes to use an expanded nuclear arsenal as leverage to win concessions such as sanctions relief after a new US president is elected. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China must combat rising unilateralism by opening up further to trade and investment, Premier Li Qiang said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Li told the opening ceremony of the annual China International Import Expo that the country will look to upgrade its free trade zones and further explore free trade and investment agreements with other countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  “In the face of the current impasses of global development, no one can stay unaffected and no one can solve these problems on their own,” Li said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Only by steadfastly embracing openness and cooperation and working together in unity can we harness the immense strength of all humanity to collectively to foster global development and prosperity.”
  <br>
  <br>
  He also expressed confidence over the nation's ability to meet its growth target and its economic prospects in the coming years.
  <br>
  <br>
  In his speech, Li pointed out there have been many positive developments in the nation’s economy indicating a favourable outlook.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities also had fiscal and monetary tools at their disposal, he added. (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 World number one Nelly Korda has clinched her first LPGA Player of the Year honours, the LPGA confirmed on Monday after it became mathematically impossible for anyone to catch her for the points-based award.
 <br>
  <br>
  In an already historic 2024 campaign America's Korda has six victories and three additional top-10 finishes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Her wins included a record-equalling run of five straight capped by her second major title at the Chevron Championship, and she represented the United States at the Paris Olympics and in the Solheim Cup.
  <br>
  <br>
  Korda skipped two tournaments on the recent Asian swing after a neck injury limited her ability to practice.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ayaka Furue of Japan, winner of the Evian Championship in July, would have had to win the rest of the LPGA events this year to catch up, but tied for 10th in the Japan Classic on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Winning the Rolex Player of the Year means so much to me," the 26-year-old Korda said in a statement. "This season has had its highs and challenges, and I'm just really grateful for the people around me who have helped me get here."
  <br>
  <br>
  Korda is expected to tee it up in two more tournaments this year, including the season-ending Tour Championship in Naples, Florida, from November 21 to 24. (AFP)

    Kowloon City court ramps up security

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Security at Kowloon City court on Tuesday was ramped up a day after a man was arrested for allegedly attempting to attack a magistrate who had earlier convicted him.
 <br>
  <br>
  The judiciary said it will “progressively implement enhanced security measures”, such as bag screenings and deploying extra manpower.
  <br>
  <br>
  An RTHK reporter at the Kowloon City Magistrates' Courts saw security personnel asking people to open their bags for inspections outside courtrooms. People were asked to empty their water bottles and sharp objects were not allowed in.
  <br>
  <br>
  “If these items are discovered, we will call the police,” a notice displayed at the screening area read.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a courtroom mainly hearing criminal cases, roughly three security guards were present and about four police officers were in the dock.
  <br>
  <br>
  On floors without courtrooms, security checks were not required.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sources suggest Edward Wong was the magistrate who was allegedly targeted as court proceedings were underway on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The court diary on the judiciary’s website showed Wong was not presiding over any cases on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Unlike West Kowloon Magistrates’ Courts, where national security cases are heard, there are no walk-through metal detectors and people are not asked to empty their pockets at the Kowloon City courthouse.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, police have laid a holding charge against a man, 32, suspected of involvement in Monday's attack.
  <br>
  <br>
  The case will be mentioned at Kowloon City Magistracy on Wednesday morning.

    Olympic champion Lyles misses out track athlete award

<img alt="Lyles on the podium after the men's 200-metre athletics event at Paris 2024. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1777595_1_20241105095925.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Olympic 100-metre champion Noah Lyles is not one of the two finalists for male track athlete of the year, World Athletics revealed on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lyles won one of the closest Olympic finals in history to take gold in Paris in August by five thousandths of a second from Kishane Thompson of Jamaica.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Lyles misses out as 200-metre Olympic champion Letsile Tebogo of Botswana and Norway's 5,000-metre gold medallist Jakob Ingebrigtsen were the two male track athletes to make the final.
  <br>
  <br>
  The American was aiming for an Olympic sprint double but had to settle for the 200m bronze medal behind Tebogo and his US teammate Kenny Bednarek.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lyles later revealed he had raced in the 200-metre despite testing positive for Covid-19.
  <br>
  <br>
  In contrast, the winner of the Olympic women's 100-metre final, Julien Alfred of St. Lucia, is one of the two women's track finalists.
  <br>
  <br>
  She will be up against Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone, the American who broke her own world record to win the Olympic 400-metre hurdles title for a second time in a row.
  <br>
  <br>
  World Athletics said the top two in each category – track, field and out of stadium – were chosen from a first round of voting, which comprised votes from the World Athletics Council, officials and dignitaries connected to the sport known as the "World Athletics Family", and a public vote on social media.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a new addition to this year's awards, a final round of votes cast by fans of the sport from Monday until November 10 will decide the overall World Athlete of the Year.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the field events, Olympic men's pole vault champion and world record holder Mondo Duplantis will be hot favourite to take the men's award.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Swede is up against Miltiadis Tentoglou of Greece, who won the men's long jump gold in Paris.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ukrainian high jumper Yaroslava Mahuchikh, who broke the 37-year-old women's world record with a clearance of 2.10-metre four weeks before taking Olympic gold, will go head-to-head with three-time Olympic heptathlon champion Nafissatou Thiam of Belgium.
  <br>
  <br>
  The women's out-of-stadium award pits world marathon record holder Ruth Chepng'etich of Kenya against Sifan Hassan of the Netherlands, who won the Olympic marathon in Paris.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the men's category Brian Pintado, the Ecuadorean gold medallist in the 20-kilometre race walk at the Paris Games, will compete against Olympic men's marathon champion Tamirat Tola from Ethiopia. (AFP)

    Sabalenka through to WTA Finals semis, Zheng cruises

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Aryna Sabalenka has secured qualification for the semi-finals stage of the WTA Finals with a 6-3, 7-5 victory over Jasmine Paolini, as Zheng Qinwen ended Elena Rybakina's chances of moving on in Riyadh on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  With two round-robin wins in as many matches this week in Saudi Arabia, Sabalenka guaranteed herself passage to the final four as the winner of the Purple Group.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Belarusian top seed is also just one victory away from locking down the year-end number one ranking, which she is in a direct battle with Iga Swiatek.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sabalenka bounced back from 0-2 down in the second set, and saved two set points at 4-5 to overcome Italian fourth seed Paolini and has now won 22 of her last 23 matches on tour.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The second set was quite tricky. Honestly, I just tried to stay aggressive and show her that I'm going to fight for this set no matter what and I'm really happy I was able to win in straight sets," said Sabalenka.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Halfway through the second set I was already thinking about the third set," she added. "But I was like, wait, wait, it's not the third set until it's the third set – I'm happy all those shots on set points went in."
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Chinese Olympic medallist improved her chances of advancing to the semi-finals with a 7-6 (7/4), 3-6, 6-1 victory over world number five Rybakina.
  <br>
  <br>
  The seventh-seeded Zheng rebounded from her opening round-robin defeat to Sabalenka by claiming her first win from three meetings with Rybakina.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rybakina suffered her second defeat of the week in Saudi Arabia, and has no chance of reaching the semi-finals – with one more round-robin clash to go against Sabalenka on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zheng apologised to the crowd during her on-court interview for yelling, 'Don't shout more', at some of her supporters at a crucial moment in the final set.
  <br>
  <br>
  She thanked them for their support and later acknowledged she could have handled the moment better.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I felt today in such an important moment, when they shout so hard my name, my heart rate goes up. So I hold and hold, until one moment I can't hold more," Zheng said during her post-match press conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm feeling a bit bad, because if I can control my emotions a bit better, I was supposed not to say that to my crowd."
  <br>
  <br>
  Zheng arrived in Riyadh on the back of an impressive second half of the season that saw her win titles in Palermo and Tokyo, and an Olympic gold medal in singles in Paris. No woman has won more matches than her within that span.
  <br>
  <br>
  The first Chinese player to qualify for the WTA Finals since Li Na in 2013, Zheng amassed a 12-2 win-loss record during the Asian swing last month and is the tour leader in most aces struck and percentage of first-serve points won.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Chinese Olympic champion now owns a tour-leading 20 three-set wins in 2024 – the highest tally by a WTA player in a single season since 2016. (AFP)

 There may be fresh hope for prostate cancer patients who develop resistance to traditional forms of therapies, as oncologists say a new third-line treatment is showing promising results so far.

  The Hong Kong Society of Uro-Oncology said the targeted radiotherapy treatment -- lutetium-177-PSMA-617 -- can boost cancer survival rates and improve patients' quality of life.
  <br>
  <br>
  Half of the patients also reported a reduction in tumour size, while others had cancer cells completely eradicated.
  <br>
  <br>
  The treatment is used when the patient no longer reacts to both hormonal therapy and chemotherapy, and presents symptoms such as difficulty in urinating, blood in urine, and even spinal cord pain.
  <br>
  <br>
  Clinical oncologist Kenneth Wong said the treatment is also associated with less side effects.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There are certainly some side effects associated with the use of this drug, including dry mouth, fatigue, nausea, anaemia and so on," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  But that was still better than traditional chemotherapy, Wong stressed, in which patients had to deal with suppressed bone marrow function and an increased risk of infection.
  <br>
  <br>
  The theranostic medicine is administered intravenously every six weeks, for up to six sessions. It locates cancer cells in the body and delivers targeted radiation to kill those cells.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong said patients are required to drink large amounts of water to purge the remnants of the drug which are not absorbed by the tumour.
  <br>
  <br>
  They should also avoid close contact with people for up to two weeks, especially children and pregnant women.
  <br>
  <br>
  Each injection costs HK$100,000 and public hospital patients have to pay out of their own pockets. Charity group St James' Settlement currently provides a subsidy of up to HK$30,000 for each treatment programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prostate cancer was the third most common cancer among men in Hong Kong in 2021. More than half of the patients were only diagnosed at an advanced stage.

 US stocks closed slightly lower after a choppy session on Monday, as investors prepared for a crucial week in which Americans will elect a new president and the Federal Reserve will release a policy statement.
 <br>
  <br>
  Presidential candidates Donald Trump and Kamala Harris both scrambled for an edge in the last full day of a race that polls show as extremely close. It could take days to determine the victor.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some of the so-called "Trump trades" unwound after a recent poll showed Harris, the Democratic vice president, leading in Iowa, sparking a drop in the US dollar, Treasury yields and bitcoin. Trump Media & Technology Group closed up 12.4 percent, bouncing back from early losses of nearly 6 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 257 points, or 0.6 percent, to 41,794, the S&P 500 lost 16 points, or 0.3 percent, to 5,712 and the Nasdaq Composite lost 59 points, or 0.3 percent, to 18,179.
  <br>
  <br>
  Investors were largely pricing in a Fed interest rate cut of 25 basis points at its policy announcement on Thursday, with CME's FedWatch Tool showing markets pricing in a 98 percent chance of a cut, with only a 2 percent chance the central bank keeps rates steady.
  <br>
  <br>
  The biggest gainer among the 11 major S&P sectors was energy, up 1.9 percent as oil prices climbed after OPEC+ decided to delay plans for an output increase. (Reuters)

    Putin meets North Korean foreign minister

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Putin met North Korea's foreign minister in the Kremlin on Monday amid mounting concern in the West that North Korean soldiers are about to enter the Ukraine war on Moscow's side.
 <br>
  <br>
  Video of the meeting showed the pair shaking hands for a full minute as Putin greeted Choe Son Hui.
  <br>
  <br>
  Putin noted that they were meeting on Russia's National Unity Day, a public holiday, and Choe conveyed "sincere, warm, comradely greetings" from North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
  <br>
  <br>
  The United States says North Korea has sent some 10,000 troops to Russia, including 8,000 to the western Kursk region where Russia is still battling to expel Ukrainian troops who broke across the border in August.
  <br>
  <br>
  Putin, who signed a treaty with Kim in June that includes a mutual defence clause, has neither confirmed nor denied the North Korean troop presence. He has said that Russia is free to implement the pact as it sees fit.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Russian leader briefly alluded to the military situation in Kursk when he met youth volunteers earlier on Monday, telling them: "When the enemy is cleaned out from the region, there will be lots of work for you to do."
  <br>
  <br>
  In Kyiv, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said he had discussed with his German counterpart Annalena Baerbock the "need for decisive action" in response to North Korean involvement in the war in Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said North Korean troops were waging "an aggressive war in Europe against a sovereign European state".
  <br>
  <br>
  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy last week urged Kyiv's allies to stop just "watching" and start taking action to tackle the presence of the North Koreans. (Reuters)

 The dispatch of North Korean troops to Russia as Moscow wages war in Ukraine highlights the need for security cooperation between the European Union and South Korea, EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The deployment "regrettably illustrates the importance of our shared security agenda," he said before talks with South Korean Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul in Seoul. The EU and South Korea are holding their first Strategic Dialogue meeting after Washington and Seoul sounded the alarm about North Korea sending troops to help Russia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Borrell also met South Korean Defence Minister Kim Yong-hyun and expressed concern over the development, the South Korean defence ministry said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Russia’s aggression against Ukraine is an existential threat," Borrell said in a post on X and also posted a photo of him shaking hands with Kim. "The Republic of Korea is best positioned to understand it. We are united in our support to Ukraine. I encouraged them to step it up."
  <br>
  <br>
  Borrell said in a post on X on Sunday that he had visited the heavily fortified Demilitarized Zone separating the two Koreas after arriving in South Korea following a trip to Japan, and described the visit as reminder of the need to invest more in peace.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said in another post that he was visiting South Korea to take security and defence cooperation between the EU and Seoul to "the next level", but gave no further details. Cho said last week that all possible scenarios were under consideration, when asked about whether Seoul could send weapons to Ukraine in response to North Korea aiding Russia.
  <br>
  <br>
  South Korea has provided non-lethal aid to Ukraine, including mine clearance equipment, but has resisted Kyiv's requests for weapons.
  <br>
  <br>
  Seoul also sees it as likely that the North will be compensated by Moscow with military and civilian technology, as it races to launch a spy satellite and upgrade its missile capabilities. North Korea last week flexed its military muscle with the test of a huge new solid-fuel intercontinental ballistic missile dubbed Hwasong-19.
  <br>
  <br>
  Washington expects North Korean troops in Russia's Kursk region, which borders Ukraine, to enter the fight against Ukraine soon, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said last week.
  <br>
  <br>
  At talks in Moscow on Friday, North Korean Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui said her country intended to back Russia until it achieves victory in the Ukraine war. (Reuters)

<img alt="The government of Anthony Albanese is seeking to overcome workforce shortages. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1777538_1_20241104194245.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Australia will spend A$600 million (US$395 million) on defence reserve recruitment and extending a cash bonus to retain troops as the centre-left Albanese government seeks to overcome workforce shortages, officials are expected to announce on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  A review of Australia's defence force last year identified severe workforce pressures as a priority issue, even as the government lifts its defence budget to a record A$51.5 billion annually, revamping its northern military bases and acquiring long range strike capabilities.
  <br>
  <br>
  A defence workforce plan expected to be released on Tuesday cites a competitive national labour market and record low levels of unemployment as putting pressure on defence's ability to recruit, according to excerpts viewed by Reuters.
  <br>
  <br>
  A bonus scheme introduced last year will be extended until 2028 and expanded through the middle ranks, offering A$40,000 to defence force members who stay to "address hollowness in the force", the plan says.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Department of Defence aims to achieve a permanent defence workforce of 69,000 by the early 2030s, with an overall combined defence and civilian workforce of around 100,000 by 2040, the plan says.
  <br>
  <br>
  In June, there were around 57,000 permanent defence personnel, falling short of funded positions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our ADF personnel are our greatest capability, which is why it is crucial that the Defence workforce has the people it needs to help protect Australia’s strategic interests," Defence Minister Richard Marles said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Australia is spending up to A$368 billion to acquire nuclear powered submarines under the Aukus partnership with the United States and Britain, and has also allocated A$74 billion for missile systems, as it responds to rising tensions with China in the Indo Pacific region.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Monday, Australia cancelled a multibillion-dollar military satellite project with Lockheed Martin, saying it would instead shift its focus to a multi-orbit system to increase resilience for the Australian Defence Force. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Fanling Magistrates' Court on Monday sentenced a 23-year-old mainland student to three months in jail for using fake academic credentials to apply for a master's degree programme at a Hong Kong university.
 <br>
  <br>
  Police said the man had passed an online interview for the Health and Physical Education programme at Education University, and received a conditional offer.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was then asked to submit his qualifications, including an English proficiency test.
  <br>
  <br>
  Upon verification the institution realised the actual score attained by the applicant did not match his claim, and reported the case to police.
  <br>
  <br>
  The man pleaded guilty to a count of attempting to obtain services by deception.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police warned people against using bogus academic qualifications, saying it will adopt a zero-tolerance approach to maintain the reputation of Hong Kong's higher education.

 Education officials on Monday said the results of this year’s Territory-wide System Assessment (TSA), which tests students on the subjects of Chinese, English and maths, remained “generally steady”.
 <br>
  <br>
  Primary three students’ scores were all slightly down this year in all the subjects, with an 80.9 percent, 78.7 percent, and 85.3 percent proficiency in Chinese, English and maths respectively.
  <br>
  <br>
  Secondary three pupils did better in Chinese and maths this year, but their English proficiency was down from last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As compared to that of last year, the performance of the primary three and secondary three students participating in the assessment of the three major subjects of Chinese Language, English Language and mathematics this year remains generally steady," the Education Bureau said.
  <br>
  <br>
  It added that it will use different ways to help enhance learning and teaching effectiveness.

<img alt='Often inhaled through vapes, "space oil" usually contains etomidate, a regulated sedative that can only be prescribed by a doctor. File photo: AFP' src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1777506_1_20241104155333.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A pharmacist on Monday said regulations on short-acting anaesthetics were not strong enough to deter their recreational use.
 <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong has this year recorded at least three deaths caused by the suspected usage of “space oil”, according to the Toxicology Reference Laboratory of the Hong Kong Poison Control Centre.
  <br>
  <br>
  Often inhaled through vapes, “space oil” usually contains etomidate, a regulated sedative that is prescribed by a doctor. The anaesthetic is classified as a Part 1 poison.
  <br>
  <br>
  The president of the Society of Hospital Pharmacists of Hong Kong So Yiu-wah said the long-term use of etomidate could be deadly.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The drug will suppress the cortisol level inside our body. Once the cortisol is lowered, then our blood potassium will also be lowered, making muscles, especially the legs, seem very weak," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Because the potassium level is low, the heartbeat may become irregular. If those people already have some heart disease, it may be even fatal."
  <br>
  <br>
  He also said penalties for the illegal use of the drug are not stringent enough.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The penalty is high not enough, because for those people who violate the [regulation], the maximum penalty is a HK$100,000 [fine] and being kept in jail for two years,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government is seeking to list the sedative as a dangerous drug in the first half of 2025, according to security minister Chris Tang, who also said taking “space oil” would be equivalent to taking drugs.
  <br>
  <br>
  If etomidate is listed as a dangerous drug, those illegally possessing or consuming “space oil” containing the substance would face a maximum of seven years in prison and a fine of HK$1 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  And those trafficking or illegally importing the drug would be liable to a maximum penalty of life imprisonment and a fine of HK$5 million.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Monday arrested a man who allegedly attempted to attack a magistrate with a knife inside Kowloon City Magistrates’ Courts.
 <br>
  <br>
  The case took place shortly after 10am, when the court was in session.
  <br>
  <br>
  As proceedings were under way, the 32-year-old suspect allegedly emerged from the public gallery and charged towards the magistrate, while pulling out a knife from his bag.
  <br>
  <br>
  A police officer intervened quickly and the man never got to the magistrate.
  <br>
  <br>
  The man then tried to flee the scene but was subdued outside the courtroom. Three officers suffered minor injuries in the process.
  <br>
  <br>
  The suspect was later arrested on suspicion of attempted wounding.
  <br>
  <br>
  Superintendent Gar Kam-lam told reporters at a briefing that the man was carrying four knives of 27 to 46cm long, as well as flammable liquids and lighters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gar also confirmed the suspect was convicted of indecent assault in 2020, and was awaiting appeal.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He brought along documents and papers which suggested he was upset with the ruling," Gar said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sources suggest Edward Wong was the presiding magistrate for that case. The same magistrate was at the court this morning.
  <br>
  <br>
  There are currently no security checks at most of the city's Magistrates' Courts.
  <br>
  <br>
  The judiciary said it will "progressively implement enhanced security measures" from Tuesday, including screenings and extra manpower.
  <br>
  <br>
  It will also liaise with police on strengthening patrols and ensure the safety of judges, judicial officers, court staff and users.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Department of Justice strongly condemned the case, saying any threat to judicial officers’ personal safety cannot be tolerated.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Bar Association, for its part, also condemned the case "in the strongest possible terms".
  <br>
  <br>
  It said any threat or violent act made with the intent to frighten or pressure judicial officers, or retaliate against their decisions is a serious assault on judicial independence.

    Legendary music producer Quincy Jones dies aged 91

<img alt="Jones rose from running with gangs on the South Side of Chicago to the very heights of show business. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1777508_2_20241104162429.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Quincy Jones, the multi-talented music titan whose vast legacy ranged from producing Michael Jackson's historic "Thriller" album to writing prize-winning film and television scores and collaborating with Frank Sinatra, Ray Charles and hundreds of other recording artists, has died at 91.
 <br>
  <br>
  Jones' publicist, Arnold Robinson, says he died on Sunday night at his home in the Bel Air section of Los Angeles, surrounded by his family.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Tonight, with full but broken hearts, we must share the news of our father and brother Quincy Jones’ passing," the family said in a statement. “And although this is an incredible loss for our family, we celebrate the great life that he lived and know there will never be another like him.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Jones rose from running with gangs on the South Side of Chicago to the very heights of show business, becoming one of the first Black executives to thrive in Hollywood and amassing an extraordinary musical catalogue that includes some of the richest moments of American rhythm and song. For years, it was unlikely to find a music lover who did not own at least one record with his name on it, or a leader in the entertainment industry and beyond who did not have some connection to him.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jones kept company with presidents and foreign leaders, movie stars and musicians, philanthropists and business leaders. He toured with Count Basie and Lionel Hampton, arranged records for Sinatra and Ella Fitzgerald, composed the soundtracks for "Roots" and "In the Heat of the Night," organized President Bill Clinton's first inaugural celebration and oversaw the all-star recording of “We Are the World,” the 1985 charity record for famine relief in Africa.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lionel Richie, who co-wrote “We Are the World" and was among the featured singers, would call Jones “the master orchestrator.”
  <br>
  <br>
  In a career which began when records were still played on vinyl at 78 rpm, top honours likely go to his productions with Jackson: “Off the Wall,” “Thriller” and “Bad” were albums near-universal in their style and appeal. Jones’ versatility and imagination helped set off the explosive talents of Jackson as he transformed from child star to the “King of Pop.” On such classic tracks as “Billie Jean” and “Don’t Stop ‘Til You Get Enough,” Jones and Jackson fashioned a global soundscape out of disco, funk, rock, pop, R&B and jazz and African chants. For “Thriller,” some of the most memorable touches originated with Jones, who recruited Eddie Van Halen for a guitar solo on the genre-fusing “Beat It” and brought in Vincent Price for a ghoulish voiceover on the title track.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Thriller” sold more than 20 million copies in 1983 alone and has contended with the Eagles’ “Greatest Hits 1971-1975” among others as the best-selling album of all time.
  <br>
  <br>
  “If an album doesn’t do well, everyone says ‘it was the producers fault’; so if it does well, it should be your ‘fault,’ too,” Jones said in an interview with the Library of Congress in 2016. “The tracks don’t just all of a sudden appear. The producer has to have the skill, experience and ability to guide the vision to completion.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The list of his honours and awards fills 18 pages in his 2001 autobiography “Q”, including 27 Grammys at the time (now 28), an honorary Academy Award (now two) and an Emmy for “Roots.” He also received France’s Legion d’Honneur, the Rudolph Valentino Award from the Republic of Italy and a Kennedy Centre tribute for his contributions to American culture. He was the subject of a 1990 documentary, “Listen Up: The Lives of Quincy Jones” and a 2018 film by daughter Rashida Jones. His memoir made him a best-selling author. (AP)

    Govt probing Tung Chung water outage

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Director of Water Supplies on Monday said officials are investigating what caused a pipe burst that resulted in a water outage in Tung Chung, and apologised to those affected.
 <br>
  <br>
  Tung Chung was cut off from fresh water for about 12 hours because urgent repairs on a 1.2 metre-diameter pipe were needed following an operational incident near the Siu Ho Wan Water Treatment Works.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities said they originally planned to turn the taps back on at 6am on Monday, but fresh water only returned to Tung Chung at 10am.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters, Roger Wong apologised to the 120,000 affected residents.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Because of the site constraints, and also because of the special failure mode of this incident, we take time to investigate and find out the leakage point,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The leakage point is also at the bottom of the pipe, so it is hard to carry out the repair works. That's why the progress of [repair] works has been slightly delayed."
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong added more time was needed to find out the exact cause and a report will be submitted to the Development Bureau.
  <br>
  <br>
  Built in the 1990s, the burst water pipe is the only one servicing the Tung Chung area.

    Exchange Fund sees record income for first nine months

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's Exchange Fund recorded a record-breaking investment income of HK$224.7 billion for the first nine months of the year, the Monetary Authority (HKMA) revealed on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The fund posted gains of HK$114.6 billion in the third quarter alone, with the largest gain coming from bond investments, which contributed HK$66 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Investments in Hong Kong stocks posted gains for the second consecutive quarter, adding about HK$22 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gains from other stocks totalled HK$18 billion while the valuation of foreign exchange brought in HK$8 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  The figure for the first three quarters saw the investment income falling just HK$40 billion short of the total annual record of HK$264 billion in 2017.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters, the HKMA’s chief executive Eddie Yue said it is difficult to tell if this year’s annual figure will set a new record.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We’ve got two more months to go, and the financial market, even a week or month, is a very long period. During those two months, even within this week, we are seeing different developments that will have an impact on the market,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “For example, the pace of the US interest rate reduction is still unknown. The market is expecting that at the [Federal Open Market Committee] meeting this week, the Federal Reserve will continue with the reduction path, with a cut of let's say 25 basis points as expected by the market. But what the commentary will be, and how they will assess the forward path will have an impact on the market.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Yue also noted factors – such as whether China will announce more economic stimulus measures, as well as uncertainties arising from the geopolitical conditions – will influence the fund’s performance.

    Morales vows to continue his defiance of Bolivian govt

<div class="itemFullText">
 Bolivia's former President Evo Morales insisted on Sunday that he would press on with a hunger strike until the government of his protégé-turned-rival agreed to a political dialogue.
 <br>
  <br>
  Morales' supporters have blocked roads and caused disruptions around the country in protest against what they say is the government's political persecution of the former Bolivian leader.
  <br>
  <br>
  Morales, a larger-than-life figure still towering over Bolivian politics five years after his ouster, spoke on his third day without food from Chapare, Bolivia’s rural coca-growing region that serves as his stronghold.
  <br>
  <br>
  “My fight is to improve the situation in the country and to start a dialogue without conditions on two fronts, one economic and one political,” Morales told reporters from the office of the coca growers’ federation that he long has led.
  <br>
  <br>
  The former president said he began his hunger strike on Friday in the hope that "international organisations or friendly governments" would facilitate talks with his political nemesis, President Luis Arce .
  <br>
  <br>
  Tensions have surged over the past three weeks since pro-Morales supporters set up crippling roadblocks aimed at rebuking Arce — Morales' former economy minister with whom he is now vying to lead Bolivia’s governing socialist party into next year’s elections.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since mid-October, protesters have choked off major highways in defiance of an attempt by Arce's government to revive a 2016 statutory rape case against Morales, an ethnic Aymara who was the first member of an indigenous community to become the president of Latin America’s only indigenous-majority nation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since then, the disruptions in transport have cost the South American country more than US$1.7 billion, according to Bolivia's government.
  <br>
  <br>
  Morales has denied any wrongdoing and rejects the charges as politically motivated.
  <br>
  <br>
  “My crime is being indigenous,” he said on Sunday. (AP)

    SAR a hub for legal collaboration: justice chief

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong’s justice secretary on Monday said the SAR is well positioned to be a hub for legal and economic collaboration, with Beijing saying it will give its unwavering support to back the SAR in its role as a super-connector.
 <br>
  <br>
  At the opening of Hong Kong Legal Week, Secretary for Justice Paul Lam said the SAR serves as a gateway between China, the Asia-Pacific and the rest of the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Under the One Country, Two Systems principle, Hong Kong is the only common law jurisdiction within China. Our strong legal foundation, coupled with our close ties with and support from the mainland, position us as a critical hub for legal and economic collaboration across the region and beyond," Lam said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister also said efforts to set up a training academy for international legal talents are underway, with a ceremony set to take place on Friday to mark the new initiative.
  <br>
  <br>
  The academy – first outlined in last year’s Policy Address – will regularly organise training courses, seminars and international exchange programmes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Also speaking at the event, Commissioner of the Foreign Ministry’s Office in Hong Kong Cui Jianchun, said the central government’s unwavering commitment to the One Country, Two Systems principle is the strongest foundation for the territory’s development.
  <br>
  <br>
  He called on the SAR to continue to boost its unique role as a super-connector to facilitate trade and investment between Chinese and foreign enterprises.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another role that the territory could play, Cui noted, would be uniting diverse market participants and expanding international connections.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We believe Hong Kong's uniqueness not only serves and links the mainland with the international community, [but also] we believe here, the common law, the unique law system, can pave the way for the development of the international community."
  <br>
  <br>
  The commissioner added the SAR could act as a bridge for multicultural interactions, facilitating legal assistance and cooperation, as well as the exchange of legal experience.

<div class="itemFullText">
 At least six people died after a volcano in eastern Indonesia erupted several times overnight, officials said on Monday, raising the alert level to the highest of a four-tiered system.
 <br>
  <br>
  Mount Lewotobi Laki-Laki, located on the popular tourist island of Flores, spewed a tower of ash and lava on nearby villages that were forced to evacuate.
  <br>
  <br>
  "According to our coordination with the local authorities, six fatalities have been confirmed," Abdul Muhari, spokesman of the country's disaster management agency said on Monday in an interview on Kompas TV.
  <br>
  <br>
  Video clips showed villages near the volcano covered by thick ash, with some areas on fire.
  <br>
  <br>
  The country's volcanology agency raised the alert level to the highest mark, and told locals and tourists not to carry out activities within a seven-kilometre radius of the crater.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There has been a significant increase in volcanic activity on Mount Lewotobi Laki-laki," it said in a press release.
  <br>
  <br>
  It warned there was a potential for rain-induced lava floods and told locals to wear masks to avoid the effects of volcanic ash.
  <br>
  <br>
  The mountain had several major eruptions in January, prompting authorities at the time to raise the alert status to the highest level and evacuate at least 2,000 residents.
  <br>
  <br>
  Indonesia, a vast archipelago nation, experiences frequent eruptions due to its position on the Pacific "Ring of Fire", an area of intense volcanic and seismic activity. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A tense battle in Seattle saw the Los Angeles Rams come away with a 26-20 overtime NFL win on Demarcus Robinson's one-handed catch of a 39-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Matthew Stafford.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Seahawks had scored on a 14-yard touchdown in the final minute of regulation to force overtime, but could not score on the opening drive of the extra session.
  <br>
  <br>
  With the Rams needing only a field goal after stuffing the Seahawks on fourth down on the first possession of overtime, Stafford went for the win by throwing a deep ball to Robinson, who was well covered by cornerback Riq Woolen.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stafford threw for 298 yards, two touchdowns and one interception for the Rams, who have now won three straight after losing four of their previous five.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the Detroit Lions dominated the Green Bay Packers in a 24-14 victory at rain-lashed Lambeau Field on Sunday, winning the battle for supremacy in the NFC North division.
  <br>
  <br>
  Detroit's Kerby Joseph returned an interception 27 yards for a touchdown to help the Lions take control in the highly anticipated matchup.
  <br>
  <br>
  Green Bay struck for an early field goal, but the Lions took the lead for good when quarterback Jared Goff hit Amon-Ra St. Brown with a three-yard touchdown pass in the first minute of the second quarter.
  <br>
  <br>
  They added a field goal and a touchdown in the final minute of the first half as Joseph reeled in a pass from an under-pressure Packers quarterback Jordan Love and raced up the sideline to the end zone.
  <br>
  <br>
  Detroit scored 24 points before the Packers produced a second field goal. A late Green Bay touchdown made the score more respectable, but the Lions were in control throughout as they improved to 7-1 – the best record in the NFC – for the first time since 1956.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was a fun game," Goff said. "In Green Bay, in Lambeau, we're supposed to be the 'dome team' – we're supposed to be the team that can't play outside – and we came in here and win." (AFP/AP)

    Tung Chung fresh water supply restored

<img alt="The Water Supplies Department says it ordered water trucks to the area to provide a temporary supply of fresh water to residents and businesses. Photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1777463_1_20241104104544.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Authorities on Monday said that water supply to Tung Chung was restored shortly after 10am, after the area was cut off from fresh water for about 12 hours due to urgent overnight repairs.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Water Supplies Department had originally planned to restore the supply of water at 6am but was forced to delay it several times.
  <br>
  <br>
  Islands District Councillor Lau Chin-pang told RTHK the arrangements were unsatisfactory.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I think the delay is not good for our residents because 7am to 8am is the most important time for the students and for the workers. So I don't think it's a suitable case. I think they can improve,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Huizaifa, a food delivery worker who lives in Yat Tung Estate in Tung Chung, was one of the affected residents.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Now I go to work [but there was] just a little water only [for] face wash… I feel very bad because when I came home, no water and when I go toilet no [water]” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a wet market, an angry congee shop owner surnamed Fu said no water meant no business.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Of course the water outage has a huge impact, affecting the whole world. It makes things very inconvenient. Everything needs water. Even if you want to eat, there’s nothing to eat. So there’s no business,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The department said earlier that it ordered water trucks and water tanks to the area to provide a temporary supply of fresh water to residents and businesses.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said the repairs for the 1,200-millimetre-diameter fresh-water pipe were needed following an operational incident near the Siu Ho Wan Water Treatment Works.
  <br>
  <br>
  A department document said the works is a key facility to supply water to Tung Chung, Hong Kong International Airport, Tai Ho, and Discovery Bay.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 New Zealand captain Tom Latham on Sunday said his team's 3-0 Test sweep in India was one of the "greatest series wins" for the country.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Black Caps won the third Test by 25 runs on Sunday at Mumbai's Wankhede Stadium to hand India only their second series whitewash at home.
  <br>
  <br>
  New Zealand – cricket's perennial underdogs – turned around their fortunes from a 2-0 defeat in Sri Lanka in September to make India suffer their first Test series loss at home in 12 years.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's obviously a great moment for New Zealand cricket, probably one of New Zealand cricket's greatest series wins I think," said Latham.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Again, all we can do is keep playing cricket and keep playing our brand of cricket," he added. "We've felt a lot of support over the last couple of weeks, which is really special."
  <br>
  <br>
  New Zealand host England for three Tests starting November 28 in Christchurch followed by matches in Wellington and Hamilton.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We've got three more big games back home," said Latham. "We've got sell-out crowds in a couple of the games – which is all you can ask for from a cricketer's point of view."
  <br>
  <br>
  Mumbai-born New Zealand spinner Ajaz Patel stood out in the final Test with a match-haul of 11 wickets with his left-arm spin.
  <br>
  <br>
  He took five in the first innings and then six to help bowl out India for 121 in their chase of 147 and Latham praised his match-winner as "fantastic". (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Three-time world champion Max Verstappen produced a virtuoso drive in often atrocious conditions to regain control of this year's world championship on Sunday when he charged from 17th on the grid to win the Brazilian Grand Prix.
 <br>
  <br>
  Without a win in 10 races since the Spanish Grand Prix in May, Red Bull's series leader made light of the chaotic, rain-swept conditions to register a 62nd career triumph and fastest lap while nearest title rival Lando Norris of McLaren went from pole position to sixth.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dutchman's triumph lifted him to 393 points, increasing his advantage over Norris, on 331, to 62 with just three Grands Prix and one sprint race remaining.
  <br>
  <br>
  Verstappen finished 19.477 seconds ahead of Alpine's French duo of Esteban Ocon and Pierre Gasly with Mercedes' George Russell fourth and Charles Leclerc fifth for Ferrari in a tumultuous contest of accidents, two red-flag stoppages, penalties and planned post-race investigations.
  <br>
  <br>
  For Alpine, the reward was a leap from ninth to sixth in the constructors championship, reportedly valued at an estimated US$50 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  Norris, who struggled to find his usual pace, came home sixth ahead of McLaren team-mate Oscar Piastri, RB's Yuki Tsunoda and Liam Lawson and seven-time champion Lewis Hamilton in the second Mercedes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Verstappen's success came on the day he overhauled Michael Schumacher's record of leading the drivers standings for 896 days while many of his rivals faced post-race investigations for various sporting misdemeanours.
  <br>
  <br>
  "My emotions have been a rollercoaster today – that unlucky qualifying and starting 17th made it such a tough race, but we stayed out of trouble, made the right calls and it is unbelievable to win here from so far back," said Verstappen.
  <br>
  <br>
  "What a day," said a beaming Ocon. "After this difficult season, it's so nice to drive here and the rain levelled out the performance so I am very happy." (AFP)

    Zverev outclasses Humbert to win Paris Masters

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Germany's Alexander Zverev won the Paris Masters on Sunday by defeating home hope Ugo Humbert 6-2, 6-2 in a dominant display by the new world number two.
 <br>
  <br>
  Zverev, 27, now boasts seven ATP 1000-level titles over the course of his career, following two wins in Rome and Madrid, as well as victories in Montreal and Cincinnati.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was a happy return to Paris for Zverev, after he lost the French Open final in five sets to Carlos Alcaraz in June. Four years ago he lost the 2020 Paris Masters championship match to Daniil Medvedev.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I knew I had to play like this to win today," said Zverev, who opened his victory speech by apologising to the crowd at Paris' Bercy Arena.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I want to congratulate Ugo on an incredible week, he's an incredible player,": he added. "If you continue like this, you'll be able to lift trophies like this. This is not your last chance, Ugo."
  <br>
  <br>
  Zverev's victory in Saturday's semi-final meant the current world number three will overtake Spain's Alcaraz in the new updated rankings.
  <br>
  <br>
  The German will next play the ATP Finals in Turin from November 10-17, where he will seek to emulate his past successes in 2018 and 2021 at the season-ending showpiece.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zverev will head into the event as the player with the most wins this year as Sunday's victory in the French capital was his 66th in 2024, taking him one ahead of world number one Jannik Sinner.
  <br>
  <br>
  For 26-year-old Humbert it was a chastening experience at the end of a week that will live long in his memory as he reached his career-first Masters final on home soil.
  <br>
  <br>
  The world number 18 stunned four-time Grand Slam winner Alcaraz in the last 16 as he delighted the vocal home crowds on his way to becoming the first French finalist at the indoor event in 13 years.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I want to congratulate Zverev for the quality of the tennis he has played all this week, and season," said Humbert.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I came as a kid to watch matches at the Paris Masters, and it made me want to do what I do," he added. "So I'm very happy to have reached the final." (AFP)

    Pro-EU Sandu claims victory in Moldova election

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Moldova’s Western-friendly President Maia Sandu won a second term in a presidential runoff against her opponent who was seen as preferring closer ties with Russia.
 <br>
  <br>
  It was a race which was overshadowed by accusations of Russian interference, voter fraud, and intimidation in the European Union candidate country.
  <br>
  <br>
  With nearly 99 percent of votes counted in the second round of the presidential election held on Sunday, Sandu had 55 percent of the vote, according to the Central Electoral Commission, or CEC, compared with 45 percent for Alexandr Stoianoglo, a former prosecutor general who was backed by the pro-Russia Party of Socialists.
  <br>
  <br>
  The result will be a major relief to those who backed Sandu’s candidacy and her push for Moldova becoming a member of the EU.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Moldova, you are victorious! Today, dear Moldovans, you have given a lesson in democracy, worthy of being written in history books. Today, you have saved Moldova!” Sandu said after claiming victory after midnight.
  <br>
  <br>
  She went on to claim that her country's vote had faced an “unprecedented attack" through alleged schemes including dirty money, vote-buying, and electoral interference “by hostile forces from outside the country" and criminal groups.
  <br>
  <br>
  “You have shown that nothing can stand in the way of the people’s power when they choose to speak through their vote," she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking before the final vote count, Stoianoglo told the media that “everyone’s voice deserves respect” and that he hopes “from now on, we will put an end to the hatred and division imposed on us.”
  <br>
  <br>
  It was not clear if he had publicly commented on his electoral defeat. (AP)

    Angry crowds throw mud at Spain's king in Valencia

<div class="itemFullText">
 Furious locals hurled mud and insults at Spain's king, queen and prime minister on Sunday in a startling show of anger in the worst hit town in the flood disaster that has killed more than 210 people.
 <br>
  <br>
  More heavy rain fell on the Valencia region after King Felipe VI, Queen Letizia and Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez were forced to leave Paiporta where more than 70 people died in floods last Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mud hit the monarchs in the face and clothes as they tried to calm the angry crowd in scenes that underscored the fury over the response to the disaster that has now killed at least 217 people with many more still missing.
  <br>
  <br>
  The king and queen went to a crisis centre in Paiporta. But extra security guards soon had to keep the angry crowd away from the royals and prime minister. They put up umbrellas to stop mud hitting the royal couple.
  <br>
  <br>
  The king said later that Spain had to "understand the anger and frustration" of people affected by the devastation to towns where cars have been left in muddy heaps in streets.

  In a social media video, the king called on the public to give the victims "hope and their guarantee that the state in its entirety is present".

  Most of the fury seemed directed at Prime Minister Sanchez and Valencia regional government head Carlos Mazon.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I understand the social anger and of course, I'm here to receive it. This is my political and moral obligation," Mazon said in a post on X.

  The rear window of Sanchez's car was broken before he and the local politicians quickly left. The socialist leader said that while he empathised with the "anguish and suffering" of the victims, he condemned "all forms of violence".

  Emergency services on Sunday listed 213 dead in the Valencia region, one in Andalusia in the south and three in Castilla-La Mancha neighbouring Valencia.

  Authorities have warned the toll could rise as vehicles trapped in tunnels and underground car parks are cleared. (AFP)

 The three astronauts of the Shenzhou-18 manned mission returned to Earth early on Monday after more than six months aboard the Tiangong space station.
 <br>
  <br>
  Ye Guangfu, Li Cong and Li Guangsu are "in good physical condition," after touching down in the return capsule of their Shenzhou spaceship at the Dongfeng landing site in Inner Mongolia, according to Xinhua News Agency.
  <br>
  <br>
  After leaving the capsule, the trio thanked the country and the people, saying they hope to continue contributing to the country's space programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  The China Manned Space Agency described the mission as "a complete success".
  <br>
  <br>
  Ye, the Shenzhou-18 mission commander, has become the first Chinese astronaut with an accumulative spaceflight time of more than a year, setting a new record for the longest duration of stay in orbit by a Chinese astronaut.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Chinese astronauts have flown to space in successive missions. I believe that the record of the duration in orbit will be broken in the near future," Ye said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Li Cong, who has just completed his first-ever space adventure, said that the crew was united as one and worked closely with the ground team.
  <br>
  <br>
  Li Guangsu also returned from his first spaceflight. "We have all enjoyed the unique experience of weightlessness. It is exciting to return to Earth, but we are also unwilling to part the wonders of the space," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The trio later arrived in Beijing by plane. They will enter a period of medical quarantine and undergo comprehensive medical examinations and health evaluations, and meet with the press afterwards.
  <br>
  <br>
  The three men had travelled to Tiangong in late April and were met on October 30 by three new astronauts, with whom they conducted a five-day handover before making their return journey.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing earlier said it is on track to send a crewed mission to the Moon by 2030, where it intends to construct a base on the lunar surface. (Additional reporting by Xinhua)
