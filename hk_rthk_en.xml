 The observatory said the Strong Wind Signal No 3 will remain in force at least until Sunday 10am, but it expects the chance of issuing a higher warning signal to be rather low.
 <br>
  <br>
  It issued the Strong Wind Signal No 3 at 3.40pm on Saturday, as Super Typhoon Yinxing gradually edges closer to Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Unless Yinxing adopts a more northerly track closer to the Pearl River Estuary, the chance of issuing higher tropical cyclone warning signals will be rather low," the observatory said.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said that the Strong Wind Signal No 3 will remain in force at least until Sunday 10am, and depending on the degree of weakening of local winds, the observatory will then consider lowering it to the Standby Signal No 1.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Education Bureau announced that kindergartens, and schools for children with physical and intellectual disabilities are suspended on Saturday.

<img alt='Chief Secretary Eric Chan says the "Uprising of the Two Airlines" is crucial to the development of the aviation industry in China. Photo: RTHK' src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1778286_1_20241109122804.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Secretary Eric Chan on Saturday said the authorities will continue to work with all sectors to enhance patriotic education in the city.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a photo exhibition marking the 75th anniversary of the outbreak of the "Uprising of the Two Airlines", Chan said the move was crucial to the development of the aviation industry in China.
  <br>
  <br>
  The uprising occurred on November 9, 1949, when 12 aircraft from two Nationalist-controlled airlines took off from Kai Tak Airport in Hong Kong, deviated from their schedule flight paths, and instead went to join the new Communist government in Beijing.
  <br>
  <br>
  After touching down, they were all given a hero’s welcome. Zhou Enlai, the newly appointed premier, hosted a banquet in their honor.
  <br>
  <br>
  The incident would become a watershed moment in Chinese history, and later deemed by Chairman Mao Zedong and Premier Zhou as "the starting point of China's civil aviation of the people with unlimited potential".
  <br>
  <br>
  "Through photo exhibitions and a microfilm, this event promotes major events to the development of the country's civil aviation industry. It's of great significance, telling the story of Hong Kong's unique contribution to this development", Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan added that the SAR government had been using different events and methods to promote patriotism and enhance people's sense of national identity.
  <br>
  <br>
  He went on to say that the Museum of History will set up a permanent exhibition about the history of the "Uprising of the Two Airlines", and the government will be in touch with mainland authorities on relevant materials to display.
  <br>
  <br>
  Air China's director Cui Xiaofeng reaffirmed the airline's commitment to the One Country, Two Systems principle, and said it will continue to support Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have made contributions in promoting Hong Kong's economic prosperity, social harmony and stability," he told the same event.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[We will] support and consolidate Hong Kong's status as an international aviation hub in the future, strengthening Hong Kong's role as a super-connector and a super value-adder."

    Northern Metropolis up for tender starting next year

<img alt="" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1778285_1_20241109124354.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Secretary for Development revealed that the government is aiming to put at least one sizeable land parcel from the Northern Metropolis up for tender next year.
 <br>
  <br>
  In last month's Policy Address, Chief Executive John Lee revealed his administration has earmarked three land parcels of 10 to 20 hectares each as pilot sites, in a bid to speed up land development.
  <br>
  <br>
  The three sites are located in San Tin Technopole, Hung Shui Kiu and Fanling North.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bernadette Linn told a Commercial Radio programme  on Saturday that the government will conduct a survey to assess the market's interest at the end of this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "By then, we will have a list of questions for the developers. We will also tell them the exact location of these three land plots, the infrastructure and facilities that we expect for each land," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That's because we have to let them know exactly which location we are referring to and what the government requires."
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Linn also noted that former Chief Executive CY Leung has raised concerns towards the government's plan to keep increasing land supply, saying that it would cause a heavier financial burden.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government plans to roll out 7,000 hectares of ready-to-use land up by 2048 - three thousand of which will be available in the next decade.
  <br>
  <br>
  The development secretary, however, brushed off his concern. She believes that Leung, who's now the vice-chairman of the nation's top political advisory body, just wants the government to be prudent.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I hope the public can see how determined we are in terms of land production.  But we're also emphasising that we will be prudent, and I realise the word 'prudent' is what we have in common."
  <br>
  <br>
  She went on to say that some people are worried that the authorities might be reckless in rolling out ready-to-use land by ignoring the vacancy rate and housing prices at a time when the economy is not in its best shape.

<img alt="Donovan Mitchell and the Cleveland Cavaliers maintain their perfect start to the season. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1778284_1_20241109122355.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Cleveland Cavaliers continued their perfect start to the NBA season in sensational style on Friday, seizing a 41-point halftime lead on the way to a 136-117 rout of the Golden State Warriors.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Cavs improved to 10-0, ending the Warriors' five-game winning streak and handing them their first road defeat of the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  The damage was done early, the Cavs' 83 first-half points tying a franchise record for most scored in any half and their 41-point halftime lead the biggest in team history.
  <br>
  <br>
  Against the Warriors' second-ranked defense, the Cavs posted their fifth game of the young season with at least 130 points.
  <br>
  <br>
  That ties a team record for the most 130-plus point games for an entire season.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Ten-0 is a magic number," Cavs coach Kenny Atkinson said. "We're playing really good basketball and I'm just really pleased where the group is.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I was worried about tonight - they're 7-1 and rolling and they're coming in here, they're champions and they're going to try and knock our block off."
  <br>
  <br>
  Darius Garland scored 27 points, Evan Mobley added 23 and Ty Jerome chipped in 20 off the bench as six Cavs players scored in double figures against a Warriors defense that came in ranked second in the league.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, they kept the potentially explosive Warriors offense in check, opening the game on a 20-2 scoring run.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The way we came out tonight, that surprised me, how ready we were, how hungry we were," Atkinson said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Andrew Wiggins with nine points and Stephen Curry with seven were the only Warriors starters to score before the break.
  <br>
  <br>
  Golden State were able to adjust after the break, out-scoring the Cavs 41-29 in the third quarter.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Warriors, however, were in too deep a hole.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jonathan Kuminga led Golden State with 21 points off the bench, Curry finished with 12 on five-of-10 shooting, making just one from three-point range. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Beijing's top official on Hong Kong affairs emphasised the important role of the business sector in boosting the city's economy and improving people's livelihood, according to Hong Kong Productivity Council chairman Sunny Tan.
 <br>
  <br>
  The director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, Xia Baolong, met representatives of the Hong Kong business sector in Shenzhen on Friday, with Chief Executive John Lee also in attendance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a radio programme on Saturday, Tan, who was at the closed-door meeting, said Xia urged the business sector to take the initiative to discover new business opportunities and new markets.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We do need to have a determination to make change. It's not about just the government, but in all our sectors... We all need to look at the external environment, look into the development progress of China and see what we got to do from our side," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For example, put in more investment into innovation technology. How do we maneuver the new dynamics of the external environment on our supply chain management? All this is very important and we have to make that change."
  <br>
  <br>
  The US Federal Reserve cut interest rates by 0.25 percentage points, which led to major banks in the SAR also cutting their Hong Kong dollar best lending rates.
  <br>
  <br>
  Executive councillor Jeffrey Lam told the same radio programme that the rate cut would benefit the city, especially small and medium enterprises (SMEs).
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think this is expected. I think we're going to see maybe more activity in the property market. As for the SMEs, the rate cut will reduce their spending on interest," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It will help their business and also their cash flow. I hope by seeing more interest reduction, maybe more to come, our business activity will get better," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lam added that he expects there would not be many changes in terms of US policies towards China, after Donald Trump won the US presidential election against Kamala Harris.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce plans to visit the US next year to meet with business representatives and potentially secure new business opportunities.

<div class="itemFullText">
 China's consumer inflation rate slowed in October, official data showed on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The consumer price index (CPI), a key measure of inflation, rose 0.3 percent year-on-year in October, down from 0.4 percent in September, the National Bureau of Statistics said.
  <br>
  <br>
  This comes as authorities on Friday unveiled a sweeping plan to lift local government debt and boost spending.
  <br>
  <br>
  In September, Beijing began unveiling fresh measures aimed at boosting economic activity,  including rate cuts and the easing of some home purchasing restrictions. (AFP)

 The observatory said on Saturday it will issue the Strong Wind Signal No 3 at 3.40pm, as Super Typhoon Yinxing edges closer to Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  It said local winds are expected to strengthen later in the day, with winds on high ground occasionally reaching gale force.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Observatory said Yinxing will skirt more than 300 kilometres to the south of Hong Kong on Sunday morning, so a tropical cyclone warning signal is expected to remain in force until then.
  <br>
  <br>
  The cross-harbour swim was originally scheduled for Sunday, but the organiser decided to call off the race.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Due to the potential for inclement weather brought by Tropical Storm Yinxing and to ensure the safety of all swimmers, under careful consideration, the organisers have made the difficult decision to cancel the New World Harbour Race 2024," it wrote on social media.
  <br>
  <br>
  It added that all qualified swimmers will receive a full refund.

<img alt="Wall Street ended the week higher, with investors upbeat about the business agenda of President-elect Donald Trump.

<div class="itemFullText">
 US markets finished at fresh records on Friday, ending a buoyant week on a positive note prompted by relief at the swift resolution of the US presidential election.
 <br>
  <br>
  The S&P 500 finished at 5,995.54, up 0.4 percent for the day and 4.7 percent for the week as markets welcomed President-elect Donald Trump's growth agenda.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.6 percent to 43,988.99, while the Nasdaq Composite Index gained 0.1 percent to 19,286.78.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're in this honeymoon period between Election Day and Inauguration Day, which we saw in previous election cycles," said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Cresset Capital Management.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ablin thinks the strength in US equities could extend through the rest of 2024, but cautioned that worries about overvaluation will grow if the market keeps rising.
  <br>
  <br>
  Market watchers have greeted Trump's win in anticipation that tax cuts and regulatory relief will more than offset the ills of higher tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump appointees are also expected to permit more corporate dealmaking, boosting mergers and acquisitions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Friday marked the debut in the Dow of chip company Nvidia, which declined 0.8 percent and paint company Sherwin-Williams, which rose 0.8 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Airbnb fell 8.7 percent after reporting earnings that narrowly missed analyst expectations. Briefing.com said "investments beyond the company's core markets are adding cost, casting a cloud on otherwise uplifting trends from the quarter." (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ineos Britannia has been accepted as the Challenger of Record for the next edition of the America's Cup sailing competition, organisers announced on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Emirates Team New Zealand completed a commanding 7-2 victory against their British opponents on October 19 and the challenge was lodged immediately.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Royal New Zealand Yacht Squadron (RNZYS) and Emirates Team New Zealand are pleased to confirm that the RNZYS has accepted a Notice of Challenge for the 38th America's Cup (AC38) from the Royal Yacht Squadron Limited, represented by Ineos Britannia, which will act as the Challenger of Record for AC38," said a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Emirates Team New Zealand CEO Grant Dalton said: "The 38th America's Cup effectively started the moment the team crossed the finish line in Barcelona on 19th October.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is very exciting to have continuity with the Challenger of Record, Ineos Britannia, to continue to build the scale of the America's Cup globally."
  <br>
  <br>
  The AC38 would be a "multi-challenger event." At this year's America's Cup, Ineos Britannia won a qualifying event that enabled them to take on the defending champions for the trophy.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Royal Yacht Squadron said it would "work alongside The Royal New Zealand Yacht Squadron" to deliver the protocol for the trophy.
  <br>
  <br>
  The class of yacht will be the AC75 and teams will be restricted to building one boat.
  <br>
  <br>
  No date has yet been set but the statement from the organisers said it is "intended that the AC38 match be held within three years of the completion of the AC37 match."
  <br>
  <br>
  Team New Zealand won the world's oldest international sporting trophy for the third consecutive time to end the best-of-13 series.
  <br>
  <br>
  The British boat was skippered by four-time Olympic gold medallist Ben Ainslie and is bankrolled by British billionaire Jim Ratcliffe, chairman of petrochemical group Ineos.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ainslie said he would keep going until he won Britain the trophy, but did not know if that would still be as a sailor or in a different position. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Global food prices rose in October to their highest level in 18 months, with a sharp increase in the cost of vegetable oil, the Food and Agriculture Organisation said on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The FAO Food Price Index, which tracks monthly changes in international prices of a basket of food commodities, reached 127.4 points last month, a two-percent increase from September.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was the highest since April 2023 but still 20.5 percent lower than the peak reached in March 2022 following Russia's assault on agricultural powerhouse Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vegetable oil prices increased by 7.3 percent in October, reaching a two-year high due to lower production.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sugar prices rose 2.6 percent, dairy was up 2.5 percent and cereals gained 0.8 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meat was the only commodity to fall, down 0.3 percent from the previous month.
  <br>
  <br>
  The FAO is an agency of the United Nations. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A Nations League football match between France and Israel will go ahead as planned in Paris next week despite the clashes that erupted in Amsterdam following a game between Maccabi Tel Aviv and Ajax, the French interior minister said on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The game at the Stade de France on Thursday has been identified as a potential flashpoint but Bruno Retailleau said France would not "back down."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Some are calling for the France-Israel match to be relocated. I do not accept this," Retailleau wrote on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  "France is not backing down because that would amount to giving up in the face of threats of violence and anti-Semitism," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Retailleau said he had asked Paris police chief Laurent Nunez to take the necessary security measures for the match.
  <br>
  <br>
  A lawmaker from Marine Le Pen's National Rally (RN) party, Julien Odoul, on Thursday suggested moving the match to the island of Corsica.
  <br>
  <br>
  Violence flared in Amsterdam after a Europa League match on Thursday between Ajax and Maccabi Tel Aviv.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israeli, Dutch and European leaders on Friday condemned the "anti-Semitic" clashes and Israel sent rescue planes for its citizens.
  <br>
  <br>
  The mayor of Amsterdam Femke Halsema said the violence represented an "explosion" of anti-Semitism that has "not been seen in a long time," describing "hit and run" attacks on Maccabi supporters by "hooligans on scooters." (AFP)

    Treat SAR as your home, Xia tells business leaders

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The top Beijing official on Hong Kong affairs has urged the local business community to see the SAR as their home, while consolidating the city's traditional advantages, during a closed-door exchange in Shenzhen, according to Xinhua News Agency.
 <br>
  <br>
  Xia Baolong, director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office (HKMAO), on Friday also told business magnates and entrepreneurs that they are the "main force" in promoting economic development.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[Business leaders] must stand firm in treating Hong Kong as their home and utilising Hong Kong to prosper, consolidate and enhance Hong Kong's traditional advantages," Xia was quoted as saying by the report.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong's business community and entrepreneurs are the main force in promoting economic development. They have made outstanding contributions to maintaining Hong Kong's prosperity and stability, and assisting in the country's modernisation."
  <br>
  <br>
  The report also said Xia told those at the exchange to support the SAR government in implementing its long-term development plans, and tell the good Hong Kong story and safeguard the city's international image, among other things.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chief Executive John Lee, who was in attendance with his principal officials, said his administration will unite and lead all sectors of Hong Kong to implement reforms and "break new ground" in the city's development, according to Xinhua.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sunwah Group chairman Jonathan Choi, who was among 29 business leaders at the meeting, said discussions focused on their role in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As Hong Kong's economy relies on entrepreneurs, [Xia] hopes that entrepreneurs will go all out and follow the central government's strategy," Choi said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pui Kwan-kay, president of the Hong Kong Chinese Importers' and Exporters’ Association, said the Beijing official noted that the city had gone through trials and tribulations.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[Xia said] the current situation in Hong Kong has been stable, and we should take advantage of this period of transitioning from stability to prosperity to do our best," Pui said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other business leaders and property tycoons included Richard Li, who chairs Pacific Century Group; Peter Lee, co-chairman and managing director of Henderson Land; and Raymond Kwok, chairman and managing director of Sun Hung Kai Properties.
  <br>
  <br>
  They attended a full-day symposium and joined a dinner, with HKMAO executive deputy director Zhou Ji and the head of Beijing's liaison office in Hong Kong, Zheng Yanxiong, who also took part in the meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  During a trip to Hong Kong in February, Xia also focused on the city's economic developments. Last month, the senior Beijing official separately met executives of Jardine Matheson and HSBC in Beijing.

    Majority of Gaza war dead women, children: UN probe

<img alt="The UN human rights office says about 80 percent of all the verified deaths in Gaza had occurred in Israeli attacks on residential buildings or similar housing. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1778223_1_20241108220743.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The UN on Friday condemned the staggering number of civilians killed in Israel's war in Gaza, with women and children comprising nearly 70 percent of the thousands of fatalities it had managed to verify.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a fresh report, slammed by Israel, the United Nations human rights office (OHCHR) detailed a raft of violations of international law since Hamas's deadly October 7 attack in Israel sparked the war in the Gaza Strip.
  <br>
  <br>
  Many could amount to war crimes, crimes against humanity and possibly even "genocide," it warned, demanding international efforts to prevent "atrocity crimes" and ensure accountability.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Civilians in Gaza have borne the brunt of the attacks, including through the initial 'complete siege' of Gaza by Israeli forces," the UN said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Conduct by Israeli forces has caused unprecedented levels of killings, death, injury, starvation, illness and disease."
  <br>
  <br>
  It pointed to "the Israeli government's continuing unlawful failures to allow, facilitate and ensure the entry of humanitarian aid, the destruction of civilian infrastructure, and repeated mass displacement."
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel's mission to the UN in Geneva "categorically" rejected the report, decrying "the inherent obsession of OHCHR with the demonisation of Israel."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Gaza is now a rubble-strewn landscape," Ajith Sunghay, head of the UN rights office's activities in the Palestinian territories, said via video-link from Amman.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Within this dystopia of destruction and devastation, those alive are left injured, displaced and starving."
  <br>
  <br>
  Friday's report also found that Hamas and other armed groups had committed widespread violations that could amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity, including seizing hostages, killings, torture and sexual violence.
  <br>
  <br>
  Those violations, it said, were especially committed in connection with the October 7, 2023 attack, which resulted in 1,206 deaths, mostly of civilians, according to a tally of official Israeli figures.
  <br>
  <br>
  The report also tackled the contentious issue of the proportion of civilians among the nearly 43,500 people killed in Gaza so far, according to the health ministry in the Palestinian territory.
  <br>
  <br>
  UN agencies have been relying on death tolls provided by the authorities in Hamas-run Gaza due to lack of access. This has sparked harsh criticism from Israel but the UN has repeatedly said the figures are reliable.
  <br>
  <br>
  The rights office said it had now managed to verify around 10,000 of the more than 34,500 people reportedly killed during the first six months of the war.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have so far found close to 70 percent to be children and women," Sunghay said, highlighting the stringent verification methodology that requires at least three separate sources.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the findings indicated "a systematic violation of the fundamental principles of international humanitarian law".
  <br>
  <br>
  He said 4,700 of the verified fatalities were children and 2,461 were women.
  <br>
  <br>
  The rights office found that about 80 percent of all the verified deaths in Gaza had occurred in Israeli attacks on residential buildings or similar housing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Children between the ages of five and nine made up the largest group of victims, with the youngest victim a one-day-old boy and the oldest a 97-year-old woman, it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel says its operations in Gaza target militants and are in line with international law.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Friday's report stressed that the verified deaths largely Gaza's demographic makeup rather than that of combatants.
  <br>
  <br>
  This, it said, clearly "raises concerns regarding compliance with the principle of distinction and reflect an apparent failure to take all feasible precautions to avoid, and in any event to minimise, incidental loss of civilian life."
  <br>
  <br>
  UN rights chief Volker Turk called on all countries to work to halt the violations and to ensure accountability, including through universal jurisdiction.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is essential that there is due reckoning with respect to the allegations of serious violations of international law through credible and impartial judicial bodies," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The violence must stop immediately, the hostages and those arbitrarily detained must be released, and we must focus on flooding Gaza with humanitarian aid." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The mayor of Amsterdam on Friday announced tighter security measures in the city after five people were hospitalised and 62 arrested as a result of clashes that erupted in Amsterdam overnight following a football match.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Several reports about last night's events in Amsterdam are circulating on social media," the city’s police said in a post on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The police have launched a major investigation into multiple violent incidents," it said, adding that “the police are aware of reports regarding a possible hostage situation and missing persons but currently have no confirmation that this actually took place. This aspect is also under investigation.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Police said fans had left Johan Cruyff Arena without incident after the Europa League match, which Ajax won 5-0 against Maccabi Tel Aviv, but that clashes erupted overnight in the city centre.
  <br>
  <br>
  That is despite a ban on a pro-Palestinian demonstration near the soccer stadium imposed by Amsterdam Mayor Femke Halsema, who had feared that clashes would break out between protesters and supporters of the Israeli soccer club.
  <br>
  <br>
  Halsema later said she was “ashamed” at what happened in the city, and  announced a temporary ban on protests.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israeli and Dutch leaders have condemned the violence. Israel initially ordered that two planes be sent to the Dutch capital to bring the football fans home, but later the prime minister's office said it would work on "providing civil aviation solutions for the return of our citizens”.
  <br>
  <br>
  A statement from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said that “the harsh pictures of the assault on our citizens in Amsterdam will not be overlooked," and that Netanyahu "views the horrifying incident with utmost gravity." He demanded that the Dutch government take “vigorous and swift action" against those involved.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof said he was "horrified by the anti-Semitic attacks on Israeli citizens", which he called "completely unacceptable".
  <br>
  <br>
  Schoof assured Netanyahu by phone that "the perpetrators will be identified and prosecuted", he said in a statement on the social media platform X. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A local bartender on Friday reigned supreme in a Greater Bay Area mixology competition, which showcased the best flairtenders from Macau and Guangdong province.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong International Mixology Showdown 2024, organised by the SAR's Bartenders Association, hosted its inaugural GBA region competition in conjunction with this year's International Wine and Spirits Fair held at the convention centre in Wan Chai.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thirty-six competitors from the two SARs, as well as Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Nansha, Jiangmen and Zhuhai, impressed the judges at the bar table with their flair and finesse.
  <br>
  <br>
  Champion Kenneth Tsang, from the Hong Kong Jockey Club, said he was ecstatic to win on home soil.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think this is a great opportunity to see other competitors from other [regions] because you can learn a lot during the competition because you can see every technique, skill and other things that you can't see in Hong Kong," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think we can join more competitions [in the future] to make friends with each other, communicate with other bars or restaurants to build [each other] up."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Bartenders Association's Ken Chau said the purpose of the event is to promote the exchange of bartending culture among the different regions, adding that more competitions can help elevate the SAR's status as a regional trading hub for wine and spirits.
  <br>
  <br>
  And even though the government has relaxed duties on liquor, Chau said many bars have suffered significantly due to different consumption habits in Hong Kong. He hopes that this will change soon.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The spirits tax doesn't help a lot of sales to be honest, but it does help start a new path, especially Chinese Baijius because Chinese Baijius will be the next big trend in Hong Kong," he added.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The nation's lawmakers have approved a bill to raise the ceiling on local government debt by six trillion yuan to replace existing hidden debts, an official said on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The nation's top legislative body, the standing committee of the National People's Congress (NPC), approved the bill during a meeting from November 4 to 8, said Xu Hongcai, vice chairman of the financial and economic affairs committee of the NPC.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xu, who made the remarks at a press conference in Beijing, added that the debt swap would help resolve local debt risks.
  <br>
  <br>
  At the same press conference, Finance Minister Lan Foan said "hidden debt" of local governments stood at 14.3 trillion yuan at the end of 2023, which authorities planned to trim to 2.3 trillion yuan by 2028.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lan also said authorities will issue policies to support state sector purchases of unsold apartments and reclaim undeveloped residential land from property developers, as well as replenish the capital of big state banks, but did not give details on the size or timing of those measures.
  <br>
  <br>
  Broadcaster CCTV described the move as China's "most powerful debt reduction measure in recent years", adding the move would free "up space for local governments to better develop the economy and protect people's livelihood".
  <br>
  <br>
  At the closing NPC meeting, lawmakers also voted to adopt a preschool education law, and revised laws on anti-money laundering, the protection of cultural relics, and mineral resources, as well as an energy law.
  <br>
  <br>
  President Xi Jinping signed seven presidential orders to promulgate the laws and the decisions. (Agencies)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 About 2,500 people on Friday attended a job fair, where about 70 companies are looking for top talents in Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  The fair – the second recruitment event that the Hong Kong Top Talent Services Association has held this year – is offering over 1,500 jobs.
  <br>
  <br>
  The association’s founder Shang Hailong pointed out that this edition of the fair is “totally different” in terms of its reach.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Today, this job fair is totally different. We cooperated with the Hong Kong Talent Engage Office, we cooperated with Oases (Office for Attracting Strategic Enterprises)…Different committees joined this job fair, that’s a big difference.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Shang added that more than 4,000 people had signed up for the event.
  <br>
  <br>
  Property giant Sun Hung Kai Properties was one of the companies offering jobs at the fair.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bonnie Soo, Assistant Manager of Human Resources revealed that the group is targetting candidates from the mainland.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The businesses of Sun Hung Kai Properties are not just in Hong Kong – we have a lot of property projects on the mainland. We recruit people from the mainland to understand more about the customers there – what they need and what they want."
  <br>
  <br>
  One jobseeker from the mainland, Scarlett Chen, said she hopes to find a better job at the fair.
  <br>
  <br>
  “On the mainland, for example for the IT industry, there is an age limit. And in recent years, the economic situation wasn’t good, [so] there are no promotion prospects or wage increases.”

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong will participate in organising the cross-border events of the National Games, including marathon and road cycling competitions, organisers said on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  To be held next year from November 9 to 21, it will be the first time for the National Games to be co-hosted by Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macau.
  <br>
  <br>
  The event’s coordination office head Yeung Tak-keung told a countdown press conference that apart from hosting eight competitions, the SAR will also help organise the athletics marathon hosted by Shenzhen, and road cycling hosted by Zhuhai.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gao Chao, the publicity department director for the General Administration of Sport of China, said Guangzhou and Shenzhen have finished planning for the games’ opening and closing ceremonies, and that authorities are planning out the route for the torch relay.
  <br>
  <br>
  Guangdong sports bureau director Cui Jian, meanwhile, said renovation and construction of venues in the province will be completed in March of next year.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Observatory issued the Standby Signal No. 1 at 12.40pm today as Tropical Cyclone Yinxing edges closer to the coast of southern China.
 <br>
  <br>
  It said the T1 signal is expected to remain in place until at least noon on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Depending on the distance between Yinxing and the Pearl River Estuary, intensity of Yinxing and the local wind conditions, the Observatory will then assess the need for issuance of the Strong Wind Signal No. 3," the forecaster said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A tropical cyclone warning signal is expected to remain in force at least until Sunday morning."
  <br>
  <br>
  It added that under the combined effect of Yinxing and the northeast monsoon, it will be windier over the coast of Guangdong and on high ground over the weekend.
  <br>
  <br>
  Seas will be rough with swells and there will be showers, the observatory said.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Justice Paul Lam on Friday said incorporating mediation clauses in all future government contracts would not only save time, but also reduce costs for all parties involved.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters on the final day of Hong Kong Legal Week, Lam stressed the government's intention to promote mediation as a means of resolving conflicts amicably.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The government is willing to take the lead in the hope that we can cultivate the culture in the society as a whole. So that when the people encounter disputes, the first thing that they would consider is not to go to court, but instead to try to resolve this view by mediation, by a means which in our belief is more economical, more time-saving, and resulting in a more harmonious result,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The justice chief added he wants the government to be an example for the private sector to follow as well.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, Lam said he had initial discussions during his first meeting with the Hong Kong International Legal Talents Training Expert Committee, composed of three advisory boards, with 17 legal experts and scholars from prominent international, mainland, and local legal organisations and universities.
  <br>
  <br>
  He expressed his hope to leverage this platform for greater capacity-building efforts and to emphasise more practical applications when developing training programmes and strategies.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Paralympics double gold medallist Ho Yuen-kei on Friday said she hopes to raise public awareness of people with special needs, after a Thai restaurant refused to admit her because of her wheelchair.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on an RTHK programme, the boccia player said she was refused entry to a Causeway Bay restaurant, with the staff saying her wheelchair could block other diners.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho said attitudes towards the disabled had improved over the past decade, but more needs to be done.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Can there be more training for staff to improve awareness? Not just for wheelchair users, but restaurants may also think of how to help those who are visually impaired," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We understand that there may be difficulties - especially for small shops in Hong Kong - but we can work together. For example, some small restaurants have ramps for people with disabilities or wheelchair users."
  <br>
  <br>
  Simon Wong, head of the Federation of Restaurants and Related Trades, said the incident was not common, but it showed that some restaurants may not be familiar with the city's anti-discrimination legislation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Most restaurants have training for their staff, but some small-scale ones may have overlooked [this] during the training process. We hope the catering sector and the government could do more promotion," he told the same programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho said the Thai restaurant’s manager apologised to her and she accepted the apology.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) on Friday announced it had cut its base rate by 25 basis points to five percent with immediate effect.
 <br>
  <br>
  The base rate is the benchmark for repo transactions under the discount window.
  <br>
  <br>
  The HKMA said it cut the rate in response to an overnight cut in the US federal funds rate.
  <br>
  <br>
  In response, HSBC, Hang Seng Bank and the Bank of China said they would cut their best lending rates by a quarter of percentage point to 5.375 percent from Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Overnight, the US Federal Reserve announced a rate cut of a quarter of a percentage point after policy-makers voted unanimously to lower the rate to between 4.50 and 4.75 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, the HKMA said the pace of Fed rate cuts was still uncertain, posing a risk to global financial market volatility.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The rate-cut cycle in the US is still at its initial stage. Interest rates might still remain at relatively high levels for some time. The public should carefully assess and continue to manage the interest rate risk when making property purchase, mortgage or other borrowing decisions," the authority said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under the Hong Kong dollar peg mechanism, interest rates move in lockstep with the US.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mackie Lau, Standard Chartered's co-Head of Treasury Markets in Greater China, North Asia and Hong Kong, said Donald Trump's proposed economic policies might affect the Fed's moves to tamp down inflation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's plan includes tax cuts, tariffs and a mass deportation of illegal immigrants.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Once Trump really starts to take office and begins to roll out his policies, that's the time when the market will begin to be more concerned with what will happen to the economy," Lau told an online press call.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think we will need at least three, six months before that will all come through. Of course, the worry is that rates might have to reverse course and go higher because of the worry about inflation, but that's more for the longer term."
  <br>
  <br>
  Martin Wong, director of real estate consultancy Knight Frank, meanwhile, said local housing prices may hit bottom by the end of this year, as the Fed continues its rate cuts.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Now with the rates gradually being lowered, we are expecting the market purchasing power to go up a little bit and to be unleashed gradually. I think the property prices would find bottom in the fourth quarter in 2024," he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The market sentiment for 2025 must be better than 2024 in order to support a rebound," Wong added.

    Trump names his White House chief of staff

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President-elect Donald Trump has named Susie Wiles, the de-facto manager of his victorious campaign, as his White House chief of staff, the first woman to hold the influential role.
 <br>
  <br>
  Wiles is widely credited within and outside Trump’s inner circle for running what was, by far, his most disciplined and well-executed campaign, and was seen as the leading contender for the position.
  <br>
  <br>
  She largely avoided the spotlight, even refusing to take the mic to speak as Trump celebrated his victory early Wednesday morning.
  <br>
  <br>
  She resisted the formal title of campaign manager, avoiding becoming a target, given Trump’s history of cycling through people in that role.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wiles’ hire is Trump’s first major decision as president-elect and one that could be a defining test of his incoming administration, as he must quickly build the team that will help run the massive federal government.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wiles doesn’t bring much federal government experience to the role, but has a close relationship with the president-elect.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the campaign, Wiles was able to do what few others have been able to: help control Trump’s impulses — not by chiding him or lecturing, but by earning his respect and showing him that he was better off when he followed her advice than flouting it. (AP)

 President Xi Jinping will travel to Peru and Brazil next week for meetings of APEC and the G20, Beijing's foreign ministry said on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Xi will go to Lima from November 13 to 17 and Rio de Janeiro from November 17 to 21, foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Peru, Xi will "attend the 31st APEC Economic Leaders' Meeting and pay a state visit", Hua said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi will then travel to Rio de Janeiro from November 17 to 21 to attend the 19th G20 Summit and will pay a state visit to Brazil at the invitation of Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, Hua added.

  China is Brazil's top trading partner, exceeding US$180 billion in each-way trade in 2023, with semiconductors, phones and pharmaceuticals dominating exports to the South American country.
  <br>
  <br>
  A visit this year by Vice President Geraldo Alckmin was seen as paving the way for Brazil to join China's massive Belt and Road Initiative.
  <br>
  <br>
  A number of South American nations, including Peru, have already signed up to the initiative. (AFP/Agencies)

    F1 takes on FIA chief in open letter amid swearing row

<div class="itemFullText">
 Formula One drivers on Thursday blasted the "tone and language" used by FIA president Mohammed Ben Sulayem amid a row over swearing at press conferences.
 <br>
  <br>
  In an open letter, the Grand Prix Drivers' Association (GPDA) also demanded that competitors be treated like adults.
  <br>
  <br>
  Several drivers, including three-time world champion Max Verstappen of the Netherlands and Monaco's Charles Leclerc, were recently sanctioned by the FIA for swearing at a press conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  And Ben Sulayem has spoken out in favour of measures to ensure drivers no longer use foul language.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Thursday, the GPDA hit back with a letter posted on social media regarding 'Driver Misconduct'.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There is a difference between swearing intended to insult others and more casual swearing, such as you might use to describe bad weather, or indeed an inanimate object such as an F1 car, or a driving situation," the letter read.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We urge the FIA president to consider his own tone and language when talking to our member drivers, or indeed about them, whether in a public forum or otherwise," it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Further, our members are adults," it went on to say. "They do not need to be given instructions via the media, about matters as trivial as the wearing of jewellery or underpants."
  <br>
  <br>
  Seven-time world champion Lewis Hamilton has clashed with FIA bosses for wearing jewellery at races, with the governing body also reminding drivers of the need to wear flame-resistant underwear.
  <br>
  <br>
  The GPDA also stressed its opposition to financial sanctions against drivers and called on Ben Sulayem to clarify how they are imposed and how their proceeds are used.
  <br>
  <br>
  Relations between Ben Sulayem, team bosses and drivers have deteriorated in recent months.
  <br>
  <br>
  The FIA president was accused at the start of the year of trying to derail the 2023 Las Vegas Grand Prix and influence the results of the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix the same year.
  <br>
  <br>
  In both cases, the Emirati was cleared by the FIA Ethics Committee. (AFP)

    World number two Swiatek crashes out of WTA Finals

<img alt="The world number two needed a victory from Gauff to advance to the last four. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1778086_1_20241108080912.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 World number two Iga Swiatek was eliminated from the WTA Finals on Thursday after Barbora Krejcikova defeated Coco Gauff to secure her spot in the semi-finals at the expense of the Pole.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Czech Wimbledon champion claimed a 7-5, 6-4 victory over Gauff to end the title defence of Swiatek, who needed Krejcikova to lose in order to progress from the group stage.
  <br>
  <br>
  With one win and one loss under her belt entering the last day of round-robin play, Swiatek's 6-1, 6-0 victory over alternate Daria Kasatkina did not have any bearing on her qualification chances.
  <br>
  <br>
  The only scenario that would have led to Swiatek's advancement to the semi-finals would have been a Gauff win over Krejcikova.
  <br>
  <br>
  That result did not materialise though, and Krejcikova punched her ticket to the semi-finals of the WTA Finals for the first time – on her second singles appearance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Krejcikova moves forward as the winner of the Orange Group, and will face Zheng Qinwen in Friday's last-four stage, with Gauff of the United States advancing as the runner-up to set up a semi-final showdown with world number one Aryna Sabalenka.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Definitely this is a big win for me. I'm really happy with how I played and with my performance today. It was a really big match," said Krejcikova, who saved a remarkable 11 of 12 break points against Gauff.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Playing tomorrow again is something unimaginable before this tournament and I'm really proud of myself and I'm looking forward to the new challenges.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I was just fighting for every ball, and I knew it's going to be difficult because I know Coco is on a roll and she's one of the best players this season," she added. "That was a huge challenge but also the big prize, the semis was on the table – I am super excited to be here."
  <br>
  <br>
  Gauff saved two match points in a 10-minute final game and had three opportunities to break Krejcikova but the eighth seed would not fold, and she scooped the victory with a service winner after one hour and 42 minutes of play.
  <br>
  <br>
  Krejcikova, who has won just 21 matches this season, earned her place in the WTA Finals field due to a new rule introduced by the Tour in 2024, which gives priority to a reigning Grand Slam champion over the eighth-ranked player in the race.
  <br>
  <br>
  As the Wimbledon champion, Krejcikova grabbed the last spot in Riyadh over world number eight Emma Navarro, who chose not to come to Saudi Arabia as an alternate. (AFP)

    Mbappé left out of France squad for internationals

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Kylian Mbappé has been left out of the France squad for their upcoming Uefa Nations League matches against Israel and Italy, with coach Didier Deschamps insisting the absence of the Real Madrid superstar "is for the best".
 <br>
  <br>
  It is the second successive France squad from which the national team captain has been absent after he also missed the October double-header against Israel and Belgium.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I have spoken with him and I have made the decision for this get-together because I think it is for the best," Deschamps told reporters at a press conference in Paris.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 25-year-old Mbappé was rested for last month's matches in order to help him recover from a minor thigh injury suffered playing for Real.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, that quickly became a source of controversy when he returned to action for Real days later, before France had even played.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mbappé was absent for France's 4-1 win over Israel in a game played in Budapest and a 2-1 win in Belgium, and instead travelled to Stockholm for a short break with members of his entourage.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was following that trip that Swedish media reported he was being investigated for an alleged rape. Mbappé himself said those reports were "fake news", while his lawyer said the player would take action for libel.
  <br>
  <br>
  A Swedish prosecutor confirmed that an investigation had been opened, without naming Mbappe.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I am not going to set out my argument, but I can say two things. The first is that Kylian wanted to come," Deschamps added. "The second is that it is not to do with the off-field problems because the presumption of innocence exists."
  <br>
  <br>
  Since last month's controversy, the ex-Paris Saint-Germain forward has made four appearances for his club, scoring one goal. However, he remains short of his explosive best form.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I don't want to say any more about it. I stand by my decision," Deschamps added.
  <br>
  <br>
  France are second in Group A2 of the Nations League, one point behind leaders Italy, ahead of their final two fixtures.
  <br>
  <br>
  They host Israel at the Stade de France next Thursday, November 14, and then play Italy in Milan three days later.
  <br>
  <br>
  France are five points clear of Belgium in third place and the top two teams will qualify for the quarter-finals, which will take place over two legs next March.
  <br>
  <br>
  The semi-finals and final will be played next June.
  <br>
  <br>
  Veteran midfielder N'Golo Kante, of Al Ittihad in Saudi Arabia, returns to the squad along with Adrien Rabiot of Marseille.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, there is a first call-up for highly-rated Lille goalkeeper Lucas Chevalier, who takes the place of West Ham United's Alphonse Areola in the squad. (AFP)

    Biden vows peaceful White House handover

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Joe Biden pledged a peaceful transfer of power Thursday after Donald Trump's stunning US election win.
 <br>
  <br>
  Biden, 81, urged Americans in a solemn televised address to "bring down the temperature," in stark contrast to Trump's refusal to accept his 2020 election defeat.
  <br>
  <br>
  As Trump began to work at his Florida resort on his transition team, Biden said he would work for an "orderly" transfer of power.
  <br>
  <br>
  In his speech from the Rose Garden of the White House, he called for unity while urging Democrats not to lose hope, saying: "Remember, a defeat does not mean we are defeated."
  <br>
  <br>
  Yet finger-pointing has already erupted in the party over Biden's initial decision to run for a second term despite his age, before dropping out at the last minute in July and handing the reins to Harris, his vice president.
  <br>
  <br>
  The White House denied Biden had any regrets. "He believed it was the right decision to make at that time," Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said. (AFP)

 The S&P 500 and Nasdaq powered to fresh records on Thursday after the Federal Reserve cut interest rates, extending a buoyant post-election rally.
 <br>
  <br>
  While the Dow finished essentially flat, both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq jumped to new all-time highs, with large tech companies like Facebook parent Meta and Apple surging.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Nasdaq Composite gained 1.51 percent, to 19,269. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was largely unchanged at 43,729, but the S&P 500 gained 0.74 percent, to 5,973.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Fed shrugged off concerns about the impact of Donald Trump's election victory and moved ahead with a quarter point interest rate cut.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the near term, the election will have no effects on our policy decisions," Fed Chair Jerome Powell told reporters, noting there was still uncertainty about what President-elect Trump's actual economic agenda would be.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We don't guess, we don't speculate, and we don't assume," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  All three major indices had earlier hit all-time highs on Wednesday as markets greeted Trump's election win in anticipation that tax cuts and the de-regulation would offset the impact of higher tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Markets were cheered by Powell's tone, which kept the door open to further interest rate cuts.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Of course, there's going to be a debate about the pace of rate cuts, but policy makers and chair Powell mentioned that they continue to think that policy is restrictive," said Angelo Kourkafas, senior investment strategist at Edward Jones.
  <br>
  <br>
  While tech shares advanced, banking shares pulled back after a torrid session on Wednesday. Bank of America dropped 1.4 percent, while JPMorgan Chase fell 4.3 percent. (AFP)

    Putin and Trump say they are ready to talk

<div class="itemFullText">
 Russia's President Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump indicated Thursday that they were ready to hold talks after the Republican tycoon emerged as the victor in the race for the White House.
 <br>
  <br>
  "I take this opportunity to congratulate him," Putin said in remarks to the Valdai forum in the southern city of Sochi after Trump defeated Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris in Tuesday's election.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked whether he was open to holding talks with Trump, the Russian leader said: "Ready".
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump revealed he was also prepared for some kind of conversation, telling NBC News in an interview that "I think we'll speak" as the topic turned to his contacts with world leaders since his victory was announced.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said he had spoken to "probably" 70 world leaders since Wednesday morning but revealed that he had not talked to Putin.
  <br>
  <br>
  Moscow was widely accused of interfering in the 2016 presidential election to boost Trump's campaign against Hilary Clinton, although the Kremlin has repeatedly rejected those charges.
  <br>
  <br>
  Putin said he was impressed by how Trump handled himself during an assassination attempt at a rally earlier this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He turned out to be a courageous person," Putin said. "People show who they are in extraordinary circumstances. This is where a person reveals himself. And he showed himself, in my opinion, in a very correct manner, courageously. Like a man," he added. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A British lawmaker was charged with assault on Thursday after he allegedly punched a passerby who he said had been threatening him after a Friday night out.
 <br>
  <br>
  Mike Amesbury was suspended from the governing Labour Party after CCTV and video footage showed him throwing a punch at a man and repeatedly hitting him after he was knocked to the ground.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Following a review of the evidence provided by Cheshire Police, we have authorised a charge of common assault against Mike Amesbury," said Rosemary Ainslie, Head of the Crown Prosecution Service's Special Crime Division.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The charge follows an alleged assault in Frodsham, Cheshire, on Saturday, 26 October 2024."
  <br>
  <br>
  After the incident, Amesbury, the Member of Parliament for Runcorn and Helsby in north-west England, said he felt threatened on the street after an evening out with friends, saying he co-operate with any inquiries if required. He said he would not make further public comment on the incident.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Labour Party did not immediately respond to a fresh request for comment after Amesbury was charged. They had previously said Amesbury was suspended from the party pending an investigation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Local police said Amesbury was set to appear in court at a "later date" in relation to reports of an assault on a 45-year-old man. (Reuters)

    Fed chair cuts rates, stands ground against Trump

<img alt="The chairman of the US Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, says he plans to serve out his full term. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1778068_1_20241108051635.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said on Thursday that he would not resign if asked to leave early by President-elect Donald Trump.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a press conference after unveiling a quarter point interest rate cut, Powell -- whose term as Fed chair ends in 2026 -- added that firing any of the Fed's seven governors was also "not permitted under the law."
  <br>
  <br>
  His comments underscore the delicate balancing act policymakers may have to play in the next Trump administration, given the US president-elect's recent criticism of the Fed.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the campaign trail, Trump repeatedly accused Powell -- whom he first appointed to run the US central bank -- of working to favour the Democrats, and has suggested he would look to replace him once his term as Fed Chair ends.
  <br>
  <br>
  The president-elect has also said he would like "at least" a say over setting Fed interest rates, something not currently allowed under the bank's dual mandate from Congress to act independently to tackle both inflation and unemployment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fed governors are nominated by the president, and appointed by the Senate to serve a 14-year term.
  <br>
  <br>
  They can also be appointed to serve out the remainder of a 14-year term if a Fed governor retires, and must then be reconfirmed.
  <br>
  <br>
  If he wanted to, Powell could stay on as a governor after he steps down as Fed chair, and serve out the remainder of his term, which expires in early 2028. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Canada Goose Holdings posted a surprise quarterly profit and topped Wall Street estimates for revenue on Thursday, as the luxury parka maker benefits from a demand recovery in China, as well as its tight cost controls.
 <br>
  <br>
  Its US-listed shares rose 5 percent in premarket trading, as its robust performance in China contrasts with comments from bigger luxury brands such as Gucci-owner Kering and LVMH .
  <br>
  <br>
  Revenue rose 2.5 percent in Greater China in the second quarter, Canada Goose said, the fourth consecutive quarter of growth in the region.
  <br>
  <br>
  Canada Goose, whose parkas can retail for more than US$1,000, has also diversified by entering the non-winter category to include rain and warm weather clothing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Excluding one-off items, Canada Goose posted a profit of 5 Canadian cents per share, compared with estimates for a loss of 5 Canadian cents.
  <br>
  <br>
  Selling, general and administrative expenses fell about 8 percent to C$162.5 million due to a cost-saving program that involved job cuts.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our second-quarter performance reflected steady progress across our operating priorities, as we navigated an increasingly challenging macro environment that affected consumer sentiment," CEO Dani Reiss said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Still, the Ontario-based company tempered its fiscal 2025 revenue expectations due to weak spending on luxury goods in the US.
  <br>
  <br>
  It now expects fiscal 2025 revenue to range from a low-single-digit decline to a low-single-digit increase, compared to its previous forecast of low-single-digit growth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Revenue in North America declined 3 percent in the reported quarter, compared to a 0.4 percent rise in the previous quarter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Canada Goose said second-quarter revenue fell to C$267.8 million (US$193 million) from C$281.1 million, a year earlier.
  <br>
  <br>
  Analysts on average had expected revenue of C$260.2 million, according to data compiled by LSEG. (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong on Thursday hosted the inaugural Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Greater Bay Area Lawyers Exchange Reception.
 <br>
  <br>
  More than 150 people from the legal sectors of the mainland, Macau and Hong Kong, including Director-General of the Department of Justice of Guangdong Chen Xudong, attended the reception.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at the event, Deputy Secretary for Justice Horace Cheung said that the establishment of a platform to enable the industry to better participate in the development of the bay area is an important measure in the Department of Justice’s Action Plan on the Construction of Rule of Law in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Greater Bay Area.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that the platform aims to consolidate the professional strengths of the legal services to give full play to the unique strengths of lawyers in the GBA.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cheung also said that the platform, along with the Hong Kong International Legal Talents Training Academy – which will be launched shortly – will enable Hong Kong to fully harness the institutional strengths of the "One Country, Two Systems" framework.

    Bank of England cuts interest rates to 4.75 percent

<img alt="The UK central bank's Monetary Policy Committee voted 8-1 to cut interest rates. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1778032_1_20241107203826.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Bank of England cut interest rates on Thursday for only the second time since 2020 and said future reductions were likely to be gradual, as it saw higher inflation and economic growth after the new government's first budget.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Monetary Policy Committee voted 8-1 to cut interest rates to 4.75 percent from 5 percent, a stronger majority than expectations in a Reuters poll for a 7-2 vote in favour of a cut. Catherine Mann dissented, preferring to keep rates on hold.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sterling rose by almost half a cent against the US dollar immediately after the announcement. British government bond prices fell but quickly reversed that drop.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We need to make sure inflation stays close to target, so we can't cut interest rates too quickly or by too much," BoE Governor Andrew Bailey said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But if the economy evolves as we expect it's likely that interest rates will continue to fall gradually from here," he added, broadly echoing his language after September's meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  The BoE predicted that finance minister Rachel Reeves' budget announced last week - which entails big increases in tax, spending and borrowing - would boost the size of Britain's economy by around 0.75 percent next year but barely improve annual growth rates in two or three years' time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Her plan was likely to add just under half a percentage point to the rate of inflation at its peak in just over two years' time, the BoE said, causing inflation to take a year longer to return sustainably to its 2 percent target.
  <br>
  <br>
  Reeves said families would welcome the BoE's rate cut.
  <br>
  <br>
  The BoE's cautious language on the future interest rate cuts was similar to previous months, in keeping with investors' view that it is likely to cut interest rates more slowly than the European Central Bank.
  <br>
  <br>
  The BoE did not refer to Donald Trump's US election victory, which has prompted a big reduction in bets that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates aggressively.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Fed is expected to reduce its benchmark policy rate by quarter of a percentage point later on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  After the BoE's rate cut, financial markets priced only around two interest rate cuts from the BoE in 2025 - compared with between two and three beforehand and down from around four before the budget.
  <br>
  <br>
  The BoE said inflation was likely to rise to around 2.5 percent by the end of this year from 1.7 percent in September and hit 2.7 percent by the end of next year, before falling gradually below its 2 percent target by the end of the three-year forecast.
  <br>
  <br>
  Government decisions to raise the cap on bus fares, hike value-added tax on private school fees and increase employers' social security contributions were likely to boost inflation.
  <br>
  <br>
  With the latter measure combining with a 6.7 percent hike in the national minimum wage, the BoE said employers faced rising costs - although it could not be certain of the overall effect on inflation as employers might respond by sacking staff or accepting lower profits.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two of Britain's biggest businesses, BT and Sainsbury's, said on Thursday that tax changes in the budget would fuel inflation.
  <br>
  <br>
  While the BoE downgraded its forecast for average economic growth this year to 1 percent from 1.25 percent, reflecting recent revisions to past growth, it raised its forecast for 2025 to 1.5 percent from 1 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This reflects the stronger, and relatively front-loaded, paths for government consumption and investment more than offsetting the impact on growth of higher taxes," the BoE said.
  <br>
  <br>
  While the BoE's forecasts for growth and inflation include the impact of higher spending and taxes, they do not include the effect of a big rise in market borrowing costs since the budget as it set those assumptions beforehand and did not update them.
  <br>
  <br>
  If the now-higher market interest rates were factored in, the outlook for inflation and growth would likely be a bit lower.
  <br>
  <br>
  The BoE repeated its message that monetary policy would need to stay "restrictive for sufficiently long" to return inflation sustainably to the 2 percent target. (Reuters)

  Forecasters said the weather system will enter the SAR's 800-kilometre warning radius at around midnight on Friday, adding in a Facebook post that two more potential storms are forming over the Pacific Ocean.
  <br>
  <br>
  The observatory said Yinxing’s circulation is relatively small, so it has to observe changes in intensity, local wind conditions, and how close it is from Hong Kong before it decides to issue a higher warning signal.
  <br>
  <br>
  It added there will be a few showers over the coast of Guangdong during the weekend under the combined effects of Yinxing and the northeast monsoon.

 China's leading chipmaker SMIC announced on Thursday a sharp rise in profits over the same period last year.
 <br>
  <br>
  SMIC said in a statement to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on Thursday that its third-quarter profit attributable to owners of the company stood at US$148.8 million, a jump of 58.3 percent compared to the equivalent period last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The company said its revenue rose to nearly US$2.2 billion, a record high and the first time it had raked in over US$2 billion in a single quarter.
  <br>
  <br>
  The results marked a return to form for the chipmaker after chalking up a nearly 60 percent year-on-year decline in profit in the second quarter.
  <br>
  <br>
  The firm said it expected revenue growth to be roughly flat in the fourth quarter, adding that it would "strengthen our confidence in development, maintain our strategic focus, stabilise our market share and consolidate our position in the industry". (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Joe Biden will make an address to the nation on Thursday, vowing a peaceful transfer of power to Donald Trump.
 <br>
  <br>
  Biden will speak in the Rose Garden of the White House at midnight Hong Kong time to "discuss the election results and the transition" to Trump's second term.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 81-year-old dropped out of the race against Trump in July and handed the Democratic nomination to Vice President Kamala Harris – but is now likely to see his legacy dismantled by the Republican's comeback.
  <br>
  <br>
  The White House said Biden spoke with Trump on Wednesday and "expressed his commitment to ensuring a smooth transition and emphasised the importance of working to bring the country together."
  <br>
  <br>
  Biden also invited Trump to meet at the White House.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung said Trump "looks forward to the meeting, which will take place shortly, and very much appreciated the call."
  <br>
  <br>
  It would be the first time they had met since Biden's poor debate performance against Trump in June that forced him out of the race. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A concern group has set an ambitious target of eliminating school bullying in Hong Kong over the next decade.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Council of Early Childhood Education and Services said according to its survey of 500 primary students, parents and teachers in July, one in three pupils have been bullied at school.
  <br>
  <br>
  The group called for society-wide effort to fight the problem.
  <br>
  <br>
  “In the next decade, we want to reduce the number of bullying to zero. So this is quite a challenge for Hong Kong and we call upon everybody, Legco members, our bureau chiefs, our influencers, our mass media, to help us,” Sansan Ching, the council’s director, told a conference on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The group has launched an "anti-bullying month" during which a series of activities will be held to raise awareness, including a casual wear day, a drawing competition and family workshops.
  <br>
  <br>
  And a petition signed jointly by parents, teachers, lawyers and medical professionals submitted to the government at the end of the conference called for a legal framework to protect pupils as well as more training for teachers to identify and intervene in cases.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to guidelines issued by the Education Bureau, school are required to intervene and follow up on bullying incidents as soon as possible.
  <br>
  <br>
  Psychiatrist Doris Chan said bullying can lead to long-term psychological impact on victims, and a more positive school environment is needed.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Most of them have lower self-esteem, and they feel they are worthless. And some of them suffer from mood problems. And a minority have some other diseases, such as post-traumatic stress disorder," she said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Thursday said they arrested 14 men on suspicion of illegal road racing.
 <br>
  <br>
  Officers said the races allegedly took place over the past two months on main roads, including Route Twisk, Tuen Mun Road, and Tolo Highway.
  <br>
  <br>
  They arrested people aged between 20 and 33 years old, with some claiming to be teachers, nurses and professional drivers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police made the arrests between Monday and Friday last week, seizing 14 private vehicles.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a press briefing, chief inspector Ng Hing-cheong criticised people who engaged in illegal street racing, saying it will endanger other drivers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Some of the vehicles involved raced back and forth at high speeds on the narrow and winding section of Route Twisk. They reached a speed of up to 135 kilometres per hour in a section with a speed limit of 50 kilometres per hour. They often crossed the double white lines to chase each other," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ng added that the operation against illegal street racing is still underway.

    HK uncorks trade potential at Wine and Spirits Fair

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong’s premier wine and spirits fair, which aims to establish the SAR as the regional trading hub for alcoholic drinks, opened on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Boasting more than 600 exhibitors from around the world, the three-day International Wine and Spirits Fair will feature exhibitions, seminars, tastings and a mixology showdown at Wan Chai’s convention centre.
  <br>
  <br>
  And with the government recently relaxing duties for drinks with an alcoholic strength of 30 percent or more, exhibitors are hoping this development will bolster their global sales.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I’m certain Hong Kong is the best city and the best way for Chinese liquor to go abroad,” Keith Lau, a representative of a mainland spirits trading company said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Maotai, Xi Jiu, or other brands, they have set up local companies in order to supply overseas [demand], so it is quite important that we have the right policy for the brands to go abroad.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Fellow exhibitor Julia Klimczak, who’s selling Scottish whisky, said she is expecting an increase in sales during this year's fair. Klimczak said she believes Hong Kong offers an ideal setting for promotion and networking.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There's a lot of international contacts and I'm very excited about the networking possibilities here in Hong Kong. It's incredible, and I believe we have people from all over the world."
  <br>
  <br>
  Teddy Tse, who works at a local wine and spirits distribution company also said he is expecting better sales this year, but said he hopes authorities could further relax duties.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The starting point at HK$100 is better because over 85 percent of the products is below HK$200, the import cost. Last year was good, so I think this year will be better because of the fruits of the Wine and Dine Festival."
  <br>
  <br>
  The government last month cut the duty on liquor with an alcohol content of over 30 percent and with an import price of more than HK$200 to 10 percent from 100 percent for the portion above HK$200.
  <br>
  <br>
  Also at the fair was Pieter Hermans, a local buyer. He said the fair is a lot smaller than it used to be.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Let's hope that due to the new spirit tariffs and all these types of things, Hong Kong will get on the map a little bit more and that the internal trade is starting to move again. I guess it's just the general economy that's also suffering a little bit at the moment," he said.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Organisers of the cross-harbour swim scheduled for Sunday said the race will be cancelled in the event of a tropical cyclone warning signal.
 <br>
  <br>
  They said the annual swim will be called off if the Standby Signal No 1 or above, or the red or black rainstorm warning, is in force at 6am that day.
  <br>
  <br>
  It will also be cancelled if there's a red tide at the harbour, or any other condition that deems the race unsuitable to take place.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Observatory said it will issue the Standby Signal No 1 between noon and 3pm on Friday as Super Typhoon Yinxing enters within 800 kilometres of Hong Kong, and according to its current forecast track, the storm will be within 400 kilometres of the SAR from Saturday until Sunday morning.
  <br>
  <br>
  Organisers of the cross-harbour swim called on all participants to pay attention to the latest situation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If the race is cancelled, an official announcement will be made shortly on [our] official website and on [our] social media channels," they said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The transport sector on Thursday urged authorities to finalise details of a plan to bring in outside workers, especially for the aviation industry, as soon as possible.
 <br>
  <br>
  Officials have revealed plans to bring in 10,000 skilled technicians over the next three years, but have not specified which job categories or professions will be included.
  <br>
  <br>
  It comes after Chief Executive John Lee in his Policy Address projected Hong Kong will have a shortage of about 60,000 skilled technicians across different sectors.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vivien Lau, the chief executive officer of the Hong Kong Business Aviation Centre said her industry is expecting more than 6,000 vacancies in the next five years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lau said the need for mechanics and technicians will increase with the three-runway system set to open later this month.
  <br>
  <br>
  "What we are tackling now is the technical side, the technician and mechanics. Because even though these categories were covered in the previous [labour importation] scheme, but we still think that there's a challenge in recruiting those technical staff because of their qualification, the level of experience that we are requiring, and also sometimes the language is also our key consideration," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Transport sector lawmaker Frankie Yick for his part said the government should place more focus on bringing in workers from Southeast Asia.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Particularly for the aviation industry, if they need to communicate with the pilot, with other people in the airport, and they normally speak in English. So [recruiting workers] from countries like the Philippines, Malaysia, I think that will be helpful,” he said.

    'Trump re-election casts shadow over HK economy'

<div class="itemFullText">
 An economist on Thursday said Donald Trump's return to the White House will add uncertainty to the local economy even as confidence among small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) improved in the fourth quarter.
 <br>
  <br>
  According to research conducted by the Productivity Council and Standard Chartered Bank, the Standard Chartered Hong Kong SME Leading Business Index rose 3.2 points to 45.7 points for the October-to-December period from the previous three months.
  <br>
  <br>
  Figures below 50 indicate a negative outlook, and those above 50 a positive one.
  <br>
  <br>
  A reading of 52.8 in the second quarter of 2023 was the highest in the past decade.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a press briefing, Kelvin Lau, a senior economist from Standard Chartered Bank, said local businesses are expected to be cautious moving forward over concerns that Trump may raise tariffs on Chinese goods, which could have an impact on Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If Trump starts talking about much more milder tariff hikes to begin with, we think that it could actually be not as bad of a news for a lot of the SMEs who have been expecting the worst," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So I think overall, we are looking at more subdued SME index performance, more cautiousness, prolonged cautiousness, but nothing more substantially worse than where we are now."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lau also said Hong Kong's economy is on track towards recovery, but the pace is slower than what the market expects.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chinese exports surged last month at their fastest pace in more than two years, easily topping forecasts and providing optimism about the economy as officials steel for a potential trade war with the United States after Donald Trump was re-elected president.
 <br>
  <br>
  Exports rose 12.7 percent in October from a year earlier to US$309.1 billion, according to customs data released on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The figure is the best since July 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  Exports to the US rose 8.1 percent while outbound shipments to Europe jumped 12.7 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We expect shipments to stay strong in the coming months," Zichun Huang, China economist at Capital Economics, said in a note. "Any potential drag from Trump tariffs may not materialise until the second half of next year."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Trump's return could create a short-term boost to Chinese exports as US importers increase their purchases to get ahead of the tariffs," she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Imports, meanwhile, fell 2.3 percent, turning negative for the first time in four months.
  <br>
  <br>
  China's trade surplus rose to US$95.7 billion in October, up from US$81.7 billion in September. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 City University has made it into the top 10 in the latest rankings of Asian tertiary institutions, jumping seven spots from a year ago.
 <br>
  <br>
  The University of Hong Kong remained second in the latest QS rankings, which is compiled by a higher education analytics firm based in Britain.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chinese University and the University of Science and Technology both moved up four spots, to rank sixth and 11th respectively.
  <br>
  <br>
  Polytechnic University moved up slightly to 17th, while Baptist University slipped to 71st.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Breaking into the top 10 in the QS Asia university rankings 2025 highlights our steady progress in academic research and our pursuit of innovation and excellence," said the president of City University, Freddy Boey.
  <br>
  <br>
  The University of Hong Kong, for its part, said the rankings highlight its world leading status in academia and innovation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[We are] committed to shaping the future through transformative education, cutting-edge research, and a pronounced emphasis on AI-readiness," it said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Polytechnic University head Teng Jin-guang, meanwhile, said the university was pleased with the result, describing it as impressive and encouraging.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Peking University retained the top spot in Asia, while the National University of Singapore was ranked third, the same as the year before.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Australian breakdancer Rachael "Raygun" Gunn has announced her retirement from competition, citing "really upsetting" backlash following her performance at the Paris Olympics.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 37-year-old Raygun's unorthodox routine – including kangaroo hops and imitating a sprinkler – failed to impress the judges at the Games.
  <br>
  <br>
  Her moves were copied on late-night talk shows and her unfashionable green tracksuit was mercilessly parodied online.
  <br>
  <br>
  Conspiracy theories abounded to explain how the university lecturer had even made it on to the Australia Olympic team.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gunn said the intense scrutiny had been "really upsetting", and she had decided to pull the plug on her breakdancing career.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm not going to compete any more," she told Australian radio station 2DayFM on Wednesday. "I was going to keep competing for sure, but that seems like a really difficult thing for me to do now.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The level of scrutiny that's going to be there," she added. "People will be filming it, it will be going online, it's just not going to be the same experience."
  <br>
  <br>
  Gunn had previously spoken out against the "pretty devastating" hatred unleashed towards her after the Olympics.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I went out there and I had fun – I did take it very seriously. I worked my butt off preparing for the Olympics, and I gave my all," she said in a video message after the Games.
  <br>
  <br>
  While many lampooned her performance on social media, Gunn won support from others, including her fellow Australian Olympians and even the country's prime minister.
  <br>
  <br>
  Raygun said she would continue to dance, just not in competition.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I mean I still dance, and I still break. But, you know, that's like in my living room with my partner," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Dancing is so much fun, and it makes you feel good. I don't think people should feel bad about the way that they dance," she added. "If you get out there, and you have fun on the dance floor – then just own it."
  <br>
  <br>
  Raygun did have the last laugh in September when she was briefly elevated to the top of the World Dance Sport Federation rankings.
  <br>
  <br>
  The WDSF named her the number one women's breakdancer based on winning the Oceania Championship, one of only a few events held that counted towards the rankings in the run-up to the Olympics.
  <br>
  <br>
  The sport of breaking made its Olympics debut in Paris, but will not feature at the next Games at Los Angeles in 2028. (AFP)

 President Xi Jinping congratulated Donald Trump on his re-election to the White House, state media said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Xi said China-US cooperation is a long-term goal and the two countries should strengthen dialogue between them while properly managing their differences.
  <br>
  <br>
  The president said history shows the two sides "gain from cooperation and lose from confrontation", according to Xinhua News Agency.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi said a stable, sound and sustainable China-US relationship serves their shared interests and meets the aspiration of the international community.
  <br>
  <br>
  He expressed the hope that Beijing and Washington will uphold the principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vice President Han Zheng, meanwhile, extended congratulations to JD Vance on his election as vice president of the United States. (Reporting by Xinhua)

    Israel opposition slams Netanyahu for sacking minister

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Opposition leaders in Israel blasted Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday for firing his defence minister, saying it threatened national security at a time of war.
 <br>
  <br>
  At a joint news conference in Jerusalem, they accused Netanyahu of putting his own political interests before the country's, following his decision the day before to dismiss Yoav Gallant.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He had the choice between disgrace and war, and he chose disgrace," said former prime minister Yair Lapid, voicing outrage at the move as Israel faces military pressures on multiple fronts.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our soldiers cannot trust him. The citizens of Israel cannot trust him. Yesterday the whole State of Israel saw that', he said of Netanyahu.
  <br>
  <br>
  Netanyahu's office announced the sacking of Gallant on Tuesday following public differences over the war with Hamas.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Over the past few months... trust has eroded. In light of this, I decided today to end the term of the defence minister," Netanyahu's office said, adding that foreign minister Israel Katz would take his place, and that Gideon Saar was appointed foreign minister to replace Katz.
  <br>
  <br>
  Leading opposition figure Benny Gantz, who quit Netanyahu's government in June over its lack of a post-war plan for Gaza, called the timing of the move "absolute security negligence".
  <br>
  <br>
  "What should our fighters in Lebanon think today, seeing that the minister of defence is fired after he issues conscription orders?" he asked, referring to an order sent on Monday for the conscription of 7,000 ultra-Orthodox individuals, a community historically exempted from military service.
  <br>
  <br>
  The orders came at a time when Israel is struggling to bolster troop numbers, with ground forces deployed to fight Hamas in the Gaza Strip and Hezbollah in Lebanon.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, thousands of Israelis took to Tel Aviv's streets to protest against Gallant's dismissal on Tuesday night, chanting slogans against Netanyahu and demanding the return of 97 hostages held in Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  For his part, Gallant said in a post on X that Israel's security would remain his life's "mission".
  <br>
  <br>
  He called on the government to bring home the hostages in Gaza while they were "still alive" and insisted all Israelis of draft age must serve in the military.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamas' October 7 attack on Israel resulted in the deaths of 1,206 people, according to a tally of Israeli official figures.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel's retaliatory campaign has killed 43,391 people in Gaza, a majority of them civilians, according to Gaza health ministry figures which the United Nations considers to be reliable. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A mainland-based political commentator warned of incoming tariffs and trade disputes between China and the United States when Donald Trump moves back into the White House, with Washington's relations with the broader Asia-Pacific region turning frosty.
 <br>
  <br>
  The incoming US president had previously proposed imposing across-the-board tariffs of between 10 and 20 percent on all imports arriving into the nation, and tariffs of at least 60 percent on Chinese goods.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump first launched a trade war with China in 2018.

  <br>
  Einar Tangen, a senior fellow at the Taihe Institute and chairman of Asia Narratives, said another Trump presidency is going to have economic implications because of the Republican's "America First" policy.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he told RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme that it would have less impact on China than during Trump's first term in office.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Things have changed dramatically since that period of time. The US had a lot more leverage. Now, China has been growing its trade with the rest of the world at a double-digit pace," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Quite frankly, the US cannot be decoupled from China, even if they start buying from somewhere else as they have been... the fact is many of the intermediate goods are still manufactured in China."
  <br>
  <br>
  Tangen also expected a shift in the Asia-Pacific region's relations with the US under a second Trump presidency.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He's not interested in coalitions or anything like that... he's going to blame Asean, in particular, saying there's a trade imbalance, that it's unfair, that they have to pay more if they want security, and that they have to do something to mend America's broken economy," he said.

 A Hakan Calhanoglu penalty gave Inter Milan a 1-0 victory over Arsenal in the Uefa Champions League on Wednesday, as the Italian champions remain undefeated in the competition this season and sit fifth on ten points at the midway point of the new league phase format.
 <br>
  <br>
  "I think we played a great game against a strong side who play with great intensity," said Inter coach Simone Inzaghi.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal, on the other hand, experienced defeat for the first time in Europe this season and lie three points and seven places behind their opponents.
  <br>
  <br>
  The match at the San Siro looked set to go into the break goalless until a penalty was signalled against Mikel Merino after Mehdi Taremi's flick deviated the ball into the Arsenal player's raised hand from close range.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We were very harshly done by," Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta said. "There is no deflection, nothing you can do in the box – so can he get away from it?"
  <br>
  <br>
  Calhanoglu stroked home the resulting spot-kick three minutes into first-half injury time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yann Sommer and Denzel Dumfries combined on the line to deny Gabriel Magalhaes a leveller shortly before the hour.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal cranked up the pressure in the second half but were unable to break down Inter's solid defensive block as the Premier League side fell to a second defeat in four days. (AFP)

    Zheng into last four of WTA Finals, Sabalenka loses

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Zheng Qinwen continued to deliver in her breakthrough season as she advanced to the semi-finals of the WTA Finals in Riyadh on Wednesday with victory over Jasmine Paolini, while Elena Rybakina beat the already-qualified Aryna Sabalenka.
 <br>
  <br>
  Picking up a 30th win from her last 35 matches, Chinese Olympic gold medallist Zheng swept past the fourth-seeded Italian 6-1, 6-1 in a mere 67 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Kazakhstan's Rybakina claimed a consolation 6-4, 3-6, 6-1 victory over world number one Sabalenka, who had already secured her semi-final spot as the group winner on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eliminated from the competition after losing her opening two matches, Rybakina found her form against Sabalenka – a much-needed confidence boost for the world number five after missing the majority of the second half of the season with allergies, insomnia and a back injury.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was a tough match and I'm really happy that I managed to win. I think it's nice to finish the year at least with one win against the world number one," said Rybakina, who shared a warm embrace with Sabalenka at the net.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was only the second loss Sabalenka has suffered in her last 24 matches.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sabalenka, 26, must wait to find out who she will face in Friday's semi-finals, but has reason to celebrate despite defeat as she clinched the year-end number one ranking as a result of Iga Swiatek's defeat to Coco Gauff on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the Belarusian said she will not let her new ranking distract her from the task at hand – lifting the WTA Finals trophy for the first time in her career.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's a really great feeling but I figured that last night and it didn't work really well tonight for me so I just want to focus on the current tournament to stay hungry and stay motivated – it's a big tournament and it's also one of my goals, so I'll focus on this goal," Sabalenka said Wednesday.

    Atlético stun PSG in Champions League clash

<img alt="Correa celebrates after scoring the late winner for Atlético. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1777905_1_20241107074910.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Substitute Ángel Correa scored a dramatic winner with the last kick of the game as Atlético Madrid snatched a 2-1 victory away to Paris Saint-Germain on Wednesday, kickstarting their Uefa Champions League campaign and casting a large cloud over the French club's European hopes.
 <br>
  <br>
  It looked as if the game at the Parc des Princes would end in a draw after Warren Zaire-Emery's early opener for PSG was quickly cancelled out by Nahuel Molina, in what was the first ever meeting of the clubs.
  <br>
  <br>
  PSG have been let down by their finishing in the Champions League all season and that was the case again here as they failed to convert a host of chances, but Atletico did not look like winning it until Correa struck in the 93rd minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Spaniards would have been the happier of the two teams with a draw, especially as goalkeeper Jan Oblak had been forced into several second-half saves.
  <br>
  <br>
  Having lost back-to-back matches against Benfica and Lille, the win puts Atlético back on track to at least make the play-off round of this new-look Champions League, with the league phase now at the halfway stage.
  <br>
  <br>
  The evening was also notable for the pre-match unfurling by PSG fans at one end of the stadium of an enormous banner in support of Palestinians in Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  "War on the pitch but peace in the world," said the banner, which also featured a Lebanese flag.
  <br>
  <br>
  That may lead to disciplinary action from Uefa, but that will probably be the least of PSG's worries right now.
  <br>
  <br>
  They may be comfortably on top of Ligue 1 but in the Champions League last season's semi-finalists have just four points, despite playing three of their four games so far at home.
  <br>
  <br>
  Having edged Girona 1-0 on the opening matchday and then lost 2-0 away to Arsenal, the French champions have since drawn at home to PSV Eindhoven and now lost to Atlético.
  <br>
  <br>
  They face a tough assignment next away to Bayern Munich and also still have to play Manchester City, meaning their hopes of finishing in the top 24 places and qualifying at least for the play-off round must be in doubt.
  <br>
  <br>
  Luis Enrique's side will need to quickly improve in front of goal having now scored just three times in their last six Champions League matches, a run stretching back to last season's semi-final loss against Borussia Dortmund. (AFP)
