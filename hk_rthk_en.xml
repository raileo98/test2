<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Friday said they launched an investigation into a suspected murder case, after a man was found slashed in the back in Tuen Mun.
 <br>
  <br>
  Officers received a report at about 10pm on Thursday saying a man was found lying unconscious outside the entrance of block seven at Po Tin Estate.
  <br>
  <br>
  The man, 33, was then rushed to Tuen Mun Hospital where he was pronounced dead.
  <br>
  <br>
  After initial investigations, the force said they suspect the deceased was attacked by a man with a sharp object, and that he fled afterwards.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A post-mortem examination will be conducted later to ascertain the cause of death."
  <br>
  <br>
  Police also said that a 44-year-old woman was arrested on suspicion of "misleading police officers during their investigation".
  <br>
  <br>
  Officers from the Tuen Mun district crime squad are investigating the incident, the force added.

 A fire and thick smoke engulfed an eight-story building in the South Korean city of Seongnam on Friday, sending 12 people to hospital with smoke inhalation, and about 30 people who had been trapped were safely rescued, the fire department said.
 <br>
  <br>
  The department deployed 82 vehicles and equipment south of Seoul to bring the blaze under control after the fire started in a restaurant on the ground floor of the busy commercial building, which also housed a swimming pool where children take lessons.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier, YTN television reported multiple people were trapped inside, with footage showing black smoke engulfing a large part of the building. (Reuters)

<img alt="Philippine Vice President Sara Duterte will no longer sit on the National Security Council after President Ferdinand Marcos removed her.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos has removed Vice President Sara Duterte from the National Security Council, according to an executive order released on Friday, a month after she allegedly plotted to kill him.
 <br>
  <br>
  The order, signed on Monday by Executive Secretary Lucas Bersamin, removed the vice president and all former presidents from the council which advises the president on policies affecting national security.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bersamin said the move was "to reorganise and streamline" its membership, which now comprises key legislative, defence, foreign and cabinet officials.
  <br>
  <br>
  "At the moment, the VP is not considered relevant to the responsibilities of membership in the NSC," Bersamin told reporters, adding that the president was free to add other members or advisers as needed.
  <br>
  <br>
  The move comes as Duterte is facing an investigation over her alleged threat to kill Marcos and his family.
  <br>
  <br>
  In late November, Sara -- the 46-year-old daughter of former president Rodrigo Duterte -- delivered an expletive-laden online news conference in which she claimed to have told someone to kill Marcos if she was assassinated.
  <br>
  <br>
  She later said the comments were misinterpreted.
  <br>
  <br>
  The vice president swept to power in 2022 in an alliance with Marcos that has unravelled spectacularly in recent months, with both sides trading allegations of drug addiction and extreme rhetoric ahead of this year's mid-term elections.
  <br>
  <br>
  Duterte is also subject of multiple impeachment complaints over her alleged misuse of millions of dollars in government funds. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Organisers of this year's Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge Half Marathon have vowed to address issues raised by runners in the inaugural edition in 2023.
 <br>
  <br>
  The race, which has been designated a Gold Label Road Race by World Athletics, will see 8,000 runners traversing the 55-kilometre bridge's Hong Kong stretch on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some participants of the event's first edition, which took place in November 2023, were left frustrated by a lack of sports drinks and snacks, as well as a shortage of toilets.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This time, we have increased the number of portable toilets. We have prepared 70 of them at the start and finish line, and we have 130 in total along the entire course... We believe this should be able to address the needs of runners," said Simon Yeung, who chairs the organising committee.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have responded to the issues raised by some runners. We heard them and have followed up, and we hope to do better this year."
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeung also said some of the six water stations would provide sports drinks and bananas.
  <br>
  <br>
  The event will be divided into the "challenge" and "non-challenge" groups, with the first batch of runners expected to start at 7.15am.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among participants in the "challenge" group will be 16 runners specially invited from abroad, including Ethiopian track and field athlete Milkesa Mengesha, who won the latest Berlin Marathon.
  <br>
  <br>
  Parts of the bridge will be gradually closed to traffic from Saturday until after all races are completed.

 A rugby competition on Sunday will serve as the first test event at Kai Tak Stadium, paving the way for the Hong Kong Sevens in March.
 <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong China Rugby will be hosting the concluding day of the University Sports Federation of Hong Kong, China’s rugby sevens tournament, which features 17 men's and women's teams.
  <br>
  <br>
  The first match is scheduled to kick off at 11.15am, with the final expected to conclude at 6.30pm. Ticket holders can enter the venue as early as 10am, but there will be no on-site ticket sales on the day.
  <br>
  <br>
  James Farndon, CEO of Hong Kong China Rugby, said the event will test various things needed for the Hong Kong Sevens.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our event operations team is obviously very experienced in running the main events, but here in particular, having the first opportunity to test, for instance, the full event control room in terms of the stadium operations, the media centre being open, broadcast teams, getting a look around the stadium," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In terms of some of our entertainment, some of our sport experiences and entertainments that we're looking at for the main event. We'll have the opportunity to test and plan some of these event presentations. Equally we'll bring in some of our DJ and match announcers for the event which allows  us to test some of the sound systems that are used."
  <br>
  <br>
  Sports Commissioner George Tsoi anticipates around 10,000 spectators for the test event, saying it will be the first of many at the stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The infrastructure has by and large been completed and every little part of the operations has been tested. What's more important is that... we put together every element into practice, into one single event so that we can have a certainty or we can have a more realistic test on the performance when all these elements are put together," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will be progressively increasing the complications, the scale, as well as the number of spectators of all of our test events."

    Mission to arrest President Yoon stalled: officials

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korean investigators on Friday called off their attempt to arrest impeached President Yoon Suk-yeol over his failed martial law bid because of a standoff at his residence.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Regarding the execution of the arrest warrant today, it was determined that the execution was effectively impossible due to the ongoing standoff. Concern for the safety of personnel on-site led to the decision to halt the execution," the Corruption Investigation Office said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon, a former prosecutor, has defied investigators' attempts to question him for weeks.
  <br>
  <br>
  The last time he is known to have left the residence was on December 12, when he went to the nearby presidential office to make a televised statement to the nation, making a defiant statement that he will fight efforts to oust him.
  <br>
  <br>
  Investigators from the country's anti-corruption agency are weighing charges of rebellion after Yoon, apparently frustrated that his policies were blocked by an opposition-dominated parliament, declared martial law on December 3 and dispatched troops to surround the National Assembly.
  <br>
  <br>
  Parliament overturned the declaration within hours in an unanimous vote and impeached Yoon on December 14, accusing him of rebellion, while South Korean anti-corruption authorities and public prosecutors opened separate investigations into the events.
  <br>
  <br>
  A Seoul court issued a warrant for Yoon’s detention on Tuesday, but enforcing it is complicated as long as he remains in his official residence. (Agencies)

    Officials mull mass transit station in Lam Tin North

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Officials are considering adding a ninth station to a planned elevated mass transit system in East Kowloon, to serve people living in the northern part of Lam Tin.
 <br>
  <br>
  The system, which is expected to be completed in 2033, will run from Choi Hung East to Yau Tong East.
  <br>
  <br>
  Transport Secretary Mable Chan told the Ta Kung Pao and Wen Wei Po newspapers in an interview published on Friday that the route could be changed to enable the creation of a "Lam Tin North Station".
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Lam Tin to Yau Tong route would require extensive excavation through mountains and rocks to build a very long tunnel, which would be both complex and costly. Many Lam Tin residents would be unable to benefit from the system," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "However, we found that shifting the route slightly leftward would bring it closer to the Lam Tin North area, where three housing estates with over 30,000 residents are located. We have identified potential locations in this area to build a station."
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Chan said the first of the city's new taxi fleets could start running from March.
  <br>
  <br>
  Five fleet licences have been granted as part of efforts to improve the sector's service quality.

    'Dental patients arriving earlier can tackle no-shows'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A lawmaker on Friday suggested that public dental clinics should require patients to arrive at least an hour in advance to deal with no-shows.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Department of Health launched its online registration for public dental services on Monday in a bid to avoid residents queuing overnight.
  <br>
  <br>
  With 151 slots available, it recorded an overall absentee rate of 26.5 percent during the first two working days since the service was launched.
  <br>
  <br>
  A majority of them were residents aged 65 or above.
  <br>
  <br>
  The department said it would keep monitoring the operation and effectiveness of the new system and carry out suitable remedial measures, such as setting up a waiting list mechanism.
  <br>
  <br>
  Election Committee lawmaker Chan Hoi-yan said patients might not show up due to various reasons, including illness or they simply forgot about the appointment.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think that - for instance - we can ask them to come in for registration an hour or so before the appointment. I think the public understands that the government has tried its best to avoid long queues," she told an RTHK radio programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Coming in earlier to make sure you'll show up enables medical workers, or the Department of Health, to contact people on the waiting list and ask them to come in."
  <br>
  <br>
  She said absentees should not be penalised.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on the same programme, Tsuen Wan District Councillor Ng Chun-yu suggested that officials should also phone elderly patients to notify them they have been allocated a spot at a public dental clinic.
  <br>
  <br>
  The no-show rate at the Tsuen Wan clinic was 33.3 percent - the highest among all surveyed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ng suspected this was because some older people living outside the area were reluctant to travel a long distance for dental appointments.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Apart from notifying elderly by SMS, the government could also use pre-recorded phone calls and can call the elderly twice," said Ng.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If they don't pick up both calls, then it's likely that they won't show up, right? If half of the 40 people who've been allocated a slot aren't picking up the phone, maybe there's a high number of people not showing up? At least [health workers] can be prepared."
  <br>
  <br>
  Responding to media enquiries, the health department said some patients did not show up due to other engagements, or they forgot about the appointment.
  <br>
  <br>
  It added that some residents were not aware that the clinics only provide emergency dental services.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Palestinian Authority (PA) has ordered the suspension of broadcasts by Al Jazeera in a move the Qatar-based television network condemned on Thursday as reminiscent of Israeli practices.
 <br>
  <br>
  Al Jazeera is already banned from broadcasting from Israel amid a long-running feud with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government.
  <br>
  <br>
  In September, masked Israeli troops raided the Al Jazeera office in the West Bank city of Ramallah, seat of the Palestinian Authority, to issue an initial 45-day closure order, in a move the PA foreign ministry slammed as "a flagrant violation" of press freedom at the time.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Thursday, the PA insisted its own suspension order was "temporary", adding its decision followed a complaint from the Palestinian Journalists Syndicate about the network's coverage.
  <br>
  <br>
  "These measures shall be applied until Al Jazeera chooses to act in accordance with basic media ethics, including its duty to prevent deliberate disinformation, ban the glorification of violence and end the incitement to armed mutiny," the PA said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The syndicate, which represents about 3,000 Palestinian journalists, said several had filed complaints against Al Jazeera for "biased media coverage on its platforms, including incitement, misleading reports and content that stirs internal discord".
  <br>
  <br>
  The suspension order involves "temporarily freezing the work of all journalists, employees, crews and affiliated channels until their legal status is rectified", the official news agency Wafa reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  Al Jazeera aired images of what appeared to be Palestinian security officers entering the network's office in Ramallah and handing over the suspension order.
  <br>
  <br>
  The network condemned the decision, saying it "aligns with Israeli occupation practices targeting its media teams".
  <br>
  <br>
  The ban on Al-Jazeera drew condemnation from press freedom organisations and the UN human rights office.
  <br>
  <br>
  Militant group Hamas, rivals of Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas's Fatah movement which dominates the PA, said the ban went against Palestinian interests. (AFP)

    Israeli air strike hits a Gaza humanitarian zone

<div class="itemFullText">
 Israeli air strikes killed at least 40 people, including several children, across the Gaza Strip on Thursday, hitting Hamas security officers and an Israeli-declared humanitarian zone.
 <br>
  <br>
  As the daily bombardment continued, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said he had authorised a delegation from the Mossad intelligence agency, the Shin Bet internal security agency and the military to continue negotiations in Qatar toward a ceasefire deal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israeli media said the delegation would depart on Friday. There was no immediate Hamas comment. The US-led talks have repeatedly stalled during 15 months of war.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Israeli strike in the seaside humanitarian zone known as Muwasi occurred as hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians had been huddling there in damp winter weather.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel’s military said it targeted a senior police officer.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another Israeli strike killed at least eight people in Deir al-Balah in central Gaza. The men were members of local committees that help secure aid convoys, according to Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital, which received the bodies.
  <br>
  <br>
  There was no immediate comment from Israel's military.
  <br>
  <br>
  In southern Gaza, the military killed five policemen in eastern Khan Younis. Israeli government spokesman David Mencer said the strike targeted the head of the Hamas internal security force in southern Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  The war was sparked by Hamas-led militants’ October 7, 2023 attack into Israel. The militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted around 250. Around 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, at least a third believed to be dead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel’s offensive in retaliation has killed over 45,000 Palestinians in Gaza, according to the territory's Health Ministry, which says women and children make up more than half the dead. The ministry does not distinguish between civilians and combatants in their tally. (AP)

    Biggest trackway of dinosaur footprints found in UK

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Researchers have uncovered hundreds of dinosaur footprints dating back to the middle Jurassic era in a quarry in Oxfordshire, southern England, showing that reptiles - such as the nine-metre predator Megalosaurus - moved along enormous tracks.
 <br>
  <br>
  The dig at Dewars Farm Quarry found five extensive trackways, one of which measured more than 150 metres in length, researchers from the Universities of Oxford and Birmingham said on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Four of the tracks were made by gigantic, long-necked, herbivorous dinosaurs called sauropods, most likely to be Cetiosaurus, an up to 18-metre-long cousin of the well-known Diplodocus, they said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The fifth trackway was made by the carnivorous theropod dinosaur Megalosaurus, which had distinctive three-toed feet with claws.
  <br>
  <br>
  The carnivore and herbivore tracks, which are about 166 million-years-old, cross over at one point, raising questions about whether and how the two types of dinosaur were interacting, the researchers said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Megalosaurus was the first dinosaur to be scientifically named and described in 1824, kick-starting the last 200 years of dinosaur science and public interest.
  <br>
  <br>
  Emma Nicholls, vertebrate palaeontologist ay the Oxford University Museum of Natural History, said: "Scientists have known about and been studying Megalosaurus for longer than any other dinosaur on Earth, and yet these recent discoveries prove there is still new evidence of these animals out there, waiting to be found."
  <br>
  <br>
  The buried prints came to light when quarry worker Gary Johnson felt "unusual bumps" as he was stripping the clay back with his vehicle in order to expose the quarry floor.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 100 researchers then excavated in the site in June, where they found around 200 footprints, the universities said in a statement. (Reuters)

    FBI says driver in New Orleans rampage acted alone

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Army veteran who drove a truck into a crowd of New Year’s revellers in New Orleans acted alone, the FBI said on Thursday, reversing its position from a day earlier that he likely worked with others in the deadly attack that officials said was inspired by the Islamic State group.
 <br>
  <br>
  The FBI also revealed that the driver, Shamsud-Din Jabbar, an American citizen from Texas, posted five videos on his Facebook account in the hours before the attack in which he proclaimed his support for the militant group and previewed the violence that he would soon unleash in the famed French Quarter district.
  <br>
  <br>
  “This was an act of terrorism. It was premeditated and an evil act,” said Christopher Raia, the deputy assistant director of the FBI's counterterrorism division, calling Jabbar “100 per cent inspired” by the Islamic State.
  <br>
  <br>
  The attack along Bourbon Street killed 14 revellers, along with Jabbar, 42, who was fatally shot in a firefight with police after steering his speeding truck around a barricade and ploughing into the crowd. About 30 people were injured.
  <br>
  <br>
  Raia stressed there was no indication of a connection between the New Orleans attack and the explosion on Wednesday of a Tesla Cybertruck filled with explosives outside Trump’s Las Vegas hotel.
  <br>
  <br>
  The person inside that truck, a decorated US Army Green Beret, shot himself in the head just before detonation, authorities said. (AP)

    South Korean authorities move to arrest President Yoon

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korean investigators on Friday were attempting to detain impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol over his short-lived martial law decree last month, as hundreds of his supporters gathered near his residence in Seoul, vowing to protect him.
 <br>
  <br>
  About 20 investigators from the Corruption Investigation Office for High-Ranking Officials and police officers were seen entering the gate of Yoon’s residence in Seoul to execute a warrant for his detention.
  <br>
  <br>
  It wasn’t clear whether the president would cooperate with authorities trying to detain him.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon in a defiant New Year’s message to conservative supporters rallying outside his residence said he would “fight to the end” against “anti-state forces.”
  <br>
  <br>
  His lawyers have described the warrant to detain him as “invalid” and “illegal.”
  <br>
  <br>
  A Seoul court issued a warrant for Yoon’s detention on Tuesday after he evaded multiple requests to appear for questioning and blocked searches of his office in Seoul, hindering an investigation into whether his ill-conceived power grab on December 3 amounted to rebellion.
  <br>
  <br>
  The warrant is valid for one week, and investigators may make another attempt to detain Yoon if they are unable to do so on Friday. (AP)

    Antetokounmpo, Jokić lead early NBA All-Star voting

<img alt="Bucks forward Giannis Antetokounmpo leads early NBA All-Star fan voting with 1.7 million votes. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1785956_2_20250103074152.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Milwaukee's Giannis Antetokounmpo is the early leader in fan balloting for the NBA All-Star Game, and LeBron James of the Los Angeles Lakers seems well on his way toward extending his record and getting picked for a 21st time.
 <br>
  <br>
  The first update on All-Star voting for this season's revised game was released saw Antetokounmpo as the overall leader with about 1.7 million votes. Three-time MVP Nikola Jokić of the Denver Nuggets is second overall with about 1.4 million votes, which tops all Western Conference players.
  <br>
  <br>
  Charlotte's LaMelo Ball led East guards with 947,444 votes, with Cleveland's Donovan Mitchell second on 718,084 and Milwaukee's Damian Lillard third on 704,914.
  <br>
  <br>
  There won't be ten starters this year for the All-Star Game, which is set to take place on Febuary 16 in San Francisco.
  <br>
  <br>
  2025 marks the first year of a new All-Star format, one where there will be three games. The 24 All-Stars will be drafted into three teams of eight players apiece by TNT personalities and former NBA greats Shaquille O'Neal, Charles Barkley and Kenny Smith.
  <br>
  <br>
  Those three teams will be entered into a four-team tournament, with the remaining squad being the team of NBA rookies and second-year players that wins the Rising Stars event on All-Star Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  There are two semifinal games, followed by the winners meeting in a championship game – with the first team to reach 40 points the winner of all three games.
  <br>
  <br>
  It will be wildly different than last year, when the All-Star Game final score was 211-186 – the highest-scoring one in history.
  <br>
  <br>
  Voting continues through January 20.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fan voting makes up 50 percent of the All-Star starter selection formula, with media voting accounting for another 25 percent and voting by current NBA players counting for the remaining 25 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ten players designated as starters – even though there technically will be at least 15 starters in the All-Star “games” – will be announced on January 23, and the reserves that will be selected by NBA head coaches will be announced on January 30. (AP/AFP)

<img alt="Wall Street closed lower as investors weighed up their best strategy to deal with a strong US dollar and labour market. File photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1785945_1_20250103052420.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street see-sawed to a lower close on Thursday amid choppy trading, as investors tackled the new year having to contend with a strong labour market, a rising dollar and tumbling Tesla shares.
 <br>
  <br>
  All three major US stocks ended the session in negative territory, a reversal of an earlier rally but off session lows.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We had some macro news but somewhat mixed and you know we have a very strong dollar today," said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities in New York. "There are a few hurdles over the next couple of weeks and those are next Friday’s employment data and the beginning of fourth quarter earnings."
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the short term, we’re looking at choppiness and a struggle for direction until we get those hurdles out of the way," Cardillo added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shares of Tesla sank after reporting its first annual drop in deliveries, as incentives failed to stem a decline in demand for its ageing line-up of electric vehicles.
  <br>
  <br>
  A report from the Labor Department showed initial and continuing claims for unemployment benefits both fell last week, supporting the narrative of a solid jobs market and adding weight to the possibility that the US central bank could let its key interest rate stand at this month's policy meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  Looking past uncertainties regarding the pace of interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve, policies to be enacted by the incoming Donald Trump administration and various hot spots of geopolitical unrest, market participants chose to focus on the strength of the United States economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wall Street's main indexes notched double-digit gains in 2024, with the benchmark S&P 500 recording its best two-year run since 1997-1998. Those gains were driven by the US Federal Reserve's first rate cuts in three-and-a-half years, the ongoing artificial intelligence boom and expectations of pro-business policies from the incoming Trump administration.
  <br>
  <br>
  The rally lost steam in the closing weeks of 2024, with the S&P 500 and the Dow marking declines for December, as markets priced in the likelihood of fewer rate cuts from the Fed this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The S&P 500 lost 13.07 points, or 0.22 percent, to 5,868.56 points, and the Nasdaq Composite lost 30.00 points, or 0.16 percent, to 19,280.79. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 151.95 points, or 0.36 percent, to 42,392.27.
  <br>
  <br>
  The S&P and the Nasdaq have now posted five consecutive sessions in the red, their longest losing streak since mid-April.

 Andrey Rublev's Australian Open preparations took an unexpected hit as the top seed was dumped out of the Hong Kong Open in the second round by Fabian Marozsan on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  With the first Grand Slam of the year just over a week away, the Hungarian ranked 58th in the world won 7-5, 3-6, 6-3 in just under two hours.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 25-year-old faces China's Shang Juncheng, 19, in the last eight at Victoria Park.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Russian Rublev, ranked eighth, was the defending Hong Kong champion and had been pursuing a 76th tour-level quarter-final.
  <br>
  <br>
  There was no such trouble for second seed Lorenzo Musetti of Italy, who defeated Canadian qualifier Gabriel Diallo 6-4, 6-3.
  <br>
  <br>
  He plays Spain's Jaume Munar next. (AFP)

<img alt="The flagship iPhone 16 Pro and the iPhone 16 Pro Max will see the highest discount of 500 yuan. File photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1785914_1_20250102192311.jpg&q=90">

<div class="itemFullText">
 Apple is offering rare discounts of up to 500 yuan (US$68.5) on its latest iPhone models in China, as the US tech giant moves to defend its market share against rising competition from domestic rivals like Huawei.
 <br>
  <br>
  The four-day promotion, running from January 4 to 7, applies to several iPhone models when purchased using specific payment methods, according to its website.
  <br>
  <br>
  The flagship iPhone 16 Pro with a starting price of 7,999 yuan and the iPhone 16 Pro Max with a starting price of 9,999 yuan will see the highest discount of 500 yuan. The iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus will receive a 400 yuan reduction.
  <br>
  <br>
  Apple is grappling with declining market share in China, the world's largest smartphone market, where local manufacturers have intensified competition.
  <br>
  <br>
  Huawei has emerged as a particularly strong challenger since its return to the premium segment in August 2023 with locally-made chipsets. Huawei had cut the prices of a variety of high-end devices, including mobile phones, by up to 3,000 yuan over the weekend on one of China's leading e-commerce platforms.
  <br>
  <br>
  Apple briefly fell out of China's top five smartphone vendors in the second quarter of 2024 before recovering in the third quarter. The US company's smartphone sales in China still slipped 0.3 percent during the third quarter from a year earlier, while Huawei's sales surged 42 percent, according to research firm IDC.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Apple promotion also includes discounts of 200 to 300 yuan on older iPhone models, as well as other categories of products such as MacBook laptops and iPad tablets. Customers must use designated payment methods including WeChat Pay or Alipay to qualify for the discounts. (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) has apologised over the suspected theft of files that contained the personal data of about 100 people.
 <br>
  <br>
  Officials said the incident involved two internal document files stored at the Kowloon City District Environmental Hygiene Office.
  <br>
  <br>
  The FEHD said the files contained records of public complaints against environmental nuisances in the district, including the names and contact information of about 100 complainants.
  <br>
  <br>
  The department has reported the case to the police and notified the Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data as well as affected complainants.
  <br>
  <br>
  "While the case is believed to be an isolated incident, the department will take stringent action should the investigation reveal any negligence or mishandling by any officer," a spokesman said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The FEHD will also review the current personal data security measures to ensure effective protection of the personal data it collects."

 China has added 28 US entities to its export control list to "safeguard national security and interests", the Commerce Ministry said on Thursday.

  <br>
  The companies on the list include General Dynamics, Boeing Defence, Space & Security, Lockheed Martin and Raytheon Missiles & Defence.
  <br>
  <br>
  China is also banning the export of dual-use items to these companies starting on Thursday, the ministry said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the ministry said on Thursday it had added 10 US companies to its "Unreliable Entity List" for their involvement in arms sales to Taiwan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Effective from Thursday, the blacklisted companies, which include various units of Lockheed and General Dynamics, will be banned from exporting to and importing from China or making new investments in the country, according to the ministry. (Reuters)

<img alt="Retail sales have declined for nine months in a row. File photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1785893_2_20250102183155.jpg&q=80">

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's retail sales were down 7.3 percent in November on a year-on-year basis, according to official figures released on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  It marked the ninth consecutive month of year-on-year declines, following a 2.8 percent skid in October and 6.9 percent drop in September.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sales of motor vehicles and parts saw the most dramatic drop in November, at 34.4 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Total retail sales plunged 7.1 percent in the first 11 months of last year, compared to the same period in 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government said the declines continued because of a change in people's consumption patterns and the relatively strong Hong Kong dollar.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Nevertheless, the introduction of various measures by the Central Government to boost the mainland economy and benefit Hong Kong, including the resumption and expansion of the multiple-entry Individual Visit Scheme for Shenzhen since December, together with the SAR Government's various initiatives to boost market sentiment, as well as increasing employment earnings, would be conducive to spending by both visitors and residents in the local market," a spokesman said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The executive director of the Retail Management Association, Bond Law, said he is hopeful sales will rebound this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The resumption of multiple-entry visas for Shenzhen is a good start to drive foot traffic, and the positive impact on the market starting December will take time to take effect," he said in an online press call.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Looking forward to 2025, the positive impact of various supportive measures are expected to gradually materialise to benefit all retail categories."

<div class="itemFullText">
 A gunman who fatally shot at least 12 people, including two children, in Montenegro has killed himself while surrounded by police, officials said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  At least four others were wounded in the shooting rampage in the western town of Cetinje on Wednesday that followed a bar brawl, officials said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The shooter, identified as 45-year-old Aco Martinović, killed the owner of the bar, the bar owner's children and his own family members, Interior Minister Danilo Šaranović said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The attacker, who was fled after the rampage, was later located and surrounded by police. He died after shooting himself in the head, Šaranović said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police had dispatched a special unit to search for the attacker in the town, which is located about 30 kilometres northwest of the capital, Podgorica.
  <br>
  <br>
  All the roads in and out of the city were blocked as police swarmed the streets.
  <br>
  <br>
  Šaranović said that Martinović had died while being taken to a hospital in the capital and succumbed from the “severity of his injuries.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The government has declared three days of national mourning starting on Thursday, with Prime Minister Milojko Spajić describing the shooting as a “terrible tragedy.”
  <br>
  <br>
  “The level of rage and brutality shows that sometimes such people ... are even more dangerous than members of organized criminal gangs,” Šaranović said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Martinović was at the bar throughout the day with other guests when the brawl erupted, Police Commissioner Lazar Šćepanović said. He said that Martinović then went home, brought back a weapon and opened fire at around 5.30pm.
  <br>
  <br>
  “He killed four people” at the bar before heading out, and then continued shooting at three more locations, Šćepanović said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the suspect received a suspended sentence in 2005 for violent behaviour and had appealed his latest conviction for illegal weapons possession. Montenegrin media have reported that he was known for erratic and violent behaviour. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The annual Toys and Games Fair, together with two other fairs, will kick off on Monday, featuring more eco-friendly products.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Toys and Games Fair, the Baby Products Fair and the International Stationery and School Supplies Fair will be held at the Convention and Exhibition Centre in Wan Chai from January 6 to 9.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong Trade Development Council (HKTDC), which is the main organiser, said the three fairs, themed “New Play for All”, attracted more than 2,500 exhibitors from different countries and regions.
  <br>
  <br>
  HKTDC’s deputy executive director Sophia Chong said the Green Toys Zone will return for a second year, featuring toys made with eco-friendly or recycled materials.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said the fair will also present the first ESG (Environment, Social and Governance) Pavilion, as going green is a global trend.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The materials, the production process and also the standard of entering these import markets outside of Hong Kong, are placing more and more importance on environmentally friendly requirements and standards,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It's not only applying in the toys and games and baby product sectors, but also across sectors in the fashion, lifestyle, as well as the electronics industry, so we think this will be a definite worldwide trend which cannot be missed.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The HKTDC said green toys include plush dog toys made using eco-friendly materials, and 3D paper puzzles made with pure wood pulp kraft paper.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chong expressed optimism about Hong Kong’s economy this year, saying the HKTDC planned to organise about 40 large-scale fairs and conventions in 2025.

 The Transport Department has announced that authorities are now handling up to 500 applications each working day from car owners who want to drive to the mainland via the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge, up from 400 previously.
 <br>
  <br>
  The department said the move will allow it to better cope with the number of applications being received under the Northbound Travel for Hong Kong Vehicles scheme.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The eligibility, procedures and balloting of applications of the scheme remain unchanged," a spokesman said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The governments of Guangdong and Hong Kong will continue to monitor the operation of Northbound Travel for Hong Kong Vehicles and maintain close liaison with relevant departments to review and enhance the arrangements of the scheme in a timely manner."
  <br>
  <br>
  The scheme began in June 2023 and more than 60,000 applications had been submitted by the middle of last year.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The chief executive of South Korean airline Jeju Air has been banned from leaving the country, police said on Thursday, after one of the company's Boeing 737-800 planes crashed last week killing 179.
 <br>
  <br>
  "The investigation team imposed a travel ban on two individuals, including Jeju Air CEO Kim E-bae," said police in South Jeolla Province, where the crash in Muan city happened.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier, police on Thursday raided the offices of Jeju Air and the operator of Muan International Airport as part of the probe into the fatal crash.
  <br>
  <br>
  The flight was carrying 181 people from Thailand to South Korea on Sunday when it issued a mayday call and belly-landed before slamming into a barrier, killing everyone aboard except two flight attendants pulled from the burning wreckage.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities carried out search and seizure operations at the Muan airport where flight 2216 crashed, a regional aviation office in the southwestern city, and Jeju Air's office in the capital Seoul.
  <br>
  <br>
  South Korean and US investigators, including from Boeing, have been combing the crash site since the disaster to establish a cause, with both black boxes found and decoding work ongoing.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In relation to the plane accident... a search and seizure operation is being conducted…at three locations," police said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The police plan to swiftly and rigorously determine the cause and responsibility for this accident in accordance with the law and principles."
  <br>
  <br>
  Yonhap reported a search warrant was approved on charges of professional negligence resulting in death, citing officials.
  <br>
  <br>
  South Korea has also announced it will inspect all Boeing 737-800 aircraft operated by its carriers, focusing on the landing gear, which appears to have malfunctioned during the Sunday crash.
  <br>
  <br>
  South Korea's acting president, Choi Sang-mok, said on Thursday that "immediate action" must be taken if that probe uncovered any issues with the aircraft model.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities have previously said 101 aircraft of the same model were in operation by six different airlines.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As there's great public concern about the same aircraft model involved in the accident, the transport ministry and relevant agencies must conduct a thorough inspection of operation maintenance, education, and training," Choi said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If any issues are found during the inspection, please take immediate corrective action," he added. (AFP)

    Cage homes won't be under new regulations: Winnie Ho

<img alt="Winnie Ho said officials would implement new regulations over future basic housing units with care. File photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1785862_1_20250102132347.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Housing minister Winnie Ho on Thursday said the government was not including cage homes and cubicle units under the planned new regulatory regime for subdivided flats, because those are already subject to an existing licensing system.
 <br>
  <br>
  There have been calls for the government to put these so-called bed space units under the future basic housing unit regime, which would subject flats to requirements such as a minimum size.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the housing chief said there's a public misconception about this.
  <br>
  <br>
  "'Bed space' units in various forms – including 'cage homes', 'coffin homes' and 'space capsule' units – are already regulated by the licensing regime under the Bedspace Apartments Ordinance," Ho wrote in an SCMP opinion piece.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Regulation under the regime for basic housing units would only duplicate regulations and is therefore unnecessary."
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho said the government estimates that around 80,000 basic housing units would still be available in the market after the new laws are introduced.
  <br>
  <br>
  Coupled with the fact that more public housing will be available in the coming years, she said there shouldn't be much room for rents to rise significantly for subdivided flats.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho added that as tackling subdivided flats is her bureau's top priority, the government is striving to pass legal changes by the end of the year and would then implement new regulations in a gradual and careful manner.
  <br>
  <br>
  Landlords would be given up to a year and a half to register the flats, followed by a grace period of up to two years for working things out with tenants before flat conversion.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister said after the completion of registration, officials would decide on the time frame for law enforcement.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said enforcement would be carried out in an orderly manner, to avoid displacing affected households.

    HK breast milk bank to commence operations on Jan 6
   </title>

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The city's first breast milk bank – located at the Hong Kong Children's Hospital in Kowloon Bay – will start services on January 6, the Hospital Authority said.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on an RTHK programme on Thursday, the director of the Hong Kong Breast Milk Bank, Rosanna Wong, said the facility aims to collect 50 to 100 litres of breast milk in its first stage of service, so it can start supplying the milk to premature or critically-ill newborns in nine public hospitals in March when the second stage begins.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We will ensure the quality of the breast milk. We will conduct checks including screening, microbiological testing, pasteurisation, and nutritional analysis, all under precise temperature control. The processed breast milk will then be eligible to supply to the newborns,” Wong said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong said breast milk is easier for premature newborns to digest, and can reduce the chance of them developing complications due to their early birth.
  <br>
  <br>
  She hoped the bank could collect around 1,000 litres of breast milk a year in future, benefiting 450 to 600 newborns.
  <br>
  <br>
  To donate breast milk, Wong said the donor must be healthy, must not smoke nor drink alcohol, and is currently breastfeeding a baby under one year old.
  <br>
  <br>
  The donor will also have to take a blood test once every three months.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong said the facility will provide milk bottles and pouches to the donors.
  <br>
  <br>
  Donors can store their breast milk in a refrigerator at home before a courier arranged by the facility collects the milk.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong Breastfeeding Mothers’ Association welcomed the launch of the facility, with chairwoman Jacy Chan calling it "a good start".
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's very helpful for premature or critically-ill newborns because often mothers cannot breastfeed them because of the separation, so having donated breast milk to help these babies would be very good to help with their recovery," she told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan also said many women are interested in donating breast milk, so it's important to make things easier for prospective donors.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For mothers who are giving birth or have given birth at private hospitals, they have to go to the Children's Hospital in Kai Tak, so it's a little bit inconvenient sometimes for these mothers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Also, the questionnaire and the blood test used to be done from Monday to Thursday during working hours, which means I think for mothers on maternity leave it may not be as difficult, but for mothers who have returned to work it would mean they have to take a day off to go to the place specifically for this.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If they can have a bit more different points for which the mothers can do the blood test, that would be helpful."

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Transport and Logistics Mable Chan said on Thursday that imported talent can help with maintenance of the C919 aircraft in the SAR.
 <br>
  <br>
  China Eastern is now using the domestically made jet on flights between Hong Kong and Shanghai.
  <br>
  <br>
  On a radio programme, Chan was asked whether Hong Kong has a sufficient number of engineers able to carry out maintenance work on the aircraft.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Civil Aviation Department has been participating in the certification work of the C919 on the mainland since 2012, and the department has also deployed workers to the mainland to join related training courses," Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If we need more people to offer short-term support, we can also make use of existing schemes to import talents, as well as work visas to cater for the need."
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the transport chief also said flight movements at the airport returned to pre-pandemic levels over Christmas, with a daily peak of about 1,150.
  <br>
  <br>
  The average daily number of passengers exceeded 180,000 during the holiday, with a peak of 190,000 on December 21, Chan said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A man who has been charged with murder and attempted robbery, in connection with an incident in Sham Shui Po more than three decades ago, appeared in Eastern Court on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Wen Wenye, 59, was arrested last November when he entered Hong Kong via the Shenzhen Bay Port.
  <br>
  <br>
  He is alleged to be one of three people who robbed a second-hand watch store on Pei Ho Street before fleeing in a car in 1991.
  <br>
  <br>
  A 56-year-old male shopkeeper died after being shot in the head.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Eastern Magistrates’ Court has adjourned the case pending transfer to the High Court.
  <br>
  <br>
  The defendant was again remanded in custody.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police are still searching for the two other suspects.

<img alt="Professor Vivian Lou (right) says Hong Kong has to review some of its policies to better cater for the needs of those living alone.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Experts have called for more support measures to cope with the rising trend of single-person households in Hong Kong, with reviews on existing policies to better cater for their needs.
 <br>
  <br>
  The proportion of one-person households in the SAR rose from around 13 percent in 2000 to 20 percent in 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vivian Lou, professor of social work and social administration at the University of Hong Kong, said society had generally become more accepting towards those living alone.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Some of our policies, programmes, and economic activities are not biased towards multi-persons families. If you are single, you can still enjoy, participate and contribute," she said on the sidelines of the Asian Family Summit 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For part of the policies or care systems, we do need to critically review and identify the blocks; what blocks the one-person households from enjoying, asserting their choices, and participating wholly in society."
  <br>
  <br>
  Srinivas Tata, the social development division director of the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, said single-person households mostly consisted of two groups of people – young people and elderly individuals.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said support was needed to prevent singletons, in particular those from the older generation, suffering from emotional distress.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Sometimes the prescriptions are social prescriptions. It means more interactions, it means more emotional support, it means having the opportunity to interact with people," Tata said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Promoting intergenerational interactions and government policies for children to support parents are key to strengthening support for those living alone, Tata added.

 Russian gas exports via Soviet-era pipelines running through Ukraine came to a halt on New Year's Day, marking the end of decades of Moscow's dominance over Europe's energy markets.
 <br>
  <br>
  The gas had kept flowing despite nearly three years of war, but Russia's gas firm Gazprom said it had stopped after Ukraine refused to renew a transit agreement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The widely-expected stoppage will not impact prices for consumers in the European Union - unlike in 2022, when falling supplies from Russia sent prices to record highs, worsened a cost-of-living crisis and hit the bloc's competitiveness.
  <br>
  <br>
  The last remaining EU buyers of Russian gas via Ukraine, such as Slovakia and Austria, have arranged alternative supplies, while Hungary will keep receiving Russian gas via the TurkStream pipeline under the Black Sea.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Transdniestria, a breakaway pro-Russian region of Ukraine's neighbour Moldova also reliant on the transit flows, cut off heating and hot water supplies to households early on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Local energy company Tirasteploenergo urged residents to dress warmly, hang blankets or thick curtains over windows and balcony doors, and use electric heaters.
  <br>
  <br>
  The European Commission said the EU had prepared for the cut-off.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The European gas infrastructure is flexible enough to provide gas of non-Russian origin," a spokesperson for the Commission said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It has been reinforced with significant new LNG (liquefied natural gas) import capacities since 2022."
  <br>
  <br>
  Russia and the former Soviet Union spent half a century building up a major share of the European gas market, which at its peak stood at around 35 percent. But the EU has slashed its dependence on Russian energy since the start of the war in Ukraine by buying more piped gas from Norway, and LNG from Qatar and the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ukraine, which refused to extend the transit deal, said Europe had already made the decision to abandon Russian gas.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We stopped the transit of Russian gas. This is a historic event. Russia is losing its markets, it will suffer financial losses," Ukraine's Energy Minister German Galushchenko said in a statement. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 At least one person was killed and seven wounded when a Tesla Cybertruck exploded outside a hotel belonging to US President-elect Donald Trump in Las Vegas, police said on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The electric vehicle pulled up to the Trump International Hotel's glass entrance before a "large explosion," Las Vegas Sheriff Kevin McMahill told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Video footage shows the stainless steel truck parked at the hotel entrance before bursting into flames, followed by smaller explosions that appeared similar to fireworks.
  <br>
  <br>
  McMahill said there was "one deceased individual inside the Cybertruck" while seven people received "minor" injuries. He said the hotel had been evacuated.
  <br>
  <br>
  US President Joe Biden said authorities were investigating any possible link between the blast and an attack earlier Wednesday in New Orleans, in which a truck rammed a crowd, killing at least 15 people and wounding dozens.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Thus far, there's nothing to report on that score," Biden said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tesla chief Elon Musk said the explosion was "caused by very large fireworks and/or a bomb carried in the bed of the rented Cybertruck," adding in a post on X that it was "unrelated to the vehicle itself."
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier, he said the "whole Tesla senior team" was investigating the blast, adding: "We've never seen anything like this."
  <br>
  <br>
  Police said they are still working to establish the cause of the explosion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Musk, who backed Trump in the November election and was named by the Republican to head up a commission to trim government spending, said he would post more information "as soon as we learn anything." (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Elena Rybakina's Kazakhstan dumped defending champions Germany out of the United Cup with Alexander Zverev sidelined by an arm injury barely a week away from the Australian Open, while top seeds USA beat China to reach the semi-finals.
 <br>
  <br>
  In Sydney, women's world number two Iga Swiatek led Poland into the last eight by winning a rematch of her 2023 French Open final against the Czech Republic's Karolina Muchova.
  <br>
  <br>
  Britain also progressed to the quarter-finals with Katie Boulter's dominant 6-2, 6-1 victory over Australia's Olivia Gadecki enough to guarantee they won their group.
  <br>
  <br>
  The upset in Perth sent the Kazakhs into the semi-finals of the 18-nation tournament.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sixth-ranked Rybakina earned the first point for Kazakhstan, with the 2022 Wimbledon champion hammering Laura Siegemund 6-3, 6-1.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zverev then withdrew from his clash against Alexander Shevchenko at the last minute with a bicep strain, leaving the 254th-ranked Daniel Masur to face him.
  <br>
  <br>
  He put up a brave fight but Shevchenko was too strong, powering home 6-7 (5/7), 6-2, 6-2 despite a medical timeout in the second set, complaining about difficulty breathing.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I was struggling in this heat, it was so rough," said the world number 78, who upset Stefanos Tsitsipas in group play on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I had a headache and my head was spinning, but I wanted to win this one." added Shevchenko. "After [losing] the first set, I knew I had to shorten the rallies and play aggressively."
  <br>
  <br>
  In the other quarter-final, 2023 winners United States beat China thanks to singles rubber wins by Coco Gauff and Taylor Fritz.
  <br>
  <br>
  World number three Gauff beat Zhang Shuai 7-6 (7/4), 6-2, and Fritz then put the tie beyond the Chinese with a 6-4, 6-4 defeat of Zhang Zhizhen.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Coco did such a good job putting us ahead and giving me the chance to come out and put us through," said Fritz.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There was a little bit of pressure because I didn't want to be the one who loses it for the team after Coco won all her matches this week," he added. "I played a really solid match – really happy with it." (AFP)

    New Orleans attack suspect was US-born army veteran

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The New Orleans attack suspect, identified by the FBI as 42-year-old US citizen Shamsud-Din Jabbar, appeared to be a real estate agent from Texas who had spent 10 years as an IT specialist in his country's army.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a video posted on YouTube four years ago, Jabbar – speaking with a southern US accent – boasted of his skills as a "fierce negotiator" as he advertised his property management services to potential clients.
  <br>
  <br>
  Criminal records reported by the New York Times show that Jabbar had two previous charges for minor offences – one in 2002 for theft and another in 2005 for driving with an invalid licence.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jabbar was twice-married, according to the newspaper, with his second marriage ending in divorce in 2022, when he detailed experiencing financial problems in an email to his wife's lawyer.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I cannot afford the house payment," he reportedly wrote, adding that his real estate company had lost more than US$28,000 in the previous year, and that he had taken on thousands in credit card debt to pay for lawyers.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Atlanta Journal-Constitution newspaper reported that Jabbar had gotten a degree from Georgia State University.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jabbar said in his YouTube video that he served in the US military for a decade as a human resources specialist and an IT specialist.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said that with this experience, he "learned the meaning of great service and what it means to be responsive and take everything seriously, dotting I's and crossing T's to make sure that things go off without a hitch."
  <br>
  <br>
  The FBI confirmed at a news conference that Jabbar was a US army veteran but did not detail his role. The agency said it was believed that he had been honourably discharged, but that its probe was ongoing.
  <br>
  <br>
  At least 15 people were killed and more than 30 wounded when Jabbar allegedly drove a truck at high speed into a crowd of New Year's revellers in New Orleans.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities said he crashed the vehicle, then opened fire and was killed in a shootout with police. (AFP)

<img alt="Arsenal's Gabriel Jesus celebrates after scoring his team first goal. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1785803_1_20250102053400.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Arsenal closed the gap on Premier League leaders Liverpool to six points as Gabriel Jesus extended his hot-streak in a 3-1 win at Brentford on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Mikel Arteta's side were rocked by Bryan Mbeumo's first-half goal at the Gtech Community Stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Arsenal refused to be blown away on a wet and windy evening in west London as Jesus equalised before the break.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was the Brazilian's sixth goal in his last four games after he scored just once in his first 20 matches this season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mikel Merino and Gabriel Martinelli netted in quick succession soon after half-time to ensure Arsenal moved into second place above Nottingham Forest.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We won in a difficult stadium against a good opponent. The record they have here is incredible and when you go 1-0 down it makes it even harder," Arteta said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Especially when you go a goal down early in the game it becomes a mountain to climb, but we remained patient," he added. "We had to manage the situation emotionally. We were very clinical in the box. Jesus's form is very important."
  <br>
  <br>
  Excluding their 5-1 rout of Crystal Palace, the Gunners had spluttered through their last four league games with lacklustre draws against Fulham and Everton followed by a narrow win over lowly Ipswich.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Arsenal's first Premier League game of 2025 provided compelling evidence that they are ready to compete in the title race with Liverpool, who have a game in hand on the north Londoners.
  <br>
  <br>
  Runners-up to Manchester City for the last two seasons, Arsenal are unbeaten in 12 games in all competitions, a revitalising run that now includes four successive wins.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We can only win our next match and see what happens. It's not in our hands," Arteta said of chasing Liverpool.
  <br>
  <br>
  With Bukayo Saka sidelined for several months due to a hamstring injury, 17-year-old Ethan Nwaneri made his first league start for Arsenal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kai Havertz was absent after scoring Arsenal's winner against Ipswich, but Jesus ensured the German was not missed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal did not lose a single one of their 10 league London derbies in 2024 and they maintained their impressive record in capital clashes after surviving an early blow. (AFP)

 Ten people were killed and 30 injured when a vehicle drove into a crowd on New Orleans' famed Canal and Bourbon Street in the first hours of New Year's Day, according to NOLA Ready, the city’s emergency preparedness agency.
 <br>
  <br>
  New Orleans police earlier said they were responding to a mass casualty incident, including fatalities. NOLA Ready advised people to stay away from the area.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said the injured had been taken to five local hospitals.
  <br>

  The incident came toward the end of New Year’s celebrations in New Orleans and hours before the kickoff of the AllState Bowl, a college football quarterfinal held in the city's Caesars Superdome, with thousands expected to be in attendance. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Macau said its casino revenues rose by almost a quarter in 2024.
 <br>
  <br>
  Data from the SAR's Gaming Inspection and Coordination Bureau showed gaming revenue last year coming in at 227 billion patacas, 23.9 percent higher than in 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  That topped the government's estimate of 216 billion patacas, but trailed the 292.5 billion logged prior to the pandemic in 2019.
  <br>
  <br>
  Macau, the world's biggest gambling hub, is now looking to diversify its economy through new industries and increased integration with the Greater Bay Area.
  <br>
  <br>
  Its economy has been heavily reliant on casinos, which contribute about 80 percent of tax revenues. (Additional reporting by Reuters)

    Hong Kong brings back 3pc hotel accommodation tax

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong on Wednesday brought back the three percent accommodation tax which had been suspended since July 2008.
 <br>
  <br>
  While some tourists called the tax rate acceptable, others were unhappy that the extra charge wasn't clearly stipulated on booking websites.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a hotel in Wan Chai, a mainland tourist who's checking in said he finds the tax rate acceptable.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's fine, I respect your system here. The platform shows the tax added to the price and reminds you. For overseas consumption, we always pay tax in advance," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  But another tourist told RTHK that the tax wasn't clearly indicated on some online booking platforms.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think the platforms should show the tax amount in brackets, or show the prices with and without tax, then consumers would know," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The executive director of the Hong Kong Tourism Association, Timothy Chui, said the key is to make the tax collection process as straightforward as possible.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The government hasn't specified how to collect it. Some hotels want to save costs, so they collect at the front desk. We need to decide whether to make it more complex by collecting at the front desk or collect it all through online travel agents," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chui also hopes the government will consider lowering the tax rate when public finances improve.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Syria's minister of information in the country's transitional government told AFP he is working towards a free press and committed to "freedom of expression", after decades of tight control under the country's former rulers.
 <br>
  <br>
  "We are working to consolidate freedoms of the press and expression that were severely restricted" in areas controlled by the former government of Bashar al-Assad, said the minister, Mohamed al-Omar, after Islamist-led rebels on December 8 ended more than five decades of rule by the Assad clan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Syria's ruling Baath party and the Assad family dynasty heavily curtailed all aspects of daily life, including freedom of the press and expression with the media a tool of those in power.
  <br>
  <br>
  Reporters Without Borders, a freedom of information watchdog, ranked Syria second-last on its 2024 World Press Freedom Index, ahead only of Eritrea and behind Taliban-ruled Afghanistan.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There was a heavy restriction on freedom of the press and expression under the regime which practised censorship. In the period to come we are working on the reconstruction of a media landscape that is free, objective and professional," Omar said during an interview with AFP on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  He is part of the interim administration installed in Damascus by the victorious rebel coalition led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham.
  <br>
  <br>
  The group has its origins in the Syrian branch of the jihadist group Al-Qaeda and is designated a terrorist organisation by numerous governments, but has sought to soften its image in recent years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Diplomats from around the region and from the West have made contact with Syria's new rulers, who have also vowed to protect the country's religious and ethnic minorities.
  <br>
  <br>
  Omar was previously minister of information in the self-proclaimed Salvation Government, the civil administration set up in 2017 by HTS in the rebel holdout of Idlib province, in Syria's northwest. It was from Idlib that the rebels began their lightning advance towards Damascus, 13 years into the country's civil war.
  <br>
  <br>
  After the conflict erupted in 2011 with the government's brutal repression of pro-democracy protests, Assad tightened restrictions on independent journalism.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We don't want to continue in the same way, that is, have an official media whose aim is to polish the image of the ruling power," Omar said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Following Assad's overthrow and flight to Moscow, Syrian media outlets which had trumpeted his regime's glories quickly adopted a revolutionary fervour.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Tuesday Omar held an exchange with dozens of Syrian journalists to discuss the transition. (AFP)

    Investigators vow to execute warrant for Yoon

<img alt="A supporter of impeached South Korea President Yoon Suk Yeol holds up a placard. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1785766_1_20250101162556.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korean investigators said on Wednesday they would execute an arrest warrant for Yoon Suk Yeol over his declaration of martial law by the deadline of January 6, as the impeached leader's supporters rallied outside his residence.
 <br>
  <br>
  Supporters and opponents of Yoon, who was suspended from office by lawmakers over his attempt to subvert civilian rule last month, have been camped outside the compound where he has been holed up for weeks, fending off investigators' efforts to question him.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Corruption Investigation Office (CIO) requested the warrant after Yoon failed to report for questioning a third time, but it has been unclear whether they could execute it as the Presidential Security Service has previously refused to comply with search warrants.
  <br>
  <br>
  CIO chief Oh Dong-woon said on Wednesday the warrant would be executed "within the deadline", which is on Monday, January 6.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We aim for a smooth process without major disturbances, but we are also coordinating to mobilise police and personnel in preparation," he told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also warned that anyone trying to block authorities from arresting Yoon could themselves face prosecution.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We consider actions such as setting up various barricades and locking iron gates to resist the execution of our arrest warrant as obstruction of official duties," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Anyone doing this "could be prosecuted under charges of abuse of authority interfering with the exercise of rights and obstruction of official duties by special means", he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon's legal team have filed for an injunction to block the warrant and claimed on Wednesday the arrest order was "an unlawful and invalid act", lawyer Yoon Kab-keun said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The suspended president's die-hard supporters raced to Seoul to support him.
  <br>
  <br>
  Outside the presidential compound dozens of people -- some in elaborate costume -- could be seen chanting, singing and hurling vitriol at police.
  <br>
  <br>
  At one point, some attempted to break through a cordon and block a police bus from parking near the entrance -- apparently mistaking it for the mobile force that may be dispatched to detain Yoon.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police were sent to the area in large numbers and could be seen yelling at protesters to keep in line, but a route in and out of Yoon's residence remained clear.
  <br>
  <br>
  South Korean officials have previously failed to execute arrest warrants for lawmakers -- in 2000 and 2004 -- due to party members and supporters blocking police from entering for the seven-day period the warrant was valid.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon has been stripped of his presidential duties by parliament and faces criminal charges of insurrection, which could result in life imprisonment or even the death penalty.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Wednesday, the majority of Yoon's remaining staff, including his chief of staff and special advisors, all tendered their resignations to the country's acting president -- who rejected them, calling instead for unity.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is a time for everyone to come together for the stability of the livelihood of the people and national affairs," acting president Choi Sang-mok said
  <br>
  <br>
  The resignations were a show of discontent over Choi's decision to appoint two new judges to the constitutional court hearing Yoon's impeachment -- meeting a key demand of the opposition, but branded an overstepping of the powers of the acting leader by Yoon's staff.
  <br>
  <br>
  The suspended president declared martial law in a televised address, saying it was aimed at eliminating "anti-state elements" but lawmakers rushed to parliament to vote it down.
  <br>
  <br>
  At the same time, heavily armed troops stormed the building, scaling fences, smashing windows and landing by helicopter.
  <br>
  <br>
  A constitutional court will rule whether to uphold Yoon's impeachment.
  <br>
  <br>
  The turmoil deepened late last week when Yoon's replacement, Han Duck-soo, was also impeached by parliament for failing to sign bills for investigations into his predecessor.
  <br>
  <br>
  Choi took office on Friday and found himself thrust immediately into a disaster with the Jeju Air plane crash on Sunday that claimed 179 lives. (AFP)

    'Arrangements at border control points were smooth'

<img alt="The Lo Wu Control Point, which usually closes at midnight, operated until 2am on Wednesday. Photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1785753_1_20250101125820.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Security Chris Tang said arrangements at border control points were smooth, as travellers returned to the mainland in the early hours of January 1 following countdown celebrations.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Shenzhen Bay Control Point operated overnight; and the Lo Wu Control Point, which usually closes at midnight, extended its service hours to 2am. The operation of the East Rail line was also extended.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government said 400,000 people watched the fireworks display over Victoria Harbour. It added that between midnight and 6:30am, around 25,000 mainland visitors departed Hong Kong via land boundary control points.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some of the tourists RTHK spoke to said they were satisfied with the transport arrangements.
  <br>
  <br>
  Unlike last year when many visitors were left stranded after trains stopped running, one said everything was a lot smoother this time around.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We were stuck here last year... for four to five hours. We also celebrated the New Year [in Hong Kong] last year. It's more convenient this year," she told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another traveller said thanks to the extension of service hours on the East Rail line and the Lo Wu Control Point, he could return to the mainland easily.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If not, I would have to go to Mong Kok to take the overnight bus, so I saved about an hour," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The security chief, who earlier inspected the Lo Wu crossing, said he was pleased that visitors were able to cross the border smoothly and quickly.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked whether MTR lines and control points can further extend their service hours in future, Tang said the authorities have to consider different factors.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's impossible for all border control points to operate overnight. We have to look at the necessity, and how we utilise our resources," he said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The inaugural flights of the domestically-produced C919 aircraft between Shanghai and Hong Kong have opened a "new chapter" for the SAR as an international aviation hub, transport and logistics chief Mable Chan said on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The first flight that took off from Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport arrived in the SAR shortly before 11am.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a welcoming ceremony at the Hong Kong International Airport, Chan said she feels honoured to witness the historic moment on New Year's Day.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong is the first city beyond the other mainland cities to have this kind of commercial flight. So we are especially happy to see this flight materialise on the first day of 2025," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We hope that through this commercial flight, we can bring this historical innovation breakthrough in the mainland's production of civil aviation aircraft to our Hong Kong citizens, as well as to the international visitors coming to Hong Kong."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan added that the SAR has what it takes to shine as an aviation engineering hub.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong International Airport has rich experience and comprehensive facilities to fully support the maintenance of domestically produced aircraft in Hong Kong and overseas," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Secondly, the Hong Kong International Aviation Academy is an important aviation talent training base in the Asia region. The academy is planning to expand training to cover C919 aircraft, which will help domestically-produced planes enter overseas markets."
  <br>
  <br>
  The transport chief also said the government is looking to further develop the aircraft leasing market by rolling out various tax incentives, to help homegrown aircraft go global.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A domestically-produced C919 aircraft has completed its first commercial flight to Hong Kong amid much fanfare.
 <br>
  <br>
  The homegrown passenger jet, operated by China Eastern airlines and carrying around 160 passengers, took off from Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport at 8.15am on Wednesday and landed in the SAR about two and a half hours later.
  <br>
  <br>
  Passengers were treated to an exceptional travel experience, with each of them receiving a special framed boarding pass – printed with the flight number, date, as well as the letters “C919” - as a souvenir.
  <br>
  <br>
  One of those on-board the full flight was Ryan, who flew on the C919 aircraft for the first time.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I’m also a citizen of Hong Kong. It feels really special. Shanghai is my hometown and Hong Kong is like my second hometown. It’s really special to be able to experience the Chinese manufactured C919 on this flight,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ryan described the flight experience as being “impressively good.”
  <br>
  <br>
  “I am quite fortunate to get the bulkhead seat. It has plenty of leg room which is nice on a narrow-body jet. Looking back, the leg room is also big [for other seats] and the tray table is pretty nice,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  13-year-old Joe, a flying enthusiast, flew solo.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I think the control of noise is very nice. Because it’s the first aircraft of China and in some ways it’s even better than Boeing and Airbus. The seats… are really comfortable,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The meal was really good... We had this sort of Shanghai cake and another cake that had C919 letters on it and it was very delicious.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Other passengers like Gin and his son Harrison, who just happened to be on this maiden flight, said they were impressed with the flight experience.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I thought it would be very loud but the noise wasn’t big at all. The seats were quite spacious,” six-year-old Harrison said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the captain of the inaugural flight, Shang Feng, told RTHK that he's honoured and excited to take passengers to Hong Kong on board the C919.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Hong Kong is our ninth destination with C919. Over the last two years, C919 has been flying to major airports in mainland cities and it fully showcases its ability to adapt and operate smoothly in different locations. I believe future regular flights to Hong Kong will be smooth,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  China Eastern said it will be using the C919 jet for one round-trip flight between Shanghai and Hong Kong per day, with the return trip scheduled for departure at 12.55pm.

<img alt="Sunday's Jeju Air crash at Muan International Airport was the worst aviation disaster on South Korean soil. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1785745_1_20250101115248.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Investigators probing a Jeju Air crash which killed 179 people in the worst aviation disaster on South Korean soil have extracted the initial data from one of the Boeing 737-800's black boxes, an official said on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The plane was carrying 181 people from Thailand to South Korea when it issued a mayday call and belly-landed before hitting a barrier and bursting into flames, killing everyone aboard except two flight attendants pulled from the burning wreckage.
  <br>
  <br>
  South Korean and US investigators, including from Boeing, have been combing over the crash site in southwestern Muan since the disaster on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both of the plane's black boxes were retrieved, and for the cockpit voice recorder, "the initial extraction has already been completed," said deputy minister for civil aviation Joo Jong-wan.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Based on this preliminary data, we plan to start converting it into audio format," he said, meaning investigators would be able to hear the pilots' final communications.
  <br>
  <br>
  The second black box, the flight data recorder, "was found with a missing connector," Joo said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Experts are currently conducting a final review to determine how to extract data from it."
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials initially pointed to a bird strike as a possible cause of the disaster, but they have since said the probe was also examining a concrete barrier at the end of the runway, which dramatic video showed the Boeing 737-800 colliding with before bursting into flames.
  <br>
  <br>
  There have also been questions over possible mechanical failures, with local media reporting that the landing gear had deployed properly on Jeju Air Flight 2216's first failed landing attempt at Muan airport before failing on the second.
  <br>
  <br>
  The issue "will likely be examined by the Accident Investigation Board through a comprehensive review of various testimonies and evidence during the investigation process," the ministry of land, which oversees civil aviation, said at a briefing.
  <br>
  <br>
  At Muan airport, grieving families of victims had become increasingly frustrated by delays in identifying and releasing the bodies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials have said the bodies were extensively damaged by the crash, making the work of identifying remains slow and immensely difficult, even as investigators had to preserve crash-site evidence.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the country's acting president said on Wednesday the process had finally been completed, and that more bodies had been handed over to relatives so that they could hold funerals.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Overnight, the identification of all 179 victims was completed," said acting president Choi Sang-mok, who has been in office less than a week.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our investigators, along with the US National Transportation Safety Board and the manufacturer, are conducting a joint investigation into the cause of the accident," Choi said at a disaster response meeting on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A comprehensive analysis and review of the aircraft's structure and the black box data will reveal the cause of the accident," Choi added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US investigators had arrived on Monday and headed straight to Muan, with the initial on-site joint probe focusing on a navigation system that assists in aircraft landings, known as a localiser.
  <br>
  <br>
  The localiser, installed on a concrete structure at Muan International Airport, is the barrier that has been blamed for exacerbating the severity of the Jeju Air crash.
  <br>
  <br>
  The plane was largely carrying holidaymakers back from year-end trips to Bangkok, with all passengers Korean nationals except for two Thais.
  <br>
  <br>
  A fuller account of what went wrong in the flight's final moments is expected once authorities have analysed the black boxes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Memorial altars for the victims have been set up nationwide, including in Seoul and at Muan airport. (AFP)

<img alt="Chief Executive John Lee says on a video posted on social media that many good things happened to Hong Kong in 2024." src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1785741_1_20250101111607.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Wednesday said the government will focus on reforming and improving people's livelihoods in 2025.
 <br>
  <br>
  Delivering his New Year message through a video, Lee described 2024 as a historical year for Hong Kong, with many good things happening, including the completion of the national security legislation under Article 23 of the Basic Law.
  <br>
  <br>
  He highlighted new momentum for the economy, such as the two giant pandas gifted by the central authorities, the resumption of multi-entry visas for Shenzhen residents, and the commencement of the three-runway system at the Hong Kong International Airport.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee pointed out that his administration also worked on building more flats, came up with a plan to eradicate substandard subdivided units, and set up community living rooms to cater for the needs of the grassroots community.
  <br>
  <br>
  Going forward, the CE said his government has several main goals this year -- reform and embrace changes, strengthen the SAR's connectivity with the mainland and the world; as well as improve people's livelihoods and foster harmony.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Facing drastic changes both in the external and internal environments, Hong Kong must understand, respond to and embrace them, while taking the initiative to align with national development strategies," Lee said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "At the same time, we will strengthen our exchanges and cooperation with the world, open up to new markets, strengthen regional cooperation, and continue to boost our international influence."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee said the Hong Kong Park of the Hetao Co-operation Zone will start operating this year, marking a milestone for the SAR as an international I&T centre.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also noted that 9,500 light public housing units and three more community living rooms will be made available this year, while Hong Kong's first Chinese medicine hospital will commence operation in phases this year.

 Three men died after a taxi collided with a private car in the early hours of Wednesday morning.
 <br>
  <br>
  Shortly before 2 am, both cars were travelling along the West Kowloon Highway towards the Western Harbour Crossing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Near Olympic MTR Station the taxi reportedly swerved into the other vehicle's lane and hit it, causing it to go out of control, ram a concrete divider, and smash into a moving taxi and three stationary vehicles.
  <br>
  <br>
  The car driver was certified dead at the scene, while two of his four male passengers were certified dead at Princess Margaret Hospital about an hour later.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two other car passengers, along with the two in the taxi, were sent to hospital for treatment for a variety of injuries.
  <br>
  <br>
  The taxi driver was arrested on suspicion of dangerous driving causing death.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 From Sydney to Mumbai to Nairobi, communities around the world began welcoming 2025 with spectacular light shows, embraces and ice plunges.
 <br>
  <br>
  Auckland became the first major city to celebrate, as thousands thronged downtown or climbed the city’s ring of volcanic peaks for a fireworks vantage point. A light display recognised Indigenous people.
  <br>
  <br>
  Countries in the South Pacific Ocean were the first to ring in the New Year, with midnight in New Zealand striking 18 hours before the ball drop in Times Square in New York.
  <br>
  <br>
  Conflict muted acknowledgements of the start of 2025 in places like the Middle East, Sudan and Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fireworks blasted off the Sydney Harbour Bridge and across the bay. More than a million Australians and others gathered at the iconic Sydney Harbour for the celebration. British pop star Robbie Williams led a singalong with the crowd.
  <br>
  <br>
  The celebration also featured Indigenous ceremonies and performances that acknowledged the land’s first people.
  <br>
  <br>
  Much of Japan shut down ahead of the nation’s biggest holiday, as temples and homes underwent a thorough cleaning.
  <br>
  <br>
  The upcoming Year of the Snake in the Asian zodiac is heralded as one of rebirth – alluding to the reptile’s shedding skin. Other places in Asia will mark the Year of the Snake later, with the Lunar New Year.
  <br>
  <br>
  In South Korea, celebrations were cut back or cancelled during a period of national mourning following Sunday's crash of a Jeju Air flight in Muan that killed 179 people.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Thailand's Bangkok, shopping malls competed for crowds with live musical acts and fireworks shows. A fireworks display in Indonesia's Jakarta featured 800 drones.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chinese state media covered an exchange of New Year’s greetings between leader Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin in a reminder of the growing closeness between the two leaders.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi told Putin their countries will “always move forward hand in hand,” the official Xinhua News Agency said.
  <br>
  <br>
  In India, thousands of revellers in the financial hub of Mumbai flocked to the city's bustling promenade facing the Arabian Sea. In Sri Lanka, people gathered at Buddhist temples to light oil lamps and incense sticks and pray.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Dubai, thousands attended a fireworks show at the Burj Khalifa, the world’s tallest skyscraper. And in Nairobi, Kenya, scattered fireworks were heard as midnight approached.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rome’s traditional New Year’s Eve festivities have an additional draw: the start of Pope Francis’ Holy Year, the once-every-quarter-century celebration projected to bring some 32 million pilgrims to the Eternal City in 2025.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Tuesday, Francis will celebrate a vespers at St. Peter’s Basilica, followed by Mass on Wednesday, when he is expected to again appeal for peace in Ukraine and the Middle East.
  <br>
  <br>
  January 1 is a day of obligation for Catholics, marking the Solemnity of Mary.
  <br>
  <br>
  Paris capped a momentous 2024 with its traditional countdown and fireworks extravaganza on the Champs-Elysées. The city’s emblematic Arc de Triomphe monument was turned into a giant tableau for a light show that celebrated the city's landmarks and the passage of time, with whirring clocks.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Paris is a party,” proclaimed Mayor Anne Hidalgo.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Summer Olympics and Paralympic Games hosted in the French capital from July to September had transformed the city into a site of joy, fraternity and astonishing sporting achievements.
  <br>
  <br>
  Frank and Rowena Klar from San Francisco visited the French capital to celebrate 31 years together. “If you start it big, we think we’re going to have a great year," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  London rang in the New Year with a pyrotechnic display along the River Thames. With a storm bringing bitter weather to other parts of the United Kingdom, however, festivities in Edinburgh, Scotland, were cancelled.
  <br>
  <br>
  But in Switzerland and some other places, people embraced the cold, stripping and plunging into the water in freezing temperatures.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rio de Janeiro will throw Brazil’s main New Year’s Eve bash on Copacabana Beach, with ferries offshore launching 12 straight minutes of fireworks. Thousands of tourists on cruise ships will witness the show up close.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 2 million people were expected at the Copacabana, hoping to squeeze into concerts by superstar Brazilian artists such as pop singer Anitta and Grammy-award winner Caetano Veloso.
  <br>
  <br>
  In New York City, the organisation managing Times Square has tested its famous ball drop and inspected 2025 numerals, lights and thousands of crystals as part of a tradition going back to 1907. This year’s celebration will include musical performances by TLC, Jonas Brothers, Rita Ora and Sophie Ellis-Bextor.
  <br>
  <br>
  Las Vegas' pyrotechnic show will be on the Strip, with 340,000 people anticipated as fireworks are launched from the rooftops of casinos. Nearby, the Sphere venue will display for the first time countdowns to midnight in different time zones.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Pasadena, California, Rose Parade spectators were camping out and hoping for prime spots. And some 200,000 people were flocking to a country music party in Nashville, Tennessee.
  <br>
  <br>
  American Samoa will be among the last to welcome 2025, a full 24 hours after New Zealand. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce led all players in fan voting for the 2025 Pro Bowl Games, the NFL said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Kelce, whose romance with Taylor Swift brought the NFL to the attention of the pop megastar's legion of fans, finished with 252,200 votes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Detroit Lions running back Jahmyr Gibbs was second overall with 250,082 votes and Washington's rookie quarterback Jayden Daniels, who has helped the Commanders into the playoffs, was third with 242,352.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Lions led all clubs in total votes received, followed by the Minnesota Vikings, Commanders, Philadelphia Eagles and Pittsburgh Steelers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Selections for the Pro Bowl Games rosters for the AFC and NFC are determined by a combination of voting by fans, players and coaches, with each group's vote counting for one-third of the tally.
  <br>
  <br>
  The NFL's all-star event will be staged February 2 in Orlando, Florida, for the second consecutive year as 88 players take part in skills competitions, including a flag football showdown with former NFL star quarterbacks Peyton and Eli Manning serving as coaches. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Famed actors Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie signed off on a divorce settlement on Monday, according to US media, marking a turning point in the eight-year legal saga.
 <br>
  <br>
  Jolie's attorney James Simon confirmed the settlement to People Magazine, saying in a statement that Jolie was "focused on finding peace and healing for their family."
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is just one part of a long ongoing process that started eight years ago," Simon said. "Frankly, Angelina is exhausted, but she is relieved this one part is over."
  <br>
  <br>
  No details of the settlement between the former power couple were immediately available.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jolie filed to dissolve their marriage in September 2016, and the pair has remained locked in a court battle since.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jolie filed for divorce a few days after a flight during which she alleged in court papers that Pitt "choked" one of their children and hit another during a plane fight.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the papers lodged in a Los Angeles court and widely quoted in US media, Jolie describes a lengthy eruption by Pitt as the couple flew with the children from California to France in September 2016.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the ensuing years, the A-listers have clashed over custody of the children – three biological and three adopted – and more recently over the ownership of a luxury French property they bought together.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2018, the couple reached a custody arrangement for their six children, three of whom are adopted, though it appears to have since unravelled.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pitt and Jolie first got together after co-starring as married assassins in the 2005 film "Mr. and Mrs Smith." Pitt was married to Jennifer Aniston at the time. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks slipped on Tuesday to end 2024 on a gloomy note, but investors capped a strong overall year that was boosted by tech stocks, interest rate cuts and a robust US economy.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones lost 0.1 percent to 42,544, while the S&P 500 Index declined 0.4 percent to 5,881.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Nasdaq fell 0.9 percent to 19,310.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was kind of a disappointing end to the year," said Steve Sosnick of Interactive Brokers, noting that markets have closed lower for a few consecutive days.
  <br>
  <br>
  He believed the selling in recent days involved "some large portfolios reallocating money from stocks."
  <br>
  <br>
  But "this year was phenomenal" overall, he said, noting that major indexes moved higher and major tech stocks dominated.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow was up around 13 percent from a year ago while the S&P 500 added more than 23 percent and the Nasdaq gained nearly 29 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Key factors included semiconductor and artificial intelligence stocks, with enthusiasm around Artificial Intelligence (AI) helping the "Magnificent Seven" US tech heavyweights – which include Apple and Nvidia – this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Concerns about the pace of US interest rate cuts and uncertainty over President-elect Donald Trump's trade and tariff agenda could cloud the outlook, however.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Sosnick believed "there's a lot of optimism about the coming year." (AFP)

 Hong Kong welcomed 2025 with a colourful fireworks display over Victoria Harbour as hundreds of thousands around the city celebrated the arrival of the new year.
 <br>
  <br>
  Themed "The Symphony of Happiness", the 12-minute show was in five parts. It kicked off with bright red fireworks, symbolising a fiery passion for life and dreams.
  <br>
  <br>
  The second section used pyrotechnic technology, creating the effect of flowers blooming one after another. This was followed by green and gold fireworks, showing an evergreen tree representing the spirit of strong perseverance, hard work and quiet cultivation.
  <br>
  <br>
  The fourth part was named the "Golden Waterfall". It took the form of golden fireworks cascading down the sky.
  <br>
  <br>
  The final section - "Propitious Clouds" - was making its debut in Hong Kong. It took the form of rainbow-coloured smoke with silver fireworks.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Sydney welcomed 2025 with a massive fireworks display at its iconic harbour.
 <br>
  <br>
  The self-proclaimed "New Year's capital of the world", sprayed nine tonnes of fireworks from its iconic Opera House and Harbour Bridge at midnight, creating a spectacle that was awash with vibrant colours.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities said more than a million people gathered to watch the display as British pop star Robbie Williams led a singalong while Indigenous ceremonies and performances acknowledged the land's first people.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier, Auckland became the first major city to ring in the new year, with thousands of revellers counting down to 2025 and cheering at colourful fireworks launched from New Zealand’s tallest structure, Sky Tower, and a spectacular downtown light show.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thousands also thronged to downtown or climbed the city’s ring of volcanic peaks for a fireworks vantage point, and a light display recognising Auckland’s Indigenous tribes.
  <br>
  <br>
  It follows a year marked by protests over Māori rights in the nation of five million people.
  <br>
  <br>
  Countries in the South Pacific Ocean are the first to ring in the New Year, with midnight in New Zealand striking 18 hours before the ball drop in Times Square in New York. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Crowds of citizens and tourists gathered along Victoria Harbour on Tuesday for the New Year's Eve fireworks display.
 <br>
  <br>
  Crowd control measures were in place with a number of exits at Tsim Sha Tsui and East Tsim Sha Tsui MTR stations temporarily closed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some mainland tourists were excited for the fireworks display. They also found the countdown celebrations in Hong Kong “lively”.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 12-minute show will cover a distance of 1,300 metres from Central to North Point. The fireworks will be launched at different heights and angles by five barges and 16 pontoons, arranged in two rows on the harbour.
  <br>
  <br>
  Service hours at the Lo Wu Control Point will be extended to 2am, while the Shenzhen Bay Control Point will stay open throughout the night, to facilitate tourist flows.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Plymouth Argyle have mutually agreed to part ways with head coach Wayne Rooney after just over seven months in charge, the second-tier Championship club said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Rooney had replaced Ian Foster in May on a three-year deal at Plymouth. However, the team struggled under his leadership, failing to win away this season, and are bottom with 18 points from 23 games, four points adrift of the safety zone.
  <br>
  <br>
  The former Manchester United and England forward oversaw 25 matches in all competitions before his departure.
  <br>
  <br>
  It marks the second setback for Rooney in 2024 following his dismissal as Birmingham City head coach in January.
  <br>
  <br>
  "First team coach Kevin Nancekivell and club captain Joe Edwards will lead the team for our Championship match against Bristol City on New Year’s Day," Plymouth said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rooney added: "Plymouth Argyle will always hold a special place in my heart, and I will continue to look out for and take interest in their results.”
  <br>
  <br>
  He was appointed Birmingham manager in October 2023 when they were sixth but sacked in January after they fell to 20th in the league.
  <br>

<div class="itemFullText">
 A flight attendant aboard a Swiss aircraft that made an emergency landing in Austria last week due to smoke in the cabin has died, the airline said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The flight from Bucharest to Zurich on December 23 was diverted to Graz after engine problems and smoke filled the cockpit and the cabin, Swiss International Air Lines said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said the attendant died on Monday in intensive care in the hospital in Graz. The attendant was one of two crew members who were hospitalised.
  <br>
  <br>
  All 74 passengers aboard the Airbus A220-300 were evacuated after flight LX1885 landed safely, Swiss said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We are devastated at our dear colleague’s death,” Swiss Chief Executive Officer Jens Fehlinger said in the statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  “His loss has left us all in the deepest shock and grief. Our thoughts are with his family, whose pain we cannot imagine. I offer them my heartfelt condolences on behalf of all of us at Swiss."
  <br>
  <br>
  The public prosecutor's office in Graz has ordered a forensic examination of the attendant's body, Austria's APA news agency reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  It has also appointed an aviation expert and initiated an investigation into the cause of the accident.
  <br>
  <br>
  Following the incident, Swiss said it was also conducting an internal examination.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We want to thoroughly clarify the causes of the smoke and the effects on passengers and crew,” the airline wrote on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The focus is on the mechanical parts of the aircraft, such as the engine, but also on the use of protective equipment for the cabin crew, known as Protective Breathing Equipment.” (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Beijing on Tuesday rejected accusations that a China state-sponsored actor was behind a cyber breach at the US Treasury Department, calling the claims "groundless".
 <br>
  <br>
  China denied the claims, with the Foreign Ministry saying Beijing "has always opposed all forms of hacker attacks, and we are even more opposed to the spread of false information against China for political purposes".
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have stated our position many times regarding such groundless accusations that lack evidence," Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to the US Treasury, the incident happened earlier this month, when the actor compromised a third-party cybersecurity service provider and was able to remotely access the workstations and some unclassified documents.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Treasury contacted the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency after it was alerted of the situation by its provider BeyondTrust, and has been working with law enforcement to ascertain the impact.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The compromised BeyondTrust service has been taken offline and there is no evidence indicating the threat actor has continued access to Treasury systems or information," the department's spokesperson said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The department did not provide further details on what was affected by the breach, but said more information would be released in a supplemental report at a later date.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Treasury takes very seriously all threats against our systems, and the data it holds," the spokesperson added. (AFP)
