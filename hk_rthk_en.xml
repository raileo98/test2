<div class="itemFullText">
 China wants to achieve a "fair, lasting and binding peace agreement" acceptable to all parties on the Ukraine war, Foreign Minister Wang Yi said on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Everyone hopes to achieve a fair, lasting, binding peace agreement that every side can accept," Wang told reporters during an annual press conference on the sidelines of the Two Sessions in Beijing.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China is willing to cooperate with the international community in accordance with the wishes of relevant parties to achieve a final resolution of the crisis and lasting peace, and will continue to play a constructive role."
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang added that "conflict has no winners, and peace has no losers".
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the foreign minister said ties with Russia were a "constant in a turbulent world" as he addressed the press conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A mature, resilient, and stable China-Russia relationship will not change due to temporary events, nor will it be disrupted by third-party interference," Wang said.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the Middle East, Wang called for a "lasting ceasefire" between Hamas and Israel in Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If major powers genuinely care about the people of Gaza, they should promote a comprehensive and lasting ceasefire in Gaza and increase humanitarian assistance," Wang said. (Agencies)

    Second measles-related death in US in a decade

<img alt="Measles testing takes place amid an outbreak in Texas. File Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1794679_1_20250307093051.jpg&q=35">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A New Mexico resident who has died, tested positive for measles, the state health department said on Thursday, marking the second measles-related death in the United States in more than a decade.
 <br>
  <br>
  The unvaccinated adult patient did not seek medical care before death, and was the first measles-related death in the state in more than 40 years, according to David Morgan, Public Information Officer for the New Mexico Department of Health.
  <br>
  <br>
  The cause of death is still under investigation by the state medical examiner, Morgan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The death brings to 10 the number of measles cases that occurred in Lea County, located adjacent to Gaines County, Texas, where more than 100 cases and one death in an unvaccinated child have been reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  The outbreak, one of the largest the United States has seen in the past decade, has put US Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr, a long-time vaccine sceptic, to the test.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a cabinet meeting last week, Kennedy initially downplayed news that a school-aged child had died of measles, calling such outbreaks ordinary and failing to mention the role of vaccination to prevent measles.
  <br>
  <br>
  Over the weekend, Kennedy published an opinion piece on Fox News that promoted the role of vaccination, but downplayed the role of vaccines by telling parents vaccination was a personal choice and urging them to consult with their physician.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also stressed the role of vitamin A, overstating evidence for its use, which has only been shown to decrease measles severity in developing countries among individuals who are malnourished and vitamin A deficient, said Dr Paul Offit, an infectious diseases expert at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia.
  <br>
  <br>
  As of February 27, 164 measles cases have been reported to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in nine jurisdictions: Alaska, California, Georgia, Kentucky, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York City, Rhode Island, and Texas.
  <br>
  <br>
  Measles typically kills 1 to 3 people per 1,000 cases, said Dr Tina Tan, an infectious disease expert at Northwestern University in Chicago.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said two deaths out of a total of 164 cases suggest "a much higher mortality rate than we would normally see," adding that there are probably many undetected cases. (Reuters)

<img alt="President Trump listens as Rodolphe Saade, CEO of CMA CGM Group, speaks in the Oval Office. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1794675_1_20250307092145.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump on Thursday said French-based shipping firm CMA CGM would invest US$20 billion in the United States to build out shipping logistics and terminals.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Trump administration wants to revive shipbuilding in the United States and weaken China's grip on the sector.
  <br>
  <br>
  The president's team is preparing an executive order that would impose a levy on ships linked to China when they call at US ports, and wants US allies to do the same.
  <br>
  <br>
  CMA CGM is the world's third-largest container shipping line and is part of a vessel-sharing alliance with companies including China's COSCO.
  <br>
  <br>
  CMA CGM said last week that US port fees on China-built ships would have a big impact on all shipping firms.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said on Thursday he would announce a new program for building ships in the United States next week or the following week, including incentives.
  <br>
  <br>
  CMA CGM CEO Rodolphe Saade, who joined Trump in the Oval Office, confirmed the US$20 billion investment and said it would create 10,000 jobs.
  <br>
  <br>
  The investment over four years would include expansion of container ports and the creation of an air cargo hub in Chicago supported by five new Boeing 777 freighters flown by American pilots, CMA CGM said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Saade, a French-Lebanese billionaire who controls CMA CGM with other family members, told Trump at the White House that his group was looking at supporting the building of container ships and would make an announcement "in the coming weeks".
  <br>
  <br>
  CMA CGM operates port terminals in New York and Los Angeles. The Marseille-based firm is the biggest cargo carrier for US retail giant Walmart. (Reuters)

    Cyclone Alfred edges closer to Australia's east coast

<div class="itemFullText">
 Violent winds toppled power lines on Friday as a tropical cyclone inched towards Australia's eastern coast, sparking evacuation orders and leaving more than 50,000 homes without electricity.
 <br>
  <br>
  Tropical Cyclone Alfred was 165 kilometres east of Brisbane city on Friday morning, crawling towards the densely-populated coastline at "walking speed", government forecasts said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some four million people were in the firing line along a 400-kilometre stretch of coastline straddling the border of Queensland state and New South Wales.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is a region rarely troubled by typhoons - it has been more than 50 years since a tropical cyclone made landfall in that part of Queensland.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 50,000 homes were without power on Friday morning as damaging winds brought down power lines, officials and utility companies said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Queensland Premier David Crisafulli said the storm already "packed a punch", warning conditions would get worse as it approached land late on Friday or early Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Emergency response officials said they had issued evacuation orders for some 10,000 people in the flood-prone northern rivers region of New South Wales.
  <br>
  <br>
  There was particular concern for the town of Lismore, which was engulfed by record 14-metre floodwaters after heavy rains in 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  Many residents have spent the past three days fortifying their homes with sandbags, tying down loose furniture and stocking up on food and water.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said the region should "hope for the best, but prepare for the worst".
  <br>
  <br>
  "When nature does its worst, Australians are at our best. We rally. We lift each other up. We look out for our neighbours," he told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tropical Cyclone Alfred would likely cross the coast "early Saturday morning", the Bureau of Meteorology said, although its path was becoming difficult to predict.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was forecast to make landfall around 60 kilometres north of Brisbane.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 900 schools across Queensland state and neighbouring parts of northern New South Wales were closed on Friday, education department officials said. (AFP)

    SpaceX loses contact with Starship rocket after launch

<img alt="The Super Heavy booster returns to its launch pad after the SpaceX Starship spacecraft continued to space following its launch on its eighth test. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1794668_1_20250307085312.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Elon Musk's SpaceX saw mixed results in the latest test launch of its Starship mega-rocket on Thursday, successfully catching the massive booster but with the upper stage failing for the second consecutive time.
 <br>
  <br>
  Minutes after lift-off and booster separation, a video live feed showed the upper stage tumbling uncontrollably, with signal soon cutting out.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Can confirm we did lose contact with the ship. Unfortunately, this happened last time, too," SpaceX official Dan Huot said, alluding to the January launch that saw the upper stage explode over the Caribbean, raining debris.
  <br>
  <br>
  The new setback could fuel questions over Musk's attention to his space company, as the billionaire spends most of his time in Washington leading US President Donald Trump's government overhaul efforts.
  <br>
  <br>
  That work has also prompted mounted scrutiny over Musk's influence on the US government space program.
  <br>
  <br>
  Starship, the world's biggest and most powerful launch vehicle, successfully blasted off from SpaceX's Starbase facility in Boca Chica, Texas shortly after 5:30 pm local time.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was Starship's eighth orbital mission - all so far uncrewed - and the first since its dramatic mid-air explosion over the Caribbean during its last trial.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite losing contact with the upper stage again, SpaceX managed to return the huge booster stage to the launch tower - catching it with arms called "chopsticks." It was the third time SpaceX completed the tricky engineering feat.
  <br>
  <br>
  About 40 minutes after the launch, Spacex turned off its livestream and the fate of the errant upper stage was not immediately known. (AFP)

<img alt='NPC deputies Frank Chan (L) and Nicholas Chan (R) are attending the "Two Sessions" meetings in Beijing. Photo: RTHK' src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1794665_1_20250307083708.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Former transport secretary Frank Chan says it is appropriate for the government to find new sources of income under a fiscal deficit, but it should carefully assess the impact of any new policies.
 <br>
  <br>
  Financial Secretary Paul Chan announced in his Budget last month a proposed HK$200 levy on private cars every time they leave Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on the sidelines of the "Two Sessions" in Beijing, Chan - a Hong Kong deputy to the National People’s Congress (NPC) - said it was inevitable that new policies would have consequences.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he believed the authorities had done analysis on the possible impact.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I would expect the officers to come up with some kind of information and impact analysis so as to convince the public whether or not they should and how much it is to be raised," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Because at the time there's a financial deficit incurring in Hong Kong, then there must be a way that we need to balance it out.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Another NPC deputy Nicholas Chan said the government should also look into ways to help those being affected by policy changes.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We would have to probably take a more holistic approach about how we help people who might suffer from this, and if this is - overall - good for the economy, how do we lessen the hurt on those who are going to feel aggrieved by such a move,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government also announced plans to adjust the city’s subsidised public transport fares for the elderly, including setting a cap on the number of subsidised trips per month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Frank Chan said the subsidised transport fare was a welfare policy, instead of a transport policy, and that it is a responsible act of the government to review it based on the actual situation.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks resumed their retreat on Thursday, falling hard ahead of key US jobs data as markets shrugged off President Trump's latest moves to soften tariff actions.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump on Thursday unveiled a temporary rollback to steep tariffs targeting Canada and Mexico, but the shift was not enough to spark a change in stock market activity.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished down one percent at 42.579, after spending the entire session in negative territory.
  <br>
  <br>
  The broad-based S&P 500 slumped 1.8 percent to 5,738, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index sank 2.6 percent to 18,069.
  <br>
  <br>
  Art Hogan of B. Riley Wealth Management said the uncertainty around trade policy is "affecting the real economy," dragging down consumer sentiment and business investment.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The longer that goes on, the more the economy slows," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier, the European Central Bank cut interest rates again to boost the struggling eurozone, but suggested the easing could be nearing an end and warned of "rising uncertainty" amid massive German spending plans and US tariff threats.
  <br>
  <br>
  Large tech firms were among the bigger losers Thursday, including Netflix, down 8.5 percent, Tesla, down 5.6 percent and Nvidia, down 5.7 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Markets are looking ahead to Friday's jobs report for February. Weekly jobless claims figures released on Thursday were better than expected, while Wednesday's private payroll report from ADP lagged estimates. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Manchester United drew 1-1 away to Real Sociedad in the first leg of their Europa League last-16 tie, while Tottenham suffered a 1-0 loss away to Dutch side AZ Alkmaar.
 <br>
  <br>
  Joshua Zirkzee drilled in from just outside the area to give United the lead on 57 minutes in San Sebastian, but Mikel Oyarzabal levelled from the spot after Bruno Fernandes was punished for a handball.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zirkzee cut a distraught figure after missing the decisive penalty in last week's FA Cup shootout loss to Fulham and has endured a testing first season at United, whose only remaining hope of silverware is in the Europa League.
  <br>
  <br>
  He scored for the first time in Europe this term, unleashing a sharp low drive from 20 yards after being teed up by Alejandro Garnacho's inviting pass.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Ruben Amorim's side could not hold on to their advantage as Fernandes handled at a corner, with Oyarzabal confidently converting his spot-kick.
  <br>
  <br>
  Andre Onana made two excellent saves to keep United level as Real Sociedad pressed for a winner, leaving the tie evenly poised ahead of next week's second leg.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I felt until the penalty we had control of the game and then I think the penalty changed a little bit the momentum," Amorim said. "I felt our team in the last 30 minutes were really, really tired.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We take this stage to Old Trafford, and it's going to be a different game," he added. "The pressure is going to be on us in that stadium and we have to be ready."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lucas Bergvall's first-half own goal condemned Spurs to defeat in the Netherlands, and it could have been worse for Ange Postecoglou's side were it not for two fine saves from Guglielmo Vicario.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Rangers recorded an impressive 3-1 win away to a Fenerbahce team coached by Jose Mourinho.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cyriel Dessers put Rangers ahead early on in Istanbul before Alexander Djiku hauled Fenerbahce level.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vaclav Cerny restored the lead for the Scots before striking again nine minutes from time to place Rangers in firm control under interim boss Barry Ferguson.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lyon also took a big stride towards the quarter-finals with a 3-1 victory at Romanians FCSB.
  <br>
  <br>
  Paulo Fonseca fought back tears as his players celebrated Nicolas Tagliafico's opener with him, a day after the Portuguese coach was banned from the dugout until November by French football officials after an angry altercation with a referee.
  <br>
  <br>
  Malick Fofana won the game for Lyon with two late goals after Alexandru Baluta had equalised for FCSB.
  <br>
  <br>
  Roma host Athletic Bilbao later on Thursday, while Ajax are at home to Eintracht Frankfurt. Lazio travel to Viktoria Plzen for the first leg of their tie. (AFP)

 President Xi Jinping on Thursday underscored the role of education in advancing science, technology, and talent development, calling for deeper alignment with the country's modernisation needs.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a joint group meeting during the third session of the 14th National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), Xi emphasised cultivating talent, maximising their potential, and integrating education with national priorities.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi, also general secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military Commission, called for comprehensive education reforms, including granting schools greater autonomy and improving governance.
  <br>
  <br>
  He stressed the need to instill in students the thought of socialism with Chinese characteristics for a new era.
  <br>
  <br>
  Education must play a fundamental role in fostering innovation and self-reliant talent training, Xi said, calling for mechanisms to align education with economic and social development.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also highlighted the CPPCC's role in supporting national education and talent strategies.
  <br>
  <br>
  President Xi Jinping on Thursday also extended festive greetings and best wishes to the country's women of all ethnic groups and from all walks of life ahead of International Women's Day, which falls on March 8. (Xinhua)

    Trump backs off Mexico, Canada tariffs

<img alt="US President Donald Trump said after a phone call with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum that fresh tariffs targeting Mexico would not apply to trade that falls under an existing regional pact. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1794641_1_20250307042023.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump on Thursday unveiled a temporary rollback to steep tariffs targeting Canada and Mexico, providing some reprieve to companies and consumers after blowback on financial markets.
 <br>
  <br>
  After his sweeping tariffs of up to 25 percent on the two US neighbors took effect on Tuesday, stock markets tumbled, while economists warned that blanket levies could weigh on US growth and raise inflation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump signed orders Thursday to delay fresh levies for Canadian and Mexican imports covered by a North American trade agreement, though he dismissed suggestions that his decisions were linked to market turmoil.
  <br>
  <br>
  The halt, which lasts until April 2, came one day after the White House announced similar relief for automakers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Following talks with the "Big Three" US automakers Stellantis, Ford and General Motors, Trump decided to give a one-month exemption on autos coming through the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA).
  <br>
  <br>
  A White House official told reporters that about 62 percent of Canadian imports will still face the new tariffs, although much of these are energy imports hit by a lower rate of 10 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  About half of Mexican imports come through the USMCA.
  <br>
  <br>
  The latest moves make conditions "much more favorable for our American car manufacturers," Trump said on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he added that major moves would be unveiled on April 2, the date that he has promised "reciprocal tariffs" to remedy practices Washington deems unfair.
  <br>
  <br>
  At that point, Canadian and Mexican goods could still face levies.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US president also said he would not modify broad tariffs for steel and aluminum, which are due to take effect next week.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump told reporters Thursday in the Oval Office that he had a "very good conversation" with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum earlier.
  <br>
  <br>
  His remarks stood in sharp contrast to the simmering tensions with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trudeau said on Thursday that Ottawa will remain in a trade war with Washington for "the foreseeable future" even if there are "breaks for certain sectors." (AFP)

<img alt="Irish captain Caelan Doris will earn his 50th cap in Saturday's crucial match against France in Dublin. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1794627_1_20250306222902.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Irish captain Caelan Doris is fit and will face France, handing a massive boost to Ireland ahead of their potential Six Nations title decider in Dublin on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 26-year-old No 8, who missed the win over Wales last month owing to a knee injury, will win his 50th cap and is one of four changes to the starting XV from the Welsh match.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fullback Hugo Keenan returns, as does prop Finlay Bealham, who was a replacement against the Welsh, and Bundee Aki comes in to partner Robbie Henshaw in the centres for the suspended Garry Ringrose.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Caelan has done incredibly well to get back to full fitness," Ireland's interim head coach Simon Easterby told reporters on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It says a lot about him that he has done as many other players might not have been able to do that in such a short space of time."
  <br>
  <br>
  Jamie Osborne, who stood in for Keenan against Wales, moves to the wing as Mack Hansen has a thigh injury.
  <br>
  <br>
  Easterby said Osborne's versatility earned him the nod ahead of an out-and-out winger such as Calvin Nash.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We felt it was right to give him (Osborne) the right wing as it gives us coverage across the backs due to his versatility," said Easterby.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Mack (Hansen) was touch and go, but he was comfortable with the call."
  <br>
  <br>
  Sam Prendergast and Jamison Gibson-Park, who have been outstanding thus far, will form the half-back partnership.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jack Conan, who started the Wales game instead of the injured Doris, has also recovered from a lower back problem and will be on the bench.
  <br>
  <br>
  Like Bealham and Doris, Conan is set for his 50th Test appearance. (AFP)

<img alt="Only 4.5 percent of private flats were vacant as of end-2024, the government says. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1794626_1_20250306222204.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Authorities insist there is still keen demand for housing, citing a low vacancy rate for private flats, in response to a market report suggesting the city's home market is on the decline due to a supply glut.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a statement on Thursday, an SAR government spokesman added delinquent residential mortgages remained at an extremely low level, and that banks are mitigating their credit risks.
  <br>
  <br>
  The comments were in response to a S&P report on Hong Kong's banks and property market.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We disagree with the observation that there is an oversupply of residential properties," the spokesman said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As of the end of last year, the vacancy rate for private homes stood at 4.5 percent, in line with the average between 2004 and 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Rents also keep going up, reflecting keen housing demand."
  <br>
  <br>
  As for delinquent residential mortgages, only 0.12 percent of all loans drawn were overdue as of end-January.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Under the Monetary Authority's counter-cyclical measures, the city's average residential mortgage rate remained solid at 60 percent, while the debt-servicing ratio, at 40 percent, was also low," the statement read.
  <br>
  <br>
  The spokesman added it agreed with the report's view that Hong Kong's banking sector can withstand "strains arising from the commercial real estate" sector, saying loans are diversified and institutions have taken measures to mitigate risks.

    World's sea ice cover hits record low in February

<img alt="In the Antarctic the frozen cover was 26 percent below average across February. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1794625_1_20250306221837.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Global sea ice cover fell to a historic low in February when the world continued to experience exceptional heat, and temperatures reached 11 degrees Celsius above average near the North Pole, Europe's climate monitor said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Copernicus Climate Change Service said last month was the third hottest February on record, continuing a run of persistent warming since 2023 stoked by greenhouse gas emissions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Combined Antarctic and Arctic sea ice cover – ocean water that freezes and floats on the surface – dropped to a record minimum extent of 16.04 million square kilometres on February 7, Copernicus said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "February 2025 continues the streak of record or near-record temperatures observed throughout the last two years," said Samantha Burgess of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, which runs Copernicus.
  <br>
  <br>
  "One of the consequences of a warmer world is melting sea ice, and the record or near-record low sea ice cover at both poles has pushed global sea ice cover to an all-time minimum."
  <br>
  <br>
  The poles are the most sensitive regions to climate change on the planet, warming several times faster than the global average.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arctic ice cover, which normally expands to its annual winter maximum in March, was a historic February low last month, eight percent below average, Copernicus said. That marked the third monthly record in a row.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the Antarctic, where it is now summer and the ice is melting, the frozen cover was 26 percent below average across February, it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Antarctic region may have hit its annual low point towards the end of the month, Copernicus said, adding that if confirmed, this would be the second-lowest daily minimum coverage in the satellite record. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 EU leaders gathered with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Thursday in Brussels in search of unity on bolstering Ukraine and Europe's defences, after US President Donald Trump upended traditional US alliances and retracted wartime backing for Kyiv.
 <br>
  <br>
  Thursday's summit brings all 27 EU leaders together for the first time since last week's explosive meeting between presidents Trump and Zelensky, with Washington since suspending military aid and intelligence sharing to help Kyiv fight Russia.
  <br>
  <br>
  This has sent Ukraine's allies scrambling, with EU leaders openly questioning Washington's reliability as a security partner going forward.
  <br>
  <br>
  While the Brussels meeting will aim to cement European support for Kyiv, it is unlikely to yield any major announcements of aid beyond the 30 billion euros (US$32 billion) the bloc has already committed for this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The prospect of the United States pivoting from its European partners in Nato has fuelled a growing consensus on the summit's other major topic: the need to strengthen Europe's defences against Russia.
  <br>
  <br>
  European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen has laid out a plan aimed at mobilising 800 billion euros to "re-arm Europe" – largely by freeing states to spend much more – which leaders are expected to greenlight on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Europe faces a clear and present danger on a scale that none of us has seen in our adult lifetime," she wrote to leaders, urging Europe to "act as decisively as the situation dictates."
  <br>
  <br>
  France's President Emmanuel Macron doubled down in a sombre address to the nation on the summit's eve, calling for a defence spending surge to confront a "new era" and saying he would discuss extending France's nuclear deterrent to European partners.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Who can believe that this Russia of today will stop at Ukraine?" Macron asked. "I want to believe that the United States will stay by our side, but we have to be prepared for that not to be the case."
  <br>
  <br>
  Germany's chancellor-in-waiting, Friedrich Merz, who conferred with EU chiefs in Brussels ahead of the talks, has likewise declared himself ready for "the worst-case scenario" and embraced radical reforms to ramp up Germany's defence spending.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bolstering European defences has taken on acute urgency as Trump makes clear his desire to swiftly end the three-year war through direct negotiations with Moscow.
  <br>
  <br>
  His embrace of Russian President Vladimir Putin, while expressing contempt toward Zelensky, has cemented fears that Kyiv and Europe's interests will be overlooked in any deal to end the biggest conflict on the continent since World War II.
  <br>
  <br>
  British Prime Minister Keir Starmer has called for a "coalition of the willing" to come together to draw up a peace plan and present it to the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  Starmer and other European leaders made a show of embracing Zelensky and reaffirming support for Ukraine at weekend talks in London. EU chiefs will be briefing Starmer on the Brussels talks on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  France and Britain have pitched a one-month truce "in the air, at sea and on energy infrastructure", though not initially on the ground. Leaders are expected to raise that proposal in Brussels, but not formally decide on it.
  <br>
  <br>
  EU leaders are also expected to start thrashing out what "security guarantees" the bloc might provide for a peace deal, including the possible deployment of European troops, which several states support.
  <br>
  <br>
  While Zelensky can expect strong words of support in Brussels, it was unclear if a deal would be reached on a new package of key weaponry, with several states arguing that Europe currently has enough money committed to meet Kyiv's needs. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hamas said on Thursday that Donald Trump's threats would encourage Israel to disregard the fragile ceasefire, after the US president said that unless hostages are freed, the people of Gaza would be "DEAD".
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump's warning came hours after his administration revealed it held unprecedented direct talks with Hamas, which it proscribes as a "terrorist" group, focused on American hostages in Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  Five Americans are believed to remain among the hostages – four have been confirmed dead and one, Edan Alexander, is believed to be alive.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office confirmed Israel was consulted and said in a statement that it "expressed its opinion" on the direct talks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said later he was "sending Israel everything it needs to finish the job" as his administration expedites billions of dollars in weapons.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Release all of the Hostages now, not later, and immediately return all of the dead bodies of the people you murdered, or it is OVER for you," he wrote on his Truth Social platform after meeting freed hostages.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is your last warning! For the leadership, now is the time to leave Gaza, while you still have a chance."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump also warned of repercussions for Gaza as a whole, where virtually the entire population has been displaced by Israel's relentless military campaign in response to Hamas's October 7, 2023 attack.
  <br>
  <br>
  "To the People of Gaza: A beautiful Future awaits, but not if you hold Hostages. If you do, you are DEAD!"
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamas spokesman Hazem Qasim said Trump's words pushed Israel to disregard the terms of a ceasefire in place since January 19.
  <br>
  <br>
  "These threats complicate matters regarding the ceasefire agreement and encourage the occupation to avoid implementing its terms," Qasim said in a statement, urging the United States to pressure Israel to enter the ceasefire's second phase. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A senior Guangdong official on Thursday said the province will work closely with Hong Kong and Macau to host the National Games this year, and strengthen technological cooperation to build a world-class Greater Bay Area.
 <br>
  <br>
  Zhang Hu, the executive vice-governor of Guangdong, made the remark at a plenary session of Guangdong deputies to the National People's Congress.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a first, the National Games will be hosted by Hong Kong, Guangdong and Macau this November.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at the same meeting, Guangdong governor Wang Weizhong expressed his vision to welcome people from all walks of life for the quadrennial gala.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We hope to invite everyone to come and watch the Games in Guangdong and the Greater Bay Area ... to experience the rapid changes of Guangdong and the unique charm of the vibrant Greater Bay Area," Wang said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Guangdong party secretary Huang Kunming, meanwhile, described the province's proximity to Hong Kong and Macau as a natural and unique advantage, adding the two SARs connect the region to the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  Huang thanked both cities for their support and investment in Guangdong, saying their involvement is key to the Greater Bay Area's development.

<img alt="The MTR Corporation posts a net profit of HK$15.77 billion for 2024. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1794580_1_20250306173403.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Net profit at the MTR Corporation more than doubled last year, thanks largely to strong gains in local property development.
 <br>
  <br>
  The railway firm posted a full-year profit of HK$15.77 billion, up from HK$7.78 billion in 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  Total revenue rose 5.3 percent to HK$60 billion, compared with HK$56 billion the year before.
  <br>
  <br>
  Local property development fared especially well, with net profit up nearly four times to HK$10.26 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  The gains were mainly due to earnings from sites at LOHAS Park, Ho Man Tin Station and The Southside in Wong Chuk Hang, the MTR said.
  <br>
  <br>
  It added it is considering possible tenders of Package 2 of Tung Chung East Station and Tuen Mun A16 Station Package 1 in the coming 12 months, but noted that any decisions will depend on market conditions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Losses in its mainland property business, meanwhile, narrowed to HK$3 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  The company also said patronage continued to recover, with passenger numbers of its domestic operations reaching 1.95 billion in 2024, close to pre-pandemic levels.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ridership rose for the high-speed rail link as well, with more than 26.7 million journeys recorded.
  <br>
  <br>
  Commenting on the MTR's annual results, Jacob Kam, the group's chief executive officer, noted that last year's performance was boosted by the notable recovery in property development under the "Rail plus Property" business model.
  <br>
  <br>
  "While the company’s operating results were satisfactory during the year under review, it is important to reiterate that much of these profits will be committed to the substantial funding required for the upgrading and renewal of existing lines as well as planning and constructing new railway projects," he said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We also must keep adapting to the new realities of consumer behaviour in the post-pandemic era, particularly the established trends of Hong Kong people travelling north for weekends and holidays and mainland Chinese tourists spending less time in local retail outlets."
  <br>
  <br>
  The company declared a final dividend of HK$0.89 per share, raising the full-year total to HK$1.31.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The ICAC on Thursday charged four people on suspicion of fixing matches in the Hong Kong football league.
 <br>
  <br>
  Three of the suspects were linked to Fu Moon Athletic Association, which currently plays in the Second Division, below the Premier League and First Division.
  <br>
  <br>
  They included 30-year-old defender Lo Hong-ming, who's also the owner and the coach, as well as 32-year-old midfielder So Chun-yin.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong Him-chun, a former Fu Moon player, was the alleged betting agent, while Yao Xiaocong was the alleged bookmaker.
  <br>
  <br>
  They are due to appear in Eastern Court on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The anti-graft body alleged that 11 league and cup matches between the 2021-22 season were manipulated.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lo was accused of receiving HK$60,000 in bribes, while the three others allegedly offered HK$240,000 to other players in exchange for their cooperation on the pitch.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ICAC said investigations were ongoing and warned of more arrests in the future.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The head of the National Development and Reform Commission said he's confident that the 5 percent GDP growth target set by China for 2025 can be met, despite external headwinds and weak domestic demand.
 <br>
  <br>
  "From a holistic approach, we have advantage in our system, potential in our market, and vitality in our businesses," Zheng Shanjie told reporters in a press conference in Beijing on the sidelines of the ongoing "Two Sessions".
  <br>
  <br>
  "And most importantly, we have the courage to face up to these risks and challenges and confidence to address these issues. It is fair to say that the realisation of this year's growth target is well supported."
  <br>
  <br>
  Zheng said there's uncertainty in the external environment and problems such as insufficient domestic demand, but believes they can be overcome.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said Beijing will launch major projects in railways, nuclear power and other infrastructure to attract private investment.
  <br>
  <br>
  The governor of the People's Bank of China, Pan Gongsheng, said authorities will cut interest rates and the reserve requirement ratios for financial institutions at an appropriate time.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will continue to keep abreast with domestic and external economic and financial situations and the financial market operation, and make reasonable cuts to the [reserve requirement ratio] and interest rate at a proper time," he told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pan also said the central bank will roll out more supportive monetary policies and prevent the risk of its exchange rate overshooting.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that officials will expand a special relending facility from 500 billion to 800 billion yuan to support tech industries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Finance Minister Lan Fo'an said there is ample room for fiscal policies to respond to domestic and global challenges.
  <br>
  <br>
  He promised to further expand fiscal spending this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We need to make full use of the policy space and draft more incremental policy focusing on livelihood, consumption and future growth drivers, and ensure policy consistencies so as to carry out stronger and more precise policy to benefit all," Lan said.

    Top court upholds sedition convictions of Tam Tak-chi

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's top court on Thursday upheld the sedition convictions of former activist Tam Tak-chi over a string of incitement incidents in public in 2020.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Court of Final Appeal also maintained the former vice chairman of People Power's jail sentence of three years and four months for sedition and public order-related offences.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tam's lawyers argued that the case should have been tried by a High Court jury, not the District Court.
  <br>
  <br>
  They also said the prosecutors should be required to prove the appellant had the intention to incite others to engage in violence or create a public disorder.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the top court judges dismissed both arguments.
  <br>
  <br>
  They said it was valid for a magistrate to transfer the case to the District Court.
  <br>
  <br>
  The judges also ruled that clauses of the old sedition laws didn't require proof of the intention to incite as an element of the offence.
  <br>
  <br>
  They noted the crimes listed all came with an "or" rather than an "and", dismissing the lawyers' reliance on a clause that states it is only an offence when a person counsels "disobedience to law or to any lawful order".
  <br>
  <br>
  "[The clause] constitutes only one of the various alternative forms of seditious intention each of which is capable of constituting the offence," the judges wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tam was prosecuted and jailed under the decades-old sedition laws, before the enactment of the local national security legislation under Basic Law Article 23.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Vice Premier Ding Xuexiang has urged Hong Kong to make good use of its advantages and to continue to safeguard national security, according to SAR delegates of the nation’s top political advisory body.
 <br>
  <br>
  Ding on Thursday held talks with Hong Kong and Macau delegates of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) on the sidelines of the ongoing "Two Sessions" in Beijing.
  <br>
  <br>
  The vice premier, who's also a Politburo Standing Committee member, urged Hong Kong to be confident and capitalise on its strengths.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Hong Kong has a unique position of enjoying strong support of the country and being connected to the world,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Delegates from the SAR said after the 90-minute meeting that national security was one of the topics of discussion.
  <br>
  <br>
  CPPCC member Ko Wing-man said the vice premier praised Hong Kong for completing Article 23 legislation of the Basic Law last year, while stressing that the city should not lower its guard.
  <br>
  <br>
  “There are still many internal and external forces which want to mess around, in terms of national security or the One Country, Two Systems,” Ko quoted Ding as saying.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Therefore, we have to be highly vigilant, and achieve a good balance between development and safeguarding security.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Another focus of the meeting was the trade and technology wars between China and the United States, according to CPPCC delegate and lawmaker William Wong.
  <br>
  <br>
  “He (Ding) said that the situation will not slow down. It will continue to be a bit stiff. But we should be confident in ourselves and Hong Kong should work together with the central government to advance technology and to go international,” Wong said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another CPPCC delegate, Pansy Ho, said the vice premier highly recognised Hong Kong’s efforts in boosting the economy, saying it was stable and showed improvement in the past year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho also said Ding urged Hong Kong to work closely with nearby cities, such as those in the Greater Bay Area.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Because of the close proximity and also now, the possibility of us really capitalising on the various components that each of these cities possesses, we can create a much stronger base for development,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We do not have to see Hong Kong as a standalone. We need to work on how we utilise best to our advantage, how to collaborate with cities around us.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, Xia Baolong, and CPPCC vice-chairman and former Hong Kong chief executive CY Leung were also present at the meeting.

    'More transparent private healthcare charges needed'

<img alt="The Consumer Council says many private hospitals and clinics did not provide sufficient price information, resulting in a flood of complaints. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1794529_1_20250306130052.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The city's consumer watchdog on Thursday called on various private healthcare service providers, including hospitals and clinics, to be more transparent when they disclose their fees, given complaints over unexpectedly higher medical costs.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Consumer Council said it received 191 complaints between 2021 and 2024, which were related to private medical care services, involving some HK$7.2 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  About half of those complaints were due to disputes over fees and charges.
  <br>
  <br>
  The council blamed the disputes partially on the lack of sufficient disclosures of fees by those private health care premises, adding a council study found that nearly 70 percent of patients surveyed encountered "price variations" when examining their bills.
  <br>
  <br>
  The final costs, in some cases, were HK$60,000 to HK$70,000 higher compared with the initial budget estimation.
  <br>
  <br>
  But about 65 percent of respondents did not get any explanation regarding the price difference, and about 39 percent reported receiving only verbal budget estimates without any written or detailed breakdowns of the chargeable items.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, the council pointed out the dramatically varied prices among the private premises also made it difficult for people to compare medical costs for the same treatment.
  <br>
  <br>
  To tackle the issue, the watchdog urged private medical providers to disclose their price list online, and roll out more packaged treatment services with clear and detailed written prices for consumers to choose and compare.

<img alt="UK police say Zou Zhenhao used online platforms and dating apps to meet women who he invited to his home under the pretext of having drinks or studying before he drugged them. Photo: Metropolitan Police via Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1794530_1_20250306130805.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A PhD student from China was found guilty on Wednesday in a London court of drugging and raping 10 women in China and the UK, as British police warned there could be more than 50 other victims.
 <br>
  <br>
  Zou Zhenhao, 28, was convicted of the attacks between 2019 and 2023 following a monthlong trial at the Inner London Crown Court.
  <br>
  <br>
  London's Metropolitan Police said Zou used online platforms and dating apps to meet women who he invited to his home under the pretext of having drinks or studying before he drugged them.
  <br>
  <br>
  He then filmed himself raping and sexually assaulting the women while they were unconscious, keeping some of their jewellery and clothing afterwards.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zou was found guilty of 11 counts of rape, with two of the offences relating to one victim.
  <br>
  <br>
  After more than 19 hours of deliberations, jurors concluded Zou raped three of the women in London and seven in China.
  <br>
  <br>
  The prosecutions relating to attacks in China were possible because foreign nationals who are living in the UK can be charged with an offence committed abroad that is also illegal in the country where it took place.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police have only been able to identify two of the victims and said after the verdict that more than 50 other women may have fallen victim to Zou, which would make him one of the worst sex offenders in UK history.
  <br>
  <br>
  Originally from Dongguan in Guangdong Province, the mechanical engineering doctoral candidate at University College London claimed that the sexual interactions were consensual.
  <br>
  <br>
  He will be sentenced on June 19.
  <br>
  <br>
  Judge Rosina Cottage described the defendant as a “dangerous and predatory sexual offender” and that his sentence will be “very long.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Zou, who showed no emotion as the verdicts were read out in court, was also convicted of three counts of voyeurism, 10 of possession of an extreme pornographic image, one of false imprisonment and three of possession of a controlled drug with intent to commit a sexual offence, namely butanediol.
  <br>
  <br>
  “He has done all that he can in these offences to incapacitate his victims to the point where they could not resist his attack, and in many instances may not even remember what has occurred to them,” said Metropolitan Police Commander Kevin Southworth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police are appealing to anyone who thinks they may have been targeted by Zou to contact them. (Agencies)

    Top court clears ex-Alliance trio over security probe

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong’s top court on Thursday overturned the convictions of three people for refusing to hand information to the police in a national security investigation.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Court of Final Appeal unanimously ruled the trio, who were members of the now-disbanded Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements in China, did not have a fair trial.
  <br>
  <br>
  Implementation rules under the national security law require suspects deemed to be "foreign agents" to hand over information to police.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chow Hang-tung, Tang Ngok-kwan and Tsui Hon-kwong were jailed in 2023 for four-and-a-half months each for refusing such a request about their former organisation.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the top court found the evidence used by prosecutors to establish that the group was acting as a "foreign agent" was so heavily redacted that it was "self-defeating".
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was self-defeating to have redacted out the only material relied on for establishing the foreign agent element of the offence, so that, in its absence, the charge could not be proved," the judges, led by Chief Justice Andrew Cheung, wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[D]epriving the appellants of all knowledge of the nature of the prosecution’s case... made it impossible for them to have a fair trial."
  <br>
  <br>
  The court therefore quashed the three's convictions and jail sentences.
  <br>
  <br>
  A separate security trial of inciting subversion involving Chow and two former Alliance leaders is still pending.

    Rare cyclone approaches Australian coast

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Early wind and rain from a rare tropical cyclone began lashing part of eastern Australia on Thursday as schools were closed, public transport was stopped and desperate residents got around shortages of sandbags by buying potting mix.
 <br>
  <br>
  Tropical Cyclone Alfred is forecast to cross the Queensland state coast somewhere between the Sunshine Coast region and the city of Gold Coast to the south early on Saturday, Bureau of Meteorology manager Matt Collopy said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Between the two tourist strips is the state capital Brisbane, Australia’s third-most populous city which will host the 2032 Olympic Games.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The wind impacts, we’re already seeing those start to develop on the exposed locations along our coast with gusts reaching 80-90 kph. We are expecting those to continue to develop,” Collopy told reporters in Brisbane.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alfred is expected to become the first cyclone to cross the coast near Brisbane since Cyclone Zoe hit Gold Coast in 1974 and brought widespread flooding.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cyclones are common in Queensland’s tropical north but are rare in the state’s temperate and densely-populated southeast corner that borders New South Wales state. More than four million people lie in the cyclone’s path.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alfred was 280 kilometres east of Brisbane and moving west on Thursday with sustained winds near the centre of 95 kilometres per hour, and gusting to 130 kilometres per hour, Collopy said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The storm is expected to maintain its wind strength before hitting land.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the greatest fears are for the expected flooding over a wide area.
  <br>
  <br>
  Modelling shows that up to 20,000 homes in Brisbane, a city largely built on a river floodplain, could experience some level of flooding.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said 660 schools in southern Queensland and 280 schools in northern New South Wales were closed on Thursday as weather conditions worsen.
  <br>
  <br>
  The federal government had delivered 310,000 sandbags to Brisbane and more were on the way, Albanese said.
  <br>
  <br>
  A shortage of sandbags in Brisbane, a city of more than three million people, led some to buy sacks of potting mix as an alternative, according to Damien Effeney, a chief executive of a rural supplies business. (AP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Donovan Mitchell scored 26 points as the Cleveland Cavaliers punched their ticket to the NBA playoffs with a hard-fought 112-107 victory over the Miami Heat.
 <br>
  <br>
  A see-saw battle in Cleveland saw the Heat threaten to end the Cavs' 11-game unbeaten streak after opening up a seven-point lead late in the fourth quarter.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the Cavs clawed back the deficit in the closing minutes to seal their 12th straight victory and a place in the postseason.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Cavaliers improved to 52-10, maintaining their stranglehold on the Eastern Conference with 20 games of the regular season remaining.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mitchell was one of six Cleveland players to finish in double figures against a short-handed Miami team missing Andrew Wiggins, Kel'el Ware and Jaime Jaquez Jr.
  <br>
  <br>
  Evan Mobley backed Mitchell with 16 points and 13 rebounds while Darius Garland finished with 15 points and 10 assists. Bam Adebayo led Miami's scorers with a game-high 34 points.
  <br>
  <br>
  The victory though was too close for comfort for Cleveland talisman Mitchell.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It took a collective effort as a group but we locked down and got stops – but we've got to be better," Mitchell said. "It's always good to learn through a win though."
  <br>
  <br>
  Mitchell played down the significance of Cleveland becoming the first team to reach the postseason.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's definitely a blessing and a sign of our hard work, but it don't really mean much," Mitchell said. "I'm happy we were able to do it for the crowd, but we've got a lot more to accomplish."
  <br>
  <br>
  Cleveland's nearest pursuers, the Boston Celtics, powered past the Portland Trail Blazers 128-118 after a sensational pair of 40-point performances from Derrick White and Payton Pritchard.
  <br>
  <br>
  White finished with 41 points while Pritchard erupted for 43 points, delivering a shooting masterclass that included 10 three-pointers from 16 attempts.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They were tremendous," Boston coach Joe Mazzulla said of White and Pritchard's double-act. "The way those two played says a lot about who they are.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They do a lot of the dirty work. So to have a night like this where those two can show what they're capable of was good for us," he added. "We're lucky to have them and it's a lot of fun to watch them do that."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Celtics improved to 44-18 with the win and are eight games behind leaders Cleveland.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere, the Milwaukee Bucks kept up their pursuit of the Eastern Conference's front-runners with a 137-107 drubbing of the Dallas Mavericks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Damian Lillard led the Bucks scoring with 34 points while Giannis Antetokounmpo finished with 32 points. The Bucks improved to 36-25 for the season and remain fourth in the Eastern Conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Charlotte, Anthony Edwards and Jaden McDaniels scored 29 points apiece as the Minnesota Timberwolves pulled away to complete a 125-110 win over the Hornets. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The chairman of the people's government of the Tibet Autonomous Region on Thursday said classes have resumed in Dingri County following the massive earthquake earlier this year.
 <br>
  <br>
  At a plenary meeting of Tibet deputies of the National People Congress in Beijing, Gama Cedain expressed gratitude to various provinces and sectors of society that provided support after the 6.8-magnitude quake struck the county in Xigaze city.
  <br>
  <br>
  In his work report, Premier Li Qiang said Beijing would provide "quality meteorological services" to better respond to natural disasters including floods and earthquakes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will provide support for post-earthquake recovery and reconstruction efforts in Dingri County, Xizang Autonomous Region, and work to ensure that residential buildings and infrastructure in key areas are more earthquake-resistant," the report said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gama Cedain said reconstruction work began on Monday, adding the work report's mention of these efforts showed the advantages of socialism with Chinese characteristics.
  <br>
  <br>
  The chairman also highlighted Tibet's current economic and cultural prosperity, noting the region has experienced no major political or violent cases for 17 consecutive years.

 South Korea's Air Force on Thursday said one of its fighter jets had accidentally dropped eight bombs in the wrong place during a training exercise, resulting in civilians being injured.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Eight MK-82 general-purpose bombs were abnormally released from an Air Force KF-16 aircraft, landing outside the designated firing range," the Air Force said, adding it deeply regretted the incident "which resulted in civilian casualties".
  <br>
  <br>
  An official at Gyeonggi-do Bukbu Fire Services said out of the eight people who had been wounded, four were seriously hurt.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pocheon is about 40 kilometres northeast of Seoul and near the heavily militarised border with North Korea.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fire officials suspected the munitions dropped on the town was from ongoing live-fire joint military exercises conducted by South Korea and the United States, the official said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Photographs shared by news agency News1 that it said were from the scene showed a badly damaged house with rubble strewn on the ground next to it.
  <br>
  <br>
  South Korea's defence ministry was not immediately available for comment.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ministry said earlier on Thursday that South Korea and US forces were holding their first joint live-fire exercises in Pocheon which were linked to annual military drills due to start next week. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Britain strongly condemned on Wednesday the sentencing of UK national James Anderson to 19 years in prison by a Russian court, which accused him of having fought for the Ukrainian army.
 <br>
  <br>
  "We strongly condemn the sentencing of James Anderson, a British national, in a Russian court on false charges," said a spokesperson for the Foreign Office, who called on Russia to respect its obligations towards "prisoners of war".
  <br>
  <br>
  The Russian court press service for the city of Kursk said James Scott Rhys Anderson, 22, was found guilty of a "terrorist act" and acting as a mercenary, after he was captured while fighting in the region in November.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Kursk court released video of Anderson being led into court in handcuffs, wearing a winter hat and jacket that appeared to be prison uniform.
  <br>
  <br>
  He nodded silently after having the sentence translated to him. He has the option to file an appeal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ukraine launched its shock cross-border offensive in August, the first time a foreign army took control of Russian territory since World War II.
  <br>
  <br>
  Anderson, from the English town of Banbury, has spoken in several videos filmed by Russian officials after he was taken prisoner, saying that he went to fight for Ukraine's International Legion after being sacked from the British army.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kursk's second western district military court spent three days on Anderson's trial with the hearings held behind closed doors, the press service said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The court said Anderson admitted guilt and decided to take part in the "armed conflict for financial reward".
  <br>
  <br>
  Anderson earlier told Russia's Izvestia newspaper he was paid US$400 a-month and about US$60 a day while on combat missions.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Briton was told by the court he would spend the first five years of his sentence in a prison - where conditions are worse than in a penal colony. He would then be transferred to a penal colony with "strict" conditions. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Premier Li Qiang’s work report has offered “important guidance” on implementing the One Country, Two Systems policy, Chief Executive John Lee said on Thursday, as he pledged to further align Hong Kong with national development strategies.
 <br>
  <br>
  Addressing delegates at the Great Hall of the People on Wednesday, the premier said Beijing will continue to fully implement One Country, Two Systems and ensure Hong Kong and Macau are administered by patriots.
  <br>
  <br>
  Li also mentioned the central government’s backing to the two SARs on growing their economies, improving people’s livelihoods and deepening international exchange.
  <br>
  <br>
  On social media, the chief executive said the government work report not only set out the country’s economic targets and policies, but also gave important direction for the practice of One Country, Two Systems.
  <br>
  <br>
  Reflecting on the premier’s message, Lee said his administration is heading in the right direction with its policies.
  <br>
  <br>
  “By following this correct policy direction and proactively aligning with the nation’s development strategies, Hong Kong’s development will have a bright future,” he wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We must better leverage the advantages of the One Country, Two Systems principle and break new ground.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The SAR will further deepen international exchanges and strengthen its role as a connector, Lee added.
  <br>
  <br>
  “On top of consolidating trade ties with traditional markets such as Europe and the United States, we will also work hard to explore new markets including the Middle East, Asean countries and Central Asia, while actively striving to join the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership,” he wrote.

<img alt="Demonstrators in Jerusalem call for the immediate return of hostages held in Gaza. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1794490_1_20250306090342.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump on Wednesday issued what he called a “last warning” to Hamas to release all remaining hostages held in Gaza, directing a sharply-worded message after the White House confirmed he had recently dispatched an envoy for unprecedented direct talks with the militant group.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump, in a statement on his Truth Social platform soon after meeting at the White House with eight former hostages, added that he was “sending Israel everything it needs to finish the job.”
  <br>
  <br>
  “Release all of the Hostages now, not later, and immediately return all of the dead bodies of the people you murdered, or it is OVER for you,” Trump said. “Only sick and twisted people keep bodies, and you are sick and twisted!”
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's hawkish language came after the United States confirmed the unprecedented direct talks with Hamas, with the US envoy on hostage affairs, Adam Boehler.
  <br>
  <br>
  Boehler, founder and CEO of Rubicon Founders, a healthcare investment firm, was a lead negotiator on the Abraham Accords team during Trump’s first term that strove to win broader recognition of Israel in the Arab world.
  <br>
  <br>
  The talks, which took place last month, focused mainly on the release of American hostages, and a potential end of the war without Hamas in power in Gaza, according to a Hamas official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israeli officials say about 24 living hostages - including Edan Alexander, an American citizen - as well as the bodies of at least 35 others are believed to still be held in Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  Confirmation of the talks in the Qatari capital of Doha come as the Israel-Hamas ceasefire remains in the balance.
  <br>
  <br>
  The first phase of a ceasefire ended over the weekend after six weeks of relative calm that included exchanges of Israeli hostages for Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails.
  <br>
  <br>
  While Israel has said it wants to extend the first phase until mid-April, Hamas has insisted on a transition to the second phase, which should lead to a permanent end to the war.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Israel has ramped up pressure, not just with threats, by halting all entry of goods and supplies into Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  France, Britain and Germany jointly on Wednesday called the humanitarian situation in Gaza "catastrophic," and urged Israel to ensure the "unhindered" delivery of aid. (Agencies)

    Wall Street rebounds after Trump pauses auto tariffs

<img alt='White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said the US President decided to "give a one-month exemption on any autos coming through USMCA", a North American free trade pact. Photo: AFP' src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1794487_1_20250306084640.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US stocks climbed on Wednesday after US President Donald Trump pulled back on some of his tariffs temporarily.
 <br>
  <br>
  The move revived hope on Wall Street that Trump may avoid a worst-case trade war that grinds down economies and sends inflation higher.
  <br>
  <br>
  The S&P 500 rose 1.1 percent to 5,842, to bounce back from a sell-off that had erased all of its 'Trump bump' since Election Day. The Dow Jones Industrial Average also climbed 1.1 percent to end at 43,006, and the Nasdaq composite gained 1.5 percent to 18,552.
  <br>
  <br>
  The market turned sharply higher after Trump said he was granting a one-month exemption for US automakers on his stiff new tariffs for Mexican and Canadian imports.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump made the move after talking with Ford, General Motors and Stellantis, which owns Chrysler.
  <br>
  <br>
  All of the Big Three automakers could have been hurt by such tariffs because of how much production happens across the countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump’s announcement sent relief through Wall Street, and Ford’s and General Motors’ stock both jumped more than 5 percent to help lead a widespread rally across the market.
  <br>
  <br>
  The worry has been that such tariffs would not only hurt profits for companies but also jack up prices for cars and other bills for US households already struggling with still-high inflation.
  <br>
  <br>
  A couple reports on Wednesday gave a mixed read on the US economy. One suggested US employers pulled back sharply on their hiring last month.
  <br>
  <br>
  The report from payrolls processing firm, ADP, could be a warning signal ahead of the more comprehensive jobs report that’s coming Friday from the US Labor Department.
  <br>
  <br>
  A separate report said growth for US finance, real estate and other businesses in the services sector is better than economists expected. But businesses also said in the survey they’re confronting “chaos” and uncertainty because of tariffs, according to the Institute for Supply Management. (AP)

<img alt="Eyal Zamir is replacing Herzi Halevi, who announced his resignation as armed forces chief in January over the military's shortcomings on October 7, 2023. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1794466_1_20250306033340.jpg&q=55">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Israel's new military chief Eyal Zamir said his country's mission to defeat Hamas remained unfinished as he took office on Wednesday, with uncertainty hanging over the fragile Gaza ceasefire.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking before Zamir at a ceremony at military headquarters in Tel Aviv, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel was "determined" to achieve victory in the multi-front war that began with Hamas' October 7, 2023 attack.
  <br>
  <br>
  His remarks came after Arab leaders endorsed a plan to rebuild the Gaza Strip under the future administration of the Palestinian Authority (PA), presenting an alternative to US President Donald Trump's widely-condemned proposal to take over the territory and displace its people.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the prospect of the PA governing Gaza remains far from certain, with Israel having ruled out any future role for the body in the territory ruled by Hamas since 2007.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hamas has indeed suffered a severe blow, but it has not yet been defeated. The mission is not yet accomplished," Zamir said, amid a deadlock in negotiations on the next steps in the ceasefire with Hamas in Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zamir is replacing Herzi Halevi, who announced his resignation as armed forces chief in January over the military's shortcomings on October 7.
  <br>
  <br>
  The military has since released the findings of an internal investigation that acknowledged its "complete failure" to prevent the deadliest attack on Israel since its creation.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hamas assault resulted in the deaths of 1,218 people, most of them civilians, while Israel's military retaliation in Gaza has killed at least 48,405 people, also mostly civilians, data from both sides show. (AFP)

<img alt="Beijing says it will boost support for the application of AI models to foster more breakthroughs in technology. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1794488_1_20250306085151.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An analyst on Thursday said the advent of artificial intelligence startups such as DeepSeek has been a boon to the nation’s technological development.
 <br>
  <br>
  Senior Fellow at the Taihe Institute and the Chairman of Asia Narratives, Einar Tangen’s comment came after Beijing said it will boost support for the application of AI models to foster more breakthroughs in technology.
  <br>
  <br>
  He told
  <a href="https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/news-programmes/this-episode.htm?cmsid=77" target="_blank">
   RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme
  </a>
  that AI startups have been “a revelation” for policymakers.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Quite frankly, these kind of breakthroughs – whether it's in film or with video games, and now artificial intelligence – this has really boosted the government’s confidence in its own sectors,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It also completely changed the regular citizen’s view and confidence in their abilities as well."
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on the government work report’s efforts to deepen cooperation with other countries, Tangen said the world is “positive” on the nation’s Belt and Road infrastructure initiative.
  <br>
  <br>
  “They’re just simply saying, we’ll continue to grow where we are welcome and continue to invest where we are welcome.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Tangen also noted the work report said that Hong Kong and Macau will continue to connect the nation with the rest of the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  “A lot of that has to do with trying to attract investment," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong plays a prominent position in that and they’re trying to assure them that One Country, Two Systems will continue and that both of these entities are very valuable.”

<div class="itemFullText">
 Greenlanders on Wednesday shrugged off US President Donald Trump's vow to take over the Arctic island, seeing it merely as an opportunity to advance their own independence bid.
 <br>
  <br>
  In the quiet hallways of the University of Greenland in Nuuk, the capital of the Danish autonomous territory, Trump's latest remarks that he would take over Greenland "one way or another" left locals largely unfazed, despite his more menacing tone this time.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For me personally, it's just something ridiculous he would say, but I wouldn't take it seriously because he's basically all talk and no action," said 23-year-old law student Peter Malik Henningsen.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That sounds very violent and it's also very dumb... because Denmark, and Greenland, is also an ally of America," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  In his first major policy speech on Tuesday since returning to power, Trump underlined his expansionist vision, reiterating the importance of the United States taking over the strategically-located and mineral-rich Arctic island and taking back the Panama Canal.
  <br>
  <br>
  About a quarter the size of the mainland US, Greenland's location in the Arctic puts it on the shortest route for missiles between Russia and the US.
  <br>
  <br>
  Less than a week before general elections in Greenland where independence has dominated the campaign, Trump said he had a message for the island's 57,000-strong population, whom he described as "incredible people".
  <br>
  <br>
  "We strongly support your right to determine your own future, and if you choose, we welcome you into the United States of America," Trump said.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he then made clear he would not give up if persuasion fails, saying: "One way or the other we're going to get it," insisting the island was needed for reasons of national security.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump offered to buy Greenland already during his first term as president - in vain.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since returning to the Oval Office in January, he has put the topic back on the agenda, and has this time said he wouldn't rule out military force to get it.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Trump is like that, a bit unpredictable at times but I'm not worried," said another law student, David Jensen.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're part of Nato, the United States are part of Nato, so I'm not worried," insisted the 20-year-old who hails from one of the northernmost regions of Greenland. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Liverpool snatched a late winner to beat Paris Saint-Germain away 1-0 in the first leg of their heavyweight Champions League last-16 tie, as Barcelona claimed a 1-0 win at Benfica despite the Catalan giants playing most of the game with 10 men.
 <br>
  <br>
  French league leaders PSG dominated at the Parc des Princes but couldn't make their superiority count and Harvey Elliott struck three minutes from time after replacing Mohamed Salah with Liverpool's only shot on target.
  <br>
  <br>
  Khvicha Kvaratskhelia had a goal ruled out for offside in the first half but Arne Slot's side defended resolutely to keep PSG at bay and are in a strong position to advance to the quarter-finals going into next week's second leg at Anfield.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson Becker made several crucial saves, as PSG had 28 attempts on goal but could not replicate the finishing that had allowed them to score 21 goals in their last five Champions League outings.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was probably the performance of my life," Alisson said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "To go away with a win over here was probably a bit more than we deserved," added Slot.
  <br>
  <br>
  If Liverpool finish the job at home next Tuesday, they could face Aston Villa in the quarter-finals, but PSG coach Luis Enrique said his side will have "nothing to lose".
  <br>
  <br>
  "We deserved to win clearly, we created a lot of chances," said the Spaniard. "Football is unfair many times and you have to accept that."
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Raphinha drilled home after 61 minutes to give five-time winners Barcelona a slim advantage over Benfica despite playing most of the game with 10 men.
  <br>
  <br>
  Teenage defender Pau Cubarsi was sent off midway through the first half of the tight clash in Lisbon with the score goalless.
  <br>
  <br>
  Barcelona have not won the competition since 2015 but are expected to go deep this season, after a draw which many consider favourable.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hansi Flick insisted before the game there was no such thing as an "easy" tie and the coach was proven right on a tense evening in the Portuguese capital.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I said to the team that I'm very proud," said the German coach after his team emerged with a victory. "After the 22nd minute with 10 players it was not easy, and this is a big win."
  <br>
  <br>
  Goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny endured two high-profile mistakes against Benfica in the group stage in January, but made amends with a string of saves as Barca were pinned back in the final half hour.
  <br>
  <br>
  Szczesny made a smart save to deny Benfica's Kerem Akturkoglu after just a few seconds, and the opening stages were played in a way that indicated both sides were picking up where they left off in Barcelona's wild 5-4 win in Lisbon.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dani Olmo fired narrowly wide at the other end as Barca threatened, before Benfica goalkeeper Anatoliy Trubin produced a stunning triple save to keep the score level.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Ukrainian first parried Dani Olmo's prodded effort, then made a brilliant reaction stop to thwart Robert Lewandowski converting from point-blank range and mopped up Lamine Yamal's attempt from the rebound. (AFP)

<img alt="New Zealand's Rachin Ravindra, left, celebrates with teammate Kane Williamson after scoring a century. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1794471_1_20250306053652.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Rachin Ravindra and Kane Williamson struck hundreds as New Zealand eased to a 50-run win over South Africa in Lahore to set up a rematch with India in the Champions Trophy final.
 <br>
  <br>
  Ravindra made 108 off 101 balls and Williamson hit 102 off 94 deliveries, as New Zealand posted a Champions Trophy record 362-6 before restricting South Africa to 312-9.
  <br>
  <br>
  David Miller finished unbeaten on 100 but his 67-ball blitz came in vain with the game already well out of reach, as South Africa suffered their fifth Champions Trophy semi-final defeat after those in 2000, 2002, 2006 and 2013.
  <br>
  <br>
  They won the first edition of the tournament in Bangladesh in 1998, when it was named the ICC KnockOut Trophy.
  <br>
  <br>
  New Zealand captain Mitchell Santner excelled with the ball and took 3-43 with his left-arm spin, breaking a 105-run partnership for South Africa's second wicket by removing rival skipper Temba Bavuma for 56.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bavuma started slowly but steadied the innings with Rassie van der Dussen, who scored a fluent 69 before being deceived by a beautiful delivery from Santner.
  <br>
  <br>
  Santner then dealt a critical blow when he dismissed Heinrich Klaasen for three, caught by a diving Matt Henry at long-on, dashing South Africa's hopes of pulling off the highest chase in the tournament's history.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ravindra had Aiden Markram caught and bowled for 31 while Glenn Phillips chipped in with 2-27 as South Africa crumbled against spin.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's a cool feeling to make the final," said Santner. "We were challenged by a good side and now we've had a go against India, look forward to do it again."
  <br>
  <br>
  New Zealand last won an ICC ODI men's event in 2000, beating India in the final of that year's Champions Trophy in Kenya. India won by 44 runs when the teams met in the group phase last Sunday in Dubai.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bavuma said New Zealand were simply too good for South Africa on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "New Zealand were above par," said Bavuma. "We backed ourselves to chase 350 with the wicket getting better but they really put us under pressure from the get-go."
  <br>
  <br>
  Ravindra and Williamson set the foundations for a big total on a batting-friendly Gaddafi Stadium pitch after New Zealand won the toss and batted first.
  <br>
  <br>
  Daryl Mitchell clubbed 49 off 37 balls and Phillips smashed a 27-ball 49 not out as the Black Caps plundered 110 runs in the last 10 overs and 66 in the last five.
  <br>
  <br>
  South Africa's bowling line-up struggled right from the start as Ravindra and Will Young (21) put on 48 for the opening stand.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was followed by a magnificent 164-run partnership for the second wicket between Ravindra and Williamson that put the New Zealanders on track for a massive total, as the duo scored at will with some delightful strokes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ravindra completed his fifth ODI hundred – all coming in ICC events – from 93 balls with a two off Kagiso Rabada.
  <br>
  <br>
  Williamson reached his 15th ODI hundred with a ramped boundary, his third three-figure score in as many matches against South Africa.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was Rabada who finally ended the partnership by dismissing Ravindra caught behind. Ravindra hit 13 fours and one six in total.
  <br>
  <br>
  Williamson chipped Wiaan Mulder into the hands of Lungi Ngidi in the 40th over after hitting 10 fours and two sixes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mitchell and Phillips added some late impetus after South Africa had briefly dragged things back to give themselves hope of limiting the score to under 350.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fast bowler Ngidi finished with 3-72, while Rabada ended with figures of 2-70. (AFP)

    US pauses intelligence sharing with Ukraine

<img alt="The Central Intelligence Agency director John Ratcliffe describes the pause as temporary. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1794449_1_20250305221949.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The United States has "paused" intelligence sharing with Ukraine after a dramatic breakdown in relations between Kyiv and the White House, CIA director John Ratcliffe said on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  President Donald Trump and Ukraine's leader Volodymyr Zelensky had a public falling-out in the Oval Office last week, followed by Ukraine's top ally suspending crucial US military aid.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ratcliffe confirmed that intelligence sharing had also been frozen as Ukraine seeks to beat back the Russian assault.
  <br>
  <br>
  "President Trump had a real question about whether President Zelensky was committed to the peace process," Ratcliffe told Fox News.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ratcliffe said the pause "on the military front and the intelligence front" was temporary, and the United States will again "work shoulder to shoulder with Ukraine."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said on Tuesday that Zelensky told him Kyiv was ready for talks with Moscow and the finalisation of a US minerals deal, as Ukraine works to move on after the Oval Office spat.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zelensky has sought to bring Trump back onside, posting on social media that their clash was "regrettable" and he wanted "to make things right."
  <br>
  <br>
  In his address to the US Congress later on Tuesday, Trump read aloud from a letter from Zelensky.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The letter reads, 'Ukraine is ready to come to the negotiating table as soon as possible to bring lasting peace closer. Nobody wants peace more than the Ukrainians,'" Trump told US lawmakers. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong and Macau have the full backing of the central government in integrating into the country’s development, a senior Beijing official said on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Xia Baolong, director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, met Chief Executive John Lee, who attended the opening of the National People’s Congress (NPC) in the capital.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to a statement, Xia praised the SAR administration’s performance in recognising and responding to changes, fully promoting high-quality development, and uniting the entire society to focus on the city’s economy and development.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The central government has always adhered to the comprehensive and accurate implementation of the ‘One Country, Two Systems’ principle, and fully backed the integration of Hong Kong and Macau into the overall development of the country,” the statement read.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xia was also quoted as saying that he hopes Hong Kong would work to consolidate the city’s status as an international financial, shipping and trade centre, and to become a place for high-performing individuals to gather.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a government statement, the Chief Executive vowed to lead all sectors of the SAR to proactively integrate into national development, and contribute to the Greater Bay Area and the Belt and Road Initiative.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, the head of Beijing’s liaison office in the SAR urged local NPC deputies to “shoulder the historic mission and responsibility of promoting Hong Kong’s transition from stability to prosperity”.
  <br>
  <br>
  During a meeting, liaison office chief Zheng Yanxiong pointed out that the delegates should take up four roles to further bolster the territory’s development – athletes, active players, doers, and leaders.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zheng also highlighted the importance of tapping into the city’s advantages, introducing reforms, supporting the country’s high-quality development, connecting with the mainland and the world, as well as preventing risks.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Zheng emphasised that over the past few years, Hong Kong has made a number of major accomplishments, and has been widely recognised by the international community,” his office's statement read.
  <br>
  <br>
  “This year marks the end of the 14th Five-Year Plan, which is a key year for Hong Kong to accelerate its transition from stability to prosperity.”

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Resembling a squat, wide fridge, the world's most accurate clock went on sale for US$3.3 million in Japan on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The "Aether clock OC 020" is so precise that it would take 10 billion years for it to deviate by one second, according to its Kyoto-based manufacturer Shimadzu Corporation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Known as a "strontium optical lattice clock", it is 100 times more accurate than caesium atomic clocks, the current standard for defining seconds, the precision-equipment producer said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The machine, a box around a metre tall, is small for its kind with a volume of around 250 litres. It can also be used in research fieldwork.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shimadzu is aiming to sell 10 of its clocks over the next three years and hopes its customers will use them to advance scientific research in areas such as the observation of tectonic activity.
  <br>
  <br>
  Optical lattice clocks have previously been installed in Tokyo's famous Skytree, the world's tallest tower, to test the general theory of relativity, which states that "time flows more slowly in places with strong gravity." (AFP)

 A vibrant festival celebrating Indian culture through dance, music and cuisine, is set to brighten up the streets of Lan Kwai Fong later this month.
 <br>
  <br>
  The inaugural "Incredible India Festival", organised by the Consulate General of India in Hong Kong and the Lan Kwai Fong Association, will take place on March 15 and 16.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We hope that this will bring Indian art and culture to an accessible space for all Hongkongers, as well as tourists and foster an appreciation and better understanding of India's rich cultural heritage that goes back millenia, making it truly 'Incredible India'," said Satwant Khanalia, the consul general of India in Hong Kong and Macau.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jonathan Zeman, CEO of the Lan Kwai Fong Group, said he’s looking forward to creating a fully immersive experience for visitors.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the streets will be filled with "lots of great food, music performances, dance performances, and different workshops".
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong has a really rich history of Indian community going back at least 150 to 200 years almost, and that community still exists here, and it's important to build a bridge with the existing Indian culture over in India. It brings a lot of new elements to Hong Kong and a lot of richness to the mosaic that we have here," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two-day festival will be open to the public for free, and Zeman said he expects around 15,000 people to turn up.

    Air passenger departure tax to go up from Oct 1

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Travellers purchasing a plane ticket to fly out of Hong Kong from October 1 will have to pay HK$200 in air passenger departure tax (APDT) instead of the current HK$120, the government announced on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The tax increase was announced by Financial Secretary Paul Chan when he delivered his budget blueprint last month. The measure is expected to boost government revenue by about HK$1.6 billion each year.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, officials say some passengers will continue to be exempted from the tax.
  <br>
  <br>
  They include passengers under the age of 12, direct transit passengers, those taking connecting flights, as well as passengers who arrive at and depart Hong Kong by plane on the same day.
  <br>
  <br>
  Passengers who get to the Hong Kong International Airport by ship, or by vehicle via the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge, will also be waived, provided that they remain in the restricted area at all times.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The APDT was last increased more than 20 years ago in 2003-04. The proposed increase constitutes only a very small portion of the overall travelling cost for the general public and travellers to Hong Kong. The impact on air passengers is expected to be minimal,” a government spokesman said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Air Passenger Departure Tax (Amendment) Bill will be gazetted on Friday, and it will be tabled at the Legislative Council for first reading and the commencement of the second reading debate on March 19.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 LeBron James became the first player in NBA history to score 50,000 career points on Tuesday, extending his lead as the league's all-time record scorer by reaching a milestone tally that may never be surpassed.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Los Angeles Lakers superstar went into the game against the New Orleans Pelicans with 49,999 regular and postseason points after a 17-point performance in Sunday's win over the Los Angeles Clippers.
  <br>
  <br>
  It did not take long for the 40-year-old NBA icon to get the solitary point needed to reach the 50,000-point barrier.
  <br>
  <br>
  James, who is in dazzling form in the 22nd season of a glittering career, gathered a pass from Luka Doncic and unfurled a sublime 25-foot three-pointer to move to 50,002 points with the Crypto.com Arena crowd roaring their acclaim.
  <br>
  <br>
  James had passed Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's previous all-time regular-season scoring record of 38,387 points in 2023 – itself a record that had stood for 39 years.
  <br>
  <br>
  James is now nearly 6,000 points clear of Abdul-Jabbar's total career points tally of 44,149, with Karl Malone third (41,689 points) and the late Kobe Bryant fourth with 39,283 points.
  <br>
  <br>
  Michael Jordan is fifth on the all-time scoring list with 38,279.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among active NBA players, only Kevin Durant, with just over 35,000 points – roughly 15,000 points behind James – makes the top 10. (AFP)

    'Mild inflation target still a concern'

<img alt="China has lowered its inflation target for the year from 3% to 2%. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1794419_1_20250305181546.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Economists have struck a cautious note on China's plan to lower the nation's inflation target from three to two percent in the coming year, citing prolonged deflationary pressure.
 <br>
  <br>
  The comments came as Premier Li Qiang delivered his annual work report to the National People's Congress, setting out economic priorities for 2025, including a growth target of around five percent for the third year in a row.
  <br>
  <br>
  In an interview with RTHK, Raymond Yeung, Greater China chief economist at ANZ Bank, said while he believes the five percent growth target is achievable, partly due to improved sentiment on the economy following recent technological breakthroughs, questions loom over the nation's persistently low consumer price growth.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Obviously this number [two percent] is still way above the current inflation number, which was around 0.5 percent in January. But China is still under a strong deflationary pressure as the consumer price index has been inactive for almost 2.5 years," he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The question is how the government can inflate the economy. Are they going to print more money? Are they going to have a fiscal policy intensity strong enough to push the domestic demand so to restore the economy back to inflation? There are still some open questions for us to ask."
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the Hong Kong-based economist said the target suggests the authorities are dedicated to offering support to the economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Echoing Yeung, Tian Xuan, associate dean at Tsinghua University's school of finance, said in a group interview in Beijing that boosting public consumption is a vital growth engine for the economy this year, adding that policymakers have adopted a more proactive monetary policy with expanded fiscal support to shore up demand.
  <br>
  <br>
  The fiscal deficit target this year, the Beijing-based economist noted, was raised to four percent from three percent last year, marking the highest level in three decades.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities will issue a total of 1.3 trillion yuan (US$182 billion) worth of ultra-long special treasury bonds this year to spur growth, including 300 billion yuan on bonds to support consumer goods trade-in programmes, Tian said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeung said the measures are a good signal, but warned the issue is whether local governments will properly implement the fiscal supports.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The problems in the past few years were that the local government or state-owned companies, they are not really executing what the central government ask them to do. So there's a lot of hoarding of 'firepower' that has not been translated into economic growth," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So I think the focus is not just whether the target is four percent, it is about whether they are willing to execute at the local level, to execute those funds."
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, Yeung shrugged off concerns over the extra US tariffs on Chinese goods, noting that Chinese exports to the US steadily declined in recent years and now only account for about 13 percent of China's total exports.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our estimation is that every 10 percent increase in tariff rates will only drag down export growth by 0.5 percent of the GDP across several years, which means that every year the impact would be very, very minimal," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The problem of the Chinese economy is always domestic, and how to revive the domestic confidence, how to stabilise the property market, so that China is not going to go through the asset price deflation. That is more important than the US tariffs," Yeung added.

    CPPCC member slams extra US tariffs on China

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) member Andy Tsang on Wednesday slammed the US move to slap additional tariffs on Chinese exports because of the fentanyl crisis.
 <br>
  <br>
  Tsang, deputy director of the National Narcotics Control Commission and a former Hong Kong police commissioner, made the comments in Beijing on the sidelines of the "Two Sessions" after US President Donald Trump imposed an additional 10 percent tariff on China, citing a lack of progress on tackling fentanyl.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tsang said Beijing will study countermeasures and the move should not affect anti-drug cooperation.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that he believes China is one of the world's best performers in drug-control efforts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Former health minister and CPPCC delegate Ko Wing-man, meanwhile, said the setting up of Hong Kong's third medical school aims to strengthen medical education and research capabilities, not just addressing doctor shortages.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, another CPPCC member and former Bar Association chairwoman Winnie Tam said she hopes the Greater Bay Area will recognise Hong Kong's potential to help train professionals in foreign-related legal matters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tam, who chairs the Communications Authority, also said her team will continue to improve anti-fraud measures and work more closely with different platforms.

 Hong Kong and Macau will always have the central government's backing in terms of developing the economy and improving people's livelihood, a senior official in charge of the SARs' affairs pledged on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Wang Linggui, deputy director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, made the comments on the sidelines of the Two Sessions in Beijing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked by RTHK if more support measures were in store for Hong Kong, Wang pointed to the city's booming stock market.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said if investors were confident about Hong Kong, then the stock market would do well.
  <br>
  <br>
  On a separate note, Hongkongers were told by a former Beijing official to cherish their city and build it into a better place.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tan Tieniu, who was deputy director of Beijing's liaison office between 2016 and 2022, said Hong Kong had special meaning for him.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the city is a "very good" place and has a key role to play in the country's overall development, and urged everyone to "steadfastly and successfully" implement "One Country, Two Systems".

<div class="itemFullText">
 Andy Kwok, the captain of the Hong Kong Golf Club, on Wednesday said he expects a lot more spectators at the second edition of LIV Golf Hong Kong event in Fanling.
 <br>
  <br>
  The tournament will be the third event of the League's 2025 season, taking place from March 7 to 9 at the Hong Kong Golf Club.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kwok said he is looking forward to seeing people from Hong Kong and the Greater Bay Area at the event.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think it's great that we're now bringing mega sporting event organisers coming to Hong Kong to host mega sports events. I think it's great for Hong Kong, great for our people, great for the economy and as the club, being a golf club, obviously we want to bring the best golf events of the world to Hong Kong," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We were quite successful in hosting the first edition of the LIV Golf Hong Kong last year, and we're looking forward to an even more successful LIV Golf Hong Kong event this year, and hopefully we will try our best to continue to bring world-class events, and hopefully LIV can come back continuously in the future. We will try very hard to facilitate that."
  <br>
  <br>
  Scott O'Neil, CEO of LIV Golf, said the tour plans to have a major presence in all the markets that matter in Asia.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In terms of Asia, it's no secret golf is booming here. I believe we're up about 30 percent year over year in terms of participants playing golf, and it's no surprise that this is a place where we feel like home," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We'll obviously be in Hong Kong and Singapore and Korea, and those are three markets that we're very passionate about."

<div class="itemFullText">
 The head of China's market regulator has pledged to tighten oversight of the rapidly growing e-commerce sector, and promote the healthy development of the so-called platform economy.
 <br>
  <br>
  Luo Wen, director of State Administration for Market Regulation, made the comments on Wednesday at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, after attending the opening session of the National People's Congress.
  <br>
  <br>
  He pointed to malpractice by some live-streaming hosts who offer products which are either counterfeit or poor in quality.
  <br>
  <br>
  The administration will fulfil its supervision role, Luo said, by strengthening product inspections and toughening enforcement against misleading advertisements and promotions.
  <br>
  <br>
  On platform fees, he said the aim is to establish a reasonable and transparent charging mechanism to lessen the burden of small and medium-sized merchants.
  <br>
  <br>
  E-commerce platforms will be instructed to simplify and publish their rates, while authorities will publish guidelines to help them achieve this goal, Luo added.

    Hospital patient chokes to death after meal blunder

<div class="itemFullText">
 Caritas Medical Centre on Wednesday said it is investigating what led to an elderly patient choking to death after he was given a regular meal despite not being able to eat solid food.
 <br>
  <br>
  The man, 75, who had a history of cognitive impairment and high blood pressure, was admitted at the end of last month suffering from abdominal bloating and constipation.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was taken off food and given intravenous fluids instead, but after his condition improved doctors decided he could go back to his usual diet of pureed food, officials said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "By March 3, his condition continued to improve, and the medical team determined that this patient could return to eating his usual food, so it was recorded in his medical records as 'DAT', which stands for 'diet as tolerated'," the hospital's chief executive, Gladys Kwan, told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We believe that the nurse and doctor responsible had a communication issue, as the nurse mistakenly thought the instruction meant he could have a normal meal."
  <br>
  <br>
  Kwan said a student nurse was instructed to feed and monitor the man after each bite. Although the patient initially managed to swallow and chew, he soon began to cough, prompting the student to alert the medical team.
  <br>
  <br>
  The man was declared dead after resuscitation efforts, the hospital said.
  <br>
  <br>
  It added that it has apologised to the man's family.
  <br>
  <br>
  Raymond Cheung, chief manager for patient safety and risk management at the Hospital Authority, said a committee has been established to investigate the incident and to implement improvement measures within eight weeks.

    'Govt will support NGOs amid funding cuts'

<div class="itemFullText">
 Labour and welfare minister Chris Sun on Wednesday said the government would help NGOs save costs by streamlining administrative procedures amid funding cuts due to the fiscal deficit.
 <br>
  <br>
  Sun said the government would help shoulder a four percent reduction for 121 small-and-medium sized NGOs, meaning they would only face a three percent funding cut by the 2027-28 financial year.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, for the 58 large NGOs receiving over HK$50 million in government funding annually, Sun said they would have to bear the seven percent cuts on their own.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking after an RTHK radio programme on Wednesday, Sun said the government would give larger NGOs more time to hold onto their financial reserves, so they could make better use of their resources through these “difficult years”.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also said the government would give these NGOs more flexibility, and help them save costs by streamlining procedures such as reporting on how they used their funds.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I'm pretty confident after the meeting on Monday that we are more or less on the same page, so we are working together while we're facing a budget cut," Sun said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But at the same time, because of the more flexible use of reserves and also the efforts we are making to provide more room for them to make better use of their resources, we should be able to deal with it together,” he added.

    Rain offers hope in Japan's worst wildfire in 50 years

<img alt="The wildfire broke out on February 26, and firefighting efforts including Japan Self-Defense Forces, have continued while thousands have evacuated their homes.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wet weather looked poised to offer relief Wednesday as Japan battled its worst wildfire in half a century in a northern region hit by record-low rainfall.
 <br>
  <br>
  The blaze around the northern city of Ofunato has killed one person and forced nearly 4,000 to evacuate their homes.
  <br>
  <br>
  It has engulfed around 2,900 hectares -- over eight times the area of New York City's Central Park -- making it Japan's largest wildfire since at least 1975, when 2,700 hectares burnt in Kushiro on Hokkaido.
  <br>
  <br>
  But rain and snow were falling Wednesday as several columns of white smoke billowed from a mountain where the blaze has been raging.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Firefighters have been working on the ground through the night to extinguish the fire," a city official said on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are hoping that snow, which started to fall this morning, will help," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  At least 84 buildings are believed to have been damaged, although details are still being assessed, according to the fire agency.
  <br>
  <br>
  As of late Tuesday, almost 4,000 people living nearby had complied with orders to evacuate.
  <br>
  <br>
  Japan endured its hottest summer on record last year, as climate change pushes up temperatures worldwide.
  <br>
  <br>
  The number of wildfires in the country has declined since its 1970s peak, but there were about 1,300 in 2023, concentrated in the period from February to April when the air dries out and winds pick up.
  <br>
  <br>
  Japanese baseball prodigy Roki Sasaki, who recently joined the Los Angeles Dodgers, has offered a 10-million-yen (US$67,000) donation and 500 sets of bedding to people affected by the wildfire.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sasaki was a high school student there, after losing his father and grandparents in the huge 2011 tsunami. (AFP)

 Fans at Kai Tak for the World Snooker Grand Prix will now be allowed to stay until the last game is finished, the government says, after spectators were ejected from the venue while a match was still underway on Tuesday night.
 <br>
  <br>
  About 100 people were watching Kyren Wilson play Matthew Selt in Kai Tak Arena when at around 11.15pm, with the match going into the fifth frame, the crowd were told to leave.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sports Secretary Rosanna Law said on Wednesday that organisers were worried about the availability of public transport if the spectators stayed any longer.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This situation is obviously not ideal, and we definitely need to take into account the experience seriously and identify remedial measures," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Law described the saga as "teething problems" and said it won't happen again.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Starting from tonight, all spectators will be allowed to view the entire series of matches until the last game is done. So, there will be no more question of spectators having to leave before the game ends," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Organisers said those affected can get complimentary tickets for another session of the tournament.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Some spectators were required to leave early before the match concluded and were unable to watch the full game. The tournament organising committee sincerely apologises for this situation," a statement said.

    Democrat lawmaker ejected during Trump's speech

<div class="itemFullText">
 Democrats protested President Donald Trump's address to Congress on Tuesday with signs reading "No King!" and "Save Medicaid," with some turning their backs on the Republican as he spoke and one lawmaker marched out by security.
 <br>
  <br>
  Representative Al Green of Texas, a Democrat who plans to introduce articles of impeachment against Trump, loudly interrupted the speech in its first minutes by shouting that Trump did not have a mandate to cut safety net programmes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Republicans are trying to pass a spending bill that could significantly slash spending on popular social programs, including the Medicaid health insurance plan for low-income people, to pay for Trump's desired tax cut plan.
  <br>
  <br>
  House Speaker Mike Johnson ordered the sergeant-at-arms to remove Green from the chamber, and Republicans cheered as Green relented - waving his cane in the air - and was led out.
  <br>
  <br>
  Green told reporters afterward, "It's worth it to let people know that there are some of us who are going to stand up against this president's desire to cut Medicaid, Medicare and Social Security."
  <br>
  <br>
  With Republicans holding majorities in the House of Representatives and Senate, any impeachment effort against Trump is unlikely to advance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Around a third of the Democrats' side of the chamber had emptied as Trump's address crossed the threshold to become the longest such speech on record at an hour and 30 minutes. The rest quickly departed as Republicans gave Trump a standing ovation when the speech ended after 100 minutes, the longest in Congressional history. (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's deputies to the National People's Congress (NPC) and the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) have given their backing to the country's economic growth target of around five percent target this year, saying it was no easy feat but achievable.
 <br>
  <br>
  HSBC chairman Peter Wong, who's a CPPCC delegate, was fully confident the country could meet the target.
  <br>
  <br>
  He recalled the many economic stimulus measures rolled out by the central government last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We think that hitting the five percent growth target last year was no easy feat, given the geopolitical situation and the world economy. But we worked hard to achieve this goal, and it wasn't easy," he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For 2025, I feel the country is well-planned to meet its goal."
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong's sentiment was shared by Jonathan Choi, who chairs the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  The businessman, who is also a CPPCC Standing Committee member, noted Beijing's support measures benefit companies big and small, across different sectors.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I just feel that we can achieve it, because at the moment, the Chinese government spent a lot of attention [on] local enterprises, not only the [state-owned enterprises] ... AI and also technology, new (sectors are) coming up," he commented.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, NPC deputy Nicholas Chan described the five percent growth target as a bold one, considering the scale of China's economy - the second-largest in the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For such a big economy, five percent in GDP is huge. Five percent is basically the entire economy of Switzerland. With such a big pie, just a small growth is humongous," he explained.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So this will lead to a lot of opportunities for people all over the world, for people along the Belt and Road, Brics (countries), and Rcep (Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership), so lots of opportunities for our friends together."

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Wednesday said he was encouraged by remarks about Hong Kong in Premier Li Qiang's work report.
 <br>
  <br>
  Addressing delegates at the Great Hall of the People, Li said Beijing will continue to fully implement the One Country, Two Systems policy and ensure Hong Kong and Macau are administered by patriots.
  <br>
  <br>
  The premier also said the central government supports the two SARs in improving their economies and the livelihoods of the people.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee, who attended the opening of the National People's Congress in the capital, said the SAR will continue to unswervingly implement One Country, Two Systems.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a Facebook post, he also said 2025 marks an important year for reforms.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This year marks the final year of the 14th Five-Year Plan, the beginning of the 15th Five-Year Plan formulation, and an important year for further comprehensive deepening of reforms, which has significant meaning for the practice of One Country, Two Systems," he wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CE said he will continue to advance the Northern Metropolis development and innovation initiatives, and strengthen Hong Kong's position as an international financial hub.
