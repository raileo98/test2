    New transit route needs to 'seamlessly' link Kai Tak

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A think tank on Monday urged the government to give full play to undeveloped land along the planned elevated mass transit system in Kai Tak to connect the line "seamlessly" with buildings in the neighbourhood.
 <br>
  <br>
  Ryan Ip, vice-president and executive director of Our Hong Kong Foundation's public policy institute, also acknowledged it would be difficult to further reduce construction time, after the government said the system could be up and running three years earlier than expected.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I understand there are procedures on tendering, and there will be construction time... I think it is hard to push even ahead of 2031," Ip told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  The authorities recently revised their plan on building the 3.5-kilometre system between Kai Tak MTR Station and the Kai Tak Cruise Terminal, with a target for the route to be in service by 2031.
  <br>
  <br>
  Changes include adding one more stop and making it a six-station line, which Ip said provides an opportunity to improve the system's design.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There are two [plots of] commercial land that are still to be sold at that new station area, and I urge the government to take reference on what Singapore has done on its [Light Rail Transit] system to seamlessly connect or integrate the new stations with the commercial buildings nearby," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another revision put forward by officials was to keep the system at least 20 metres away from residential properties, instead of the 10 metres initially proposed.
  <br>
  <br>
  But according to Kowloon City District Councillor Jimmy Lam, privacy concerns still linger.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lam also urged authorities to look for ways to connect the Hong Kong Children's Hospital and the incoming New Acute Hospital with the proposed route.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said officials could take reference from the escalators and walkway system between Central and Mid-Levels.

<img alt="The Consumer Council says only three makeup bases that offer protection from the sun do not contain potential endocrine disruptors. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796050_1_20250317133301.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Consumer Council on Monday warned that some makeup bases can affect hormone levels, and people who are pregnant or are breastfeeding should avoid such products.
 <br>
  <br>
  Among the 37 primers it reviewed, 17 of them that claimed to offer protection against ultraviolet rays contained potential endocrine disruptors.
  <br>
  <br>
  The watchdog pointed out that aside from pregnant women and those who are breastfeeding, adolescents and children should also avoid using these products.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[Potential endocrine disruptors] will affect your hormone levels, your sex hormones, maybe possibly it will impair your fertility," the council’s chief executive Gilly Wong said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And also for newborns, it may [cause] genital malformation; for the young adolescents, possibly premature puberty as well."
  <br>
  <br>
  The watchdog found that only products that protect users from the sun made by Guerlain, Hourglass, and MAC are free from potential endocrine disruptors.
  <br>
  <br>
  The council also noted that 15 products it examined contained BHT, a type of antioxidant that helps to improve product stability.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said the substance could potentially lead to skin and eye irritation, according to studies conducted on animals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, the watchdog called on the public to be aware of alcohol concentrations and fragrance allergens in cosmetics, as they could lead to dryness and irritation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Users should test products by applying them on the inner wrist, it added.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Innovation and technology secretary Sun Dong said on Monday Hong Kong's I&T development was so rapid that the sector is already "in the fast lane."
 <br>
  <br>
  He made the comment in Beijing at a press conference on Monday about the upcoming two-day World Internet Conference Asia-Pacific Summit to be held in Wan Chai starting on April 14.
  <br>
  <br>
  It will mark the first time the summit is held outside mainland China.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sun said the hosting of the summit in Hong Kong shows that the SAR is, apart from being a hub for finance, trading and aviation, also making the mark in becoming a center for global IT cooperation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In fact, for the future innovation and technology industry, Hong Kong has entered the fast lane. We have clearly stated that there is a need to focus on several advantageous areas, and they're related to digital economy," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted that in Hong Kong's IT development policy blueprint, areas such as artificial intelligence, data and robots have been earmarked as focal points for development.
  <br>
  <br>
  For his part, the conference's secretary general, Ren Xianliang, says the summit will discuss topics such as the development of AI models, lower costs and technological innovation.
  <br>
  <br>
  He described the introduction of AI model DeepSeek in January as changing the world's understanding of AI, saying it's provided different professions with unprecedented development momentum and room for creativity.

    Experts weigh in on extending cryopreservation storage

<img alt="Extending the storage of embryos and gamets could raise new issues for patients according to some fertility doctors. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796041_1_20250317124547.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A specialist in obstetrics and gynaecology said it remains uncertain whether patients will return for tailored counselling after storing their embryos or gametes for a certain period of time.
 <br>
  <br>
  The government is looking to make it a requirement for licensed centres under its proposal to lift the storage period restriction for frozen eggs, sperm or embryos.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a pre-recorded interview broadcast on
  <a href="https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/news-programmes/this-episode.htm?cmsid=77" target="_blank">
   <u>
    <b>
     RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme
    </b>
   </u>
  </a>
  ,
  <br>
  Dr Alice Wong, a council member of the Hong Kong Society for Reproductive Medicine, pointed out that present freezing technique allows embryos and gametes to be stored longer than the current limit of a decade.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Theoretically, with our present freezing technique we can freeze the embryos and eggs for much longer than 10 years... of course the problem is whether it is feasible for the woman to bear the pregnancy 17 years after [she freezes her eggs] so there are still other limitations," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  With the changes possible in the future, Wong believes people will consider freezing the embryos or gametes at an earlier age to harvest eggs with higher quality.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said this means that patients can undergo fewer harvest and thus, save money from carrying out the procedure.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under the proposed amendments, the government is also planing to make it mandatory for centres to provide patients information such as the risks of egg retrieval.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong, who's also the Vice President of the Obstetrical and Gynaecological Society of Hong Kong, pointed out that centres have already been doing so.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Olympic women's badminton champion An Se-young came from behind to beat China's Wang Zhiyi 13-21, 21-18, 21-18 in a classic All England Open final as top seed Shi Yuqi lifted the men's crown.
 <br>
  <br>
  World number two Wang won the first game convincingly on Sunday and edged into a 13-10 lead during a captivating second game in Birmingham but the South Korean 2023 champion pegged her back.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang scented victory when the scores were tied at 18-18 in the second game but her South Korean opponent took the next three points to level the match.
  <br>
  <br>
  The decider was also a tight affair but again An, 23, pulled away when the players were level at 18-18, winning her fourth tournament in a row and second at the All England.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I had all sorts of emotions going through my mind during the second game," said An. "The thought that was concrete in my mind was not giving up.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That thought motivated me to keep playing and I think that led to today's win.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I won't even try to describe how hard today's match was. The match didn't go as I'd planned, which made me extra tired.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But I'm pleased with the outcome of the match."
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier, China's men's world number one Shi delivered a composed performance to see off Taiwan's Lee Chia-hao 21-17, 21-19, also collecting his second All England crown.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee, ranked 22nd, was quickly out of the blocks and opened up a three-point lead, but Shi reeled off six straight points to lead 9-6 and never relinquished his advantage.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tenacious Lee held a 10-9 lead in the second game but he could not pull away from his 29-year-old opponent, who also won the tournament in 2018.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shi was briefly made to sweat after his 20-16 lead narrowed to 20-19 but he held his nerve to seal victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's been seven years," said Shi. "A lot has happened during these seven years, ups and downs. I've been to a few semi-finals and didn't make it in the end.
  <br>
  <br>
  "After these seven years I'm delighted I could win it again.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's great that I can pass on some positive energy and values to the fans and in return they offer me support and encouragement." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A local education concern group on Monday welcomed the government's decision to form a task force to look into a recent gastroenteritis outbreak among students who went on a mainland study tour in Guangdong.
 <br>
  <br>
  Education minister Christine Choi said the task force would review the arrangements of such trips, and liaise with their mainland counterparts.

  </a>
  , Mervyn Cheung, who chairs the Hong Kong Education Policy Concern Organisation, said the task force was necessary to ensure future school trips did not encounter similar problems.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The task force is badly needed... because these kinds of exchanges or study tours for students are becoming more and more frequent and, at the same time, they are quite important in the curriculum for schools," Cheung said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cheung said the task force must look at existing regulations to see if they need to be changed or improved to ensure the health and safety of students on school trips.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They need to review all the guidelines that are set for these kinds of study tours. And especially in relation to the vigilant maintenance of hygiene and safety standards for students during the tours... whether or not the existing provisions have already safeguarded the hygienic standards and the safety standards of the travel agencies that have been hired... all this should come under very strict scrutiny."

    Healthcare co-payment levels 'should be capped'

<div class="itemFullText">
 A former senior Hospital Authority official has called for caution in setting co-payment levels for healthcare services after the government said it'll consider charging patients separately for certain check-ups.
 <br>
  <br>
  Luk Che-chung, a former chief executive of the authority's Hong Kong East area, also said on Monday that the authorities should cap medical expenses paid by patients.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Some medical services do cost a lot, especially self-financed items that often involve new drugs. They are expensive. If patients need financial assistance ... there'll be procedures to undergo and thresholds to meet," Luk told an RTHK programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If there is a capping mechanism in the future – not only on the number of check-ups but also medical fees – I believe it will be a good thing for the public."
  <br>
  <br>
  The administration has said it's reviewing fees and charges for public hospital services, including charging for such services as CT scans and MRIs to prevent abuse. But emergency and hospitalised patients would be exempted.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials said they were hoping to adjust hospital fees to a level where there would be a "reasonable co-payment."
  <br>
  <br>
  Alex Lam, chairman of Hong Kong Patients' Voices, expressed concerns that some people might not be able to cope if a co-payment were to be introduced.
  <br>
  <br>
  “For people who are not eligible for the Comprehensive Social Security Assistance scheme or are not qualified as a result of means tests, they would rather not pay the several hundred or thousand dollars out of their own pocket even if it means they won't receive such services. In the end, their condition may get worse," Lam told the same programme.

 The Consumer Council on Monday encouraged people to nap on mattresses – some of which were found to provide inadequate support – before making a purchase.
 <br>
  <br>
  The watchdog made the advice after testing double mattresses from 14 brands that make pocket spring, interlocking spring, and foam models.
  <br>
  <br>
  It found one was too hard and could not conform to a person’s back, and more than half of them were unable to support side-sleepers effectively.
  <br>
  <br>
  The council's chief executive Gilly Wong said taking a trial nap on mattresses at stores could help people make smarter purchases.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We highly recommend don't be shy. [Do] try out different mattresses to test out how you feel after you sleep on it. We recommend at least ten to 15 minutes. Frankly speaking, the longer the better," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So if the shop allows you to sleep longer, sleep as long as you could so that you can get a good sense according to your sleeping pattern, no matter it's back sleeping or side sleeping," she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The council also revealed that pocket spring mattresses offered more stability than interlocking spring models, allowing two people to rest with fewer disturbances.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Choose [mattresses] according to your own and partner’s body shape, sleeping habits and posture," the council's report said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The watchdog also noted that prices do not necessarily reflect the quality of the mattress, as they found a more than double price difference for two pocket spring models of the same rating.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the watchdog reminded consumers to pay attention to their mattresses' warranty terms, after finding over half of them were eligible for free maintenance for the first one or two years of purchase.
  <br>
  <br>
  It urged sellers to clearly explain any post-purchase costs and warranty registration procedures.

<img alt="Total retail sales of consumer goods reached over 8.37 trillion yuan, according to official figures. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796017_1_20250317110913.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Retail sales in China accelerated slightly in the first two months of the year, government data showed on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) offered some positive signs, showing retail sales – a key measure of consumer sentiment – increased four percent year-on-year during January and February combined.
  <br>
  <br>
  The NBS said total retail sales of consumer goods reached over 8.37 trillion yuan for the period.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Generally speaking, in the first two months, with the sustained effects of macro policies, the national economy maintained the new and positive development," the NBS said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  But, the statement warned "domestic effective demand is weak, [and] some enterprises face difficulties in production and operation".
  <br>
  <br>
  "The foundation for sustained economic recovery and growth is not strong enough," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Industrial production in January and February increased 5.9 percent year-on-year, data showed, slowing from the 6.2 percent growth in December.
  <br>
  <br>
  The statistics authorities combine many economic indicators for the first two months of the year to account for potential distortions caused by the annual Lunar New Year holiday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the surveyed urban unemployment rate – China's main metric for measuring unemployment – in February ticked up to 5.4 percent, the NBS said, up 0.2 percentage points from the previous month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing announced earlier this month that it is targeting total growth this year of five percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Faced with an intensified trade war under US President Donald Trump, the nation’s officials are looking to boost domestic consumption to reduce reliance on exports.  (AFP/Xinhua)

    Mass layoffs begin at Voice of America

<img alt="Contractual staff at Voice of America have been told they are terminated as of this end of this month. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796015_1_20250317104956.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump's administration began mass layoffs at Voice of America and other US-funded media, making clear its intent to gut outlets long seen as critical for US influence.
 <br>
  <br>
  Just a day after all employees were put on leave, staff working on a contractual basis received an email notifying them that they were terminated at the end of this month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Contractors were told that "you must cease all work immediately and are not permitted to access any agency buildings or systems."
  <br>
  <br>
  Contractors make up much of VOA's workforce and dominate staffing in the non-English language services, although recent figures were not immediately available.
  <br>
  <br>
  Many contractors are not US citizens, meaning they likely depend on their soon-to-disappear jobs for visas to stay in the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  Full-time VOA staff, who have more legal protections, were not immediately terminated but remain on administrative leave and have been told not to work.
  <br>
  <br>
  Voice of America, created during World War II, broadcast around the world in 49 languages with a mission to reach countries deemed to be without media freedom.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump signed an executive order on Friday targeting VOA's parent US Agency for Global Media in his latest sweeping cuts to the federal government.
  <br>
  <br>
  The agency had 3,384 employees in the 2023 fiscal year. It had requested US$950 million for the current fiscal year.
  <br>
  <br>
  With VOA in limbo, some of its services have switched to playing music for lack of new programming.
  <br>
  <br>
  The sweeping cuts also froze Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, formed in the Cold War to reach the former Soviet bloc, and Radio Free Asia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other US-funded outlets being gutted include Radio Farda, a Persian-language broadcaster blocked by Iran's government, and Alhurra, an Arabic-language network established after the Iraq invasion in the face of highly critical coverage by Qatar-based Al-Jazeera.
  <br>
  <br>
  The White House said on Saturday that "taxpayers are no longer on the hook for radical propaganda."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump regularly criticizes media coverage of him and has questioned the wisdom of funding VOA when it has a "firewall" ensuring its editorial independence.
  <br>
  <br>
  In an editorial on the demise of VOA, China's Global Times tabloid said that "the monopoly of information held by some traditional Western media is being shattered."
  <br>
  <br>
  "As more Americans begin to break through their information cocoons and see a real world and a multidimensional China, the demonising narratives propagated by VOA will ultimately become a laughingstock of the times," it said. (AFP)

 Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index gained 266.02 points, or 1.11 percent, to open at 24,226 points on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  It comes as official data shows China's retail sales of consumer goods - a major indicator of the country's consumption strength - climbed 4 percent year-on-year in the first two months of 2025.
  <br>
  <br>
  Data from the National Bureau of Statistics also showed that China's value-added industrial output, an important economic indicator, went up 5.9 percent on-year in the same period. (Xinhua)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 New home prices on the mainland dropped 0.1 percent in February, official data showed on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  On a year-on-year basis, new home prices fell 4.8 percent, compared with a 5 percent drop the previous month.
  <br>
  <br>
  In its annual work report earlier this month, the government said arresting the protracted slide in the property market was among its major tasks this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  China will introduce city-specific policies for adjusting homebuying curbs and tap into the potential demand for first homes and better housing, policymakers said.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Sunday, the State Council unveiled what it called a "special action plan" to boost domestic consumption, featuring measures including increasing residents' income and establishing a childcare subsidy scheme.
  <br>
  <br>
  The plan, organised into eight sections, "aims to promote reasonable wage growth by strengthening employment support in response to economic conditions", Xinhua reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  It intends to grow incomes through property reform, including in rural areas where it calls for "exploring ways to unlock the values of houses legally owned by farmers", it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mechanisms for stabilising the stock market and the development of financial products for individual investors are also being explored.
  <br>
  <br>
  Financial institutions will be encouraged to issue more personal consumption loans and set reasonable loan limits, terms and interest rates, Xinhua said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The plan also mentions linking consumer consumption to broader social goals, and potentially raising pension benefits.
  <br>
  <br>
  China would also accelerate the development and application of new technologies and products including autonomous driving, smart wearables, and robotics, to create new high-growth consumption sectors.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing is pushing for economic growth of around five percent this year, Premier Li Qiang announced at the opening session of the National People's Congress earlier this month.
  <br>
  <br>
  The new plan is part of China's drive to make domestic demand the main engine and anchor of its economic growth. (Agencies)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Unusually vicious and damaging weather across multiple US states spawned violent tornadoes, blinding dust storms and fast-moving wildfires this weekend, leaving at least 37 people dead.
 <br>
  <br>
  Hailey Hart and her fiancé Steve Romero hunkered down with their three huskies inside their 1994 Toyota Celica as a tornado ripped apart their home Saturday in Tylertown, Mississippi.
  <br>
  <br>
  Romero said he prayed out loud and hugged Hart as the car rolled onto its side, windows shattering, before it landed on its wheels again. After the twister passed, they could hear people nearby screaming for help.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It was a bad dream come true,” Romero said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Next door, Hart’s grandparents crawled out from the rubble of their destroyed house after they sought shelter in a bathroom as falling trees collapsed the roof.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Everything was coming down on us,” said Donna Blansett, Hart’s grandmother. “All I could do was pray to God to save us.”
  <br>
  <br>
  They escaped with just a few scratches and aches. Family members, friends and volunteers spent Sunday removing debris and salvaging anything they could find - some damp clothes, a photo album and a few toiletries.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I’m so happy you’re alive,” Hart said through tears, as she embraced her grandmother on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The National Weather Service said tornado watches had mostly expired, but dangerous winds were still possible in the Carolinas, east Georgia and northern Florida through Sunday evening.
  <br>
  <br>
  The dynamic storm that began Friday earned an unusual “high risk” designation from weather forecasters. Still, experts said it was not unusual to see such weather extremes in March.
  <br>
  <br>
  At least three people, including an 82-year-old woman, were killed in central Alabama when multiple tornadoes swept across the state.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Troy, Alabama, parks officials said the recreation centre where many residents had taken refuge had to be closed due to damage from overnight storms. No one was injured.
  <br>

   Missouri resident Dakota Henderson said he and others rescuing trapped neighbours found five bodies scattered in rubble on Friday night outside what remained of his aunt’s house in hard-hit Wayne County. Scattered twisters killed at least a dozen people in the state, authorities said.

    <br>
    In Mississippi, Governor Tate Reeves announced that six people died and more than 200 were displaced after tornadoes sowed devastation across three counties. And in the northern part of the state, roads were inundated and some people were stranded by flood waters.
    <br>
    <br>
    Wind-driven wildfires caused extensive damage in Texas and Oklahoma and officials warned on Sunday that parts of both states would again face an increased risk of fire danger in the coming week.
    <br>
    <br>
    More than 130 fires were reported across Oklahoma and nearly 300 homes were damaged or destroyed, Governor Kevin Stitt said.
    <br>
    <br>
    Oklahoma Department of Emergency Management spokesperson Keli Cain said two people were killed as a result of wildfires and weather.
    <br>
    <br>
    Meanwhile, dust storms spurred by high winds claimed almost a dozen lives on Friday.
    <br>
    <br>
    Eight people died in a Kansas highway pileup involving at least 50 vehicles, according to the state highway patrol. Authorities said three people also were killed in car crashes during a dust storm in Amarillo, in the Texas Panhandle. (AP)

    Stranded astronauts to return to Earth next Tuesday

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A pair of US astronauts stuck for more than nine months on the International Space Station will be returned to Earth on Tuesday evening, Nasa said.
 <br>
  <br>
  Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams are to be transported home with another American astronaut and a Russian cosmonaut aboard a SpaceX Crew Dragon craft, which arrived at the ISS early on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The stranded duo have been on the ISS since June after the Boeing Starliner spacecraft they were testing on its maiden crewed voyage suffered propulsion issues and was deemed unfit to fly them back to Earth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nasa said in a statement on Sunday evening that it had moved forward the astronauts' anticipated ocean splashdown off the Florida coast to Tuesday evening. It was initially slated for no sooner than Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The updated return target continues to allow the space station crew members time to complete handover duties while providing operational flexibility ahead of less favourable weather conditions expected for later in the week," the space agency said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nasa astronaut Nick Hague and Roscosmos astronaut Aleksandr Gorbunov will also return on the Dragon capsule, with the journey to be broadcast live from Monday evening when hatch closure preparations begin.
  <br>
  <br>
  For Wilmore and Williams, it will mark the end of an ordeal that has seen them stuck for nine months after what was meant to have been a days-long roundtrip.
  <br>
  <br>
  Their prolonged stay was significantly longer than the standard ISS rotation for astronauts of roughly six months.
  <br>
  <br>
  But it is much shorter than the US space record of 371 days set by Nasa astronaut Frank Rubio aboard the ISS in 2023, or the world record held by Russia's Valeri Polyakov, who spent 437 continuous days aboard the Mir space station. (AFP)

<img alt="Regulators will be summoned to Downing Street to hear Rachel Reeves' action plan to cut the administrative cost of regulation on business.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The UK's Labour government will on Monday set out details of how it plans to slash red tape to boost business, as it struggles to deliver growth nine months after winning power.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chancellor Rachel Reeves' shake-up comes after Prime Minister Keir Starmer took aim at the nation's "flabby state", sparking anger from unions who called on him to avoid the "incendiary rhetoric" of Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) in the US.
  <br>
  <br>
  The finance ministry said regulators would be summoned to the prime minister's Downing Street office on Monday to hear Reeves announce her "action plan to deliver on the pledge to cut the administrative cost of regulation on business by a quarter".
  <br>
  <br>
  The "radical" plan would cut "costly red tape" such as the "hundreds of pages of guidance on protecting bat habitats which goes far beyond legal requirements", said a statement, referring to the £100 million (US$130 million) spent on a bat tunnel by the company building Britain's new high-speed HS2 train line.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tunnel has become a lightning rod for criticism of the planning system, with the Prime Minister describing it as "absurd".
  <br>
  <br>
  The number of regulators will also be cut under Reeves' plan, saving businesses "billions of pounds", the statement added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Starmer on Thursday announced that he was axing NHS England which has run the state-run National Health Service in that nation since 2012, in a move seen as a dramatic shift to the right.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government has dubbed NHS England "the world's largest quango" (quasi-autonomous non-governmental organisation).
  <br>
  <br>
  Its abolition was the "beginning not the end" and more health-related quangos would also face the chop, Health Secretary Wes Streeting wrote in the Sunday Telegraph.
  <br>
  <br>
  Labour ousted former prime minister Rishi Sunak's Conservative government in a landslide election victory last July but has seen its popularity ratings fall during a bumpy start.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is under pressure to deliver on its election promise to kickstart economic growth while keeping prices under control amid a prolonged cost of living crisis.
  <br>
  <br>
  The central bank in February slashed its forecast for UK economic growth and warned that inflation would rise more than expected this year, blaming global risks amid US tariff threats and deteriorating business confidence in the UK. (AFP)

<img alt="Draper will make his top ten debut at seventh in the world after the victory at Indian Wells. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795988_1_20250317081126.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Britain's Jack Draper roared past Denmark's Holger Rune 6-2, 6-2 to win his first ATP Masters 1000 title at Indian Wells.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 14th-ranked Briton, who toppled two-time defending champion Carlos Alcaraz in the semi-finals, didn't face a break point as he subdued the 13th ranked Dane in just 69 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  He'll make his top 10 debut on Monday at seventh in the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's incredible," said Draper, a US Open semi-finalist last year whose preparations for 2025 were hindered by a flare-up of hip tendinitis. "I'm just so grateful and happy to be out here, to be able to play, my body feeling healthy, to feel great in my mind."
  <br>
  <br>
  "All the work I've done over the last few years, it feels like it's all coming together on the big stage and I can't put that into words," added the 23-year-old, who also missed significant time with a shoulder injury in 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  Draper was rock-solid in his first Masters 1000 final, racing to a 4-0 lead as Rune made a nervous start.
  <br>
  <br>
  Draper dropped just four points on serve in the opening set as Rune, who burst on the scene with a precocious Paris Masters triumph in 2022, had 10 of his 19 unforced errors in the set.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dane had managed to hold serve twice before Draper pocketed the set, giving himself set point with an ace before Rune thumped a backhand into the net.
  <br>
  <br>
  Draper broke Rune to open the second set, and even though the Dane got a few more looks at Draper's second serve he couldn't take advantage.
  <br>
  <br>
  Draper seized a second break for a 5-2 lead and after sending a forehand long on his first match point he had the win when Rune went long with a backhand.
  <br>
  <br>
  Draper's run to a third career title included victories not only over Alcaraz but also over 2022 Indian Wells winner Taylor Fritz and big-hitting home hope Ben Shelton.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I feel like I deserve it, in all honesty," Draper said. "It's an emotional feeling to know how much you've gone through and put in and to be here now to say that I'm going to be number seven in the world tomorrow, I can't tell you how much that means to me." (AFP)

    Australia's Gout Gout clocks world-leading 200m time

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Australian sprinting prodigy Gout Gout ran the fastest men's 200m in the world this year, with the 17-year-old saying he felt "literally free".
 <br>
  <br>
  The youngster rose to prominence in December when he clocked the quickest time ever by a 16-year-old.
  <br>
  <br>
  That mark broke Usain Bolt's personal best at the same age, with his 20.04secs also bettering Peter Norman's Australian record of 20.06 from the 1968 Olympics.
  <br>
  <br>
  He turned heads again on Sunday with a 20.05 in the heats of the Queensland State Championships – the fastest in the world this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gout then smashed through the 20-second barrier in the final with a 19.98, but it was wind-assisted so deemed illegal.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I felt literally free. I had 80 metres left to go, and I thought, let's send it," he said of the final.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Only from then did I believe I had a chance of going sub (20)," he added. "Seeing the clock, I was really happy and surprised in a way, but it just felt like a weight off my shoulders. Now that I've done it, I've just got to do that more consistently."
  <br>
  <br>
  The lanky Gout, who was born in Australia after his parents migrated from South Sudan, has drawn comparisons with eight-time Olympic gold medallist Bolt.
  <br>
  <br>
  World Athletics President Sebastian Coe recently said he was a rare talent but needed "nurturing and protecting".
  <br>
  <br>
  The qualifying mark for this year's World Athletics Championships in Tokyo is 20.16, which Gout has now beaten twice. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Paolo Banchero scored 24 points as the Orlando Magic overturned a 13-point deficit to end the Cleveland Cavaliers' 16-game unbeaten streak with a gutsy 108-103 road victory.
 <br>
  <br>
  Cleveland, the runaway Eastern Conference leaders, had looked poised to extend their franchise-record winning run after surging clear of Orlando early in the third quarter.
  <br>
  <br>
  But after a season where they have staged hefty winning comebacks of their own, the tables turned on Cleveland in the face of a furious burst of Orlando scoring.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Magic outscored Cleveland 35-23 in the third quarter, with Franz Wagner leading the charge with nine points and Banchero adding seven.
  <br>
  <br>
  Although Cleveland led by a slender 83-82 margin heading into the fourth quarter, and threatened to stretch away once more after Donovan Mitchell's driving layup made it 91-84, Orlando refused to roll over.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eight more points from Wagner in the final frame and five apiece from Banchero and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope saw the Magic home to silence a 19,432 sellout crowd at Cleveland's Rocket Arena.
  <br>
  <br>
  The former number one NBA Draft pick Banchero finished with 24 points, 11 rebounds and seven assists while Wagner added 22 points with eight rebounds and two assists as Orlando improved to 32-37 to remain eighth in the Eastern Conference standings.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mitchell led the Cleveland scoring with 23 points, with Jarrett Allen finishing on 20 and Darius Garland adding 19. (AFP)

    Andreeva downs Sabalenka for Indian Wells title

<img alt="Russia's Mirra Andreeva celebrates after defeating Aryna Sabalenka at the Indian Wells tournament. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795977_1_20250317054052.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Russian 17-year-old Mirra Andreeva toppled world number one Aryna Sabalenka 2-6, 6-4, 6-3 to capture her second WTA 1000 title at Indian Wells.
 <br>
  <br>
  Andreeva, who last month become the youngest ever player to win an elite 1000 level crown with her triumph in Dubai, ended a frustrating run against the Belarusian to ensure she will rise to a career-high sixth in the world on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Andreeva shook off her first set problems and broke Sabalenka three times in the third.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a match of swinging shifts of momentum, Andreeva was in full control by the end, giving herself a match point on Sabalenka's serve with a defensive lob that forced a miss from the number one and clinching victory with a forehand winner.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I would like to thank myself for fighting to the end," Andreeva said. "I was running like a rabbit today because Aryna she was sending bullets and it was really hard to keep up."
  <br>
  <br>
  Andreeva claimed her first hard court victory over Sabalenka, who had beaten her twice already this year at Brisbane and the Australian Open.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sabalenka had powered into the final without dropping a set but it was another disappointment for the Belarusian, who was stunned by Madison Keys in the final at Melbourne to see her bid for a third successive Australian Open title denied.
  <br>
  <br>
  Andreeva had Sabalenka under pressure early, and the youngster's frustration was evident as she was unable to convert four break points in the third game.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sabalenka took full advantage, breaking the Russian to love for a 3-1 lead and keeping her foot firmly on the accelerator from there.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sabalenka backed up her power from the baseline with some confident forays to the net, breaking Andreeva to take the opening set in 37 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sabalenka fought off another three break points to open the second set, but Andreeva finally gained a foothold with a break for 2-1, pouncing on a Sabalenka second serve to end a run of 18 missed break point chances against the Belarusian this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Andreeva followed with a quick hold for 3-1 and suddenly it was Sabalenka who looked lost.
  <br>
  <br>
  Andreeva saved a pair of break points to push her lead to 4-2, her winners tally climbing with her confidence.
  <br>
  <br>
  After missing one chance to take the set on Sabalenka's serve, Andreeva sealed the set with her first love service game, complete with a pair of aces to close it.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Russian maintained her momentum as she broke Sabalenka to love to open the third.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sabalenka promptly broke back, but that proved just a speedbump as Andreeva broke again for 2-1 and didn't face another break point on the way to her first career win over a reigning number one. (AFP)

    Newcastle win the League Cup, stunning Liverpool

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Newcastle ended their 56-year trophy drought in stunning style as Dan Burn and Alexander Isak sealed a 2-1 win against Liverpool in the League Cup final on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Eddie Howe's side made history at Wembley with a superb display that left the runaway Premier League leaders shell-shocked.
  <br>
  <br>
  Burn put Newcastle ahead late in the first half and Isak's 27th goal in all competitions doubled their lead after the interval.
  <br>
  <br>
  Federico Chiesa got one back in the closing seconds, but Newcastle held on for their first major silverware since the 1969 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup.
  <br>
  <br>
  That success in the predecessor to the Europa League is a relic of a bygone era, but this long-awaited triumph will be forever etched in the memories of the Newcastle fans who turned one half of Wembley into a roiling sea of black and white with their ecstatic celebrations.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was also Newcastle's first major domestic prize dating back 70 years to the 1955 FA Cup.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since the Magpies lifted the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, 30 different English teams had won silverware, while Liverpool had clinched 38 major trophies in that time.
  <br>
  <br>
  But after losing the 2023 League Cup final against Manchester United, Howe's team returned to Wembley and set the record straight at last.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We were well aware of the history and we wanted to do the club proud. We wanted to score, we wanted to perform and we wanted to win," Howe said. "We are breaking new ground. I thought we were magnificent today."
  <br>
  <br>
  Newcastle had endured five relegations to the second tier since their last trophy, with club legends like Alan Shearer, Paul Gascoigne and Malcolm MacDonald failing to win silverware in their time on Tyneside.
  <br>
  <br>
  Aside from a brief period when Kevin Keegan's self-styled "entertainers" challenged for the title in the 1990s, Newcastle have endured decades of underachievement and self-inflicted wounds that rendered them a laughing stock for long periods.
  <br>
  <br>
  All that changed in 2021 when a Saudi-backed consortium completed a takeover from unpopular owner Mike Ashley and quickly hired Howe as their manager.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thanks to Howe's astute leadership and the Saudi financial backing, Newcastle have been transformed from relegation candidates to silverware winners.
  <br>
  <br>
  The defeat was another painful blow for Liverpool just days after their Champions League last 16 exit on penalties against Paris Saint-Germain.
  <br>
  <br>
  But despite failing to win their first trophy under boss Arne Slot, Liverpool still sit 12 points clear at the top of the Premier League, within touching distance of a record-equalling 20th English title.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's a very disappointing result. The game went the way Newcastle wanted it. They deserved to win. We were out-played in their style. They won more aerial duels than us," Slot said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool are 23 points ahead of sixth-placed Newcastle in the league and hadn't lost to them for 17 games dating back to 2015.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Howe's men were in no mood to be cowed by past failures
  <br>
  <br>
  Newcastle fans unveiled a banner before kick-off urging their team to "write your name in the history books".
  <br>
  <br>
  They rose to the challenge in spectacular fashion, snapping into tackles and counter-attacking with purpose, while Liverpool were sluggish and sloppy in possession.
  <br>
  <br>
  Newcastle's desire and drive was clear to see when Joelinton tracked back from midfield to stop Jarell Quansah in his tracks and celebrated with a fist-pumping roar.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite nearly being caught out by Burn's aerial prowess earlier in the game, Liverpool failed to heed the warning as the towering centre-back put Newcastle ahead in the 45th minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bizarrely left unmarked, with only the diminutive Alex Mac Allister anywhere near him, Burn was allowed to rise unchallenged to meet Kieran Tripper's corner as he thumped a powerful header into far corner from 12 yards.
  <br>
  <br>
  Burn's goal – Newcastle's first in a cup final since 1976 – capped an incredible week for the journeyman centre-back, who received his first England call-up on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  With Liverpool talisman Mohamed Salah completely anonymous, the lethargic Reds had no answer as Isak put Newcastle into dreamland after 52 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Newcastle dominated in the air again as Jacob Murphy met Tino Livramento's cross with a header that found Isak, who drilled a superb first-time finish past Caoimhin Kelleher from 10 yards.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chiesa's stoppage-time strike set up an anxious finale, but good things comes to those who wait.
  <br>
  <br>
  And all across Wembley, Newcastle players and fans celebrated with abandon as a party over half a century in the making got into full swing. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chelsea's challenge for a place in next season's Champions League faltered in a toothless 1-0 defeat at Arsenal, as Manchester United continued their upward trend with a 3-0 win at Leicester.
 <br>
  <br>
  Mikel Merino scored the only goal of a disappointing contest at the Emirates as Arsenal pulled clear in second place and to within 12 points of runaway leaders Liverpool.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chelsea badly missed the presence of the absent Cole Palmer due to injury as they meekly surrendered to a damaging defeat for their hopes of a top-four finish.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Blues remain in fourth for now but have five sides from fifth-placed Manchester City to Aston Villa in ninth within four points of Enzo Maresca's men.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both managers are hoping to be stronger after the upcoming international break.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bukayo Saka is nearing a return for Arsenal, while Maresca is confident of having Palmer, Nico Jackson and Noni Madueke back when they are next in action at home to Tottenham on April 3.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We did enough to deserve to win the game," said Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta. "Now we have the international break so let's take a chance to breathe and bring some players back hopefully."
  <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal have struggled badly for goals since the loss of Kai Havertz to a season-ending injury forced midfielder Merino into a makeshift centre-forward role.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Spanish international proved the match winner from a corner as he looped a header from Martin Odegaard's delivery inside the far post on 20 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chelsea's Robert Sánchez made a brilliant stop to prevent Merino doubling Arsenal's lead with the best effort of the second half.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the game petered out with little goalmouth action as a limp performance will do little to quieten the critics of Maresca's style of play among the Chelsea support.
  <br>
  <br>
  United extended their unbeaten run in open play to seven games with a comfortable victory at seemingly doomed Leicester.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rasmus Hojlund ended a 21-game goal drought by firing United in front on 28 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alejandro Garnacho was made to wait for his first goal since November as the Argentine was flagged offside early in the second half. Garnacho, though, was not to be denied with a snap shot that Mads Hermansen should have kept out.
  <br>
  <br>
  United have won all four meetings against Leicester this season, two of which the Foxes' current boss Ruud van Nistelrooy was in interim charge of the Red Devils.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the Dutchman has not had the same impact at the King Power.
  <br>
  <br>
  Leicester have lost 13 of their last 14 league games to fall nine points adrift of safety.
  <br>
  <br>
  Van Nistelrooy's men also set an unwanted record of becoming the first Premier League side to go seven home games without scoring.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bruno Fernandes unsurprisingly set the seal on United's win with a stunning strike from the edge of the box for his seventh goal in seven games.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Tottenham kept their season alive by reaching the Europa League quarter-finals with victory over AZ Alkmaar on Thursday, but suffered the latest in a series of European hangovers in a 2-0 defeat at Fulham.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ange Postecoglou's side have won just three times in the 10 league matches that have followed a midweek European fixture.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's been a difficult campaign for sure," said Spurs captain Son Heung-min. "But I feel we've lost too many games that we should have got stuff out of, and this was one of those games."
  <br>
  <br>
  Victory for Fulham propels Marco Silva's men into the race for Champions League places as they climb to eighth, four points off the top four and three outside the top five.
  <br>
  <br>
  A top-five finish will almost certainly secure a place in Europe's top club competition next season thanks to the strong performance of English sides in European competitions. (AFP)

    Hospitalised Pope Francis addresses frailty

<img alt="Children holding balloons gather by the statue of John Paul II outside the Gemelli University Hospital where Pope Francis is hospitalised, in Rome. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795960_1_20250316215620.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Pope Francis acknowledged being fragile and "facing a period of trial", as he thanked well-wishers on Sunday for prayers in a message from hospital, where he has been slowly recovering from pneumonia.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 88-year-old pope, who has weathered his setbacks along with periods of improvement since being hospitalised on February 14, sent a particularly personal message to the faithful that referenced both his faith and his frailty.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I am sharing these thoughts with you while I am facing a period of trial, and I join with so many brothers and sisters who are sick: fragile, at this time, like me," wrote the pope in the message published by the Vatican.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our bodies are weak but, even like this, nothing can prevent us from loving, praying, giving ourselves, being for each other, in faith, shining signs of hope," he added in the message marking the second Sunday of Lent, a 40-day period of prayer and reflection leading up to Easter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sunday was the fifth time in a row the pope's illness had prevented him from personally giving the Angelus prayer, usually delivered to a crowd gathered in St Peter's Square following mass.
  <br>
  <br>
  Although Francis has yet to appear at the window of his papal suite on the 10th floor of the Gemelli hospital, that has not dissuaded a steady stream of well-wishers from gathering.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Sunday, dozens of children including scouts from a Catholic group stood at the foot of a statue of Pope John Paul II at the hospital's entrance, holding yellow and white balloons and vainly striving to catch a glimpse of the pope.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You see the pope there!" shouted one of them eagerly, before being set straight by the group leader, Valerio Santobonio, 23: "I don't think that's him."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Yesterday we had some drawings made specifically to give to the Holy Father," Santobonio told AFP.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the boys and girls, aged from five to seven, don't quite yet grasp who the pope is, nor his health situation, he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite not appearing at the window to wave, Francis addressed his youngest well-wishers in his message.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I know that many children are praying for me; some of them came here today to 'Gemelli' as a sign of closeness," Francis wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Thank you, dearest children! The pope loves you and is always waiting to meet you."
  <br>
  <br>
  Last week the Vatican signalled that the Argentine Jesuit was out of danger after a series of breathing crises earlier in his hospitalisation had sparked fears for his life.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Saturday, the Vatican said Francis's condition continued to be stable and showing progress, as it has for the past week, but cautioned he still needed therapies administered within the hospital setting.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Holy Father still requires hospital medical therapy, motor and respiratory physiotherapy; these therapies, at present, are showing further, gradual improvements," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  That message appeared to quash speculation that the pope's progress could signal an imminent release from hospital. (AFP)

    'Most scared I've been': US strikes sow panic in Yemen

<img alt="Armed Yemenis shout slogans and raise their weapons during a protest against Israel's decision to block aid into the Gaza Strip, in the capital Sanaa. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795952_1_20250316194411.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The first US strikes against Yemen's Houthis since Donald Trump took office killed 31 people, the rebels said on Sunday, with the US president warning "hell will rain down upon" the Iran-backed group if it did not stop attacking shipping.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Houthis, who have attacked Israel and Red Sea shipping throughout the Gaza war, said children were among those killed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Attacks on Sanaa, as well as on areas in Saada, Al-Bayda and Radaa, killed at least 31 people and wounded 101, "most of whom were children and women", Houthi health ministry spokesperson Anis Al-Asbahi said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Footage on Houthi media showed children and a woman among those being treated in a hospital emergency room, including a dazed girl with blackened legs wrapped in bandages.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump, in a post on social media, vowed to "use overwhelming lethal force" to end the Houthi attacks, which the rebels say are in solidarity with Palestinians amid the Gaza war.
  <br>
  <br>
  After halting their attacks when a ceasefire took effect in Gaza in January, the Houthis announced on Tuesday that they would resume them until Israel lifted its blockade of aid to the devastated Palestinian territory.
  <br>
  <br>
  Late on Saturday, a plume of white smoke had risen over Sanaa after explosions rocked the northern district of the capital.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the Houthis sealed off areas around the blast sites, making it impossible to gauge the true scale of the destruction.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mohammad Albasha, a US-based consultant, said the area targeted in Sanaa was home to senior Houthi leaders and considered their stronghold in the capital.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is the point of no return, and from now on, it's gloves off between the Houthis and CENTCOM," he said, referring to the regional US military command.
  <br>
  <br>
  Amal, 29, who lives with her mother in Sanaa, said Saturday's attacks were "terrifying... windows were shattered and the walls of the house shook".
  <br>
  <br>
  "Several military operations against the Houthis have been announced, but they've only added more casualties, most of them civilians."
  <br>
  <br>
  "The homes and locations of the leaders are well-known, but the victims are always civilians." (AFP)

    Parents need more guidance on child abuse law: YMCA

Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795949_1_20250316183822.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An NGO on Sunday said many parents are still unclear about an incoming law which makes it mandatory to report child abuse, adding that authorities should step up efforts to explain the legislation which comes into effect next year.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Chinese YMCA of Hong Kong polled over 2,500 parents from last July to November in a survey which found that two-thirds of them did not fully understand the Mandatory Reporting of Child Abuse Ordinance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Albert So, a lawyer who has been assisting the YMCA in holding activities regarding the legislation, said parents may not have had the chance to read up on the changes.
  <br>
  <br>
  “There are also lots of parents that are not local. They may be coming from the other jurisdictions, for example, some overseas ethnic minorities or people coming from mainland China,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Due to the cultural difference, [non-local parents] may not know about the situation of current legislation of Hong Kong," he said, adding more explanatory work, such as holding seminars and relevant activities, would improve the situation.
  <br>
  <br>
  The survey also revealed that almost 80 percent of the parents polled experienced mood swings when disciplining their children, and that about 30 percent of them believed a certain level of physical punishment could change their children’s behaviour.
  <br>
  <br>
  YMCA’s coordinating secretary Phoebe Sze says punishment has serious impacts on child development and should be discouraged.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We don't agree about using punishment to our children. It will harm their self-image in building their self-confidence, and may discourage their relationship with others. This would [also] discourage the children's exploration abilities.
  <br>
  <br>
  It called on parents to be more aware of their own emotions when taking care of their children and to seek help when needed.

 A fire that tore through a nightclub in North Macedonia killed 59 revellers attending a hip-hop concert at the venue, with more than 100 wounded, the country's interior minister said on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The fire broke out in "Pulse", a nightclub in the eastern town of Kocani, where more than 1,000 mostly young fans had crammed in to see the hip-hop duo DNK popular in the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  "According to the data we have by now, 59 persons lost their lives," interior minister Pance Toskovski said after visiting the scene.
  <br>
  <br>
  "More than 100 persons are injured," Toskovski said, adding that the wounded had been transported to the local hospital in the town as well as to the capital Skopje and the town of Stip some 30 kilometres to the south.
  <br>
  <br>
  The concert kicked off around midnight, while online media outlet SDK, reported that the fire started about three hours later.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to Toskovski, the fire was probably caused by the use of pyrotechnic devices "used for light effect at the concert".
  <br>
  <br>
  "At the moment of activating the so-called sprinklers, the sparks caught the ceiling that was made of easily flammable material after which for a very short period of time the fire spread across the whole discotheque, creating a thick smoke" Toskovski said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Helicopters ferried some of the wounded to the capital Skope's hospitals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Videos posted on social networks and shot before the fire show the use of stage jets, a type of indoor fireworks used during concerts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other videos published by media in the Balkan country show the entrance to the building blackened by flames.

    HK firms should strive for win-win deals: Starry Lee

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's sole delegate to the country's top legislature on Sunday said all Chinese people should do their part to help the nation’s development, and business exchanges are only sustainable if it is a win-win situation.
 <br>
  <br>
  Starry Lee made the comment when asked on a TVB programme about Beijing officials reposting articles criticising CK Hutchison's sale of its Panama Canal ports – and dozens of other ports across the globe – to a US consortium.
  <br>
  <br>
  She added that businesspeople and Hong Kong residents have always been able to create win-win situations for all parties.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The best way to approach matters is to create win-win situations. Because no matter if you're talking about doing business or having an exchange with other people, it's only sustainable if it's win-win and benefits both parties," the member of the National People's Congress Standing Committee said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We think Hong Kong people are always flexible. We've always been able to grasp the idea of creating win-win situations."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee, a former chairwoman of the DAB party, also said the Northern Metropolis development has been too slow, and the Hong Kong government can speed things up by creating what she called "an SAR within an SAR".
  <br>
  <br>
  She said such a development mode has been adopted on the mainland where officials would cut red tape and adopt a different set of vetting procedures for projects.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Beijing officials have shared a second article by the Ta Kung Pao newspaper criticising the sale by Hong Kong conglomerate CK Hutchison of its Panama Canal ports – and dozens of other ports across the globe – to a US consortium.
 <br>
  <br>
  CK Hutchison – the flagship firm of Hong Kong's richest man Li Ka-shing – will reportedly make US$19 billion from the deal.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the article, Ta Kung Pao questioned why CK Hutchison would want to sell to the US, which it described as having ill intentions.
  <br>
  <br>
  US President Donald Trump has said he wants the US to take back control of the Panama Canal – and has not ruled out military force.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ta Kung Pao also asked whether the transaction had taken the interests of the nation into account, saying those who choose to dance with the Americans have no future even if they make big money.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last week, the liaison office and the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs office shared an earlier article by Ta Kung Pao calling on CK Hutchison to rethink the deal.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Sunday said the success of mainland film Ne Zha 2 has inspired his administration to continue breaking barriers and forging its own path.
 <br>
  <br>
  Writing on his Facebook page after watching the highest-grossing film in national box office history, Lee said the movie showcased the rapid advancement of the nation's animation technology.
  <br>
  <br>
  Citing a line from the movie, "If there is no path ahead, I will make one", Lee drew parallels between Ne Zha's determination and Hong Kong's approach to tackling long-standing issues.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This mirrors Hong Kong's recent vigorous reforms, as we continue to resolve long-standing issues one after another," he wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Similarly, my team and I tackle each challenge fearlessly, demonstrating breakthrough thinking."
  <br>
  <br>
  The chief executive concluded by expressing optimism about the city's film industry, citing the success of recent local productions and expressed the hope they would reach more viewers outside Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  The sequel to the 2019 blockbuster Ne Zha premiered in Hong Kong last month, topping the local box office for several days.

    3,000 compete in inaugural Kai Tak Run

<div class="itemFullText">
 More than 3,000 runners took part in the inaugural Kai Tak Run at the Kai Tak Sports Ground on Sunday morning.
 <br>
  <br>
  Runners jogged past major facilities of the new sports ground, such as the Kai Tak Arena, with organisers saying participants were able to admire the design of the new venues and take in the nearby scenery.
  <br>
  <br>
  The event featured over eight races, including an elite, and open category.
  <br>
  <br>
  Matthew Yu, who competed at the event said he enjoyed the route. "It's very innovative, and it's something new."
  <br>
  <br>
  "We usually [race] through the streets during marathons, Tolo Harbour, or along cycling tracks in Tai Po. It's the first time for me to [race] in a large sports facility, and seeing the view from inside is a new experience for me," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Yu, who was competing in a wheelchair, also expressed the hope organisers could look into the possibility of allowing those in wheelchairs to compete alongside other groups.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think it would be better to allow us to participate alongside people in the other races, such as by having both groups start together. We could then enjoy the atmosphere together. I also think this would help promote disability inclusion," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yiu Hong-lai, the winner of the five-kilometre elite category race also said she enjoyed the race track.
  <br>
  <br>
  The runner said the route offered some challenges, such as slopes and U-turns, which tested runners' strength and ability to change directions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Also at the event was lawmaker Vincent Cheng. Speaking to reporters, Cheng expressed the hope that officials can promote the Kai Tak community ahead of international events.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Rugby Sevens is happening later this month. I hope organisers can provide more information to tourists on where to visit and the tourist spots nearby, so they could consume more [in Hong Kong]," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cheng also said the new sports ground can host more school sports competitions.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan said grooming local tech talent and attracting people in the field from outside Hong Kong are both important for the development of innovation and technology in the city.
 <br>
  <br>
  Writing on his weekly blog, he noted that local tech hubs have been offering thousands of jobs in recent weeks.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister said about 500 firms will host a job fair at Cyberport later this week offering more than two thousand jobs, more than half of them related to artificial intelligence.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last month, companies from the Science and Technology Park offered a thousand jobs in the industry.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan noted that in his budget last month, he asked more companies in the field to go to local schools to share their experience and inspire students.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister then said that the government's Hong Kong Investment Corporation will promote the development of AI technology, including hosting a forum on AI for global youth scientists.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It will promote the technical exchange of AI and its industrial development, including open source technology. Among them, the design and application of the Risc-V open source computer chip is an important part of strategic development going forward," Chan wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the firm will announce this week its partnership with a group focusing on Risc-V.

    'National Games test events show room for improvement'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The local official who heads the National Games Coordination Office on Sunday said test runs for cross-border sports events have shown there is room for improvement.
 <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong is set to co-host the November Games with Guangdong and Macau for the first time, and will host events for eight sports, including fencing and basketball.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeung Tak-keung told a radio programme that organisers are working to improve cross-border marathon and road cycling events, particularly in supporting athletes who lag behind the leading group.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We found that for some of the arrangements we can make further improvements, like how to support our athletes, and how to monitor [them]," he told reporters after the radio show.
  <br>
  <br>
  "During the road cycling and marathon [events], sometimes there may be a distance [between] the leading group and the other athletes – they may be not so close together. So how we can provide better support to them, that is one area that we think we can further improve."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Games will also feature 23 mass participation events, including bowling which will be hosted by the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  Local selections will take place in April and successful candidates can compete with bowlers from other Greater Bay Area cities in the finals in August.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeung added that officials are still working out the pricing for tickets but promised they will be affordable.

 US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov spoke on Saturday to discuss the next stage in talks on ending Moscow's war against Ukraine.
 <br>
  <br>
  According to State Department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce, the top diplomats "agreed to continue working towards restoring communication between the United States and Russia."
  <br>
  <br>
  The statement gave no details on when the next round of US-Russia talks, which are being hosted by Saudi Arabia, would begin.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rubio also updated Lavrov on military activity in the Middle East, where US forces carried out deadly strikes on Saturday against Huthi rebel targets in Yemen, the statement said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite recent tensions between President Donald Trump and his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky, Kyiv has agreed in principle to a US-brokered 30-day unconditional ceasefire if Moscow halts its attacks in eastern Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  Russia's President Vladimir Putin has not however agreed to any truce, instead setting conditions that were beyond what was called for in the US agreement with Ukraine. (AFP)

    US launches large-scale strikes against Yemeni Houthis

<img alt="" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795905_1_20250316083448.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 At least 19 were killed as US President Donald Trump launched large-scale military strikes against Yemen's Iran-aligned Houthis on Saturday over the group's attacks against Red Sea shipping, warning "hell will rain down" on them if they do not stop.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump also warned Iran, the Houthis' main backer, that it needed to immediately halt support for the group. He said if Iran threatened the United States, "America will hold you fully accountable and, we won't be nice about it!"
  <br>
  <br>
  The unfolding strikes - which one official said would last days and maybe weeks - represent the biggest US military operation in the Middle East since Trump took office in January. It came as the United States ramps up sanctions pressure on Tehran while trying to bring it to the negotiating table over its nuclear programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  At least 13 civilians were killed and nine injured in US strikes on Yemen's capital Sanaa, according to the Houthi-run health ministry.
  <br>
  <br>
  Six others, including four children and one woman, were killed and 11 were injured in a US strike on the northern province of Saada, the Houthi-run Al-Masirah TV reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Houthis' political bureau described the attacks as a "war crime."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our Yemeni armed forces are fully prepared to respond to escalation with escalation," it said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Residents in Sanaa said the strikes hit a building in a Houthi stronghold.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The explosions were violent and shook the neighbourhood like an earthquake. They terrified our women and children," one of the residents, who gave his name as Abdullah Yahia, told Reuters.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Houthis, an armed movement that took control of most of Yemen over the past decade, have launched more than 100 attacks targeting shipping since November 2023, disrupting global commerce and setting the US military on a costly campaign to intercept missiles and drones that burned through stocks of US air defences.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Houthis say the attacks are in solidarity with Palestinians over Israel's war with Hamas in Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  Iran's other allies, Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, have been severely weakened by Israel since the start of the Gaza conflict. Syria's Bashar al-Assad, who was closely aligned with Tehran, was overthrown by rebels in December.
  <br>
  <br>
  But throughout, Yemen's Houthis have remained resilient and often on the offensive, sinking two vessels, seizing another and killing at least four seafarers in an offensive that disrupted global shipping, forcing firms to re-route to longer and more expensive journeys around southern Africa.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US administration of former President Joe Biden had sought to degrade the Houthis' ability to attack vessels off its coast but limited the U.S. actions.
  <br>
  <br>
  US officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, say Trump has authorised a more aggressive approach.
  <br>
  <br>
  The strikes on Saturday were carried out in part by fighter aircraft from the Harry S. Truman aircraft carrier, which is in the Red Sea, officials said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US military's Central Command, which oversees troops in the Middle East, described Saturday's strikes as the start of a large-scale operation across Yemen.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Houthi attacks on American ships & aircraft (and our troops!) will not be tolerated; and Iran, their benefactor, is on notice," Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth wrote on X. "Freedom of Navigation will be restored."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump held out the prospect of far more devastating military action against Yemen.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Houthi attack on American vessels will not be tolerated. We will use overwhelming lethal force until we have achieved our objective," Trump wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  Iran's mission to the United Nations did not immediately respond to a request for comment. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A federal judge on Saturday barred the administration of President Donald Trump from deportations under an 18th century law that Trump invoked just hours earlier asserting the United States was being invaded by a Venezuelan gang and that he had new powers to remove its members from the country.
 <br>
  <br>
  James E. Boasberg, chief judge for the US District Court for the District of Columbia, said he needed to issue his order immediately because the government was already flying migrants it claimed were newly deportable under Trump’s proclamation to El Salvador and Honduras to be incarcerated there.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I do not believe I can wait any longer and am required to act,” he said during a Saturday evening hearing in a lawsuit brought by the ACLU and Democracy Forward. “A brief delay in their removal does not cause the government any harm,” Boasberg added, noting they remain in government custody.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ruling came hours after Trump claimed the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua was invading the United States and invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 , a sweeping wartime authority that allows the president broader leeway on policy and executive action to speed up mass deportations of people — potentially pushing his promised crackdown on immigration into higher gear.

<div class="itemFullText">
 France claimed their seventh Six Nations trophy in a record-strewn 35-16 victory Scotland on Saturday, shaking off their beautiful runners-up tag on a crisp evening at the Stade de France.
 <br>
  <br>
  Les Bleus matched England's number of titles since Italy joined the championship in 2000 and did so in style, scoring 30 tries in a pulsating campaign to make sure they would not end up runners-up for the fifth time in six years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Their only defeat came against England at Twickenham but Fabien Galthie's side put that 26-25 loss behind them by humiliating Italy before crushing Ireland despite losing their talismanic captain Antoine Dupont through injury.
  <br>
  <br>
  The hosts turned on the gas after the interval on Saturday, and prevailed through tries by Yoram Moefana (2), Louis Bielle-Biarrey and Thomas Ramos, who kicked the other points to become came France's all-time record points scorer.
  <br>
  <br>
  Scotland made a game of it and scored a try through Darcy Graham with Finn Russell kicking their other points.
  <br>
  <br>
  France, who gave Galthie his second title after the 2022 Six Nations since he took charge in 2020, finished on 21 points with England second.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was party time at the Stade de France but Les Bleus only really got into their groove after the break, relying again on forward power to finish off a combative but limited Scotland team.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dupont, who ruptured his ACL against Ireland, stayed with the squad and the mercurial scrumhalf received the loudest cheers as he watched from the stands.
  <br>
  <br>
  France started well.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gael Fickou tore through the middle and set up fellow centre Moefana for a try between the posts while Scotland were down to 14 after Jamie Ritchie was shown a yellow card.
  <br>
  <br>
  France, however, suffered a blow when Peato Mauvaka was sin-binned for head-butting Ben White and the hooker look relieved when he heard the sanction was not upgraded to a red card.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ramos slotted a penalty from under the sticks to beat Frederic Michalak's record of 436 points scored for France and give them a 13-3 lead. He now has 450 to his name.
  <br>
  <br>
  The visitors reduced the arrears when Graham touched down after collecting Russell's inside ball. The flyhalf converted and added a penalty to level the scores as French prop Jean-Baptiste Gros was sent off for 10 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ramos, however, restored a slim advantage with a penalty on the stroke of halftime before giving away possession with a poor kick.
  <br>
  <br>
  Scotland's Tom Jordan went over after a superb Blair Kinghorn break but the try was ruled out by the TMO as the fullback was ruled to be in touch.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bielle-Biarrey scored a championship record eighth try in a single campaign after being set up by Romain Ntamack who had sprinted through the defence.
  <br>
  <br>
  Then came the bomb squad as Galthie sent five forwards on from the bench and Scotland cracked.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ramos crossed the whitewash after another devastating rolling maul and Moefana, who bulldozed past Russell after Fickou's offload, claimed the bonus-point try. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Gaza's civil defence agency said nine people, including journalists, were killed in Israeli strikes in the north on Saturday, an attack Hamas denounced as a "blatant violation" of the fragile ceasefire.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Nine martyrs have been transferred (to hospital), including several journalists and a number of workers from the Al-Khair Charitable Organisation, as a result of the occupation targeting a vehicle with a drone in the town of Beit Lahia, coinciding with artillery shelling on the same area," said civil defence spokesman Mahmoud Bassal.
  <br>
  <br>
  The health ministry in the Hamas-run Palestinian territory reported that "nine martyrs and several injured, including critical cases, have arrived at the Indonesian Hospital in northern Gaza Strip, due to the ongoing Israeli aggression."
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, the Israeli military said it struck "two terrorists... operating a drone that posed a threat to IDF troops in the area of Beit Lahia."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Later, a number of additional terrorists collected the drone operating equipment and entered a vehicle. The IDF struck the terrorists," it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  After the strikes, Hamas accused Israel of violating the Gaza truce deal.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The occupation (Israel) has committed a horrific massacre in the northern Gaza Strip by targeting a group of journalists and humanitarian workers, in a blatant violation of the ceasefire agreement," Hamas spokesman Hazem Qassem said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The director of Hamas-affiliated media in Gaza, Ismail Thawabteh, said that local photo journalists were killed while "using a drone to capture images of a Ramadan dining table in Beit Lahia."
  <br>
  <br>
  He said they were "directly targeted by the occupation in two air strikes, despite their work being clear."
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel has carried out near-daily air strikes in Gaza since early March, often targeting what the military said were militants planting explosive devices.
  <br>
  <br>
  The truce in Israel's war with Hamas, in effect since January 19, has largely held despite the attacks and with no agreement yet on extending the ceasefire.
  <br>
  <br>
  The first phase of the truce ended on March 1, but both Israel and Hamas have refrained from returning to all-out war. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Saturday he had urged Kyiv's Western allies to give "a clear position" on security guarantees, including about a potential foreign troop contingent on Ukrainian soil with a US backstop.
 <br>
  <br>
  His comments came after British Prime Minister Keir Starmer held a virtual call with other European leaders and allies, including Zelensky, where Starmer said a "coalition of the willing" would help secure Ukraine "on the land, at sea and in the sky" in the event of a peace deal with Russia.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We need to continue working on the contingents that will form the foundation of Europe's future Armed Forces," Zelensky said in a post on X with an image of himself taking part in the call.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Peace will be more reliable with European contingents on the ground and the American side as a backstop."
  <br>
  <br>
  Starmer has also called for a US security backstop to help secure a lasting peace between Russia and Ukraine in the three-year-old war.
  <br>
  <br>
  Russian leader Vladimir Putin said on Thursday that he supported in principle US President Donald Trump's proposal for a 30-day ceasefire with Ukraine, but that Russia would fight on until several crucial conditions were worked out.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zelensky urged European leaders to dismiss Putin's opposition to European peacekeepers in Ukraine and blamed the Russian leader for stalling peace efforts.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A ceasefire could have already happened, but Russia is doing everything to prevent it," he said. (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Russian captain of a cargo ship which struck a tanker in the North Sea off the UK's northeastern coast appeared in court on Saturday charged with gross negligence manslaughter.
 <br>
  <br>
  Vladimir Motin, 59, appeared before magistrates in the port of Hull, where he was remanded in custody. He did not enter a plea, and will next appear in the Old Bailey in London on April 14.
  <br>
  <br>
  Motin, from Primorsky, St Petersburg, was arrested on Monday after his ship, the Portuguese-flagged Solong, rammed into the fuel-laden tanker Stena Immaculate, setting both vessels ablaze.
  <br>
  <br>
  Humberside Police said earlier that "extensive searches" by HM Coastguard to locate a missing crew member from the Solong had failed to locate him.
  <br>
  <br>
  The crew member was identified by state prosecutors as Mark Angelo Pernia, a 38-year-old Filipino, who is now presumed dead, police said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US-flagged tanker, which had been chartered by the US military, was anchored off the coast of Hull in northeastern England at the time of the crash.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police were granted two extensions on Wednesday and Thursday to allow more time to question the captain, given "the complexities of the incident," the Humberside police force said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  An investigation led by the UK, with US and Portuguese teams, has been launched to determine the exact cause of the collision, and why the Solong did not deviate from its course before it ploughed into the tanker.
  <br>
  <br>
  The UK government has ruled out foul play so far. (AFP)

    Ohtani hits home run in Dodgers' Tokyo exhibition game

<img alt="Superstar Shohei Ohtani sends the crowd wild with a two-run homer in the third inning. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795879_1_20250315205024.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Shohei Ohtani fever in Tokyo reached boiling point on Saturday as the Japanese baseball superstar hit a home run in his first game in a Los Angeles Dodgers uniform in his home country.
 <br>
  <br>
  Ohtani is in the Japanese capital with the World Series champion Dodgers to open the Major League Baseball season with two games against the Chicago Cubs next week.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 30-year-old was in action as the Dodgers beat Japan's Yomiuri Giants 5-1 in a warm-up game at the Tokyo Dome, which was packed to its 45,000-capacity rafters.
  <br>
  <br>
  He gave the crowd what they were looking for, smacking a huge home run in the third inning.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was great to see so many fans at an exhibition game," Ohtani told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It really made me feel like I was back in Japan for the first time in a while."
  <br>
  <br>
  It was Ohtani's first game in Japan since he helped his country win the World Baseball Classic two years ago in Tokyo.
  <br>
  <br>
  But it was his first-ever appearance in an MLB uniform in his home country, having left Japan for the Los Angeles Angels in 2018 before joining the Dodgers in late 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yurie Sakamune, who was at the game with her husband Junji, said the couple had entered 10 times into a lottery to buy tickets and had paid 50,000 yen (US$335) in total after snagging a pair.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's like a dream," said the 30-year-old, dressed in a Dodgers uniform with Ohtani's name and number 17 on the back.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I've been working every day to see Ohtani and I've put up with all the tough times for this. It's become like a life goal to see him."
  <br>
  <br>
  A huge cheer went up as Ohtani stepped up to the plate to open the game, drawing a walk from Giants starting pitcher Shosei Togo.
  <br>
  <br>
  He crushed the next pitch he faced, slamming a two-run home run into the stands.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Shohei, to be quite honest, in the last seven years has represented almost single-handedly the people of Japan," Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said before the game.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So for him to come back here in person, it's going to be an emotional night for a lot of people."
  <br>
  <br>
  Excitement has been building for Ohtani's visit, with around 500 fans waiting for the Dodgers to arrive at Tokyo's Haneda airport on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thousands more paid 2,000 yen (US$13) each to watch the team practice the following day, with Ohtani emerging for a brief workout lasting about 10 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The slugger, who has been described as a modern-day Babe Ruth, gave fans more for their money against the Giants.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's really cool," said American Dodgers fan Michael Artukovic, who travelled from his home in San Francisco just to watch the game.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A lot is going on in our country where we're becoming insular.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's great to see this where people from all over the world are coming to a baseball game in another country."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dodgers play another warm-up game against Japan's Hanshin Tigers on Sunday, before starting their two-game series against the Cubs on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The vast majority of fans at the Tokyo Dome were wearing Dodgers uniforms, although there was also a smattering of support for the Giants, Japan's most successful team.
  <br>
  <br>
  Atsuko Onuma said she was rooting for the Giants but said she had also come to see Ohtani.
  <br>
  <br>
  She confessed she would have "mixed feelings" if he were to hit a home run.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I want to see it but I also want to suppress that feeling," she said. (AFP)

    Putin will have to 'come to table,' UK PM tells summit

<img alt='Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron have been leading efforts to assemble a so-called "coalition of the willing."  Photo: AFP' src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795873_1_20250315201758.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 UK premier Keir Starmer said on Saturday that Russian President Vladimir Putin would "sooner or later" have to "come to the table" as he opened a virtual summit to drum up support for a coalition willing to protect any eventual ceasefire in Ukraine.
 <br>
  <br>
  The British prime minister told some 25 fellow leaders as they joined a virtual call hosted by Downing Street that they should focus on how to strengthen Ukraine, protect any ceasefire and keep up the pressure on Moscow.
  <br>
  <br>
  While Ukraine had shown it was the "party of peace" by agreeing to a 30-day unconditional ceasefire, "Putin is the one trying to delay," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If Putin is serious about peace, I think it's very simple, he has to stop his barbaric attacks on Ukraine and agree to a ceasefire, and the world is watching," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Overnight fighting continued in the relentless three-year war, with Russia saying it had taken two more villages in its Kursk border region where it has launched an offensive to wrest back seized territory.
  <br>
  <br>
  As moves have gathered pace for a ceasefire, Moscow has pushed this week to retake a large part of the land that Ukraine originally captured in western Kursk.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Russian defence ministry said troops took control over the villages of Zaoleshenka and Rubanshchina – north and west of the town of Sudzha, the main town that Moscow reclaimed this week.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kyiv, meanwhile, said its air force had overnight downed 130 Iranian-made Russian-launched Shahed drones over 14 regions of the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  Putin has called on embattled Ukrainian troops in Kursk to "surrender," while his US counterpart Donald Trump urged the Kremlin to spare their lives.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We can't allow President Putin to play games with President Trump's deal," Starmer said in comments released by Downing Street late on Friday, ahead of Saturday's call.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Kremlin's complete disregard for President Trump's ceasefire proposal only serves to demonstrate that Putin is not serious about peace."
  <br>
  <br>
  Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron have been leading efforts to assemble a so-called "coalition of the willing" ever since Trump opened direct negotiations with Moscow last month.
  <br>
  <br>
  They say the group is necessary – along with US support – to provide Ukraine with security guarantees by deterring Putin from violating any ceasefire.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky, who was on Saturday's call, said on Friday he had discussed "technical aspects" of how the ceasefire could be implemented with Macron.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our teams continue to work on clear security guarantees, and they will be ready soon," Zelensky said on the social media platform X.
  <br>
  <br>
  Starmer and Macron have said they are willing to put British and French troops on the ground in Ukraine, but it is not clear if other countries are keen on doing the same.
  <br>
  <br>
  Macron called on Russia late on Friday to accept the proposal for a ceasefire and stop making statements aimed at "delaying the process."
  <br>
  <br>
  The French president also demanded that Moscow stop its "acts of violence" in Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  Germany on Friday likewise criticised Putin's response to the US-proposed ceasefire in Ukraine as "at best a delaying tactic."
  <br>
  <br>
  US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Friday he was "cautiously optimistic" about reaching a truce, but acknowledged there was "a lot of work that remains to be done."
  <br>
  <br>
  Starmer has said he welcomes any offer of support for the coalition, raising the prospect that some countries could contribute logistics or surveillance.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The call is expected to delve further into how countries plan to contribute to the coalition of the willing, ahead of a military planning session being held next week," the UK government said.
  <br>
  <br>
  It added that Starmer will say that countries "need to ratchet up economic pressure on Russia, to force Putin into negotiations, in the short term."
  <br>
  <br>
  "And be prepared to support a just and enduring peace in Ukraine over the long term and continue to ramp up our military support to Ukraine to defend themselves against increasing Russian attacks."
  <br>
  <br>
  British Commonwealth partners Canada, Australia and New Zealand have been involved in early talks and are due to dial in to the summit.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nato chief Mark Rutte and European Union chiefs Ursula von der Leyen and Antonio Costa are also expected to take part, along with the leaders of Germany, Spain, Portugal, Latvia, Romania, Turkey and the Czech Republic, among others. (AFP)

 Nobody was reported injured after three workers became trapped on a gondola platform in Tin Shui Wai on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The incident happened at the Tin Shui Estate as Hong Kong saw its first amber rainstorm of the year at around 3 pm.
  <br>
  <br>
  A video circulating online showed the platform swaying from side to side amid high wind gusts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Firefighters rescued the workers shortly after.

    HK$2 tweaks can save govt nearly HK$700 million a year

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Labour and welfare minister Chris Sun on Saturday said changes to the HK$2 fare scheme could save the government about HK$680 million a year.
 <br>
  <br>
  As Financial Secretary Paul Chan announced in the budget last month, instead of a flat HK$2 fare, citizens aged 60 or above will have to pay 20 percent of any standard fare costing more than HK$10.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters after an event, Sun said the HK$680 million saving is “not a small amount,” and it accounts for more than 10 percent of the expenditure on the scheme.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sun also said the amended scheme would encourage the elderly to take short-haul buses instead of long-haul ones for short journeys, which will save the government even more money.
  <br>
  <br>
  “This nearly HK$700 million saving is based on the assumption that the travel habits and patterns of the beneficiaries remain unchanged. However, implementing the changes means they will choose cheaper transportation,” Sun said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the amended scheme would not lose its original purpose, while its financial sustainability would be enhanced.

<img alt="Lando Norris says he knows Sunday's race conditions will be completely different to those during Saturday's qualifying. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795861_1_20250315171554.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lando Norris clinched pole position on Saturday for the season-opening Australian Grand Prix ahead of teammate Oscar Piastri as McLaren fired a warning shot to their rivals.
 <br>
  <br>
  In scorching hot conditions at Melbourne's Albert Park, world champion Max Verstappen came third in tense qualifying.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mercedes' George Russell will keep Red Bull's four-time world champion company on the second row. Lewis Hamilton will start in eighth on his Ferrari debut.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's the perfect way to start the year. A big congrats to the team, everyone has done an amazing job to start with a one-two," said Norris.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But it is just quali, right? Let's see tomorrow," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The car is extremely quick. When you put it together it is unbelievable, but it is hard to put it together.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm never going to get ahead of myself, I'm confident the car is in a good place but we have never run it in the wet."
  <br>
  <br>
  The forecast for Sunday's race is for cooler temperatures and rain.
  <br>
  <br>
  Norris eclipsed his rivals with a flying lap of one minute 15.096 seconds on soft tyres, 0.084sec ahead of Piastri.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Pretty happy, great to start the year on the front row," said Piastri.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Pretty happy with how qualifying went, but just not quite enough in Q3, but it is a long season so a good start," added the Australian.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Maybe left a little bit on the table."
  <br>
  <br>
  No Australian driver has won their home race since Alan Jones in 1980, but that was a non-championship race before Australia was added to the F1 calendar in 1985.
  <br>
  <br>
  Verstappen, who was the pole-sitter in 2023 and 2024, was three-tenths behind Norris.
  <br>
  <br>
  Verstappen is chasing a second win in Australia after his 2023 victory to kickstart his bid for a fifth consecutive world title, a feat only Michael Schumacher has achieved.
  <br>
  <br>
  RB's Yuki Tsunoda will start a surprise fifth alongside the Williams of Alex Albon.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ferrari pair Charles Leclerc and Hamilton were a disappointing seventh and eighth with Alpine's Pierre Gasly and Carlos Sainz in the other Williams filling out the top 10. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Consumer Council has so far received 12 complaints involving around HK$5,000 in relation to the shutdown of the online food delivery platform, Deliveroo, in Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  It announced earlier that it will run until April 7, and part of its assets will be sold to rival Foodpanda.
  <br>
  <br>
  Consumer Council chief executive Gilly Wong pointed out that the biggest complaint involved about HK$600.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong said Deliveroo has to make it clear whether its subscribers are still entitled to a complimentary half-year membership at its rival, Foodpanda, if they have already subscribed to that platform.
  <br>
  <br>
  She also called on Deliveroo to inform its customers about the handling of their data.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If customers have a membership on both platforms, or they do not want to switch to another platform to enjoy their services, can they ask for a refund for the subscription that they've purchased?" Wong called on the platform to spell out the arrangement.
  <br>
  <br>
  She noted that members will have their subscriptions renewed automatically when the complimentary subscription ends, but said the platform should allow members to decide for themselves instead.
  <br>
  <br>
  She added that the watchdog is maintaining close contact with Foodpanda, which is taking over part of Deliveroo's business, and the council will offer more details later.

    'Provide mental health support to students early'

 Executive Councillor Lam Ching-choi sounded the alarm on youth mental health in Hong Kong on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at an event, Lam, who chairs the Advisory Committee on Mental Health, said previous studies by the committee had found that one-fourth of primary students and one-sixth of secondary and university students faced mental health challenges.
  <br>
  <br>
  He underscored that the issue must be addressed early in life.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The reason to allocate a lot of resources to youth work is simple, and it is evidence-based, that 90 percent of mental illnesses are developed before 21 years old,” Lam said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “If we do a good job in addressing the needs of young people, the psychological burden for adults can be relieved,” he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lam said it is important for the medical sector, teachers and social workers, to coordinate and provide mental support to students in school, as there were a lot of unsuccessful referrals to other institutions in the past.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also said people from all walks of life can take part in mental health training to help themselves and others, as people may face mental health issues in their lives.

    'Rugby Sevens tourists opting for HK Island hotels'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Rugby Sevens, one of the city's most popular and highly anticipated events, will be hosted at a brand new location this year, but the retail and tourism sectors are still expecting a boost in spending.
 <br>
  <br>
  The three-day event kicks off on March 28 and will be staged at the newly opened Kai Tak Sports Park - after three decades of being held at the Hong Kong Stadium in Causeway Bay.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tourism sector lawmaker Perry Yiu told a Commercial Radio programme on Saturday that many tourists coming for the tournament have opted for hotels on Hong Kong Island despite the change in venue.
  <br>
  <br>
  He pointed out that it will take time for visitors to adjust to the new location.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Because they used to live in areas like Causeway Bay and they are used to the area, so they would continue to stay there," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They also know that transportation is convenient on Hong Kong island side, so maybe during the first year, they will adopt a wait-and-see approach."
  <br>
  <br>
  Yiu was also pleased to see that around 80 percent of the three-day tickets have been sold.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fellow lawmaker Peter Shiu from the retail sector believes Lan Kwai Fong in Central will remain a hotspot for revellers, on top of the new attractions in Kai Tak.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Timothy Chui, executive director of the Hong Kong Tourism Association, said the so-called "Hong Kong Super March", which features a series of world-class events such as LIV Golf, and the Coldplay concert next month, will attract long-haul visitors to the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the sector still lacks manpower, particularly coach drivers, he added.

    Sabalenka books Indian Wells title clash with Andreeva

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Aryna Sabalenka avenged her Australian Open loss to Madison Keys on Friday, thrashing the American 6-0, 6-1 to book an Indian Wells title showdown with teen sensation Mirra Andreeva.
 <br>
  <br>
  Red-hot Russian 17-year-old Andreeva showed plenty of poise in a 7-6 (7/1), 1-6, 6-3 victory over defending champion Iga Swiatek, ending the second-ranked Pole's bid to become the first woman to win three titles in the California desert.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I was hungry," said Sabalenka, who had made no bones about wanting revenge after Keys denied her bid for a third straight Australian Open title in January.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That Australian Open match was really heartbroken for me, and I really needed some time to recover after that.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And if I would lose today again, it would get in my head and I didn't want that to happen. I was really focused, I was just really hungry to get this win against Madison."
  <br>
  <br>
  Keys, who was riding a 16-match winning streak, couldn't get a foot in the door.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think tactically I played really great tennis," said Sabalenka, adding her strategy was to "just keep her out of the rhythm".
  <br>
  <br>
  The mis-firing Keys finally held serve for 5-1 in the second, but minutes later Sabalenka sealed the win and lined up a shot at the WTA tour's newest sensation Andreeva in what 26-year-old Sabalenka quipped would be "kind of like an old mama playing against a kid".
  <br>
  <br>
  Andreeva beat Swiatek for the second time in as many tournaments, having stunned the Polish star in the quarter-finals at Dubai last month on the way to becoming the youngest ever WTA 1000 champion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Swiatek, who hadn't dropped a set in winning 10 straight Indian Wells matches, looked supremely confident as she dropped just one point in her first three service games.
  <br>
  <br>
  But it was Andreeva who claimed the first break of the tense first set for a 5-4 lead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Andreeva stepped up her attack and broke Swiatek to open the third, and she sealed the win with her third break of the set. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Cuba suffered a general blackout on Friday caused by a crash of its national electricity grid, officials said, the fourth major power outage on the cash-strapped communist island in five months.
 <br>
  <br>
  "At around 8:15 pm tonight, a breakdown... caused the significant loss of power in western Cuba and with it the fall of the national electricity system," the Ministry of Energy and Mines said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Writing on the social network X, Prime Minister Manuel Marrero Cruz said the government was "working tirelessly" to restore power.
  <br>
  <br>
  In by now familiar scenes, the streets of Havana were plunged into darkness.
  <br>
  <br>
  Only a few hotels and private businesses with generators still had lights on, as did essential services such as hospitals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Angelica Caridad Martinez, a resident of the central city of Camaguey, said she was about to sit down for dinner when the power failed.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm not even hungry anymore," the 50-year-old said, "This situation is unsustainable, no one can live like this."
  <br>
  <br>
  The island of 9.7 million inhabitants has suffered three nationwide blackouts in the final months of 2024, two of them lasting several days.
  <br>
  <br>
  The repeated outages comes as the island battles its worst economic crisis in 30 years, marked by widespread shortages of food, medicine and fuel, high inflation and a massive outflow of migrants.
  <br>
  <br>
  Friday night marked the first general blackout of 2025, but citizens face almost daily outages of four or five hours across much of Havana, while in rural provinces the periods without power can last 20 hours or longer.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cuba's eight thermal power plants, nearly all of which came online in the 1980s or 1990s, suffer routine failures.
  <br>
  <br>
  And the Turkish floating power barges that help boost Cuba's national grid are fed with expensive imported fuel which is often in short supply.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cuba's leadership points to a six-decade-long US trade embargo that intensified during Donald Trump's first presidency for its difficulties in keeping the lights on.
  <br>
  <br>
  To make up its electricity shortfall, Cuba is racing to install a series of at least 55 solar farms with Chinese technology by the end of this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to authorities, these facilities will generate some 1,200 megawatts of power, about 12 percent of the national total. (AFP)

 Hong Kong’s sole delegate to the nation’s top legislature, Starry Lee, on Saturday called on the government to continue to coordinate with other major cities around the world to further strengthen the SAR's position across fields.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters after an RTHK programme, Lee said Hong Kong should make use of its unique system and further strengthen international cooperation, citing it as one of the key takeaways from this year’s “Two Sessions” meetings.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee suggested the government to invite various sectors to deliberate over how to boost international cooperation.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Apart from economic ties with different cities, we have to think about, for example, other areas politically, or make use of culture, sport, education, technology, all these other areas we can further develop various ties with different cities around the world,” Lee said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on the radio programme, Lee said Hong Kong should expand its network with the Global South and Asean countries, aside from just looking at traditional markets in Europe and North America.

    'New private sector law must be rolled out gradually'

<img alt="Last week, the nation’s top legislators tabled the 'private economy promotion law', aimed at creating a fairer business environment. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795827_2_20250315105255.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An economist has said that the new law proposed by Beijing to protect and enhance the country's private sector could help address "grey areas" facing private business, but cautioned that it should be gradually rolled out to avoid stifling opportunities.
 <br>
  <br>
  Last week, the nation’s top legislators tabled the "private economy promotion law", which is designed to ensure private firms receive clear legal protection and create a fairer business environment.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bill was first introduced to the public via a consultation last October, subsequently reviewed twice by national lawmakers since last December, and was signalled by the country's top legislature - the National People's Congress - to be hammered out in parliament.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the bill was not passed at the annual session of the NPC, as lawmakers redrafted the bill to add more detailed measures - analysts expect more tweaks to come.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Ever since President Xi Jinping met some leading tech entrepreneurs last month, it has become a pretty clear signal that the government is very keen on promoting the private sector," Dan Wang, a director at the Eurasia Group's China team, told RTHK's Trending China programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang said the new bill is necessary, but cautioned that it should be rolled out gradually.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Previously, there were too many grey areas, including violations of intellectual property rights and people taking advantage of a symmetry information, so the government wants to address that. But precisely because regulations were added very fast, it stifled opportunities that could have existed for private entities."
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang, who's a seasoned economist, noted that while measures from the new law, such as prohibiting local governments to exclude private firms when launching government tenders, could give a boost for small and medium-sized private enterprises, authorities must come up with new ways to provide financial assistance for them.
  <br>
  <br>
  "How they can provide affordable and accessible financing is a problem. And how those private businesses can compete with their SOE competitors in the market, that's also a difficult issue," she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, another distinctive measure that was proposed by Premier Li Qiang in his report to the NPC, aimed to crackdown on the so-called, "996" work culture and "neijuan" practices.
  <br>
  <br>
  The "996" work culture refers to the practice by some firms to illegally make employees work from 9 am to 9 pm, six days a week. While "neijuan" refers to a self-defeating cycle of competition where firms feel forced to compete with each other excessively.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang noted the intention and necessity of the policy, but has questions on how it can be implemented practically.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Actually, China was in this vicious circle that everybody was racing, competing with each other to see who can come up with the longest working hours and who can be more competitive within the company. But it's quite damaging to the morale of the whole labour force," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For a young, fresh graduate, they don't really have negotiating power in the labour market. They probably prefer to hold on to a job rather than negotiating the work life balance."
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang added that fresh policies from Beijing during the "Two Sessions" showed a more "pro-labour" approach as part efforts to stablise the country's private sector and job market.

    Crew launch to ISS to replace stuck astronauts

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 After more than nine months on the International Space Station, two astronauts are a step closer to returning home following the launch of a crew swap mission on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  A Falcon 9 rocket with a Crew Dragon fixed to its top blasted off from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, carrying a four-member team bound for the orbital outpost.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We celebrate the countless individuals all over the world that have made this journey possible," said astronaut Nichole Ayers, the designated pilot of the Crew-10 mission, just before launch.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the real focus is what their arrival enables - the long-overdue departure from the ISS of NASA duo Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two former US Navy pilots have been stuck aboard the orbital lab since June after the Boeing Starliner spacecraft they were testing on its maiden crewed voyage suffered propulsion issues and was deemed unfit to fly them back to Earth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Instead, Starliner returned empty, without experiencing further major issues and what was meant to have been a days-long round-trip for Wilmore and Williams has now stretched past nine months.
  <br>
  <br>
  That is significantly longer than the standard ISS rotation for astronauts of roughly six months.
  <br>
  <br>
  But it is much shorter than the US space record of 371 days set by NASA astronaut Frank Rubio aboard the ISS in 2023, or the world record held by Russian cosmonaut Valeri Polyakov, who spent 437 continuous days aboard the Mir space station.
  <br>
  <br>
  What began as a technical failure has also spiraled into a political flashpoint, as President Donald Trump and his close advisor, Elon Musk, who leads SpaceX, have repeatedly suggested that former president Joe Biden "abandoned" the pair intentionally and rejected a plan to bring them back sooner.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump, meanwhile, has drawn attention for his bizarre remarks about the situation, referring to Williams, a decorated former naval captain, as "the woman with the wild hair" and speculating about the personal dynamic between the two.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They've been left up there. I hope they like each other, maybe they love each other, I don't know," he said during a recent White House press conference. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks finished higher on Friday following bargain hunting that reduced the week's losses amid recession worries over President Trump's shifting tariff policy.
 <br>
  <br>
  Major indices opened higher and remained in positive territory through the day, shrugging off a downcast reading on US consumer sentiment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Analysts pointed to the diminished odds of a US government shutdown as supportive of stocks after Democratic Senate Leader Charles Schumer backed a spending bill favored by Republican President Donald Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  The broad-based S&P 500 finished at 5,638, up 2.1 percent for the day, but down 2.3 percent for the week.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1.7 percent to 41,488, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index jumped 2.6 percent to 17,754.
  <br>
  <br>
  A consumer survey by the University of Michigan said expectations for the future "deteriorated," with "many consumers": citing a "high level of uncertainty around policy and other economic factors."
  <br>
  <br>
  The report came as economists warn that Trump's wide-ranging and unpredictable trade policy risks delaying investments, raising the odds of a recession.
  <br>
  <br>
  Major indices dropped more than one percent on Thursday after Trump threatened a 200 percent tariff on European Union wine, champagne and other alcoholic beverages following the EU's announced countermeasures against new US steel and alumium tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Friday, all 11 sectors of the S&P 500 posted gains, while the Dow index was mostly up. (AFP)

    Putin tells Ukraine troops in Kursk to 'surrender'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 President Vladimir Putin on Friday called on beleaguered Ukrainian troops in the Russian region of Kursk to "surrender" as Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky accused the Russian leader of seeking to sabotage a ceasefire initiative.
 <br>
  <br>
  US President Donald Trump urged Putin to spare the lives of the Ukrainian troops as he said his envoy had held "productive" talks with Russia's leader on a proposed 30-day ceasefire.
  <br>
  <br>
  Russia has mounted a rapid counteroffensive in the western border region of Kursk over the past week, recapturing much of the territory Ukraine seized in a shock incursion last August.
  <br>
  <br>
  Defeat in Kursk would be a major blow to Ukraine's plans to use its hold on the region as a bargaining chip in peace talks for the three-year-old war.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are sympathetic to President Trump's call," Putin said in remarks broadcast on Russian television.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If they lay down their arms and surrender, they will be guaranteed life and dignified treatment," Putin said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said "thousands" of Ukrainian troops were "completely surrounded by the Russian military, and in a very bad and vulnerable position".
  <br>
  <br>
  "I have strongly requested to President Putin that their lives be spared. This would be a horrible massacre, one not seen since World War II," Trump said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ukraine's military leadership denied the claims. "There is no threat of our units being encircled," Ukraine's General Staff posted on social media.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zelensky gave a more sober assessment in comments to reporters in Kyiv. "The situation in the Kursk region is obviously very difficult," he said, while insisting the campaign still had value.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's latest comments came as he gave an update on a meeting on Thursday between his envoy Steve Witkoff and Putin on a US-Ukrainian proposal for a 30-day pause in hostilities.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We had very good and productive discussions with President Vladimir Putin of Russia yesterday, and there is a very good chance that this horrible, bloody war can finally come to an end," Trump said on his Truth Social platform.
  <br>
  <br>
  Putin said on Thursday that he had "serious questions" about the proposal and that events in Kursk would influence the next moves towards a ceasefire.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Kremlin said on Friday that it was "cautiously optimistic" a deal could be reached, but that Trump and Putin had to speak directly before talks could progress.
  <br>
  <br>
  Putin, addressing his Security Council, said he had read Trump's appeal.
  <br>
  <br>
  While accusing Ukrainian troops of carrying out crimes against civilians that he said amounted to "terrorism", something Kyiv denies, Putin said he understood the call by Trump to take humanitarian considerations into account. (Agencies)

    Mark Carney sworn in as Canada's PM

<div class="itemFullText">
 Mark Carney was formally sworn in as prime minister of Canada on Friday, putting him in a position to fight tariffs from US President Donald Trump that could devastate the trade-dependent Canadian economy.
 <br>
  <br>
  In the presence of Governor General Mary Simon, the personal representative of King Charles, who is Canada's head of state, Carney took the oath of office.
  <br>
  <br>
  The moment capped a momentous rise for the 59-year-old, who became the first Canadian prime minister without any serious political experience.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carney plans to travel to London and Paris next week, said a diplomat aware of the plans. Canada has sought to shore up alliances in Europe as its relations with the United States sink to unprecedented lows.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carney has reshaped his cabinet with a view to dealing with Washington. Finance Minister Dominic LeBlanc is moving to the international trade portfolio and will be replaced by current Innovation Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carney crushed his rivals on Sunday in a race to become leader of the ruling Liberal Party. He replaces Justin Trudeau, who spent more than nine years in office.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carney, a former head of both the Bank of Canada and the Bank of England, successfully argued his position as an outsider with a history of tackling crises meant he was the best person to take on Trump, who has repeatedly talked about annexing Canada.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Wednesday, Carney told reporters that he was ready to meet Trump when "there is respect for Canadian sovereignty."
  <br>
  <br>
  He also said he would keep in place retaliatory tariffs on US goods until the United States showed Canada some respect.
  <br>
  <br>
  Efforts are underway to arrange a call between Trump and Carney in the next couple of days, Canadian Foreign Minister Melanie Joly told reporters on Friday. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Former Philippines president Rodrigo Duterte failed to show in person at the International Criminal Court on Friday at the opening of his crimes against humanity hearing over his deadly crackdown on narcotics.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 79-year-old, the first ex-Asian head of state to face charges at the ICC, was following by video link during a short hearing to inform him of the crimes he is alleged to have committed, as well as his rights as a defendant.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sounding frail and wearing a blue suit and tie, he spoke briefly to confirm his name and date of birth. The presiding judge allowed him to follow proceedings in absentia due to his long flight to The Hague.
  <br>
  <br>
  Duterte stands accused of the crime against humanity of murder over his years-long campaign against drug users and dealers that rights groups said killed thousands.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the prosecutor's application for his arrest, he said Duterte's alleged crimes were "part of a widespread and systematic attack directed against the civilian population in the Philippines."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Potentially tens of thousands of killings were perpetrated," the prosecutor alleged of the campaign that targeted mostly poor men, often without proof they were linked to drugs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Victims' families have welcomed the trial as a chance to get justice, while Duterte supporters believe he was "kidnapped" and sent to The Hague amid a spectacular fallout with the ruling Marcos family. (AFP)

 The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) on Friday called on members of the public to exercise caution when travelling to the Middle East.
 <br>
  <br>
  The reminder came as the World Health Organisation reported four new cases of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in Saudi Arabia, involving chronically-ill men aged between 27 and 78.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two of the patients have passed away.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, the CHP said one of the infected patients has had indirect contact with dromedary camels and their raw milk.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The CHP also recommends travel agents organising tours to the Middle East to refrain from arranging for visitors to ride dromedary camels or to participate in any activities involving direct contact with dromedary camels, which are known risk factors for acquiring MERS-CoV," the statement read.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials also reminded people to maintain good personal hygiene.

    Rashford recalled in Tuchel's first England squad

<img alt="Marcus Rashford has looked more like his old self since his loan move to Aston Villa. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795783_1_20250314215113.jpg&q=90">

<div class="itemFullText">
 Thomas Tuchel said Marcus Rashford and Jordan Henderson are contenders for England's 2026 World Cup squad after earning recalls in his first squad on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal's Myles Lewis-Skelly and Newcastle defender Dan Burn were handed their maiden call-ups for Tuchel's first matches in charge in World Cup qualifiers against Albania and Latvia.
  <br>
  <br>
  England have turned to the former Chelsea, Bayern Munich and Paris Saint-Germain coach in a bid to win a first major tournament since 1966 after losing the last two European Championship finals under Gareth Southgate.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rashford last played for the Three Lions a year ago but has been revitalised since a January loan move to Aston Villa from Manchester United.
  <br>
  <br>
  Henderson, 34, made the last of his 81 appearances for England back in November 2023 as moves to Saudi Arabia and then Ajax saw the former Liverpool captain fall down the pecking order for Southgate and interim boss Lee Carsley.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Everyone who's with us on this journey in the first camp is a contender for the World Cup," Tuchel said at a press conference at Wembley.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Jordan, I think this is a pretty easy one," he added. "What he brings to every team is his leadership, his character, personality, energy.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He makes sure that everyone lives by the standards and with this characteristic he embodies everything we try to build as a team."
  <br>
  <br>
  Rashford had been an outcast at United under Ruben Amorim, but has looked more like his old self in helping Villa to reach the quarter-finals of both the Champions League and FA Cup with four assists in nine appearances.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tuchel said he wanted to "bond" with the 27-year-old and encourage Rashford not to fall back into bad habits with his work rate.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I felt that Marcus had a huge impact in Aston Villa since he changed," said Tuchel, who won the Champions League with Chelsea in 2021.
  <br>
  <br>
  "His hard work in counter pressing, his tracking back on his position was impressive and I had the strong feeling that we should nominate him, we should bring him in, to push him to stay on that level. To not fall back in old routines."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lewis-Skelly was expected to be included after excelling in his breakout season for the Gunners at 18.
  <br>
  <br>
  Burn is at the other end of his career, but is rewarded for his consistency with a first call up at 32.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tuchel is the third non-British coach of England after Fabio Capello and Sven-Goran Eriksson.
  <br>
  <br>
  The German's appointment stirred controversy among some England fans given their long-standing rivalry with Tuchel's homeland.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Prince William, now an English Football Association patron after 18 years as the organisation's president, believes Tuchel's pedigree makes him well suited for the job.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Without doubt he is one of the top five managers in the world. It would be amazing if he could win the World Cup next year. It's gearing up to that and it's definitely possible," William told The Sun on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tuchel said it was an "honour" to have met William during his first few months in charge and is keen to prove the decision to appoint him was the correct one by the Football Association.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Exciting and a bit surreal," he said of becoming the first German to lead England. "It's a big honour and I'm very proud of it. I'm very well aware of it, I will make sure that I earn my rights to be in this place." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A male visitor at Kwong Wah Hospital has been arrested for allegedly assaulting a nurse.
 <br>
  <br>
  The hospital revealed that the nurse's arm was injured in the incident that happened in a ward on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said other medical staff and security officers were alerted, and reported the case to the police.
  <br>
  <br>
  The nurse was sent to the Accident and Emergency Department for treatment, and has since been discharged.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The hospital is highly concerned about the incident, expressed sympathy and rendered necessary support to the nurse," a Hospital Authority statement read.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The hospital resolutely adopts a zero-tolerance attitude to any workplace violence and strongly condemns the violent act."
