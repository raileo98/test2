<img alt="More than 600 global exhibitors joined the fair this year. Photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1777973_2_20241107142109.jpg&q=30">

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong’s premier wine and spirits fair, which aims to establish the SAR as the regional trading hub for alcoholic drinks, opened on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Boasting more than 600 exhibitors from around the world, the three-day International Wine and Spirits Fair will feature exhibitions, seminars, tastings and a mixology showdown at Wan Chai’s convention centre.
  <br>
  <br>
  And with the government recently relaxing duties for drinks with an alcoholic strength of 30 percent or more, exhibitors are hoping this development will bolster their global sales.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I’m certain Hong Kong is the best city and the best way for Chinese liquor to go abroad,” Keith Lau, a representative of a mainland spirits trading company said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Maotai, Xi Jiu, or other brands, they have set up local companies in order to supply overseas [demand], so it is quite important that we have the right policy for the brands to go abroad.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Fellow exhibitor Julia Klimczak, who’s selling Scottish whisky, said she is expecting an increase in sales during this year's fair. Klimczak said she believes Hong Kong offers an ideal setting for promotion and networking.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There's a lot of international contacts and I'm very excited about the networking possibilities here in Hong Kong. It's incredible, and I believe we have people from all over the world."
  <br>
  <br>
  Teddy Tse, who works at a local wine and spirits distribution company also said he is expecting better sales this year, but said he hopes authorities could further relax duties.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The starting point at HK$100 is better because over 85 percent of the products is below HK$200, the import cost. Last year was good, so I think this year will be better because of the fruits of the Wine and Dine Festival."
  <br>
  <br>
  The government last month cut the duty on liquor with an alcohol content of over 30 percent and with an import price of more than HK$200 to 10 percent from 100 percent for the portion above HK$200.
  <br>
  <br>
  Also at the fair was Pieter Hermans, a local buyer. he said the fair is a lot smaller than it used to be.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Let's hope that due to the new spirit tariffs and all these types of things, Hong Kong will get on the map a little bit more and that the internal trade is starting to move again. I guess it's just the general economy that's also suffering a little bit at the moment," he said.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Organisers of the annual cross-harbour swim scheduled for Sunday said the event will be cancelled if a tropical cyclone warning signal is in effect.
 <br>
  <br>
  They said the race will be called off if the Standby Signal No 1 or above, or the red or black rainstorm warning, is in force at 6am that day.
  <br>
  <br>
  It will also be cancelled if there's a red tide at the harbour, or any other condition that deems the race unsuitable to take place.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Observatory said it will issue the Standby Signal No 1 between noon and 3pm on Friday as Super Typhoon Yinxing enters within 800 kilometres of Hong Kong, and according to its current forecast track, the storm will be within 400 kilometres of the SAR from Saturday until Sunday morning.
  <br>
  <br>
  Organisers of the cross-harbour swim called on all participants to pay attention to the latest situation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If the race is cancelled, an official announcement will be made shortly on [our] official website and on [our] social media channels," they said.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 4,000 swimmers have signed up for the event due to take place on Sunday morning. They'll make their way from m Wan Chai to Tsim Sha Tsui.

<img alt="Labour groups are saying that the need for mechanics and technicians will increase with the three-runway system set to open in late November. File photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1777971_2_20241107151112.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The transport sector on Thursday urged authorities to finalise details of a plan to bring in outside workers, especially for the aviation industry, as soon as possible.
 <br>
  <br>
  Officials have revealed plans to bring in 10,000 skilled technicians over the next three years, but have not specified which job categories or professions will be included.
  <br>
  <br>
  It comes after Chief Executive John Lee in his Policy Address projected Hong Kong will have a shortage of about 60,000 skilled technicians across different sectors.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vivien Lau, the chief executive officer of the Hong Kong Business Aviation Centre said her industry is expecting more than 6,000 vacancies in the next five years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lau said the need for mechanics and technicians will increase with the three-runway system set to open later this month.
  <br>
  <br>
  "What we are tackling now is the technical side, the technician and mechanics. Because even though these categories were covered in the previous [labour importation] scheme, but we still think that there's a challenge in recruiting those technical staff because of their qualification, the level of experience that we are requiring, and also sometimes the language is also our key consideration," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Transport sector lawmaker Frankie Yick for his part said the government should place more focus on bringing in workers from Southeast Asia.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Particularly for the aviation industry, if they need to communicate with the pilot, with other people in the airport, and they normally speak in English. So [recruiting workers] from countries like the Philippines, Malaysia, I think that will be helpful,” he said.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An economist on Thursday said Donald Trump's return to the White House will add uncertainty to the local economy even as confidence among small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) improved in the fourth quarter.
 <br>
  <br>
  According to research conducted by the Productivity Council and Standard Chartered Bank, the Standard Chartered Hong Kong SME Leading Business Index rose 3.2 points to 45.7 points for the October-to-December period from the previous three months.
  <br>
  <br>
  Figures below 50 indicate a negative outlook, and those above 50 a positive one.
  <br>
  <br>
  A reading of 52.8 in the second quarter of 2023 was the highest in the past decade.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a press briefing, Kelvin Lau, a senior economist from Standard Chartered Bank, said local businesses are expected to be cautious moving forward over concerns that Trump may raise tariffs on Chinese goods, which could have an impact on Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If Trump starts talking about much more milder tariff hikes to begin with, we think that it could actually be not as bad of a news for a lot of the SMEs who have been expecting the worst," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So I think overall, we are looking at more subdued SME index performance, more cautiousness, prolonged cautiousness, but nothing more substantially worse than where we are now."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lau also said Hong Kong's economy is on track towards recovery, but the pace is slower than what the market expects.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chinese exports surged last month at their fastest pace in more than two years, easily topping forecasts and providing optimism about the economy as officials steel for a potential trade war with the United States after Donald Trump was re-elected president.
 <br>
  <br>
  Exports rose 12.7 percent in October from a year earlier to US$309.1 billion, according to customs data released on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The figure is the best since July 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  Exports to the US rose 8.1 percent while outbound shipments to Europe jumped 12.7 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We expect shipments to stay strong in the coming months," Zichun Huang, China economist at Capital Economics, said in a note. "Any potential drag from Trump tariffs may not materialise until the second half of next year."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Trump's return could create a short-term boost to Chinese exports as US importers increase their purchases to get ahead of the tariffs," she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Imports, meanwhile, fell 2.3 percent, turning negative for the first time in four months.
  <br>
  <br>
  China's trade surplus rose to US$95.7 billion in October, up from US$81.7 billion in September. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 City University has made it into the top 10 in the latest rankings of Asian tertiary institutions, jumping seven spots from a year ago.
 <br>
  <br>
  The University of Hong Kong remained second in the latest QS rankings, which is compiled by a higher education analytics firm based in Britain.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chinese University and the University of Science and Technology both moved up four spots, to rank sixth and 11th respectively.
  <br>
  <br>
  Polytechnic University moved up slightly to 17th, while Baptist University slipped to 71th.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Breaking into the top 10 in the QS Asia university rankings 2025 highlights our steady progress in academic research and our pursuit of innovation and excellence," said the president of City University, Freddy Boey.
  <br>
  <br>
  The University of Hong Kong, for its part, said the rankings highlight its world leading status in academia and innovation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[We are] committed to shaping the future through transformative education, cutting-edge research, and a pronounced emphasis on AI-readiness," it said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Polytechnic University head Teng Jin-guang, meanwhile, said the university was pleased with the result, describing it as impressive and encouraging.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Peking University retained the top spot in Asia, while the National University of Singapore was ranked third, the same as the year before.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Australian breakdancer Rachael "Raygun" Gunn has announced her retirement from competition, citing "really upsetting" backlash following her performance at the Paris Olympics.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 37-year-old Raygun's unorthodox routine – including kangaroo hops and imitating a sprinkler – failed to impress the judges at the Games.
  <br>
  <br>
  Her moves were copied on late-night talk shows and her unfashionable green tracksuit was mercilessly parodied online.
  <br>
  <br>
  Conspiracy theories abounded to explain how the university lecturer had even made it on to the Australia Olympic team.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gunn said the intense scrutiny had been "really upsetting", and she had decided to pull the plug on her breakdancing career.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm not going to compete any more," she told Australian radio station 2DayFM on Wednesday. "I was going to keep competing for sure, but that seems like a really difficult thing for me to do now.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The level of scrutiny that's going to be there," she added. "People will be filming it, it will be going online, it's just not going to be the same experience."
  <br>
  <br>
  Gunn had previously spoken out against the "pretty devastating" hatred unleashed towards her after the Olympics.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I went out there and I had fun – I did take it very seriously. I worked my butt off preparing for the Olympics, and I gave my all," she said in a video message after the Games.
  <br>
  <br>
  While many lampooned her performance on social media, Gunn won support from others, including her fellow Australian Olympians and even the country's prime minister.
  <br>
  <br>
  Raygun said she would continue to dance, just not in competition.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I mean I still dance, and I still break. But, you know, that's like in my living room with my partner," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Dancing is so much fun, and it makes you feel good. I don't think people should feel bad about the way that they dance," she added. "If you get out there, and you have fun on the dance floor – then just own it."
  <br>
  <br>
  Raygun did have the last laugh in September when she was briefly elevated to the top of the World Dance Sport Federation rankings.
  <br>
  <br>
  The WDSF named her the number one women's breakdancer based on winning the Oceania Championship, one of only a few events held that counted towards the rankings in the run-up to the Olympics.
  <br>
  <br>
  The sport of breaking made its Olympics debut in Paris, but will not feature at the next Games at Los Angeles in 2028. (AFP)

 President Xi Jinping congratulated Donald Trump on his re-election to the White House, state media said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Xi said China-US cooperation is a long-term goal and the two countries should strengthen dialogue between them while properly managing their differences.
  <br>
  <br>
  The president said history shows the two sides "gain from cooperation and lose from confrontation", according to Xinhua News Agency.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi said a stable, sound and sustainable China-US relationship serves their shared interests and meets the aspiration of the international community.
  <br>
  <br>
  He expressed the hope that Beijing and Washington will uphold the principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vice President Han Zheng, meanwhile, extended congratulations to JD Vance on his election as vice president of the United States. (Reporting by Xinhua)

    Israel opposition slams Netanyahu for sacking minister

<img alt="Thousands of Israelis protested against Yoav Gallant's dismissal, chanting slogans against Netanyahu. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1777866_1_20241106210015.jpg&q=55">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Opposition leaders in Israel blasted Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday for firing his defence minister, saying it threatened national security at a time of war.
 <br>
  <br>
  At a joint news conference in Jerusalem, they accused Netanyahu of putting his own political interests before the country's, following his decision the day before to dismiss Yoav Gallant.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He had the choice between disgrace and war, and he chose disgrace," said former prime minister Yair Lapid, voicing outrage at the move as Israel faces military pressures on multiple fronts.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our soldiers cannot trust him. The citizens of Israel cannot trust him. Yesterday the whole State of Israel saw that', he said of Netanyahu.
  <br>
  <br>
  Netanyahu's office announced the sacking of Gallant on Tuesday following public differences over the war with Hamas.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Over the past few months... trust has eroded. In light of this, I decided today to end the term of the defence minister," Netanyahu's office said, adding that foreign minister Israel Katz would take his place, and that Gideon Saar was appointed foreign minister to replace Katz.
  <br>
  <br>
  Leading opposition figure Benny Gantz, who quit Netanyahu's government in June over its lack of a post-war plan for Gaza, called the timing of the move "absolute security negligence".
  <br>
  <br>
  "What should our fighters in Lebanon think today, seeing that the minister of defence is fired after he issues conscription orders?" he asked, referring to an order sent on Monday for the conscription of 7,000 ultra-Orthodox individuals, a community historically exempted from military service.
  <br>
  <br>
  The orders came at a time when Israel is struggling to bolster troop numbers, with ground forces deployed to fight Hamas in the Gaza Strip and Hezbollah in Lebanon.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, thousands of Israelis took to Tel Aviv's streets to protest against Gallant's dismissal on Tuesday night, chanting slogans against Netanyahu and demanding the return of 97 hostages held in Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  For his part, Gallant said in a post on X that Israel's security would remain his life's "mission".
  <br>
  <br>
  He called on the government to bring home the hostages in Gaza while they were "still alive" and insisted all Israelis of draft age must serve in the military.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamas' October 7 attack on Israel resulted in the deaths of 1,206 people, according to a tally of Israeli official figures.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel's retaliatory campaign has killed 43,391 people in Gaza, a majority of them civilians, according to Gaza health ministry figures which the United Nations considers to be reliable. (AFP)

    'Second Trump term less impactful on China than first'

<img alt="US President-elect Donald Trump has proposed imposing tariffs of at least 60 percent on Chinese goods. File photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1777931_1_20241107102855.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A mainland-based political commentator warned of incoming tariffs and trade disputes between China and the United States when Donald Trump moves back into the White House, with Washington's relations with the broader Asia-Pacific region turning frosty.
 <br>
  <br>
  The incoming US president had previously proposed imposing across-the-board tariffs of between 10 and 20 percent on all imports arriving into the nation, and tariffs of at least 60 percent on Chinese goods.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump first launched a trade war with China in 2018.
  <br>
  <br>
  Einar Tangen, a senior fellow at the Taihe Institute and chairman of Asia Narratives, said another Trump presidency is going to have economic implications because of the Republican's "America First" policy.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he told RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme that it would have less impact on China than during Trump's first term in office.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Things have changed dramatically since that period of time. The US had a lot more leverage. Now, China has been growing its trade with the rest of the world at a double-digit pace," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Quite frankly, the US cannot be decoupled from China, even if they start buying from somewhere else as they have been... the fact is many of the intermediate goods are still manufactured in China."
  <br>
  <br>
  Tangen also expected a shift in the Asia-Pacific region's relations with the US under a second Trump presidency.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He's not interested in coalitions or anything like that... he's going to blame Asean, in particular, saying there's a trade imbalance, that it's unfair, that they have to pay more if they want security, and that they have to do something to mend America's broken economy," he said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A Hakan Calhanoglu penalty gave Inter Milan a 1-0 victory over Arsenal in the Uefa Champions League on Wednesday, as the Italian champions remain undefeated in the competition this season and sit fifth on ten points at the midway point of the new league phase format.
 <br>
  <br>
  "I think we played a great game against a strong side who play with great intensity," said Inter coach Simone Inzaghi.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal, on the other hand, experienced defeat for the first time in Europe this season and lie three points and seven places behind their opponents.
  <br>
  <br>
  The match at the San Siro looked set to go into the break goalless until a penalty was signalled against Mikel Merino after Mehdi Taremi's flick deviated the ball into the Arsenal player's raised hand from close range.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We were very harshly done by," Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta said. "There is no deflection, nothing you can do in the box – so can he get away from it?"
  <br>
  <br>
  Calhanoglu stroked home the resulting spot-kick three minutes into first-half injury time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yann Sommer and Denzel Dumfries combined on the line to deny Gabriel Magalhaes a leveller shortly before the hour.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal cranked up the pressure in the second half but were unable to break down Inter's solid defensive block as the Premier League side fell to a second defeat in four days. (AFP)

    Zheng into last four of WTA Finals, Sabalenka loses

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Zheng Qinwen continued to deliver in her breakthrough season as she advanced to the semi-finals of the WTA Finals in Riyadh on Wednesday with victory over Jasmine Paolini, while Elena Rybakina beat the already-qualified Aryna Sabalenka.
 <br>
  <br>
  Picking up a 30th win from her last 35 matches, Chinese Olympic gold medallist Zheng swept past the fourth-seeded Italian 6-1, 6-1 in a mere 67 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Kazakhstan's Rybakina claimed a consolation 6-4, 3-6, 6-1 victory over world number one Sabalenka, who had already secured her semi-final spot as the group winner on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eliminated from the competition after losing her opening two matches, Rybakina found her form against Sabalenka – a much-needed confidence boost for the world number five after missing the majority of the second half of the season with allergies, insomnia and a back injury.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was a tough match and I'm really happy that I managed to win. I think it's nice to finish the year at least with one win against the world number one," said Rybakina, who shared a warm embrace with Sabalenka at the net.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was only the second loss Sabalenka has suffered in her last 24 matches.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sabalenka, 26, must wait to find out who she will face in Friday's semi-finals, but has reason to celebrate despite defeat as she clinched the year-end number one ranking as a result of Iga Swiatek's defeat to Coco Gauff on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the Belarusian said she will not let her new ranking distract her from the task at hand – lifting the WTA Finals trophy for the first time in her career.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's a really great feeling but I figured that last night and it didn't work really well tonight for me so I just want to focus on the current tournament to stay hungry and stay motivated – it's a big tournament and it's also one of my goals, so I'll focus on this goal," Sabalenka said Wednesday.

    Atlético stun PSG in Champions League clash

<img alt="Correa celebrates after scoring the late winner for Atlético. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1777905_1_20241107074910.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Substitute Ángel Correa scored a dramatic winner with the last kick of the game as Atlético Madrid snatched a 2-1 victory away to Paris Saint-Germain on Wednesday, kickstarting their Uefa Champions League campaign and casting a large cloud over the French club's European hopes.
 <br>
  <br>
  It looked as if the game at the Parc des Princes would end in a draw after Warren Zaire-Emery's early opener for PSG was quickly cancelled out by Nahuel Molina, in what was the first ever meeting of the clubs.
  <br>
  <br>
  PSG have been let down by their finishing in the Champions League all season and that was the case again here as they failed to convert a host of chances, but Atletico did not look like winning it until Correa struck in the 93rd minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Spaniards would have been the happier of the two teams with a draw, especially as goalkeeper Jan Oblak had been forced into several second-half saves.
  <br>
  <br>
  Having lost back-to-back matches against Benfica and Lille, the win puts Atlético back on track to at least make the play-off round of this new-look Champions League, with the league phase now at the halfway stage.
  <br>
  <br>
  The evening was also notable for the pre-match unfurling by PSG fans at one end of the stadium of an enormous banner in support of Palestinians in Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  "War on the pitch but peace in the world," said the banner, which also featured a Lebanese flag.
  <br>
  <br>
  That may lead to disciplinary action from Uefa, but that will probably be the least of PSG's worries right now.
  <br>
  <br>
  They may be comfortably on top of Ligue 1 but in the Champions League last season's semi-finalists have just four points, despite playing three of their four games so far at home.
  <br>
  <br>
  Having edged Girona 1-0 on the opening matchday and then lost 2-0 away to Arsenal, the French champions have since drawn at home to PSV Eindhoven and now lost to Atlético.
  <br>
  <br>
  They face a tough assignment next away to Bayern Munich and also still have to play Manchester City, meaning their hopes of finishing in the top 24 places and qualifying at least for the play-off round must be in doubt.
  <br>
  <br>
  Luis Enrique's side will need to quickly improve in front of goal having now scored just three times in their last six Champions League matches, a run stretching back to last season's semi-final loss against Borussia Dortmund. (AFP)

Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1777896_1_20241107055849.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks surged to all-time records on Wednesday in a torrid post-election rally that cheered Donald Trump's growth agenda and welcomed the presidential race's swift conclusion.
 <br>
  <br>
  All three major indices finished at all time-highs, led by the Dow Jones, which piled on 3.6 percent at 43,729.
  <br>
  <br>
  The S&P 500 gained 2.5 percent to 5,929, while the Nasdaq jumped 3.0 percent to 18,983.
  <br>
  <br>
  Markets expect passage of Trump's agenda based on Republican wins in the Senate and anticipation that his party will retain the House as well.
  <br>
  <br>
  The rally translated into particularly robust gains for financial and industrial companies, as well as for private prison stocks. Renewable energy companies were among the losers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The reaction today is just the fact that it was a clean sweep ... winning the election, the electoral vote, the popular vote, the Senate, and looking like they'll retain the House as well," said Aaron Clark, equity portfolio manager at GW&K Investment Management. "The market's clearly on a sugar high."
  <br>
  <br>
  The gains showed investor hopes about expected tax cuts and regulatory easing more than offset worries about higher tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A swift and decisive outcome reduces the risks of protracted uncertainty, political violence, recession risks, and even geopolitical spillover that could have accompanied presidential election outcome uncertainty," said Prestige Economics' Jason Schenker.
  <br>
  <br>
  Big winners in the post-election rally included Trump Media & Technology Group, home to the president-elect's Truth Social platform, as well as Tesla, which is led by Trump mega-supporter Elon Musk.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump Media rose 5.9 percent and Tesla piled on 14.8 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Big financial companies also soared in expectation of an easing in strict banking rules. JPMorgan Chase won 11.6 percent and Goldman Sachs soared 13.2 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  CoreCivic and GEO Group, which manage immigration detention centres, both jumped on expectations of more investment. CoreCivic won nearly 29 percent while GEO Group won more than 42 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  But renewable energy producers and other companies focused on sustainability were under pressure. This group included Enphase Energy, down 16.8 percent, and First Solar, down 10.1 percent. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 US Vice President Kamala Harris delivered a televised concession speech to the nation on Wednesday after a whirlwind campaign that failed to stop Republican Donald Trump's return to the White House.
 <br>
  <br>
  "While I concede this election, I do not concede the fight that fueled this campaign," she told supporters at her alma mater Howard University, a historically black college.
  <br>
  <br>
  Harris pledged to continue fighting for women's rights and against gun violence, and to "fight for the dignity that all people deserve."
  <br>
  <br>
  She said she had called President-elect Trump and congratulated him on his triumph.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We must accept the results of this election. Earlier today, I spoke with President-elect Trump and congratulated him on his victory. I also told him that we will help him and his team with their transition, and that we will engage in a peaceful transfer of power."
  <br>
  <br>
  Harris addressed a crowd that included former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, aides in President Joe Biden's White House and thousands of fans who listened to a soundtrack that included Beyonce's "Run the World (Girls)" and Tye Tribbett's "We Gon' Be Alright."
  <br>
  <br>
  Her running mate, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, joined the crowd.
  <br>
  <br>
  Harris rose to the top of the Democratic ticket in July after Biden stepped aside and brought new-found enthusiasm and cash to the Democratic ticket, but struggled to overcome voters' concerns about the economy and immigration.
  <br>
  <br>
  She was handed a resounding loss, with Trump winning a greater share of votes across most of the country compared with his performance in 2020 and Democrats failing to secure key battleground states that decide elections.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thousands had gathered at Howard University, Harris' alma mater, on Tuesday night for what they hoped would be a historic victory for the first woman to become president.
  <br>
  <br>
  They came back on Wednesday to show their support after her loss. (Reuters)

File photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1777871_1_20241106220620.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson said on Wednesday the election of Donald Trump as US president could put Washington's commitment to Ukraine at risk.
 <br>
  <br>
  Kristersson congratulated Trump on his victory in a post to X early Wednesday. He was looking forward "to working together and continuing the excellent US-Sweden relations as friends and allies", he wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  But hours later, Kristersson told a news conference that Trump's return to the Oval Office also carried risks, including "existential" ones for Sweden such as a potential US "reduced commitment to Ukraine".
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm not going to count on it," Kristersson told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "On the contrary, we take stock of the fact that the US is until now the single largest military aid donor to Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We don't take it for granted."
  <br>
  <br>
  Added together, he noted, the Nordic and Baltic countries were the second-largest donor to the Ukrainian war effort.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has cast doubt on continuing US military support for Kyiv, promising to cut a quick deal with Russian President Vladimir Putin to end the war.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sweden ended two centuries of military non-alignment and applied for Nato membership in the wake of Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine -- becoming the US-led alliance's 32nd member in March of this year. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Israel's airports authority said operations at its main airport near Tel Aviv were not affected after Hezbollah claimed it fired missiles at an Israeli military base nearby on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Ben Gurion airport is open and operating as normal for takeoffs and landings," the authority's spokeswoman, Liza Dvir, told AFP, adding that the runway had been unaffected.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lebanon's Hezbollah said it fired missiles at an Israeli military base near the airport on Wednesday, the first such attack in more than a month of war.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, the Iran-backed group said the salvo of missiles targeted the Tzrifin military base near Ben Gurion International Airport, south of the Israeli commercial hub of Tel Aviv.
  <br>
  <br>
  Images posted on social media showed smoke rising near the airport while AFP photos from Ben Gurion showed no damage on the tarmac.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Israeli military did not confirm whether the base had been targeted.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said that "approximately 10 projectiles crossed from Lebanon" following sirens in northern and central Israel.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Most of the projectiles were intercepted and one fallen projectile was identified in central Israel," it added. (AFP)

<img alt="President Xi Jinping and his then US counterpart Donald Trump meet at the G20 summit in Japan in 2019. Hong Kong-based political expert Brian Wong says he expects China-US relations to be volatile under the Trump presidency. File photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1777857_2_20241106220018.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A Hong Kong-based political expert on Wednesday said Republican Donald Trump's victory in the US presidential election would add uncertainty to Sino-American ties.
 <br>
  <br>
  "There's no guaranteed outcome... It's going to be an incredibly unpredictable and volatile four years, with more trade protectionism and tariffs, with potential escalation and flare-ups over geopolitical fault lines near China," Brian Wong, Assistant Professor of Philosophy and a fellow at the Centre on Contemporary China and the World at the University of Hong Kong, told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong likened Trump's return to the White House to a game of Russian roulette for Beijing.
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted that Trump's backers included many China hawks, such as former US trade representative Robert Lighthizer and former acting US director of national intelligence Richard Grenell, as well as those with business interests in the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Donald Trump also has enduring ties with many prominent businessmen with sizeable corporate interests and commercial interests in China, including (Blackstone CEO) Stephen Schwarzman and also (Tesla CEO) Elon Musk," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So how these different factions and also voices in his likely administration makeup and also in a circle of advisors on China influences him, that remains to be seen."

 Five more people have been arrested in connection with an attack on a corrections officer outside Pik Uk Prison last week.
 <br>
  <br>
  That brings to 13 the number of people arrested over the case.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police said of the latest arrests, three were suspected to have carried out or planned the attack and two others allegedly provided assistance to the assailants.
  <br>
  <br>
  At least one of them has been charged.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eight others were taken into custody earlier and three of them have been charged.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officers have not ruled out making further arrests.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to the police, the officer was attacked by three masked men carrying "long hard objects" while waiting for a bus outside the prison in Sai Kung on Friday.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Donald Trump was elected president, capping a remarkable comeback four years after he was voted out of the White House and ushering in a new American leadership likely to test relations abroad.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump, 78, recaptured the White House on Wednesday by securing more than the 270 Electoral College votes needed to win the presidency, Edison Research projected.
  <br>
  <br>
  The former president's victory in the swing state of Wisconsin pushed him over the threshold.
  <br>
  <br>
  "America has given us an unprecedented and powerful mandate," Trump said early on Wednesday to a roaring crowd of supporters at the Palm Beach County Convention Centre in Florida.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump’s political career had appeared to be over after his false claims of election fraud led a mob of supporters to storm the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, in a failed bid to overturn his 2020 defeat.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he swept away challengers inside his Republican Party and then beat Democratic candidate Kamala Harris by capitalising on voter concerns about high prices and what Trump claimed, without evidence, was a rise in crime due to illegal immigration.
  <br>
  <br>
  Harris did not speak to supporters who had gathered at her alma mater Howard University. Her campaign co-chair, Cedric Richmond, briefly addressed the crowd after midnight, saying Harris would speak publicly later on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We still have votes to count," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Republicans won a US Senate majority, but neither party appeared to have an edge in the fight for control of the House of Representatives where Republicans currently hold a narrow majority.
  <br>
  <br>
  Voters identified jobs and the economy as the country's most pressing problem, according to Reuters/Ipsos opinion polls.
  <br>
  <br>
  Many Americans remained frustrated by higher prices even amid record-high stock markets, fast-growing wages and low unemployment.
  <br>
  <br>
  With the administration of President Joe Biden taking much of the blame, a majority of voters said they trusted Trump more than Harris to address the issue.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hispanics, traditionally Democratic voters, and lower-income households hit hardest by inflation helped fuel Trump's election victory. His loyal base of rural, white and non-college educated voters again showed up in force.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump prevailed despite persistently low approval ratings. Impeached twice, he has been criminally indicted four times and found civilly liable for sexual abuse and defamation.
  <br>
  <br>
  In May, Trump was convicted by a New York jury of falsifying business records to cover up hush money payments to a porn star.
  <br>
  <br>
  His victory will have major implications for US trade and climate change policies, the war in Ukraine, Americans' taxes and immigration.
  <br>
  <br>
  His tariff proposals could spark a fiercer trade war with China and US allies, while his pledges to reduce corporate taxes and implement a spate of new cuts could balloon US debt, economists say.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has promised to launch a mass deportation campaign targeting immigrants in the country illegally.
  <br>
  <br>
  He has said he wants the authority to fire civil servants he views as disloyal. His opponents fear he will turn the Justice Department and other federal law enforcement agencies into political weapons to investigate perceived enemies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vice President Harris fell short in her 15-week sprint as a candidate, failing to galvanise enough support to defeat Trump, who occupied the White House from 2017-2021, or to allay voters' concerns about the economy and immigration.
  <br>
  <br>
  Harris had warned that Trump wanted unchecked presidential power and posed a danger to democracy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump ran a campaign characterised by apocalyptic language. He called the United States a "garbage can" for immigrants, pledged to save the economy from "obliteration" and cast some rivals as the "enemy within."
  <br>
  <br>
  His diatribes were often aimed at migrants, who he said were "poisoning the blood of the country," or Harris, whom he frequently derided as unintelligent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite legal woes and controversies, Trump is only the second former president to win a second term after leaving the White House. The first was Grover Cleveland, who served two four-year terms starting in 1885 and 1893. (Reuters)

    'Specific licences needed for bamboo scaffolding work'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A concern group for industrial accident victims on Wednesday urged authorities to issue specific licences to contractors that carry out scaffolding-related work.
 <br>
  <br>
  Siu Sin-man of the Association for the Rights of Industrial Accident Victims made the comment after a worker fell to his death on Tuesday while dismantling bamboo scaffolding from a To Kwa Wan building.
  <br>
  <br>
  Currently, bamboo scaffolding workers must be accredited by the Occupational Safety and Health Council – and their licences have to be renewed.
  <br>
  <br>
  But contractors do not have similar requirements. They only need to be registered under the Buildings Ordinance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Siu said having a more specific licensing system for contractors could enhance regulations.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Scaffolding is a high-risk industry. If we only use business registration, [there’s not enough] regulation for this kind of work. So people can easily open a company to do this high-risk [job],” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Siu added that she is unsure whether the worker who died was wearing proper safety equipment when the incident occurred.
  <br>
  <br>
  The worker’s relatives held a mourning ceremony earlier in the day.
  <br>
  <br>
  His wife said her husband operated a company with several partners, and that he spent more than 20 years in the field and was always very careful.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong and mainland shares fell while US stock futures rose sharply hours before the opening of markets on Wednesday as Republican Donald Trump claimed victory in the American presidential election.
 <br>
  <br>
  The greenback surged and bitcoin hit a record high, with traders ramping up bets on fresh tax cuts, tariffs and rising inflation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Here in Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index snapped a three-day winning streak, finishing 468 points or 2.2 percent lower at 20,538.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mainland stocks also closed lower, with the Shanghai Composite Index down 0.09 percent to 3,383 and the Shenzhen Component Index losing 0.35 percent at 10,968.
  <br>
  <br>
  Analysts said the prospect of another Trump presidency and Republican control of US Congress risked heightened tensions between Beijing and Washington over trade and technology.

  "Right now, the markets are focusing narrowly on the prospect of tariffs because it is the easiest lever to pull directly under a presidential executive order, but we’ve seen between 2016-20 other levers that can be pulled to contain China," said Rong Ren Goh, a portfolio manager in the fixed income team at Eastspring Investments.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Although both candidates are probably hawkish toward China, Trump is still less predictable in terms of policy, so the prospect of a Trump win could still drag sentiment a bit," said Kenny Ng, strategist at China Everbright Securities International.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stock futures were up 2.2 percent for the Dow, 2 percent for the broad-based S&P 500 and 1.7 percent for the tech-heavy Nasdaq.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the US dollar jumped 1.5 percent to 154.38 yen, its highest since July, while it was also up more than 1 percent against the euro and more than 3 percent against the Mexican peso.
  <br>
  <br>
  The offshore yuan fell more than 1 percent versus the greenback, to its weakest since mid-August.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bitcoin sprung US$6,000 higher to a record US$75,371.69, topping its previous peak of US$73,797.98 in March.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has pledged to make the United States the "bitcoin and cryptocurrency capital of the world" and to put tech billionaire Elon Musk in charge of a wide-ranging audit of governmental waste.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The price of bitcoin has closely followed Trump's position in the polls and on betting markets," Russ Mould, an analyst at AJ Bell, said ahead of Tuesday's US election.
  <br>
  <br>
  Investors are "potentially taking the view that a Republican victory would lead to a surge in demand for the digital currency", he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Peter Esho, economist and founder at Esho Capital, said: "The markets are scrambling to figure out what happens next, but for the time being, the market is pricing in a higher growth and higher inflation outlook." (Agencies)

    Snow seen on Mount Fuji after record absence

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Snow has finally fallen on Mount Fuji, images showed on Wednesday, after warm weather led to the Japanese mountain's longest-ever stint with bare slopes.
 <br>
  <br>
  The volcano's famous snowcap begins forming on October 2 on average, and last year snow was first observed by government meteorologists on October 5.
  <br>
  <br>
  Japan's weather agency – which compares conditions from exactly the same location, Kofu City, each year – has not yet announced a new record for the slowest start to the snowcap, due to cloud cover at its monitoring station.
  <br>
  <br>
  But this year already marks the latest arrival of snow since comparative data became available in 1894, beating the previous record of October 26 – seen twice, in 1955 and 2016.
  <br>
  <br>
  Photographs taken from different points around Japan's highest mountain where the skies were clearer early on Wednesday showed a dusting of snow on its peak.
  <br>
  <br>
  "These are photos of Mount Fuji, seen from the city hall this morning. We could see a thin layer of snow cover near the summit," said a post on the official X account of Fuji City, in Japan's central Shizuoka region.
  <br>
  <br>
  Many others in the area also posted their own photographs of snow on the country's highest mountain, and aerial footage from national broadcaster NHK showed close-ups of white powder on the rocky slopes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Finally, the first snow cover! Mount Fuji looks good with snow," said a post from a nursing home, also in Fuji City.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mount Fuji is covered in snow for most of the year, but during the July-September hiking season, more than 220,000 visitors trudge up its steep, rocky slopes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The symmetrical mountain has been immortalised in countless artworks, including Hokusai's "Great Wave". It last erupted around 300 years ago. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Reactions from around the world began flooding in on Wednesday as Donald Trump claimed victory in the US presidential election.
 <br>
  <br>
  NATO chief Mark Rutte congratulated the Republican, saying his return to power will help keep the alliance "strong".
  <br>
  <br>
  "His leadership will again be key to keeping our Alliance strong. I look forward to working with him again to advance peace through strength through NATO," Rutte said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called Trump’s apparent victory "history's greatest comeback" and a new beginning in the US-Israel alliance.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Congratulations on history's greatest comeback! Your historic return to the White House offers a new beginning for America and a powerful recommitment to the great alliance between Israel and America. This is a huge victory!" said Netanyahu in a statement issued by his office.
  <br>
  <br>
  British Prime Minister Keir Starmer also hailed Trump’s “historic election victory.”
  <br>
  <br>
  “I look forward to working with you in the years ahead. As the closest of allies, we stand shoulder to shoulder in defence of our shared values of freedom, democracy and enterprise."
  <br>
  <br>
  In a post on social media platform X, French President Emmanuel Macron said he’s “ready to work together just as we knew how to do during four years. With your convictions and with mine. With respect and ambition. For more peace and prosperity", Macron wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky congratulated Trump on an “impressive” election victory, and said he hopes the result will bring “just peace in Ukraine closer.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, meanwhile, had this assessment of Trump on his official Telegram account.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Trump has one useful quality for us: as a businessman to the core, he mortally dislikes spending money on various hangers–on and stupid hanger-on allies, on bad charity projects and on voracious international organisations".
  <br>
  <br>
  Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi also sent his congratulations, saying he was looking forward to working with the vote frontrunner.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Heartiest congratulations my friend @realDonaldTrump on your historic election victory," Modi wrote on X. "As you build on the successes of your previous term, I look forward to renewing our collaboration." (Agencies)

    Police nab 275 over 'staged traffic accidents'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Wednesday said they arrested 275 people who allegedly staged traffic accidents to obtain financial assistance from the government.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Social Welfare Department, which arranges financial assistance for traffic accident victims, requires these people to provide documents certified by a registered medical practitioner.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officers said the suspects were involved in 121 traffic accidents from February last year to April this year, and had obtained about HK$14 million in financial assistance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chief Inspector Tse Yu-ngai said a majority of them belonged to different syndicates and some even staged accidents involving public transport.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Eleven out of 14 victims in one accident were from the same syndicate... They got on the double-decker bus at different stations. When the bus travelled to Tung Chung, the mastermind arranged a private car to collide with the bus, staging a traffic accident," Tse said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that some debtors were being forced by creditors to participate in these staged accidents in order to pay off their debts.
  <br>
  <br>
  The suspects, aged between 18 and 64, were arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to defraud and fraud.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Department of Justice on Wednesday said it has issued a policy statement to incorporate mediation clauses in government contracts.
 <br>
  <br>
  Officials said the statement sets out the government's stance on promoting the use of mediation to resolve disputes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a Legal Week event, Secretary for Justice Paul Lam encouraged people to seek mediation when disputes arise, before resorting to arbitration or litigation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The government will incorporate mediation clauses in all future government contracts, and departure from that policy will need to be justified by exceptional circumstances, for example the existence of an inconsistent statutory provision," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Through this policy, we do not only aim at ensuring that contractual disputes involving the government may be resolved in a flexible, economical and time-saving manner.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We also hope that with the government taking the lead, the policy will also encourage the private sectors to follow suit."

 China said on Wednesday it hoped for "peaceful coexistence" with the United States as Donald Trump appeared on the verge of a decisive victory over Kamala Harris in the country's presidential election.
 <br>
  <br>
  "We will continue to approach and handle China-US relations based on the principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence, and win-win cooperation," foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning told a regular briefing.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our policy toward the United States has been consistent," she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mao did not comment directly on the possibility of Trump's re-election, but said "the United States presidential election is an internal affair of the United States".
  <br>
  <br>
  "We respect the choice of the American people," she said. "After the US election results are released and officially announced, we will handle related matters in accordance with usual practice," she added when asked if President Xi Jinping would call Trump to congratulate him. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Two Shanghai-based firms that are taking part in a national expo said they plan on expanding their reach into Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  TMiRob Technology and Faraconix are among the firms that have signed cooperation agreements at the China International Import Expo.
  <br>
  <br>
  TMiRob produces AI-powered robots that can be sent into isolation wards to conduct simple medical procedures, such as checking the temperature and radiation levels of cancer patients.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With the effort of letting our robots running inside Hong Kong hospitals, hopefully we can combine with more technologies in the world," the firm's founder, Pan Jing, told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  Faraconix – which produces semiconductors for smartphones and computers – plans to expand into Hong Kong this month and invest more than HK$100 million in the coming three years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Its founder, Chi Law, is from Hong Kong and started the firm in Shanghai four years ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The purpose of coming to Hong Kong is to bring some communication products for use in the future, such as what's known as millimetre wave, or [products] in the 6G era, as well as satellite communication chips," he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  Law said despite the global competition in chip making, he expressed confidence that his company can come up with chips and tech that are better than those in the US in two to three years.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Republican Donald Trump on Wednesday claimed victory in the 2024 US presidential contest after Fox News projected that he had defeated Democrat Kamala Harris, which would cap a stunning political comeback four years after he left the White House.
 <br>
  <br>
  As jubilant supporters cheered and chanted "USA", Trump took to the stage at his campaign headquarters in Florida along with his wife Melania and several of his children.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are going to help our country heal," the Republican former president said. "It's a political victory that our country has never seen before."
  <br>
  <br>
  Addressing a roaring crowd of supporters at the Palm Beach County Convention Centre, Trump said "America has given us an unprecedented and powerful mandate."
  <br>
  <br>
  Other news outlets had yet to call the race for Trump, but he appeared on the verge of winning after capturing the battleground states of Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Georgia and holding leads in the other four, according to Edison Research.
  <br>
  <br>
  Harris did not speak to her supporters, who had gathered at her alma mater Howard University. Her campaign co-chair, Cedric Richmond, briefly addressed the crowd after midnight, saying Harris would speak publicly later on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We still have votes to count," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The mood shifted had shifted sharply at the watch party as the results came in.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I am scared," said Charlyn Anderson. "I am anxious now. I am leaving, my legs can barely move."
  <br>
  <br>
  In contrast, the celebrations intensified at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida and the watch party nearby.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tech tycoon Elon Musk, who has backed Trump and stands to lead a government efficiency commission under him, posted a picture of himself with the Republican.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Game, set and match," Musk said on X, the social media network he owns along with the Tesla electric vehicle firm and the Space X company.
  <br>
  <br>
  The former president was showing strength across broad swaths of the country, improving on his 2020 performance everywhere from rural areas to urban centres.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a further blow to Democrats, Trump's Republican Party also seized control of the Senate, flipping two seats to overturn a narrow Democratic majority. Neither party appeared to have an edge in the fight for control of the House of Representatives where Republicans currently hold a narrow majority.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump went into Election Day with a 50-50 chance of reclaiming the White House, a remarkable turnaround from January 6, 2021, when many pundits pronounced his political career to be over.
  <br>
  <br>
  That day, a mob of his supporters stormed Congress in a violent attempt to overturn the results of the 2020 election.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump picked up more support from Hispanics, traditionally Democratic voters, and among lower-income households that have keenly felt the sting of price rises since the last presidential election in 2020, according to exit polls from Edison.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump won 45 percent of Hispanic voters nationwide, trailing Harris with 53 percent but up 13 percentage points from 2020.
  <br>
  <br>
  About 31 percent of voters said the economy was their top issue, and they voted for Trump by a 79-to-20 margin, according to exit polls.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some 45 percent of voters across the country said their family's financial situation was worse off today than four years ago, and they favoured Trump 80 to 17 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Global investors were increasingly pricing in a Trump win. US stock futures and the dollar pushed higher, while Treasury yields climbed and bitcoin rose – all flagged by analysts and investors as trades that favour a Trump victory. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Republican Party has wrested control of the US Senate from the Democrats, with at least 51 seats in the 100-member upper house of Congress, US networks projected early on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  It gives the GOP a major power centre in Washington and a lead role in confirming the next president’s cabinet, as well as any Supreme Court justice if there is a vacancy.
  <br>
  <br>
  The last time the Republicans had a majority in the Senate was January 2021.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US Capitol is divided into the House of Representatives - where all 435 seats are up for grabs - and a 100-member Senate, which has 34 seats at stake this year. Congressional elections run alongside the White House race.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jim Justice, the sitting Republican governor of West Virginia, delighted Republicans early in the night when he emerged as an easy victor in the Senate race to replace retiring moderate Joe Manchin, an independent who voted with the Democrats.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ohio then moved into the Republican column after longstanding Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown was defeated by Bernie Moreno, a Trump-endorsed businessman and the son of a one-time high-ranking Colombian government official.
  <br>
  <br>
  Democrats were looking to mitigate losses with gains in Texas and Florida, but conceded both as the sitting Republicans notched easy wins.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nonpartisan political finance monitor OpenSecrets reports that US$10 billion has been spent on candidates for Congress this cycle - a touch less than in 2020 but almost twice as much as the US$5.5 billion price tag for the 2024 White House race. (Agencies)

    Hong Kong watches as America decides

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Many people in Hong Kong were keeping a close watch on the unfolding results of the hotly contested US elections on Wednesday, with opinions here as divided as those in the United States.
 <br>
  <br>
  Dozens of people attended a watch party organised by the American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  One of them, Chris Growney, who works in the financial services sector, thinks a win for Republican candidate Donald Trump would also be a victory for American businesses.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The businesses that are in the States would be treated with better tax efficiency, have better opportunities to create new jobs,” he said. “And ideally, if there are potentially higher tariffs on imports then that could potentially help American businesses."
  <br>
  <br>
  But Diana Parusheva-Lowery, who works in the same sector, believes a Trump victory could mean more restrictions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If there are more tariffs, if there are more investment restrictions, this is going to affect trade flow, investment flow and ultimately capital flow," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But equally, if Kamala Harris wins, she also has her policies towards China, which will also have an effect to which might be similar, might be different."
  <br>
  <br>
  There were also a number of people who still don’t have a preference either for Trump or Democratic candidate Kamala Harris, including businessman Mark Wise.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The US and Chinese economies are intertwined... One candidate is a bit more protectionist in their approach, and another is more in line with traditional, open and free trade between the countries. That could a material difference in the economic situation for both countries, depending on the outcome," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But I'd say that having an election that takes longer than a day is going to be something that no one wants."
  <br>
  <br>
  Eden Woon, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong, said the result will determine the future development of Sino-US ties, which will also have a direct impact on the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It is very important for Hong Kong because Hong Kong has a very close trade relationship with the United States. Historically, it has a very good connection with the United States' civil society and here many people, many businesses have an interest in the United States. So we are also watching to see what happens in this election,” Woon told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other watch parties were being held elsewhere in the territory, including at a pub in Central.
  <br>
  <br>
  Raj, a British shipping worker in Hong Kong, said he's not surprised to see Trump leading early but believed the Democrats will take over eventually.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Republicans always take an early lead... Typically whenever you watch an election like this it always looks like the Republicans are winning, but it's going to be very close, so I think at the end, we're going to see the Democrats coming forward," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I want to follow the results of this election because I think it has an impact geopolitically all over the world.”
  <br>
  <br>
  For James Lockett, chairman of Democrats Abroad and organiser of the event, the early results came as a surprise.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Compared to 2020, by this time, Joe Biden had a big lead because of early voting,” he noted. "My main concern is gun control, it's very important, and also women's rights are very important. Diversity in the workplace is very important to me."
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, a group of university students was paying attention to the elections on the University of Hong Kong campus on Wednesday morning.
  <br>
  <br>
  Peter Lee, an HKU undergraduate, told RTHK that he was at the event to get to know what others thought about the race.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think in here you can [listen] to different voices and you will listen to different people with different opinion or predictions," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think it will be better for me to come here to interact with people rather than just staying at home, just thinking by myself, because election somehow you can predict it, but maybe the real outcome is different from your predictions."
  <br>
  <br>
  Another student, Zhang Yiqiu, said she backs Harris because of her support for women's reproductive rights.
  <br>
  <br>
  She also described the winner-take-all electoral system in the US as "absurd".
  <br>
  <br>
  "To me, it's not fair if someone gets more votes but still they are the losing party... From quite an idealistic point of view, it will be good to eradicate that and just by counting votes only based on the number."
  <br>
  <br>
  Zhang Jiarui, a master's student, said a Trump win would be a bad sign to China's exports.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Trump said they will bring manufacturing industry back to the United States which implies that they will implement some tariffs to China's exports."

    'Rainbow wall' at Choi Hung Estate must go: govt

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Housing director Rosanna Law said an iconic rainbow wall of Choi Hung Estate will have to be demolished, but officials will seriously look at restoring the spot after redevelopment.
 <br>
  <br>
  Officials plan on moving the first batch of affected tenants to an estate in Kowloon City as early as four years from now, as an estimated 15 years will be needed to complete the phased renewal of the estate.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to RTHK, Law said the "rainbow" block of Tan Fung House and the sports courts next to it, which is above a multi-storey car park, would have to go.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If we say we retain the rainbow wall and the car park, not only will we have fewer flats in the redeveloped estate, but I think it would be rather difficult in terms of having enough space, to improve the traffic conditions nearby," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But we understand how the public loves this photo spot. Our team of architects will seriously think about ways of restoring this 'rainbow' at the new Choi Hung Estate."
  <br>
  <br>
  Law said authorities made the redevelopment announcement early, so that tenants can be psychologically prepared about having to move out and take part in the process.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said if they don't want to move to Kowloon City and stay nearby, officials will try to accommodate if there are suitable flats available.
  <br>
  <br>
  Law stressed that the second and third phase of the redevelopment - due to begin around 2035 - are still in a conceptual stage.
  <br>
  <br>
  She explained the new blocks were meant to be up to 50-storeys high and officials cannot conduct works such as exploring the ground's foundation until after tenants have moved out.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chief Executive John Lee also announced in his Policy Address last month plans to regulate sub-divided flats while requiring landlords to turn them into "basic housing units".
  <br>
  <br>
  Law said it is illegal for landlords to break existing rental contracts early and force out tenants in the name of renovating the flats and she said tenants can report this to the authorities.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In fact, the government has yet to set the standards [for basic housing units]. We haven't completed our public consultation and enact new laws. Do landlords have to rush to [renovate]?" the director of housing said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I appeal to the landlords, even if you're eager to make sure your flats comply with the new standards, you really should wait a little bit until we have promulgated the new standards. Otherwise you may waste your money."
  <br>
  <br>
  Law said around 40 percent of tenants currently living in the potentially affected sub-divided flats, or around 40,000 households, should be ineligible to apply for public housing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities, she said, will not conduct large-scale law enforcement in future unless officials are confident they can find re-settlements for affected residents.

    Gauff beats Swiatek, Sabalenka earns world number one

<img alt="Gauff during her match against Iga Swiatek of Poland. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1777756_1_20241106093625.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Coco Gauff posted a rare victory over Iga Swiatek to punch her ticket to the semi-finals of the WTA Finals in Riyadh on Tuesday, ensuring Aryna Sabalenka will finish the year as the world number one.
 <br>
  <br>
  Swiatek, the defending champion, was in a direct battle with Sabalenka for the top spot this week but needed a win over Gauff to keep her chances alive of leapfrogging her Belarusian rival.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gauff, 20, entered the contest having lost 11 of her 12 previous meetings with Swiatek, with the American's sole victory coming in Cincinnati last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  But she turned the tables on Swiatek on Tuesday, defeating the second seed 6-3, 6-4 to make it two straight-sets wins from two round-robin matches in Riyadh this week.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It feels great. I knew going into the match that despite our head-to-head I had a lot of confidence going in," said Gauff, who hit 11 double faults during the one-hour 48-minute showdown.
  <br>
  <br>
  With the exception of the opening game of the match, Gauff had break point opportunities in every Swiatek service game in the first set.
  <br>
  <br>
  The American third seed made her move in game seven, breaking for 4-3, and she closed out the set with a second break of serve, taking the lead in 49 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Swiatek needed six break points in a marathon third game of the second set to finally take down the Gauff serve but she couldn't consolidate her advantage.
  <br>
  <br>
  They traded breaks again, as Gauff's double-fault tally went up to double digits and Swiatek racked up the errors.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was Gauff who eventually steadied the ship, and wrapped up the victory on Swiatek's 47th unforced error of the match.
  <br>
  <br>
  Swiatek, a five-time major champion, admits her two-month break between the US Open and the WTA Finals and the fact she is playing her first tournament with her new coach Wim Fissette have made things "a bit more tricky and different than usual".
  <br>
  <br>
  "But I'll force myself to work even better in the next match," the Pole added. (AFP)

    AC Milan topple Champions League holders Real Madrid

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Champions League holders Real Madrid fell to a 3-1 home defeat by AC Milan on Tuesday in the group stage with striker Kylian Mbappé unable to find the net again.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 25-year-old France captain has scored once in his last six matches for Madrid across all competitions, including three losses for Los Blancos.
  <br>
  <br>
  Malick Thiaw headed the Italian side ahead before Vinicius Junior levelled from the penalty spot for the hosts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alvaro Morata struck against his former side to restore Milan's lead before the break and Tijjani Reijnders netted the third to secure Milan's victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  Madrid were unable to bounce back strongly from the 4-0 thrashing by Barcelona in late October, their last outing after Saturday's La Liga match at Valencia was postponed because of devastating floods in the east of Spain.
  <br>
  <br>
  Players from both sides wore t-shirts before the match reading "We are all Valencia" while in one stand a giant Valencia regional flag was unfurled for a minute's silence.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the 90 minutes that followed, Paulo Fonseca's Milan, seventh in Serie A, outclassed Madrid.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are going through a period when our opponents are punishing us a lot and we have to keep working so that this doesn't happen again," Madrid defender Lucas Vazquez told Movistar.
  <br>
  <br>
  Los Blancos have let in nine goals in their last three home matches.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have to be worried, the team's not giving a good account of itself," said Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The team is not compact, we have to be more compact, more organised, we've let in a lot of goals," he added. "We're not well organised on the pitch, and we have to work on that."
  <br>
  <br>
  Milan have won the competition seven times, behind only record 15-time champions Madrid, but have not reached a final since 2007, when Ancelotti led them to the trophy.
  <br>
  <br>
  This victory harked back to their glory days and Fonseca praised his team's bravery.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The players came here with courage, didn't have any fear – in the first half we created plenty, and in the second half we were on the back foot, but we fought together," said the Portuguese coach. "We definitely deserved to win."
  <br>
  <br>
  Ancelotti, who won the Champions League twice as a player and then twice as a coach with Milan, only made one change from the Clasico humiliation, bringing in Luka Modric for Eduardo Camavinga. (AFP)

    Americans in multiple states also voted on the issue of abortion on Tuesday. Voters in Missouri cleared the way to undo one of the nation's most restrictive abortion bans in one of four victories for abortion rights advocates, while Florida defeated a similar constitutional amendment, leaving in place a law barring most abortions after the first six weeks of pregnancy. Abortion rights amendments also passed in Colorado and Maryland.
    <br>
    <br>
    The Missouri and Florida results represent firsts in the abortion landscape, which underwent a seismic shift in 2022 when the US Supreme Court overturned Roe v Wade, a ruling that ended a nationwide right to abortion.

The Associated Press shows Trump narrowly leading in the battleground state of Pennsylvania, which comes with the most electoral votes at 19. He said this was ironic, given that the state has the third largest Puerto Rican population in the US mainland, and that Trump called it a "floating island of garbage".

     "In exit polling, it appears that Trump is actually doing well among Latino voters," Niu said.

        Republicans are nudging ahead in their mission to wrest control of the Senate from the Democrats.

        Trump has called into a Wisconsin radio station to say: “I’m watching these results. So far so good". Harris did phone interviews with radio stations in the battleground states, then visited Democratic National Committee headquarters in Washington carrying a box of Doritos – her go-to snack.
        <br>

        The closeness of the race and the number of states in play raised the likelihood that, once again, a victor might not be known on election night. Trump said on Tuesday that he had no plans to tell his supporters to refrain from violence if Harris wins, because they “are not violent people”. Federal, state and local officials have expressed confidence in the integrity of the nation’s election systems.

             <br>
             <br>
             This would give Harris 27 electoral votes and Trump 105, with both needing to reach 270 to win.

             Here in Hong Kong, the American Chamber of Commerce (Amcham) has organised a watch party for people to see the live results coming in for the US elections.
             <br>
             <br>
             Chamber president Eden Woon says the result will determine how the relationship between China and the United States will move forward – which will have a direct impact on Hong Kong as well.
             <br>
             <br>
             “It is very important for Hong Kong because Hong Kong has a very close trade relationship with the United States. Historically, it has a very good connection with the United States’ civil society and here many people, many businesses have an interest in the United States. So we are also watching to see what happens in this election”, he said.
             <br>
             <br>
             Businessman Mark Wise is one of those at the party. He says while he does not have a personal preference between Trump and Harris, he just wants to see a decisive victory for a new leader that will take the country forward.

             US investigators are looking into apparent hoax bomb threats that were directed at polling locations in four battleground states - Georgia, Michigan, Arizona and Wisconsin as voting was underway.
             <br>
             <br>
             "None of the threats have been determined to be credible thus far," the FBI said in a statement, adding that election integrity was among the bureau's highest priorities.
             <br>
             <br>
             At least two polling sites targeted by the hoax bomb threats in Georgia were briefly evacuated.
             <br>
             <br>
             Georgia's secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, a Republican, blamed Russian interference for the Election Day bomb hoaxes.
             <br>
             <br>
             "They're up to mischief, it seems. They don't want us to have a smooth, fair and accurate election, and if they can get us to fight among ourselves, they can count that as a victory," Raffensperger told reporters.
             <br>
             <br>
             The Russian embassy in Washington said insinuations about Russian interference were "malicious slander."
             <br>
             <br>
             "We would like to emphasize that Russia has not interfered and does not interfere in the internal affairs of other countries, including the United States," the embassy said in a statement. "As President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly stressed, we respect the will of the American people." (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Novak Djokovic said on Tuesday he will not defend his ATP Finals title due to an "ongoing injury" which has ended the 24-time Grand Slam champion's season.
 <br>
  <br>
  Tennis icon Djokovic was one of four players still battling for one of three remaining places at the season-ending event in Turin, which kicks off on Sunday, but said on social media that he wouldn't be making a bid for a third straight Finals title.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I was really looking forward to being there, but due to ongoing injury I won't be playing next week," Djokovic said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Apologies to those who were planning to see me," the statement added. "Wishing all the players a great tournament. See you soon!"
  <br>
  <br>
  The 37-year-old Serb, currently ranked fifth in the world, sits sixth in "The Race", the ATP's annual rankings to determine the eight competitors at the Finals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jannik Sinner, Alexander Zverev, Carlos Alcaraz, Daniil Medvedev and Taylor Fritz had already qualified before Djokovic's announcement.
  <br>
  <br>
  His retirement from the tournament automatically opens up the final three places to Casper Ruud, Alex de Minaur and Andrey Rublev.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ruud and Rublev are playing in Metz, France this week, with De Minaur in action in Belgrade.
  <br>
  <br>
  Djokovic's withdrawal was not a surprise as he had already pulled out of the Paris Masters, effectively ending what has been a difficult season.
  <br>
  <br>
  He hasn't won a single ATP title in 2024, the first time that has happened since 2006, and has been shoved aside by young stars Sinner and Alcaraz at the top of the game.
  <br>
  <br>
  Djokovic did, however, win singles gold at the Paris Olympics, adding the final major honour which was missing from his record-breaking list of career achievements. (AFP)

    Amorim's Sporting stun Man City in Champions League
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<div>
<img alt="Amorim is celebrated by his players at the end of his final home game with Sporting. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1777733_1_20241106075002.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Viktor Gyokeres's hat-trick fired Sporting Lisbon to a stunning 4-1 rout of Manchester City in the Uefa Champions League as Ruben Amorim showed why Manchester United were so keen to lure him to Old Trafford.
 <br>
  <br>
  Sporting manager Amorim accepted United's offer to replace Erik ten Hag,  and will officially take charge of the troubled Premier League club on November 11.
  <br>
  <br>
  Regarded as one of Europe's brightest young managerial minds, the 39-year-old delivered a tantalising glimpse of his acumen as Sporting exposed injury-hit City's defensive weaknesses.
  <br>
  <br>
  Phil Foden put City ahead in the opening moments at the Jose Alvalade stadium, but the visitors wasted a string of chances to increase their lead and Sporting made them pay.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gyokeres equalised before half-time and Maximiliano Araujo bagged Sporting's second after the break before Gyokeres's penalty capped their incredible fightback with two penalties.
  <br>
  <br>
  Erling Haaland squandered a chance to give City a second half lifeline when his penalty hit the bar.
  <br>
  <br>
  Amorim said United fans might think "the new Alex Ferguson has arrived" if his team beat City.
  <br>
  <br>
  After the turbulent end to Ten Hag's reign – he was sacked in October with United languishing in the bottom half of the table – Amorim clearly faces a huge task to restore the club to the glory they enjoyed in the Ferguson era.
  <br>
  <br>
  Comparisons with United's legendary former boss should be shelved for now, but Sporting's spirited victory will have fans counting down the days until his arrival.
  <br>
  <br>
  Amorim, who led Sporting to two Portuguese titles in four years, is set to take charge of his first United game at Ipswich on November 24.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pep Guardiola will get his chance for revenge in Amorim's first Manchester derby at the Etihad Stadium on December 15.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Guardiola has plenty to work on before then as he looks for solutions to City's unexpected three-game losing streak.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We had a fantastic first half, now we are struggling to score. We create and concede when the opponents don't do much," Guardiola said. "At 2-1 down, many things can happen. Emotionally, we were not stable enough – and in this competition, you have to be stable."
  <br>
  <br>
  Premier League champions City suffered a first top-flight defeat of the season against Bournemouth on Saturday, three days after losing to Tottenham in the League Cup.
  <br>
  <br>
  Amid the absences of Rodri, Jack Grealish, Ruben Dias, John Stones and Oscar Bobb, City have lost their momentum in dramatic fashion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Their first defeat in four games in this season's Champions League shouldn't be fatal to their European ambitions, but Guardiola will be desperate for a positive reaction at Brighton on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  City's heaviest defeat since 2020 meant, for only the second time in the Guardiola era, they had suffered three consecutive losses in a single season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sporting, meanwhile, have 10 points from four Champions League games as Amorim leaves them in rude health. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks rose on Tuesday, bouncing back from the prior session's declines in a benign session held as voters went to the polls in the US presidential election.
 <br>
  <br>
  Forecasters have for weeks pointed to a neck-and-neck contest between Vice President Kamala Harris and former president Donald Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  "What the market is saying is that the economy has continued to hold up even in the face of all this uncertainty that we have," said Victoria Fernandez, chief market strategist at Crossmark Global Investments, who pointed to a host of potentially market-moving policy areas affected by the results.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones finished up 1.0 percent at 42,221.
  <br>
  <br>
  The S&P 500 gained 1.2 percent to 5,782, while the Nasdaq jumped 1.4 percent to 18,439.
  <br>
  <br>
  All 11 sectors of the S&P 500 pushed higher, led by consumer discretionary and industrial stocks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Large technology equities also advanced, including Netflix, which won 1.1 percent despite a raid of the company's offices in Paris and Amsterdam on Tuesday as part of a tax fraud probe, according to a judicial source.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Boeing dropped 2.6 percent as a machinist union voted to accept the company's latest contract offer, ending a more than seven week strike that closed two assembly plants in the Seattle area. The new contract includes a 38 percent wage hike. (AFP)

 Queen Camilla, wife of the Britain's King Charles, has been forced to pull out of her planned engagements this week after suffering a chest infection, Buckingham Palace said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Camilla, 77, is resting at home while she recovers but no further details of her illness have been given, as is usual with royal medical issues.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Her Majesty The Queen is currently unwell with a chest infection, for which her doctors have advised a short period of rest," a palace spokesperson said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With great regret, Her Majesty has therefore had to withdraw from her engagements for this week, but she very much hopes to be recovered in time to attend this weekend’s Remembrance events as normal." (Reuters)

    WHO: Over 100 patients in Gaza to be evacuated

<img alt="The medical evacuees will be transported to the Kerem Shalom crossing on Wednesday. File photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1777697_1_20241105210917.jpg&q=30">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The World Health Organization (WHO) said on Tuesday a large-scale medical evacuation was planned from Gaza this week, with more than 100 seriously ill and injured patients due to leave the war-ravaged territory.
 <br>
  <br>
  The WHO said that, alongside its partners, it would evacuate as many as 113 patients on Wednesday, with most going to the United Arab Emirates and some heading to Romania for specialised care.
  <br>
  <br>
  If it goes ahead, it would be the largest evacuation from Gaza since October 2023, according to data from the UN health agency.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rik Peeperkorn, the WHO's representative in the Palestinian territories, said he was hopeful the evacuation would go ahead.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said efforts were currently under way to bring patients from various hospitals across the Gaza Strip to the Gaza European Hospital near Khan Yunis in the south.
  <br>
  <br>
  They will be transported to the Kerem Shalom crossing on early Wednesday and then flown on to the UAE and Romania, Peeperkorn told reporters in Geneva, via video link from Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  Those on the list figure among up to 14,000 people currently waiting in Gaza to be evacuated out of the territory for medical reasons.
  <br>
  <br>
  Around half of them have sustained trauma injuries in the war and the others are suffering from serious illnesses such as cancer, he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since the war in Gaza began following Hamas' deadly October 7, 2023 attack inside Israel, fewer than 5,000 people have been granted medical evacuations out of the territory.
  <br>
  <br>
  Only 282 have meanwhile been able to leave since Israel shuttered Gaza's main Rafah border crossing in early May, Peeperkorn said, adding that around a third of them had been children.
  <br>
  <br>
  Peeperkorn lamented the "ad hoc" access to desperately-needed medical evacuations from Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  "What we need is regular access... which would be properly supported, facilitated and not made unnecessarily dangerous," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We need medical corridors, and the first medical corridor we basically request to be restored is the traditional referral pathway from Gaza to East Jerusalem and the West Bank, and... a second medical corridor to Egypt should be open again, and maybe to Jordan."
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamas's October 7 attack resulted in the deaths of 1,206 people, mostly civilians, according to a tally of Israeli official figures.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel's retaliatory campaign has killed 43,391 people in Gaza, most of them civilians, according to Gaza health ministry figures which the United Nations considers to be reliable. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Labour Department (LD) said it was investigating a fatal industrial incident in Kowloon City in which a worker fell to his death while dismantling scaffolding at a building.
 <br>
  <br>
  The incident happened on Tuesday afternoon, when the man fell onto the canopy on the first floor while dismantling a bamboo scaffold at the external wall of the building on Ma Tau Kok Road.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was declared dead in hospital.
  <br>
  <br>
  The department said it issued suspension notices to the contractors involved and stopped all scaffolding work.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The contractors cannot resume the work until the LD is satisfied that measures to abate the relevant risks have been taken," it wrote in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The department added that it will try to find out what caused the incident and who might be responsible, and take legal actions if there is any violation of work safety legislation.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong Construction Industry Employees General Union expressed regret over the tragedy.
  <br>
  <br>
  It urged employers to provide workers with safety equipment such as full-body safety harness and lifelines to prevent similar cases.

    'Oct saw most non-mainland visitors to HK this year'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Tourism minister Kevin Yeung said on Tuesday that Hong Kong recorded nearly a million arrivals of non-mainland visitors last month, the most so far this year for a single month.
 <br>
  <br>
  He said total visitor arrivals in October topped 4 million, with non-mainland tourists exceeding 950,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  For the first 10 months of the year, tourist arrivals reached 36.6 million, a 37 percent jump from the same period last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a Legco panel meeting, lawmakers discussed the idea of promoting horse-racing tourism, which was included by Chief Executive John Lee in his Policy Address.
  <br>
  <br>
  Third Side councillor Tik Chi-yuen expressed concerns that the move could encourage gambling, especially among the younger generation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeung said the aim is not to encourage people to gamble.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our target is the tourists... Horse-racing is an attractive event in their eyes," the secretary for culture, sports and tourism said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He described the SAR as the only place in the region that can host world-class, distinguished races.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the Kai Tak Sports Park which is set to come into use in the first quarter of 2025, Election Committee councillor Chan Siu-hung asked whether officials can ensure that shops and facilities near the park will enjoy a high usage rate during days when mega events are not being held.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan noted the nearby cruise terminal could go very quiet at times.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeung said you can't compare the two. He said the sports park is a public facility, and individuals and groups can book and use the facilities there on non-game days.

<img alt="Voters cast their ballots in Atlanta. Georgia is seen as a key battleground state for the presidency. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1777693_1_20241105203832.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Election Day voting began in the United States on Tuesday after an extraordinary, and for many unnerving, presidential race that will either make Kamala Harris the first woman president in the country's history or hand Donald Trump a comeback that sends shockwaves around the world.
 <br>
  <br>
  As the first polling stations opened, Democratic vice president Harris, 60, and Republican former president Trump, 78, were dead-even in the tightest and most volatile White House contest of modern times.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bitter rivals spent their final day of the campaign frenetically working to get their supporters out to the polls and trying to win over any last undecided voters in the swing states expected to decide the outcome.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite a series of head-spinning twists in the campaign – from Harris's dramatic entrance when President Joe Biden dropped out in July, to Trump riding out two assassination attempts and a criminal conviction – nothing has broken the deadlock in the opinion polls.
  <br>
  <br>
  Polling stations opened from 6.00am in states including Virginia, North Carolina and New York. Tens of millions of voters are expected to cast their ballots, on top of the more than 82 million people who have already voted early in the preceding weeks.
  <br>
  <br>
  A final outcome may not be known for several days if the results are as close as the polls suggest, adding to the tension in a deeply divided nation.
  <br>
  <br>
  And there are fears of turmoil and even violence if Trump loses, and then contests the result as he did in 2020, with barriers erected around the White House and businesses boarded up in Washington.
  <br>
  <br>
  The world is anxiously watching, as the outcome will have major implications for conflicts in the Middle East, for Russia's war in Ukraine, and for tackling climate change which Trump calls a hoax.
  <br>
  <br>
  Harris and Trump are effectively tied in the seven main swing states: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the eve of the vote, Harris went all-in on the must-win state of Pennsylvania, rallying on the Philadelphia steps made famous in the "Rocky" movie and declaring: "momentum is on our side."
  <br>
  <br>
  However "this could be one of the closest races in history – every single vote matters," cautioned Harris, who was joined by celebrities including Lady Gaga and Oprah Winfrey.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump, who would become the first convicted felon and oldest person to win the presidency, cast himself as the only solution to an apocalyptic vision of the country in terminal decline and overrun by "savage" migrants.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With your vote tomorrow, we can fix every single problem our country faces and lead America – indeed, the world – to new heights of glory," Trump told his closing rally in Grand Rapids in the key swing state of Michigan, after touring North Carolina and Pennsylvania. (AFP)

    'Preserve collective memory of Choi Hung Estate'

<img alt="Wong Tai Sin district councillor Godfrey Ngai says a colourful exterior wall and a basketball court at Choi Hung Estate should be preserved. File photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1777676_1_20241105175551.jpg&q=20">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 District councillors have urged officials to think of ways to keep alive the heritage and collective memory of Choi Hung Estate, which is set to be redeveloped in three phases over about two decades.
 <br>
  <br>
  The first phase of the facelift for the rainbow-themed housing complex, built in the 1960s and famous for its colourful exterior wall and photogenic basketball court, involves three blocks and two vacant school sites.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a Wong Tai Sin district council meeting on Tuesday to discuss the redevelopment plan, councillor Godfrey Ngai said the exterior wall and the basketball court should be preserved.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We propose setting up a Choi Hung museum in the new [Choi Hung] estate, which would include the estate's existing iconic signage, retro vending machines and nostalgic items... This would help preserve the unique features and collective memory of Choi Hung Estate,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another councillor, Deannie Yew, said she is worried about the wall effect, after Secretary for Housing Winnie Ho revealed earlier that the blocks at the future estate will be over 50-storey high.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If each building is going to be 50 storeys high, it would be like a 'giant' in the district because many buildings in the area aren't that tall. In such a densely populated area, wouldn't this potentially create the wall effect?" she questioned.
  <br>
  <br>
  In response, chief architect Tim Li from the Housing Department said a study has already taken the wall effect into consideration, and 50-storey designs are not new.
  <br>
  <br>
  Li added that each redevelopment cycle of Choi Hung Estate would take about seven years, which includes moving residents out, tearing down old buildings and building new foundations.

 Local stocks on Tuesday overcame early losses to finish more than 2 percent higher, thanks partly to fresh confidence towards the Chinese economy.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Hang Seng Index gained 439 points to 21,006, its highest finish in three weeks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Most blue chips and tech plays closed higher.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mainland stocks also did well, finishing at four-week highs, after Premier Li Qiang expressed confidence in the country's economic recovery.

  The Shanghai Composite Index put on 2.32 percent to 3,386 and the Shenzhen Component Index climbed 3.22 percent at 11,006. (Agencies)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A senior Beijing official overseeing Hong Kong affairs on Tuesday said the territory’s economic development has been recognised internationally and that the SAR has unlimited opportunities.
 <br>
  <br>
  Zhou Ji, executive deputy director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, also hailed Chief Executive John Lee’s leadership in supporting the economy, seeking development opportunities and improving people’s livelihoods.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong's economy has continued to expand. Its external economic and trade relations have also continued to improve. And the capital market is full of vitality," Zhou told the China International Import Expo in Shanghai.
  <br>
  <br>
  “These achievements have also been fully recognised and highly praised by the international community.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Citing recent data on the city’s economy and competitiveness, Zhou added that Hong Kong is full of business opportunities and development potential.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also said Beijing would continue to work with different departments to roll out measures beneficial to the SAR, while supporting cooperation between the city and Shanghai.
  <br>
  <br>
  At the same event, Chief Executive John Lee said Hong Kong could become a financing platform for mainland enterprises. He said there are more than 2,000 mainland firms in the city with more than 1,400 listed on the city’s bourse.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Among them were nearly 200 Shanghai companies that had a market value of more than HK$2 trillion. This fully demonstrates that Hong Kong can become an investment and financing platform serving the development of Shanghai and mainland enterprises," Lee said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We welcome more Shanghai and mainland enterprises to use Hong Kong to go global and achieve mutual development."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee led a delegation that included Financial Secretary Paul Chan and commerce minister Algernon Yau to attend the seventh edition of the expo, where he toured the Hong Kong exhibition area and reported to Premier Li Qiang on the city's development.
  <br>
  <br>
  The finance chief, for his part, said Hong Kong is a prime treasury centre with a free flow of capital.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan added that the SAR could facilitate the allocation of funds for mainland firms that set up their headquarters in Hong Kong, while providing tax concessions.

<div class="itemFullText">
 RTHK has learnt that Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office director Xia Baolong will hold a seminar on Hong Kong’s development in Shenzhen on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Sources have suggested Chief Executive John Lee, the director of Beijing’s liaison office Zheng Yanxiong, representatives of Hong Kong’s chambers of commerce and some international firms will participate in the seminar.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last month, Xia met HSBC group chairman Mark Tucker, and expressed the hope that the bank could actively participate in the nation’s high-quality development, and contribute to Hong Kong’s prosperity and development.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xia also met Jardine Matheson’s executive chairman Ben Keswick last week and said he hopes the group could help boost the international community’s understanding of Hong Kong.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Tickets for the upcoming Hong Kong Rugby Sevens – the first to be held at the Kai Tak Stadium – went on sale on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The tournament, scheduled for March 28 to 30, will be among the first major sporting events held at the 50,000-seat stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  Organisers said three-day passes for the tournament – which took place at the Hong Kong Stadium for decades – are priced at HK$1,950 for adults, and HK$950 for children 12 and under.
  <br>
  <br>
  A small amount of single-day tickets are also available via online ticket-seller, Klook, priced at up to HK$1,200.
  <br>
  <br>
  Event organisers Hong Kong China Rugby said prices are frozen at 2019 levels and that a HK$750 pass will grant priority access to the new South Stand and cover a free flow of drinks.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[We hope] the opportunity to be at one of the first events at the stadium, as well as the increased stadium capacity of the venue, will draw thousands of new fans to experience Hong Kong’s biggest party in the city’s biggest stadium," organisers said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tickets for last year’s sevens were sold out for the first time since the end of the pandemic.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Kamala Harris and Donald Trump made their final case on Monday in the hours before Election Day, when voters will either choose America's first woman president or hand the Republican an unprecedented comeback.
 <br>
  <br>
  With polls showing a dead heat, Trump promised to lead the United States to "new heights of glory" while Harris said the "momentum is on our side", as the rivals held their last rallies of the 2024 race in crucial battleground states.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Democratic Vice President finished on a high note in Philadelphia in the must-win state of Pennsylvania, with a rally on the steps immortalised by the boxing movie "Rocky". "This could be one of the closest races in history – every single vote matters," said Harris, who was joined by celebrities, including Lady Gaga and Oprah Winfrey.
  <br>
  <br>
  She also referenced the film, telling thousands of supporters that "here at these famous steps" she was paying "tribute to those who start as the underdog and climb to victory".
  <br>
  <br>
  Harris, 60, has repeatedly said she is the underdog, having only joined the race three months ago after President Joe Biden dropped out. But she insisted she would win.
  <br>
  <br>
  Former president Trump brought several family members up on stage at his closing rally in Grand Rapids, Michigan.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With your vote tomorrow, we can fix every single problem our country faces and lead America – indeed, the world – to new heights of glory," he told the crowd, as the clocks ticked over into Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump, 78, also called on people to turn up on election day, saying his supporters can "put ourselves in a position to win, which we can do very easily if we show up".
  <br>
  <br>
  The world is watching as the outcome will have major implications for conflicts in the Middle East and the war in Ukraine, and for tackling climate change.
  <br>
  <br>
  And with Trump having narrowly survived an assassination attempt in July and police foiling a second alleged plot, the fears of violence are very real.

    Labour group hopes for 5.5 percent pay rise next year

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Federation of Hong Kong and Kowloon Labour Unions on Tuesday urged bosses to give their workers a raise of 5.5 percent next year.
 <br>
  <br>
  The group noted its recent survey of more than 1,100 workers showed that more than six out of ten interviewees got an average pay rise of 4.5 percent this year, while most of the rest saw their salaries frozen.
  <br>
  <br>
  Over half of all respondents said they were unhappy with the salary adjustment, and over 70 percent think their pay should be adjusted based on inflation, the group said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The federation’s chairman Lam Chun-sing said the group had scaled back its expectations compared to last year after looking at factors such as inflation, the business situation and economic growth.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We suggest a salary increase of 5.5 percent, which is a little bit lower than last year because last year we suggested an increase of six percent,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Because last year the inflation was much higher than this year and also this year some of the sectors also face some challenges because of the economic situation.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Lam noted while the transportation sector saw bigger salary increases, some employees in industries like construction and catering faced a salary freeze.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think this is because of the economic situation... Also for the construction industry, some private construction projects are also delayed.”

    Rank outsider Knight's Choice wins the Melbourne Cup

<img alt="Irish jockey Robbie Dolan (left), high fives a fan after riding horse Knight's Choice to victory. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1777635_1_20241105144009.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Rank outsider Knight's Choice upset favourite Buckaroo on Tuesday to win the A$8 million (US$5.25 million) Melbourne Cup, earning Irish jockey Robbie Dolan a debut victory in Australia's "race that stops a nation".
 <br>
  <br>
  The five-year-old Australian-bred gelding came home by a nose in a photo finish ahead of Japanese raider Warp Speed and the Jamie Kah-ridden Okita Soushi in the energy-sapping two-mile handicap at Flemington.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Pinch me, I'm dreaming," said 28-year-old Dolan, a part-time singer who was riding in the famous race for the first time. "It is incredible. I can't believe it. I don't even know what to say."
  <br>
  <br>
  "I didn't know what to expect, but I feel like I've ridden it 10 times because I have ridden it in my head 100 times," he added. "I can't put it into words – it's the biggest race in the world."
  <br>
  <br>
  It was a huge breakthrough for Dolan, who was previously best-known for appearing on The Voice, an Australian singing show.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'll be singing tonight after a few beers," he said, overcome with emotion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Buckaroo, priced as the A$7.00 favourite, finished ninth while the fancied Vauban could only manage 11th on a warm and sunny day, with the track firm.
  <br>
  <br>
  A cultural institution in Australia, the Melbourne Cup has been run since 1861 and is considered so important it is a public holiday in its host state of Victoria.
  <br>
  <br>
  Held in front of a bumper crowd, drinking and socialising took priority over racing for many, with the sound of popping champagne corks accompanying the thundering of hooves.
  <br>
  <br>
  Breaking from barrier six, the John Symons and Sheila Laxon-trained Knight's Choice, an 80-1 shot, settled towards the back of the 23-strong pack behind early leader Just Fine.
  <br>
  <br>
  With 1,000m to go, Just Fine was still ahead but was slowly reeled in down the home straight and finished last, with Knight's Choice surging from 20th at the final turn for a thrilling victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was a second win for Laxon, who became the first woman to train a Melbourne Cup winner in 2001 with Ethereal.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He did, he did," she said, lavishing praise on Dolan. "We didn't give him instructions, he knew what to do."
  <br>
  <br>
  Symons added: "I was worried. He got further back than we talked about, but great ride. What a thrill. What a thrill."
  <br>
  <br>
  Mark Zahra, who rode the last two Melbourne Cup winners – Without a Fight and Gold Trip – was denied a hat-trick aboard Circle of Fire, finishing sixth.
  <br>
  <br>
  And Kerrin McEvoy's bid for a record-equalling fourth win was also unsuccessful, with his horse Absurde fifth. A record four women jockeys took part with Kah faring best on Okita Soushi.
  <br>
  <br>
  Michelle Payne is the only woman rider to win the Melbourne Cup after she steered Prince of Penzance to victory in 2015.
  <br>
  <br>
  There was one withdrawal by stewards before the race started with French import Athabascan found to have an irregular heartbeat, reducing the field to 23. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korea has fined Facebook-parent Meta more than US$15 million for illegally collecting sensitive user information from nearly a million people without consent and sharing it with advertisers, the country's data watchdog said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The firm, which also owns Instagram, ran afoul of laws prohibiting the use of information on political opinions, religious beliefs and people's sex life unless the individual provides explicit consent, Seoul's Personal Information Protection Commission added.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said that the tech giant collected sensitive information from around 980,000 domestic users in South Korea through their Facebook profiles.
  <br>
  <br>
  This included details about their religious beliefs and whether they are in a same-sex relationship.
  <br>
  <br>
  The watchdog said it had confirmed that such information was provided to advertisers by Meta, with around 4,000 advertisers using it.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meta "analysed user behaviour data, including pages liked and ads clicked on Facebook", to create and implement targeted advertising related to "sensitive themes" such as transgender issues, homosexuality and North Korean defectors, officials said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The commission said on Tuesday it had decided to fine Meta 21.6 billion won or US$15.6 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  It added that it "also ordered the company to establish legal grounds for processing sensitive information, implement safety measures, and respond diligently to users' requests for access to their personal data". (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Harry Wilson struck twice in stoppage time to give Fulham a dramatic 2-1 victory over west London rivals Brentford on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Vitaly Janelt had blasted the Bees in front against the run of play midway through the first half.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fulham were frustrated until added time when substitute Wilson flicked home the equaliser and then head in a winner at the death.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was an amazing feeling to come on and get the two goals to win the game. We deserved it, we kept them pinned in throughout," said Wilson.
  <br>
  <br>
  Victory lifts Marco Silva's men up to ninth and just three points off the top four.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brentford had been headed for the top half themselves until the late turnaround, but instead remain in 12th.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fulham failed to make the most of a purposeful start as Reiss Nelson was denied by Mark Flekken.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brentford had barely threatened prior to going in front on 24 minutes when Janelt took aim from distance and fired a blistering shot past Bernd Leno.
  <br>
  <br>
  Emile Smith Rowe wasted a big chance to reply immediately and the home side struggled to break through Brentford's mass ranks of defence after half-time.
  <br>
  <br>
  It took until Fulham's 25th attempt on goal to beat Flekken, as Wilson's inventive effort looped over the Dutch goalkeeper from Adama Traore's cross.
  <br>
  <br>
  Moments later, the Welsh international had a fortuitous second.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wilson's attempted header came off his shoulder to wrong-foot Flekken and flew into the top corner.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They both went in, but not how I would have wanted" Wilson added. "The first one I just helped it on to the back post, and the second one was more lucky." (AFP)

<img alt="Deputy Financial Secretary Michael Wong says he expects airlines to make use of the new runway to introduce new routes. Photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1777615_1_20241105114054.jpg&q=60">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Deputy Financial Secretary Michael Wong on Tuesday said the airport’s three-runway system, which opens on November 28, will strengthen Hong Kong’s status as an aviation hub.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at the Super Terminal Expo, Wong said the Hong Kong International Airport would be able to handle 120 million passengers and 10 million tonnes of cargo annually after the launch of the third runway, more than double the current figures.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the airport currently connects the SAR with nearly 200 global destinations, and that he expects airlines to make use of the new runway to introduce new routes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It will make Hong Kong an even stronger aviation hub and allow us to serve the region and beyond even better. And for you as key stakeholders in the world's aviation and logistics communities, this means Hong Kong will provide you with a lot of business and profit opportunities," Wong said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[The authorities] will proactively engage new and existing aviation partners, and markets in Belt and Road countries, including those in the Middle East and Asean."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Airport Authority said it successfully conducted safety checks at the airport in the past few months.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Airport Authority continues to take forward the preparatory work for the commissioning of the three-runway system, including an aircraft crash and rescue exercise on the Centre Runway in the early hours of October 15," it wrote in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  It added that the airport’s expanded Terminal 2 will be put into service in phases from the end of 2025.

<img alt="Clevand's Darius Garland celebrates in the second half against the Milwaukee Bucks. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1777618_1_20241105115319.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Darius Garland poured in 39 points as the Cleveland Cavaliers fended off a late Milwaukee surge to beat the Bucks 116-114 on Monday and push their perfect NBA record to 8-0.
 <br>
  <br>
  Garland drilled a step-back three-pointer to put Cleveland up 113-111 with 45 seconds to play, then fed Jarrett Allen for a dagger layup as the Cavs, who led by as many as 19 in the second quarter, matched the franchise's best start to a season – also achieved in 1976.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's hard to get one win, so eight is crazy," Garland said. "I'm happy we got eight – we've got to keep this thing going."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Bucks, with two-time NBA Most Valuable Player Giannis Antetokounmpo sitting out with an adductor strain, dropped their sixth straight game – coming up short again after a one-point home loss to the Cavs on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Milwaukee point guard Damian Lillard scored 14 of his 36 points in the third quarter as the Bucks battled back to lead 91-89 heading into the fourth.
  <br>
  <br>
  They pushed the lead to eight points midway through the fourth, but a three-pointer from Garland ignited a 10-0 scoring run that put the Cavs up by two. Lillard would briefly put Milwaukee back in front but the Cavs had enough.
  <br>
  <br>
  Evan Mobley added 17 points and Allen finished with 14 points, 15 rebounds and a massive block on Lillard with eight seconds to play that sealed the win.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We had to fight for 48 minutes," Garland said. "We knew they were going to come out in the second half and try to be more aggressive – it was a great all-around team effort."
  <br>
  <br>
  On a busy night that saw every team in action before a pause for the US presidential election on Tuesday, the Detroit Pistons upset the Los Angeles Lakers 115-103 while the reigning champion Boston Celtics romped past the Hawks 123-93 in Atlanta.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Golden State Warriors welcomed Stephen Curry back from a three-game injury absence with a 125-112 victory over the Wizards in Washington.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Detroit, Cade Cunningham scored 17 points with 11 rebounds and 11 assists for the third triple-double of his career and Jaden Ivey scored 26 points to power the Pistons to their third win of the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Anthony Davis scored 37 points for the Lakers, but appeared to be troubled by a left foot or ankle injury in the fourth quarter.
  <br>
  <br>
  LeBron James scored 20 points with eight rebounds and 11 assists, but the Pistons seized the lead in the first quarter and remained in control the rest of the way.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Warriors led all the way in Washington, with Curry scoring a team-high 24 points in his first game since he tweaked his left ankle on October 27. (AFP)

 Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto will visit China this week, the Foreign Ministry said on Tuesday, on his first foreign tour as he seeks a more prominent position for Jakarta on the world stage.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 73-year-old ex-general's state visit will take place from Friday to Sunday, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Hua Chunying said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prabowo was sworn in on October 20, pledging to stick to Jakarta's traditionally non-aligned foreign policy while making the world's fourth-most populous nation more active abroad.
  <br>
  <br>
  On his first planned foreign visits since taking power, Prabowo will also travel to Peru and Brazil for the Apec and G20 summits.
  <br>
  <br>
  He is also expected to go to the United States and Britain, newspaper Kompas reported last month, citing presidential palace sources.
  <br>
  <br>
  After his February election win, Prabowo used his eight-month transition period to visit more than a dozen countries – including China – to showcase a more active foreign policy than his predecessor Joko Widodo, who focused more on domestic issues like the economy. (AFP)

 North Korea fired a barrage of short-range ballistic missiles into the sea on Tuesday, its neighbours said, as it continued its weapons demonstrations hours before the US presidential election.
 <br>
  <br>
  Japanese Defence Minister Gen Nakatani said at least seven North Korean missiles flew as far as 400 kilometres with a maximum altitude of 100 kilometres.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said they landed in the waters between the Korean Peninsula and Japan.
  <br>
  <br>
  “North Korea’s actions, including a series of repeated missile launches, threaten the peace and safety of Japan, the region and the international community,” Nakatani said.
  <br>
  <br>
  South Korea's military also detected several missile launches by North Korea and subsequently boosted its surveillance posture.
  <br>
  <br>
  The North Korean missiles could be used to target key facilities in South Korea, including US military bases there.
  <br>
  <br>
  The launches came days after North Korean leader Kim Jong-un supervised a flight test of the country’s newest intercontinental ballistic missile designed to reach the US mainland.
  <br>
  <br>
  In response to that launch, the United States flew a long-range B-1B bomber in a trilateral drill with South Korea and Japan on Sunday in a show of force.
  <br>
  <br>
  That drew condemnation from Kim’s powerful sister Kim Yo-jong, who on Tuesday accused North Korea’s rivals of raising tensions with “aggressive and adventuristic military threats.”
  <br>
  <br>
  South Korean officials have said that North Korea was likely to dial up its military displays around the US presidential election to command the attention of Washington.
  <br>
  <br>
  South Korea’s military intelligence agency said last week that North Korea has also likely completed preparations for its seventh nuclear test.
  <br>
  <br>
  Outside officials and analysts say North Korea eventually hopes to use an expanded nuclear arsenal as leverage to win concessions such as sanctions relief after a new US president is elected. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China must combat rising unilateralism by opening up further to trade and investment, Premier Li Qiang said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Li told the opening ceremony of the annual China International Import Expo that the country will look to upgrade its free trade zones and further explore free trade and investment agreements with other countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  “In the face of the current impasses of global development, no one can stay unaffected and no one can solve these problems on their own,” Li said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Only by steadfastly embracing openness and cooperation and working together in unity can we harness the immense strength of all humanity to collectively to foster global development and prosperity.”
  <br>
  <br>
  He also expressed confidence over the nation's ability to meet its growth target and its economic prospects in the coming years.
  <br>
  <br>
  In his speech, Li pointed out there have been many positive developments in the nation’s economy indicating a favourable outlook.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities also had fiscal and monetary tools at their disposal, he added. (Reuters)
