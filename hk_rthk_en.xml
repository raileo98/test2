  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   A local football league match on Sunday kicked off a series of test events at the Kai Tak Sports Park before it officially opens in the first quarter of next year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   About 1,000 spectators streamed into at the Kai Tak Youth Sports Ground for a Second Division League fixture between Sai Kung and Wong Tai Sin.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   One of them was Stephen, an engineer who has worked on the Kai Tak project since five years ago.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Pretty much a bit of professional pride, and proud of what we've built for Hong Kong," he told RTHK.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "[It's] almost there. We're quite excited because it's been five years, and like any other construction projects, it's had its ups and downs. And now we can see it’s almost open."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Another spectator Ivy, who walked from Kowloon City to the stadium, said security was quite strict at the door.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But she was happy to attend the match and support her friend, who’s playing on one of the teams.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "[It's] really exciting. It's huge… My friend is playing football here," she said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Spectators were encouraged to get to the sports ground from Sung Wong Toi - instead of Kai Tak - MTR station.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The MTR Corporation said it had implemented special arrangements at both stations. Plenty of signs were put up pointing passengers to the stadium.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sports minister Kevin Yeung and sports commissioner George Tsim were both spotted at the stadium.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Also in attendance was security chief Chris Tang, who was happy with what he saw so far before the match.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Everything is smooth. When people depart [from] the MTR, there’s sufficient announcements, as well as notice direction showing how they come here," he told RTHK.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We have adopted a phased approach, so at different stages, we have different [arrangements]. On this occasion, apart from making sure that it’s safe, it's also training to our frontline officers, so that's the reason why we are bringing extra officers to come here to make themselves familiar with the environment."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Another event has been scheduled at the Youth Sports Ground in mid-November, as Hong Kong Men's Rugby Team host Brazil for a two-match international series.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The second match will be played in Kai Tak, with an estimated attendance of 3,000 people.

    Subdivided unit residents fear losing their homes

  <img alt="The Sham Shui Po Housing Concern Mothers’ Group says rent of future subdivided flats may go up under a government initiative to wipe out inadequate housing. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1776430_1_20241027160717.jpg&q=65" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   A concern group on Sunday said residents of subdivided flats may be left homeless as the government proposed plans to put an end to inadequate housing.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The chief executive announced plans in the Policy Address to eradicate substandard subdivided units.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A future legislation will mandate the registration of such dwellings as "basic housing units". Each must be no less than eight square metres, or 86 square feet, in size, and fitted with an individual toilet and at least one window.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Units which fail to meet the set of standards will be outlawed. That could be a headache for tenants, who have to relocate elsewhere.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Sham Shui Po Housing Concern Mothers' Group surveyed about 70 residents of subdivided flats following the announcement of the proposal.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   About eight in 10 respondents said they wished to be directly allocated a public flat, instead of moving to temporary solutions such as light public housing, or transitional homes.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   One of them was Amber, who was worried her landlord would evict them in the future because the unit had to be renovated in order to comply with the rules.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The mother of two added possible rehousing plans by the authorities may not be suitable.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Even if they offer us a light public housing flat or transitional housing, I won't consider. The location is far. I'm not familiar with the new environment, and I don't want my children to transfer to another school," she explained.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Another group member, Lily, feared paying higher rent since there's a minimum size for future units.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We hope they can build more public housing flats quickly. Some of us have waited for eight to 10 years," she appealed to the government.

  <img alt="Two special polling stations were set up in Sheung Shui to facilitate Hongkongers returning from the mainland to vote in the 2023 District Council election. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1776411_1_20241027114458.jpg&q=65" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Constitutional and mainland affairs chief Erick Tsang has revealed the government is looking into setting up more polling stations near the border for Hongkongers on the mainland to vote in next year's Legislative Council elections.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The measure was first implemented in 2021, when the city's borders were shut due to Covid. In the end 17,569 voters cast their ballots at Heung Yuen Wai, Lo Wu and Lok Ma Chau checkpoints without having to enter Hong Kong.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   For last December's District Council election, officials allowed eligible voters on the mainland to vote at one of the designated polling stations near the border in Sheung Shui, sparing them a trip to their home district. Almost 10,000 people made use of the arrangement.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "If necessary, we will continue to set up these polling stations, or even enhance and expand [the arrangement], which we are also considering," he told a televised interview on Sunday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "There might be more choices by then, depending on where the site would be, or whether the location would be suitable as a polling station."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Tsang also confirmed the electronic poll register system would remain in use for the upcoming polls.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The system broke down during last year's DC election, causing major delays at certain stations and prompting Electoral Affairs Commission chairman David Lok to issue a teary apology.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Tsang also said there's no need to further amend the current electoral system, saying it's in line with Hong Kong's long-term development.

    FS reiterates need to issue bonds for development

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Sunday said the government will rely more on long-term capital for infrastructure development in the SAR, including the Northern Metropolis.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Speaking on a radio programme, Chan revealed that the government's recurrent expenditure has gone up by HK$4 billion per year to facilitate new Policy Address measures.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Authorities will continue to issue up to HK$130 billion worth of bonds a year to fund various projects. He pointed out that outstanding government bonds make up only 6 percent of Hong Kong's gross domestic product, a level which is very low compared to other parts of the world.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Hong Kong faces economic restructuring, and geopolitical uncertainties.... we need to take preventive measures, and at the same time we need to enhance development to make ourselves secure," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Chan also estimated the government would return to fiscal balance in about three years. One way of achieving that, he said, was to slash expenditure by one percent each year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   On a separate note, the former development minister said authorities must continue to create land, even as the property market remains volatile.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Recalling the early 2000s when authorities froze their land sale programmes and stopped creating land in response to a market downturn, Chan said the impact of those decisions became evident now.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We can better make use of the land in remote places, so prices for properties near the city centre won't be too high, when compared with remote places," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The financial chief's hectic schedule continues with a visit to Saudi Arabia on Monday, just days after returning from the United States.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Writing on his weekly blog, Chan confirmed he will lead a delegation from the financial and innovation and technology sectors to Riyadh, with an aim to promote Hong Kong and explore business opportunities.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   They will attend the Future Investment Initiative conference, and witness the launch of two exchange-traded funds tracking SAR stock indices on the Saudi Exchange.

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Mining giants BHP and Vale have signed a deal with Brazil's government to pay nearly US$30 billion in damages for a 2015 dam collapse that triggered the country's worst environmental disaster.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva attended the signing of the deal over the November 5, 2015 collapse of a tailings dam at a mine in the southeastern town of Mariana, which triggered a giant mudslide.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The river of mud swamped villages, rivers and rainforest, killing 19 people on its way to the sea.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I hope the mining companies have learned their lesson: it would have cost them less to prevent (the disaster), much less," Lula said at the ceremony attended by representatives of Brazil's Vale and Australia's BHP, co-owners of the Brazilian company Samarco that operated the iron mine.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The agreement, which Lula declared to be the biggest environmental payout in modern history, comes on the fifth day of a separate mega-trial in London over BHP's role in the dam's failure.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   More than 620,000 complainants, including 46 Brazilian municipalities and several Indigenous communities, are seeking an estimated 36 billion pounds (US$47 million) in damages in the civil trial.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   BHP denies responsibility.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The company said on Friday that the agreement reached in Brasilia did not end the lawsuits pending against the companies, nor prevent others being taken.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The dam's failure released a torrent of over 40 million cubic meters of highly toxic sludge, the equivalent of 12,000 Olympic swimming pools, which coursed through the Doce River all the way to the Atlantic Ocean, over 600 kilometres away.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Over 600 people were left homeless.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Scientists say the mouth of the Doce River and parts of the southeast Atlantic coastline are still contaminated with metals from the spill, affecting the area's population of fish, birds, turtles, porpoises and whales.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   BHP and Vale had already agreed in 2016 to pay 20 billion reais (about US$3.5 billion at today's rate) in damages, but the negotiations were reopened in 2021 due to what the government called their "non-compliance" and the slow progress of Brazil's justice system in resolving the dispute.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Friday's agreement in Brazil, which is subject to approval by the country's Supreme Court, covers the companies' past and future obligations to assist people, communities and ecosystems affected by the disaster. (AFP)

    G7 meeting takes aim at Russian sanction breaches

  <img alt="In December 2022, the G7, the EU and Australia agreed to pressure purchasers of Russian oil not to breach a price ceiling in a bid to curb Russian petroleum sales and revenues. File photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1776397_1_20241027071814.jpg&q=75" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Finance ministers of the G7 nations vowed on Saturday to step up efforts to prevent Russia from evading sanctions imposed over the war with Ukraine.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We remain committed to taking further initiatives in response to oil price cap violations," the group said in a statement following a meeting in Washington. Those further steps were not spelled out in detail.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In December 2022, the G7 together with the European Union and Australia agreed to pressure purchasers of Russian oil to not go above a certain price ceiling.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The agreement was intended to limit Russian petroleum sales and revenues without curbing exports so sharply that it would cause global oil prices to soar.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But some countries have continued to import Russian crude oil without observing the price ceiling.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The G7 finance ministers also said they would take additional measures aimed at "increasing the costs to Russia of using the shadow fleet to evade sanctions."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Officials say Russia has used its fleet of shadow tankers, many of them old, unmarked and poorly maintained, to skirt sanctions by transporting oil without properly declaring their cargo or itineraries.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The tankers sometimes load or transfer their cargo at sea to avoid unwanted attention.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The United States and the EU have sanctioned several of these ships and their owners, notably Russia's government-owned maritime company Sovcomflot.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The G7 ministers said they intended "to intensify our efforts to prevent financial institutions from supporting Russia's evasion of our sanctions."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   According to the US Office of Foreign Assets Control, Russian financial institutions have developed a network of foreign subsidiaries to facilitate the purchase or sale of sanctioned goods.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Joining the G7 ministers in the meeting on Saturday were the heads of the seven countries' central banks, plus top officials of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The G7, which groups seven of the world's most advanced economies, announced on Friday it had reached an agreement to provide a loan of around US$50 billion to Ukraine.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The loan will be repaid not by Ukraine but with the interest -- roughly US$3 billion a year -- generated by Russian assets seized and frozen after the war began in February 2022. (AFP)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Erling Haaland fired Manchester City to the top of the Premier League as the striker sealed a 1-0 win against Southampton, while third-placed Aston Villa were frustrated by Bournemouth's last-gasp leveller on Saturday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Haaland had gone three league games without a goal but he ended that mini drought in the first half at the Etihad Stadium.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   That was enough to lift Pep Guardiola's side into first place, two points ahead of second-placed Liverpool, who can regain pole position if they win Sunday's blockbuster clash with title rivals Arsenal.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   City have not lost a league game at the Etihad for two years, a run encompassing 35 games, and bottom-of-the-table Southampton, who have only one point from nine games this season, were never likely to shatter that impressive streak.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   With Jack Grealish and Jeremy Doku ruled out, Guardiola made four changes to the team that thrashed Sparta Prague in the Champions League on Wednesday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Haaland had scored an audacious goal against Sparta and while his effort to kill off Southampton was more prosaic, it was arguably far more valuable given the context of a tense title race.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Matheus Nunes' cross reached Haaland in the fifth minute and the Norwegian showed strength and desire to get to the ball ahead of his marker for a close-range strike.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   City spurned several chances to increase their lead but Haaland's 14th goal in all competitions this season gave the unbeaten champions seven wins from nine league matches as they chase a fifth successive title.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The way Southampton played, they are so demanding. Big credit to them, it was not because we were sloppy or flat. I don't have that feeling," Guardiola said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We created chances and unfortunately couldn't score the second. I think we were there and sometimes they are good. We have to accept that."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Aston Villa's hopes of pushing for the title suffered a setback as Bournemouth snatched a 1-1 draw at Villa Park.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Villa are unbeaten in the Champions League, sitting top of the table after seeing off Young Boys, Bayern Munich and Bologna.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But they couldn't follow their latest European success with a domestic victory despite taking the lead in the 76th minute.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Ian Maatsen crossed and Leon Bailey teed up Ross Barkley to hook in his first goal for the club.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But Evanilson rescued Bournemouth with a headed equaliser six minutes into stoppage-time.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Brentford beat fourth-bottom Ipswich 4-3 in a thrilling clash in west London.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Ipswich's Sam Szmodics produced a fine finish from 15 yards in the 28th minute before George Hirst clipped a composed strike past Mark Flekken three minutes later.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But Yoane Wissa netted in the 44th minute and Harry Clarke's own goal seconds later hauled Brentford level.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Bryan Mbeumo's 51st-minute penalty, awarded for Clarke's foul on Keane Lewis-Potter, put Brentford 3-2 up.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Capping a miserable day for Clarke, he was sent off in the closing stages after fouling Lewis-Potter to earn a second booking.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Liam Delap's 86th-minute equaliser appeared to have spared Clarke's blushes, but Mbeumo snatched victory with the last kick of stoppage-time.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Second-bottom Wolves staged a superb fightback to draw 2-2 at fifth-placed Brighton.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Danny Welbeck bagged his sixth goal of the season in first half stoppage-time and Evan Ferguson struck with a clinical finish from Tariq Lamptey's 85th-minute cross to leave Brighton in control.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But Rayan Ait-Nouri got one back three minutes later and Matheus Cunha saved winless Wolves from a sixth successive league defeat with a deflected equaliser deep into stoppage-time.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Everton forward Beto salvaged a 1-1 draw against Fulham as his stoppage-time header cancelled out Alex Iwobi's 61st-minute strike against his former club at Goodison Park.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Although Everton are unbeaten in their last six games, they sit just three places above the relegation zone. (AFP)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   New Zealand made history with their first Test series triumph in India as spinner Mitchell Santner's heroic performance delivered a 113-run win in the second match on Saturday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   New Zealand bowled out India for 245 in their chase of 359 on day three in Pune to take an unbeatable 2-0 lead in the three-match series.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It marks India's first Test series defeat at home since December 2012, when Alastair Cook's England beat them 2-1.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Santner, who's 7-53 in India's first innings of 156 set up the famous win, rattled the Indian chase with six wickets on a turning pitch and trumped the hosts at their own spin game.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The left-hander bowled unchanged from one end, returning figures of 6-104 in 29 overs.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Ajaz Patel took the final two wickets and ended Ravindra Jadeja's resistance on 42 when the batsmen holed out in the deep and New Zealand celebrated to pin drop silence from the stands.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Before Saturday, a visiting New Zealand team had never won a Test series in India dating back to their first trip in 1955.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   India bowled out New Zealand for 255 inside the first hour of play and opener Yashasvi Jaiswal in his 65-ball 77 came out attacking to raise hopes of a miracle.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   India lost skipper Rohit Sharma for eight but raced to 81-1 at lunch in 12 overs.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Santner took down Shubman Gill for 23 soon after the break to end a 62-run second-wicket stand with the left-handed Jaiswal, who powered on after reaching his fifty.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The in-form spinner finally had Jaiswal caught at slip, run out Rishabh Pant for a duck and trapped Virat Kohli lbw, dousing India's chances.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Glenn Phillips chipped in with the wicket of Washington Sundar for 21.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   India spinners Sundar and Jadeja shared seven wickets between them in the second New Zealand innings, with Jadeja claiming three of the five to fall on Saturday morning.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sundar, a lanky off-spinner, returned to the Indian Test team after more than three years and took 7-59.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   New Zealand made 259 in their first innings riding on knocks from Devon Conway (76) and Rachin Ravindra (65) before Santner took charge.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   New Zealand have now won four Tests in India after their opening triumph was the first on Indian soil since 1988.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The series victory comes after New Zealand's recent 2-0 loss in Sri Lanka on a sub-continent tour, which began with a washed-out Test against Afghanistan near New Delhi.
   <br/>

    Death toll from Trami approaches 100 in Philippines

  <img alt="Vast swathes of the Bicol region in the northern Philippines remain under water and many people are still missing or stranded. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1776364_1_20241026201337.jpg&q=90" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Rescuers in the Philippines raced on Saturday to reach people still stranded in areas made inaccessible by flooding from Tropical Storm Trami, which has killed at least 97 people.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Trami battered the main island of Luzon and forced nearly half a million people to flee their homes as heavy rain caused widespread floods and landslides.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In the hardest-hit Bicol region, residents trapped on the roofs and upper floors of their homes were still awaiting desperately needed assistance, officials said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The floods have yet to subside. Calls asking for help are still pouring in," said Bicol regional police director Andre Dizon.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We need to rescue them as soon as possible because starvation can be a problem. We're hearing reports that children are already getting sick."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In the region's Camarines Sur province, food and drinking water were in increasingly short supply as some areas remained completely submerged and difficult to access, he added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   President Ferdinand Marcos visited the province on Saturday to inspect the damage.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Our main problem here is that many areas are still flooded," he told government officials during a briefing.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We have flood control systems but the amount of water is unmanageable. This is climate change. This is all new, so we have to come up with new solutions too," Marcos added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Trami's death toll rose on Saturday as rescuers retrieved more bodies from floodwaters and landslide sites, mostly from the Bicol region and Batangas province, south of Manila.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Police have recorded 36 deaths in Bicol, most due to drowning.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The number of confirmed dead in Batangas has risen to 54, provincial police chief Jacinto Malinao said, with at least 21 people missing.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Two were reported dead in separate incidents of electrocution and drowning in Cavite province, police said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Five more deaths have been confirmed in other provinces, bringing the total to 97, according to a tally based on official police and disaster agency sources.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In Batangas, two hours south of the capital, rescuers were using backhoes and shovels to dig through mud as high as three metres in a desperate search for the missing in areas hit by landslides.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Cadaver-sniffing dogs have also been deployed to assist the operations.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Reporters who visited the province on Friday saw roads blocked by felled trees, vehicles half-submerged in mud and homes severely damaged by flash flooding.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We are still hoping for the best," said Malinao, the police chief.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We will not stop until all bodies are retrieved."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The national disaster agency said on Saturday that about 495,000 people have been displaced by the flooding, which has submerged hundreds of villages in swathes of the northern Philippines. (AFP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   A suicide bomber detonated at a checkpoint in western Pakistan on Saturday, killing eight people and wounding five more, officials said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The bomber set off the blast from the back of a motorbike rickshaw near the town of Mir Ali in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, a local police officer said on condition of anonymity.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Four police officers were killed alongside two members of a state paramilitary force and two civilians in the attack near the border with Afghanistan, he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Pakistan has seen an increase in militancy since the Afghan Taliban returned to power in 2021, with Islamabad claiming hostile groups are now using the neighbouring country for shelter.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Among the five injured personnel, the condition of three is critical, and they have been transferred to a local military hospital," the police officer said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A local government official who also did not want to be named confirmed the same toll of dead and wounded.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The attack was claimed by a little-known militant group calling itself "Aswad ul-Harb."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Another checkpost near the Afghan border was raided this week by the Pakistani Taliban, killing 10 police officers.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Last year, the country saw more suicide attacks than any year since 2014, according to the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   There were 29 suicide attacks registered, killing 329 people in Pakistan's deadliest year in a decade. (AFP)

  <img alt="The war in Sudan has killed tens of thousands of people, with some estimates of 150,000 dead. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1776361_1_20241026191325.jpg&q=90" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   At least 50 people have been killed in a single attack by Sudanese paramilitaries who have besieged and raided villages in al-Jazira state, activists said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) have been at war with Sudan's regular army since April 2023 but have in recent days intensified their violence against civilians in al-Jazira, south of the capital Khartoum, after their commander in the state defected to the army.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The villages of al-Sariha and Azraq have been under attack" since Friday morning, the resistance committee in Hasaheisa, one of the hundreds of volunteer groups coordinating aid in Sudan, said in a statement late on Friday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In al-Sariha alone, the attack killed 50 and wounded more than 200, the resistance committee added, reporting a total "inability to evacuate the wounded from the village due to the shelling and snipers" from the RSF.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   With a near-total communications blackout, tolls are impossible to verify and often hard to gather.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The resistance committee said that the nearby village of Azraq had been placed under a "total siege, suffering the same violations as al-Sariha," although it was not possible to provide a death toll.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   On Friday, the Sudanese doctors' union called on the United Nations to press for safe humanitarian corridors into villages that "are facing genocide at the hands of the Rapid Support militia."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The doctors' union added that rescue operations had become impossible and that "the army is incapable of protecting civilians."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   According to medical sources in several villages, nearly all health facilities capable of receiving emergency cases have been forced shut.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The war in Sudan has killed tens of thousands of people, with some estimates of 150,000 dead.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It has also caused what the UN calls the world's largest displacement crisis, with more than seven million uprooted.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In June, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the United States ambassador to the UN, said Sudan is the planet's "largest humanitarian crisis."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Famine was declared in July in the Zamzam camp for displaced people near the town of El-Fasher, in Sudan's western Darfur region bordering Chad.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Last Sunday the army announced that the RSF's al-Jazira commander Abu Aqla Kaykal had abandoned the paramilitaries, bringing "a large number of his forces" with him, in what it said was the first high-profile defection to its side.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Activists reported at least 20 people killed in subsequent paramilitary attacks in eastern al-Jazira. They also said an air strike by the Sudanese Armed forces on a mosque in the state capital, Wad Madani, killed 31 people.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   On Thursday, neighbouring Chad denied helping to arm the paramilitaries after the governor of Sudan's Darfur region, Minni Minnawi, accused them of doing so.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Chad has no interest in amplifying the war in Sudan," said Chadian Foreign Minister Abderaman Koulamallah, pointing out that Chad was "one of the rare countries upon which this war has had major repercussions."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sudanese authorities have previously charged that Chad was facilitating the delivery of weapons from the United Arab Emirates to Sudan, which both Chad and the UAE have denied.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The International Monetary Fund's director for Africa, Catherine Pattillo, said this week that the war in Sudan was likely to cause heavy economic damage to its already struggling neighbours.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "And then to be confronted with the refugees, the security issues, the trade issues, is very challenging for their growth," she said. (AFP)

   The Observatory has cancelled all typhoon signals at 12:20 am on Sunday as Trami continued to move westwards away from Hong Kong.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It had issued the Strong Wind Signal Number 3 at 10:40 am, after Trami intensified into a typhoon, skirting to the south of Hong Kong at a distance of about 500 kilometres.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Observatory said winds will be strong offshore and on high ground overnight and in the morning.

   Members of the public are advised to stay away from the shoreline and remain on alert.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It is expected that Trami will linger and weaken over the coast of central Vietnam today and tomorrow. It may then turn eastward, moving across the central part of the South China Sea again.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Observatory will closely monitor its movement.

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The 56-member Commonwealth agreed the "time has come" for discussions about the legacy of the "abhorrent" transatlantic slave trade on Saturday, in a landmark joint statement that raised the prospect of future reparations.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Gathering for a summit in Samoa, leaders held lengthy and occasionally tense talks over one of the most sensitive aspects of their shared and troubled past.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The bloc brings together Britain and most of its former colonies, many of which are still scarred by the brutal trade that saw an estimated 10-15 million slaves ripped from Africa over four centuries.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   African, Caribbean and Pacific nations have pressed for Britain – and other European powers – to pay financial compensation for slavery, or to make political amends.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In a closing statement, Commonwealth leaders noted calls for "reparatory justice" for the "abhorrent" transatlantic trade and agreed that "the time has come for a meaningful, truthful and respectful conversation."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   While Britain and other colonial powers have occasionally apologised for slavery in broad terms, they have baulked at the idea of paying financial reparations, which could come with a hefty price tag.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   During the summit, London tried to avoid making explicit commitments, while trying to prove the Commonwealth was still relevant and could work together.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The meeting's conclusion was delayed for hours as leaders and officials tried to hammer out a compromise.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   That compromise text may stop short of what some former colonies wanted.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The time has come to have a real dialogue about how we address these historical wrongs," Prime Minister Philip Davis of the Bahamas told the summit.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The horrors of slavery left a deep, generational wound in our communities, and the fight for justice and reparatory justice is far from over."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But experts said the summit could be historic nonetheless.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The commitment to conversations on reparatory justice wedges open the door for dialogue," said Kingsley Abbott, of the University of London's Institute of Commonwealth Studies.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The Commonwealth" he said, "should see this as an opportunity to lead on a potentially historic process, and to do so with vision and courage."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   For Britain – still staking out its place in the world after empire and leaving the European Union – the summit had high stakes.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Among the delegates were Prime Minister Keir Starmer and King Charles, his first summit as monarch and as head of the Commonwealth.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The British royal, whose family benefited from the slave trade over centuries, had faced calls to apologise personally.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He stopped well short of that on Friday, asking delegates to "reject the language of division."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I understand, from listening to people across the Commonwealth, how the most painful aspects of our past continue to resonate," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "None of us can change the past. But we can commit, with all our hearts, to learning its lessons and to finding creative ways to right inequalities that endure."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Charles left to return to London before the final summit communique had been agreed.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Commonwealth leaders found more common cause on the "existential" issue of climate change.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   They agreed to an "Ocean Declaration," which recognises national maritime boundaries even if sea levels continue to rise.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   They also agreed to protect at least 30 percent of the ocean and to restore at least 30 percent of degraded marine ecosystems by 2030.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "What the ocean declaration seems to do and to say is that once your marine boundaries are fixed, they are fixed in perpetuity," said outgoing Commonwealth Secretary-General Baroness Patricia Scotland.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Commonwealth leaders also agreed to name Ghana's foreign minister Shirley Ayorkor Botchwey as the new secretary general.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A former lawmaker, she has served as foreign minister for the past seven years, notably steering Ghana's two-year tenure on the UN Security Council, ending December 2023.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   She has backed the drafting of a free trade agreement among Commonwealth member states and has previously said she stands for reparations.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Truly humbled by the overwhelming support of the Commonwealth Heads of Government in selecting me as the incoming Secretary-General of the Commonwealth" she posted on social media.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The work indeed lies ahead!" (AFP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   The All Blacks crushed Eddie Jones's Japan 64-19 in a one-off Test in Yokohama on Saturday as the visitors scored 10 tries in a routine victory.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The match was the first in an All Blacks tour that will see them take on England, Ireland, France and Italy on successive weekends.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Japan drew first blood with Fiji-born winger Jone Naikabula steaming in to touch down by the posts in the fifth minute.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   New Zealand hit back when Mark Tele'a rampaged down the left wing and scored in the corner. Captain Patrick Tuipulotu then held off three tackles to bundle over the line before Damian McKenzie converted to make it 14-7.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Japan bounced back immediately, attacking off a line-out, punching holes in the defence before loose forward Faulua Makisi crashed through a wide gap off a close-range ruck.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Japan lock Warner Dearns thought he had put the hosts back in front, taking a lucky bounce to break clear and gallop over the line, only for the try to be disallowed.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Then the floodgates opened for New Zealand with Billy Proctor, Sam Cane, Samipeni Finau and Pasilio Tosi all going over the line, the latter after a barnstorming run by hooker Asafo Aumua to make it 36-12.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Just before the break the All Blacks packs smashed their way over the line with Tamaiti Williams grounding the ball off the back of a maul and McKenzie converting to make it 43-12 at halftime.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Cam Roigard opened the scoring in the second half and took the visitors over the 50-point mark in the 44th minute after being let fly by hooker Aumua.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Japan managed to give the scoreboard operators a respite, repeatedly pinning the now sloppy All Blacks in their 22, but not breaching the wall of the New Zealand defence.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   All Blacks attacks were frequently blunted and Japan again and again looked the more likely to score, but handling errors and New Zealand turnovers frustrated their efforts.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In the 67th minute, Yoshitaka Yazaki made a blistering run down the right but to the agony of the full-capacity Nissan stadium was brought down just short by McKenzie.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Seconds later however Japan's reserve prop Uwe Helu, on his debut, scored the hosts' third try and a successful conversion.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   All Blacks replacement back Ruben Love, on debut, claimed two late tries in three minutes off the bench as the Japanese defence faded. (AFP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   The Observatory said on Saturday that the Strong Wind Signal No. 3 will stay in place at least until 10 pm, adding that local winds are expected to strengthen with a few squally showers in Hong Kong, as the winds veer to the east later on.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   However, it expects the winds to ease off gradually on Sunday morning as Trami leaves.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Earlier, the forecaster had issued the Strong Wind Signal No. 3 at 10.40 am on Saturday, after Trami intensified into a typhoon in the morning, skirting to the south of Hong Kong at a distance of about 500 kilometres.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Education Bureau said kindergartens and schools for children with physical and intellectual disabilities were suspended for the day.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The organiser of the Hong Kong Food Carnival said the event has been postponed due to the typhoon.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Tourism Commission said the light-and-sound show, "A Symphony of Lights", will be cancelled.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Harbour Lounge at the Hong Kong Wine & Dine Festival is also closed, but the doors of the festival remain open as usual.

  <img alt="Shigeru Ishiba could become Japan's shortest-serving prime minister in the post-war period. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1776354_1_20241026180240.jpg&q=99" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Candidates in Japan's super-tight election made last-ditch appeals to voters on Saturday, with opinion polls suggesting the ruling coalition might fall short of a majority.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Such a bombshell outcome in Sunday's vote would be the worst result for the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) since 2009, and potentially a knockout blow to Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Ishiba – a fan of trains, 1970s pop idols and making model ships and planes – only last month took the helm of the LDP, which has governed Japan for almost all of the past seven decades.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   After a tough internal contest, the 67-year-old former defence minister became premier on October 1. Days later, he called the snap parliamentary elections, promising a "new Japan."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Ishiba pledged to revitalise depressed rural regions and to address the "quiet emergency" of Japan's falling population through family-friendly policies such as flexible working hours.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But he has since rowed back his position on issues including allowing married couples to take separate surnames.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He also named only two women ministers in his cabinet.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Rising prices have rankled voters, and also dogging Ishiba is the fallout from a party slush fund scandal that helped sink his predecessor, Fumio Kishida.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A poll on Friday by the Yomiuri Shimbun daily suggested that the LDP and its coalition partner Komeito might struggle to get the 233 lower house seats needed for a majority.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Ishiba has set this threshold as his objective, and missing it would undermine his position in the LDP and mean finding other coalition partners or leading a minority government.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Local media speculated that Ishiba could potentially even resign immediately to take responsibility, becoming Japan's shortest-serving prime minister in the post-war period. (AFP)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Pakistan sealed a memorable Test series win as they thrashed England by nine wickets on Saturday after Noman Ali and Sajid Khan delivered a spin masterclass.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Noman and Sajid knocked over all 10 England wickets to dismiss the visitors for 112 before Pakistan raced to victory in Rawalpindi before lunch on day three of the third Test.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Shan Masood hammered five boundaries in six balls, launching Shoaib Bashir over the ropes to complete a resounding victory, his first series triumph as captain.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Noman finished with figures of 6-42 and Sajid 4-69 after England resumed the day on 24-3 but were dismissed in 37.2 overs for their lowest total in Pakistan.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   England won the first Test by an innings and 47 runs while Pakistan took the second by 152 runs, both in Multan.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Pakistan lost opener Saim Ayub for eight but Masood's six-ball 23 not out ended the match.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Pakistan captain had lost his previous two series in charge – 3-0 to Australia and 2-0 to Bangladesh – since being appointed last year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Noman and Sajid were brought into the line-up after England destroyed the hosts in the first Test in Multan by an innings and 47 runs.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The duo have knocked over 39 wickets between them in the subsequent two Tests, turning what looked like an easy England series victory Pakistan's way.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Joe Root top-scored with 33 while none of the other England batters could last long enough to stop Pakistan's charge towards a first home series win since beating South Africa in February 2021.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   England's previous lowest total was 130 in Lahore in 1987.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   England's fate was sealed once Noman dismissed overnight batsman Harry Brook caught behind by Mohammad Rizwan for 26 and skipper Ben Stokes leg-before for three.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Stokes once again fell in bizarre fashion as he offered no stroke to a Noman delivery, expecting it to go down the leg side but it struck him in front of the stumps.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The England skipper, who missed the first Test with a hamstring injury, managed just 53 runs in four innings.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sajid made it 6-75, dismissing Jamie Smith who tried to hit him out of the ground only to miss the ball and lose his stumps for three.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Noman completed his sixth five-wicket haul when Root edged a sharp turning delivery to Rizwan, quashing all hopes of an England fightback.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sajid dismissed Rehan Ahmed for seven while Noman wrapped up the innings with the wicket of Jack Leach, bowled for ten. (AFP)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Secretary for welfare Chris Sun on Saturday said it’s not necessary to disclose every violation that happens at care homes, saying it depends on the severity of individual incidents.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Social Welfare Department has issued warnings to 15 care homes for persons with disabilities, in the past year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   One of them was issued to Hong Chi Association in August, which operates a care home in Tai Po.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A 38-year-old staff member from the facility has been charged on suspicion of sexually assaulting two residents while on duty.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The case was confirmed by the Social Welfare Department on Wednesday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Speaking to reporters, Sun said the standard procedure for the department is to upload the issuance of warnings to its website.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He said it’s not necessary to share details of every case to the public.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “It depends on the severity of individual violations as well as social awareness. These are judgments we need to make. For example, regarding the Hong Chi case, of course we think the incident was serious, and society is highly concerned, so we believe it’s necessary to explain to the public the details of the case,” he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “Some other violations are really about technical problems. For such violations, we just follow procedures that we think are suitable.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sun reiterated that he doesn't think it's wrong to delay the announcement for two months, adding that officials want to make sure the alleged victims and their families are in a stable emotional state and will not experience further harm.

   The two giant pandas presented to Hong Kong by the central government - An An and Ke Ke - have completed their month-long isolation period.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Ocean Park said on Saturday that the pair's health conditions have met the requirements of the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But it will take at least another 30 days before the public can meet the pandas, as they are still adapting to their new home.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The park revealed that the duo enjoy tailor-made facilities at their habitats.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Separately, the public is invited to suggest new names for the giant pandas until tomorrow. Participants have to submit their proposals along with a 100-word explanation.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A drawing competition for people to portray the pandas will last until November 8.

    'Market drives the site for gold storage facilities'

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury Christopher Hui said on Saturday that gold storage facilities do not have to be located at the airport.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The government unveiled in the Policy Address last week that it hopes to build an international gold trading market by promoting the development of world-class gold storage facilities.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The capacity of the gold vault at the city's international airport stands at 150 tonnes, and the Airport Authority announced that it is finalising the expansion plan of precious metal depository in line with the government's initiative.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   However, speaking on an RTHK radio programme, Hui said storage facilities do not have to be sited at the airport.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Of course, the airport has an innate advantage, because it's safe and secure. In terms of planning, it also allows us to get a better idea of the quantity and scale involved, because the plot of land is relatively level," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "But can we say that other sites can't be used as storage facilities? I don't think so. It's mainly driven by the market, and whether we could meet the storage requirements."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Hui also revealed that he will set up a working group to review the drive of world-class storage facilities in the region, by the end of this year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   While Hong Kong has always been a distribution centre for gold, apart from import and export of the precious metal, Hui hopes the city can make a breakthrough in trading as well as prices of gold.

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Freddie Freeman described his walk-off grand slam as a dream come true on Friday after helping the Los Angeles Dodgers snatch a jaw-dropping World Series game one victory over the New York Yankees.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Freeman's 10th-inning blast - the first ever walk-off grand slam in a World Series game - was the latest improbable twist to what has been a roller-coaster season for the 35-year-old first baseman.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Freeman, an avid student of the game, was delighted to learn he had etched his name into baseball history with his winning homer.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "That's pretty cool," Freeman said. "Obviously it's kind of amazing. When you get told you do something like that in this game that's been around a very long time -- I love the history of this game, to be a part of it, it's special.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I've been playing this game a long time, and to come up in those moments, you dream about those moments even when you're 35 and been in the league for 15 years, you want to be a part of those."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The fact that Freeman has made it to the postseason is a minor miracle in itself after a challenging year beset by injuries, all overshadowed by a serious illness for his three-year-old son, Max.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   An emotional Freeman returned to play later that month but then saw his postseason hopes clouded by a serious ankle sprain in late September that left him barely able to run.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   After celebrating his walk-off with team-mates, Freeman sprinted over to the seats behind home plate to share a moment with his father.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "He's been throwing me batting practice since I can remember," Freeman said. "My swing is because of him. My approach is because of him. I am who I am because of him. It was kind of spur of the moment."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Dodgers manager Dave Roberts meanwhile believed that Freeman's moment of glory was just reward for one of the most popular players in baseball.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The game honors you, and when you do things the right way, you play the right way, you're a good team-mate, I just believe that the game honors you," Roberts said. "Tonight Freddie was honored. (AFP)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Secretary for transport Lam Sai-hung on Saturday said the bureau will do all it can to cope with the series of test events to be held at the Kai Tak Sports Park.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The first test event will take place on Sunday, featuring a youth football match with about 1,000 invited spectators.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   There will be no parking or drop-off areas available at the Sports Park and people were urged to use MTR to enter the area.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Writing on his official blog, Lam noted that the bureau is aware of the broad public's concerns about transport arrangements for the sports park during large-scale events.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He said the government anticipated many spectators will use the Kai Tak Station and Sung Wong Toi Station to access the park, stressing that the MTR will strengthen services on the Tuen Ma line and Kwun Tong line based on actual needs and circumstances.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lam said there are also plenty of nearby buses connecting all parts of Hong Kong near the park and bus operators will launch special bus routes to cope with special transportation needs during major events.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He added that the transport bureau‘s emergency coordination centre will work closely with other governmental departments and public transport operators to monitor the situation and issue timely updates to the public.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Hong Kong Rugby Sevens, scheduled to take place from March 28 to 30 in 2025, is expected to be the first major event to be held at the Sports Park.

    Expansion of '1+' mechanism to lift healthcare quality
   </title>

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The Secretary for Health emphasised that the expansion of the "1+" mechanism will not affect the quality of medicine.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Starting next month, the mechanism will cover all new drugs, including vaccines and advanced therapy products. Currently, it only includes new drugs for treating life-threatening or severely debilitating diseases.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Speaking on a Commercial Radio programme on Saturday, Lo Chung-mau pointed out that the relaxation only changes the mode of approval, not the requirements for approval.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He believes the move will elevate the region's healthcare standard - the reason being that Hong Kong-registered drugs can be used in designated health institutions on the mainland, even if they have not been registered there.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We will be able to, one, allow patients in Hong Kong and even in the Greater Bay Area to enjoy more advanced therapy products or new drugs...with the improvement of healthcare standard in the whole area."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Two, with more choices, the cost of these new treatment drugs or advanced therapy products will be lowered. Thirdly, it will promote the development of R&D - research and development - in the area."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lo pointed out that the move will be attractive for pharmaceutical companies, as they can enjoy access to a bigger market.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Once the drug or device gets approved and registered in Hong Kong and is in-use at public hospitals, it will have a 'green channel' for use in the 86 million population of the GBA."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Meanwhile, Chief Executive John Lee voiced his support towards building a third medical school by local universities, in his third policy blueprint.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The health chief said it's "definitely good" to have one more medical institute, but warned that if the third medical institute is not up to scratch, it may affect the quality of the current two schools.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We have to be cautious, because a medical school involves a lot of resources, not just capital, for medical training, such as professors...a teaching hospital, and even patients. Because teaching is not only held in classrooms, we need medical cases to do so."

    Crime up slightly in first nine months of 2024

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Police Commissioner Raymond Siu on Saturday unveiled that Hong Kong recorded 70,015 crimes in the first nine months of the year, marking a 4.8 percent increase from the same period last year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The rise mainly comes from a surge in fraud, theft and blackmail cases.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Former police chief Andy Tsang’s home in Tai Po was recently burglarised, with reports saying that over HK$100,000 worth of items were stolen.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   On a Commercial Radio programme, Siu mentioned that burglary cases saw a 50 percent year-on-year increase in the first quarter.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He noted the force had since enhanced prevention measures, leading to a decline in such crimes in the first nine months, when compared with last year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We have strengthened patrols, especially on village houses and detached homes. We have also done more intelligence gathering, and we're using technology as well. We use drones from the Government Flying Service to monitor remote areas to identify if there are suspicious persons,” he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “Moreover, we have enhanced communication with residents, and urged them to report to the police immediately if they spot any suspicious activities. All these measures have led to a noticeable improvement.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Siu noted there were 32,120 fraud cases in the first nine months of the year, 2,470 more compared with the same period last year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He highlighted that the surge primarily came from a new method of deception, where scammers pretend to be customer service representatives at e-commerce stores.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The police chief went on to say that the force had implemented targeted promotions and initiatives aimed at combating these types of fraud crime in the past few months, leading to a monthly decline in figures since July.

   The Observatory has issued the Strong Wind Signal No. 3 at 10.40am on Saturday and said it will remain in force for most of the day.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The forecaster said Trami intensified into a typhoon this morning, skirting to the south of Hong Kong at a distance of about 500 kilometres.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Education Bureau said kindergartens and schools for children with physical and intellectual disabilities would be suspended for the day.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Social Welfare Department said all child-care centres, facilities providing after-school care programmes, elderly services centres, rehabilitation units as well as day activity centres, will remain open during normal operating hours.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The organiser of the Hong Kong Food Carnival said the event has been postponed due to the typhoon, noting that the carnival will be cancelled for the rest of the day if Signal No. 3 remains in force after 1pm.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Tourism Commission said the light-and-sound show, "A Symphony of Lights", will be cancelled.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Habour Lounge at the Hong Kong Wine & Dine Festival is also closed under the strong wind signal number 3, but the doors of the festival remain open as usual.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Observatory said the Strong Wind Signal No. 3 will stay in place at least until 10pm, adding that local winds are expected to strengthen with a few squally showers in Hong Kong, as the winds veer to the east later on.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   However, it expects the winds to ease off gradually on Sunday morning as Trami leaves.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Israel announced the launch of "precise strikes" on military targets in Iran on Saturday, in retaliation for attacks against it, as Iranian state media reported several explosions around the capital.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "In response to months of continuous attacks from the regime in Iran against the State of Israel - right now the Israel Defense Forces (Israeli military) is conducting precise strikes on military targets in Iran," the military said in a statement.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Israel had vowed, following Iran's October 1 missile attack, to hit back.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Hostilities between Iran and Israel soared since Israel launched it's offensive in Gaza last October, which has so far killed over 42,000 Palestinians.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Israel has since broadened the scope of its operations to Lebanon, vowing to secure its northern border after nearly a year of cross-border attacks by Lebanese group Hezbollah.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Our defensive and offensive capabilities are fully mobilised," the Israeli military said in a statement.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Military spokesman Daniel Hagari in a separate statement called on the people to be "alert and vigilant".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Iranian state television said on Saturday "strong explosions" were heard around the capital, though it did not specify the cause of the blasts.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Minutes ago, the sound of strong explosions were heard from around Tehran, the source of these sounds is not yet clear," a state TV presenter said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Iranian media said no fire or explosions had been reported at a main oil refinery near Tehran.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The United States said strikes by its ally Israel on military targets in Iran are "an exercise of self-defence" following the attack earlier this month.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In a possible indication of the scope of Saturday's strike, Syrian state news agency SANA said Syrian air defences had intercepted what it described as "hostile targets" near the capital city, Damascus.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Our anti-aircraft defence is confronting hostile targets in the skies around Damascus," SANA said on Telegram.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It also reported "sounds of explosions" in the vicinity of Damascus, though the origin of those blasts was unclear. (AFP)

   The Observatory says it will issue the Strong Wind Signal No. 3 at 10.40am as Severe Tropical Storm Trami skirts the SAR.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Education Bureau said kindergartens and schools for children with physical and intellectual disabilities would be suspended for the day.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Observatory said local winds are expected to pick up gradually in Hong Kong as the winds veer to the east later on, and some places which were previously sheltered become exposed.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   However, it expects the winds to ease off gradually on Sunday morning as Trami leaves.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It said Trami was an estimated 560 kilometres south of Hong Kong, and is forecast to move across the South China Sea in the direction of the waters south of Hainan Island.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   The Nasdaq ended higher on Friday, driven by megacap shares, as investors awaited quarterly results from some of Wall Street's biggest companies next week.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Tesla shares rose 3.36 percent a day after surging 22 percent on the electric vehicle maker's sales forecast. Amazon, Apple and Microsoft also rose.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Tesla numbers helped rekindle some optimism of investors that the Magnificent Seven rally is not over," said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He was referring to the group of interest rate-sensitive technology stocks which have surged on enthusiasm for artificial intelligence. Chip heavyweight Nvidia gained, briefly overtaking Apple as the world's most valuable company based on its shares.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The benchmark 10-year Treasury note yield edged higher as investors awaited US employment data next week for clues on the likely path of Federal Reserve interest rate cuts. Earlier this week, the yield reached a three-month high of 4.26 percent, weighing on the stock market.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.61 percent to 42,114. The S&P 500 lost 0.03 percent to 5,808, and the Nasdaq composite gained 0.56 percent, to 18,518.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Dow was dragged down by banking shares, with Goldman Sachs down 2.27 percent, and it was also hit by a 2.97 percent fall in fast-food chain McDonald's, which has been hit by an E. coli outbreak linked to its hamburgers.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Banks have rallied as (US presidential candidate Donald) Trump's odds (of winning) increased, so it seems investors are taking some profits," said Michael Rosen, chief investment officer at Angeles Investments.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Regional lender New York Community Bancorp dropped 8.26 percent after reporting its fourth straight quarterly loss, primarily due to its commercial real estate loans.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Continued uncertainty around the US election has made investors cautious.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Equities have been unsettled this week by a rapid rise in yields as bets on rate cuts by the Fed unraveled on expectations of a stronger economic outlook.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Only the Nasdaq closed the week with gains. The tech-heavy index rose 0.16 percent, while the S&P fell 0.96 percent and the Dow sank 2.68 percent. (Reuters)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   A man whose home had to be demolished because of coastal erosion lost a landmark legal claim on Friday against the UK government that accused it of failing to meet obligations to protect citizens from the effects of climate change.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Kevin Jordan, whose seaside home on the Norfolk coast in eastern England had to be knocked down, was one of two private claimants who brought the case, along with environmental campaign group Friends of the Earth.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Co-claimant Doug Paulley, a disability activist, lives in a care home in northern England and says hotter summers affect his health and puts him at increased risk of serious harm.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   They both claimed the government's climate adaptation aims policy, drawn up by the previous Conservative government, failed to comply with the country's 2008 Climate Change Act.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The claim also said the policy failed to assess impacts on protected groups under equality law and that it breached the human rights of the two individual claimants due to the lack of provision for the specific risks they faced.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But a judge at the High Court in London ruled on Friday that the government's plans were lawful – a decision described by Jordan as "extremely disappointing."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Friends of the Earth said its legal team will "study the detail of this judgement before we decide whether to lodge an appeal."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "A robust and comprehensive adaptation plan is urgently needed to help protect us from increasingly severe storms, floods and heatwaves – particularly marginalised groups, such as older and disabled people, and those living in areas most at risk from climate change," it added, urging the new Labour government to act. (AFP)

  <img alt="The bank directly blamed high government spending for inflation and said it could hike rates yet again if the pace of price rises does not cool. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1776235_1_20241025202739.jpg&q=80" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Russia's central bank hiked interest rates to 21 percent on Friday, taking borrowing costs to their highest level in more than 20 years amid surging inflation.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The rise takes rates above an emergency level introduced in February 2022 – just after Moscow ordered troops into Ukraine – and to their highest since 2003.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Further tightening of monetary policy is required to ensure the return of inflation to the target and reduce inflation expectations," the bank said in a statement announcing the increase.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The bank directly blamed high government spending for inflation and said it could hike rates yet again if the pace of price rises does not cool.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Additional fiscal spending and the related expansion of the federal budget deficit in 2024 have pro-inflationary effects," it said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Inflation has surged amid a massive increase in government spending on the Ukraine offensive that has triggered labour shortages across the economy.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Price rises were running at 8.6 percent on an annual basis in September, more than double the official 4.0-percent target.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Russian lawmakers voted on Thursday to increase defence expenditure by almost 30 percent next year, another sign Moscow is not planning to halt its spending on the offensive, grinding through its third year, anytime soon.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Several sectors of the economy are facing intense labour shortages, as hundreds of thousands of men have been called up to fight, fled the country or been recruited by a booming domestic weapons' industry.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   That has created strong growth despite an unprecedented package of Western sanctions that Washington hoped would cripple the Russian economy.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The International Monetary Fund this week raised its growth forecast for Russia in 2024 to 3.6 percent.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But it has also led to a cycle of spiralling wages and prices that the Central Bank has long warned undermines economic stability.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Official borrowing costs in Russia have not been above 20 percent since 2003.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   They regularly topped 100 percent throughout the 1990s, a decade of economic volatility and hardship following the collapse of the Soviet Union.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   For years President Vladimir Putin has boasted of economic stability under his leadership, with his first years in office in the 2000s seeing an oil-led boom and rising wealth.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But his conflict in Ukraine has threatened Moscow's future prosperity, cutting it off from lucrative Western export markets and much of the global financial system.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Putin had hoped to advance plans for alternative international payment systems at the Brics summit in Kazan this week, the largest diplomatic gathering in Russia since the start of the offensive.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But speaking on Thursday, he indicated little progress had been made on talks over launching a possible competitor to the Belgium-based Swift financial messaging system.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "As for Swift and any alternatives, we have not created and are not creating any alternatives," Putin told reporters at the end of the summit.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "One of the key problems today is the problem of payments, that is why we are moving towards the use of national currencies," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "As for a unified Brics currency, we are not considering that question at the moment," he added. (AFP)

   The nation's top legislative body will meet from November 4 to 8, Xinhua News Agency reported on Friday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Draft laws and amendments to be discussed at the meeting of the National People's Congress Standing Committee will cover mineral resources, energy, anti-money laundering measures, maritime issues and other areas, Xinhua said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lawmakers would also review a draft preschool education law, and a draft revision to the Law on Protection of Cultural Relics.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Xinhua reported that the meeting will examine the State Council's financial work report, the management of state-owned assets and a special report on the administrative undertakings of state-owned assets last year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The legislative top brass will also deliberate on matters related to appointments and removals of officials.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Thousands descended upon Central Harbourfront on Friday to bask in the evening atmosphere and indulge in the finer things at the Wine and Dine Festival.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The annual flagship culinary event organised by the Tourism Board is featuring more than 300 booths from around the world.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Phil from South Africa was in a long queue outside a booth selling wines from the UK. He said the festival this year was bigger than even those before the pandemic.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “I’ve been here previously, like pre-Covid. There’re a lot more people here. It seems a bit bigger. I’m having a really good time, so it’s interesting,” he told RTHK.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He also said the nation’s alcohol producers have made leaps and bounds.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “I had a Chinese Chardonnay earlier, and it was good... I had some Chinese wines like 10 or 15 years ago, and it was terrible. Now, it’s like quite good.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   At another booth was Umesh, who was enjoying a glass of Finnish wine. He said he was able to taste drinks that he had never tried before.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “We’ve tried Finland’s. We’ve tried China’s. We’ve tried France’s. Not disappointed yet. I can’t wait to see the others, because I’ll probably find stuff that I don’t know existed,” he said of his first Wine and Dine Festival experience.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The five-day festival will end on Sunday.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Friday that it was Russia's business whether or not it decided to use North Korean troops, and that if Ukraine wanted to join Nato then Moscow could do what it wanted to ensure its own security.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The United States said on Wednesday that it had seen evidence that North Korea has sent 3,000 troops to Russia for possible deployment in Ukraine, a move that the West is casting as a significant escalation of the Ukraine war.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Ukraine's military intelligence service said that the first North Korean units trained in Russia had been deployed in the Kursk region, a Russian border area where Ukrainian forces took a chunk of Russian land in August.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "When we have to decide something, we will decide... but it is our sovereign decision whether we will apply it, whether we will not, whether we need it," Putin told Russian state television. "This is our business."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Putin said that the West repeatedly said that it was up to Ukraine how it ensured its security – "with or without Nato".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The sooner they realise the futility of such an approach in relations with Russia, the better it will be for everyone, and perhaps, above all, for themselves," Putin said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Friday said Russia could send North Korean troops into battle as early as Sunday and urged international pressure on the Kremlin and Pyongyang.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "According to intelligence reports, on October 27-28, Russia will use the first North Korean military in combat zones," the Ukrainian leader said on social media, calling for "tangible pressure" to be placed on Russia and North Korea.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un signed a comprehensive strategic partnership agreement during Putin's visit to Pyongyang in June.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Article 4 of the agreement says: "If one of the parties is subjected to an armed attack by any state or several states and thus finds itself in a state of war, the other party will immediately provide military and other assistance with all means at its disposal."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Putin on Thursday did not deny US claims that North Korea had sent troops to Russia but said it is up to Moscow how to run its mutual defence clause with Pyongyang and accused the West of escalating the Ukraine war. (Reuters/AFP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Siobhan Haughey on Friday won gold for the 200-metre freestyle event at the World Aquatics Swimming World Cup 2024 in Incheon, South Korea.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The SAR's swimming queen dominated the race – one of her favourite events – finishing with a time of 1:51.02, three seconds clear of silver medallist, Brittany Castelluzzo of Australia.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Another Australian, Milla Jansen rounded up the podium.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The win comes hot on the heels of Haughey’s silver-medal performance in the women's 400-metres freestyle race on Thursday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The 26-year-old will feature in the 50-metre breaststroke and the 100-metre freestyle on Saturday, the last of her events for the Incheon leg of the tournament.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Meanwhile, 15-year-old SAR swimmer Li Su-yiu finished seventh in the race with a personal best of 1:59.17 seconds.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The event is part of a qualifying series for the World Aquatics Championships in Budapest at the end of this year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Held over three consecutive weeks, the series began last week in Shanghai and concludes in Singapore early next month.

    Relaxed approval rules for all new drugs from Nov 1

File Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1776207_1_20241025180845.jpg&q=99" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   A streamlined regulatory regime aimed at speeding up the arrival in Hong Kong of medicines for serious diseases will be extended to cover all new drugs from November 1, the government said on Friday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Under the “1+” mechanism, a new drug can be registered in the SAR if just one reference regulatory authority in the world has approved it, rather than two in the past.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The mechanism was introduced last November for new drugs to treat life-threatening or severely debilitating diseases, and five products have been approved under it so far.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Department of Health said extending the relaxed regime to all new medicines will bring more choice for patients and strengthen the city’s ability to evaluate drugs.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Alex Lam, chairman of concern group Hong Kong's Patients’ Voices, said Hongkongers will benefit from lower prices and a larger variety of drugs on the market. But he cautioned that quality may be undermined.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Previously we had two regulatory authorities’ approval, now we only need one. If that one authority comes from a country where the standing is not too high in the world, the quality may be lower and the risk to patients may be higher than before," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lam said the World Health Organisation has stated which countries have higher standards regarding drug regulation, with most of them in Europe. In Asia, only Singapore and South Korea make it onto the list, he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "When we expect more drugs coming from countries that are not listed as the highest standard, there may be a compensation of cost in terms of quality and risk associated with this kind of medicine. We have to be careful when we use it on patients in Hong Kong," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lam added that the government needs to act as a gatekeeper to ensure patient safety, suggesting public hospitals should monitor the outcomes when patients are prescribed drugs approved under the mechanism, to check for any problems.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Vendors at this year’s Wine and Dine Festival said on Friday that they hope the weather doesn't dampen business over the weekend.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A storm that prompted the observatory to issue a No 1 signal is expected to come within 500 kilometres of Hong Kong on Saturday morning.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Jeremy Li from a local gin brand said his business mainly welcomed locals in the first two days of the festival.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He told RTHK that the weather will play a part in how well they do over the weekend.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “Last year was the first year we joined the Wine and Dine [Festival], the weekend was really, really packed and busy,” he told RTHK.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “Hopefully if the weather is nice, I guess [business] should be good [this weekend] too.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Kit Leung, a merchant in the newly designated zone featuring British products, is also hoping for good weather.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “[Our business] depends on the typhoon. We are looking at the sky,” he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The annual festival kicked off on Wednesday and will last for five days, instead of the usual four.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Customs officers on Friday said they seized smuggled goods with a market value of over HK$100 million during an operation last week.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   They inspected a 40-foot container scheduled to set sail to Taichung, confiscating products including electronic appliances, routers, CPUs, computers and circuit boards.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   No arrests have been made so far.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Shirley Woo, an investigator of Customs' syndicate crimes investigation bureau, said it's believed the intended final destination for the goods was the mainland.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “We believe that, given the huge demand for these smuggled products on the mainland, criminals are taking an indirect route to first smuggle the cargo to Taichung, and then use various means to smuggle it back to the mainland,” she said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Woo added that more than HK$10 million in taxes would have been evaded if the smuggling had been successful.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Commerce Minister Wang Wentao said Apple is welcome to deepen its presence in China in talks with the tech giant's CEO Tim Cook in Beijing.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Cook, for his part, pledged to increase investment in China.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   At their meeting in Beijing on Friday, the two sides exchanged views on the development of Apple's business in China as well as China-US economic and trade relations.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Wang said Beijing is willing to help return bilateral economic and trade ties to a healthy and stable track through regular exchanges between government officials and firms, and provide quality services for foreign enterprises.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "China will further optimise its business environment and continue to provide high-quality services for foreign-funded firms," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Wang added that Apple is welcome to maintain stable cooperation with Chinese partners to achieve common development.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Cook said China's rapid development helps Apple achieve fast and sustainable growth, and the company will continue to serve as a bridge between Beijing and Washington in economic and trade issues. (Xinhua and agencies)

   The Hong Kong Observatory on Friday said the Standby Signal No. 1 will stay up until at least 6 am on Saturday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Severe Tropical Storm Trami is expected to skirt about 500 kilometres to the south of Hong Kong on Saturday morning, it said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The forecaster predicted strong winds in some areas, especially offshore and on high ground due to the combined effects of Trami and a northeast monsoon.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But It said local winds will not strengthen much because the prevailing winds will mainly be northerlies.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “Depending on the distance of strong winds associated with Trami from the Pearl River Estuary and the change in local wind conditions, the observatory will assess the need of issuing the Strong Wind Signal No. 3 during the day [on Saturday]," it said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Local winds are expected to weaken on Sunday when Trami moves further away, the observatory added.

   Philippine rescue workers battled floodwaters on Friday to reach residents still trapped on the roofs of their homes as Tropical Storm Trami moved out to sea after killing at least 66 people.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Tens of thousands remained displaced after fleeing floods driven by a torrential downpour that dumped two months' worth of rainfall in just two days in some areas.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Many are still trapped on the roofs of their homes and asking for help," Andre Dizon, police director for the hard-hit Bicol region, said. "We are hoping that the floods will subside today, since the rain has stopped."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Accessibility remained a major issue for rescuers on Friday, particularly in Bicol, President Ferdinand Marcos said at a press briefing.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "There were landslides in areas that didn't have landslides before... so I guess the soil is completely saturated, the water has nowhere to go," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The cities of Naga and Legazpi were reporting "many casualties but we haven't been able to get in yet," Marcos added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   As Trami departed the Philippines in the early hours, the storm's death toll swelled as fresh reports of victims emerged.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In Batangas province south of the capital Manila, police staff sergeant Nelson Cabuso said six unidentified bodies had been found in Sampaloc village.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The area was hit by a flash flood yesterday. Our people are still in the area to check if there are other casualties," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The number of confirmed dead in the province stood at at least 34.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   While Manila was seemingly spared the kind of heavy flooding that accompanied Typhoon Gaemi in July, a subdivision south of the capital was seen to be largely submerged. (AFP)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Japan's Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba hit out at "biased" media reports related to a party scandal, as a fresh survey suggested that his ruling coalition could fall short of a majority in elections on Sunday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   This would be the worst result for the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) – which has governed Japan for almost all of the past seven decades – since it last lost power from 2009 to 2012, as well as a major blow to Ishiba himself.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Adding to Ishiba's woes is the continuing fallout from a slush fund scandal within the LDP that angered voters and helped torpedo his predecessor, Fumio Kishida.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Ishiba promised to not actively support LDP politicians caught up in the scandal running in the election, although they are still standing.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But according to media reports, the party has still provided US$132,000 each to district offices headed by these figures.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It is truly frustrating that such reports come out at a time like this," Ishiba said in a campaign speech on Thursday. "Those candidates will not use the money."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We cannot be defeated by those with biased views," he added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Opposition leaders pounced on Ishiba's comments, including Yoshihiko Noda, a popular former prime minister who heads the main opposition Constitutional Democratic Party (CDP), the second-biggest in parliament.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "However you look at it, it is cash to secretly endorse them. Mr Ishiba is making excuses that no one understands," Noda, 67, said in a campaign speech.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "He is angry with these reports? What are you saying? It is the Japanese people who are angry." (AFP)

    Govt hopes probe will help prevent abuse at care homes

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The secretary for labour and welfare said on Friday that he hopes an investigation by an operator of a care home into alleged abuse there could help prevent cases in future.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A care home worker of Hong Chi Association was arrested on suspicion of sexually assaulting two residents while on duty. The association has terminated the employee and promised its own probe.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I hope Hong Chi Association's independent review committee can complete its work as soon as possible, look into details if any improvements can be made systematically, and ensure that such unfortunate incidents won't happen again in the future," Chris Sun said on an RTHK radio programme.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He also said the government is not in a position to offer details of abuse cases reported from four other care facilities, citing privacy concerns.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sun added that the Social Welfare Department has issued warnings to 15 care homes in the past year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "A warning letter is intended to inform care homes of any shortcomings, or if it's suspected of breaking the rules. We have to warn them. But the public has to understand that the warnings cannot include all the details.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "So we've always adopted a similar practice in issuing warning letters. The main point of doing so is to notify care homes of inappropriate actions and shortcomings. This can also allow the industry to know that they have to focus on a certain area and step up their efforts in this regard."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Social Welfare Department will review the licence of the care home operated by Hong Chi Association annually in the wake of the case, instead of the current practice of every three years.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sun said the department's next move depends on the findings of the independent review committee.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The operation of a care home depends on its quality and whether its operations are up to the required standard. That's one thing. But if someone does bad things for an ulterior motive, that's mostly down to the individual. The two things have to be separated," he said.

    Dinosaur fans excited to see HK fossils

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   People gathered bright and early on Friday morning to catch a glimpse of the first-ever dinosaur fossils found on home soil, as they went on display at the Hong Kong Heritage Discovery Centre in Kowloon Park.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Officials announced earlier this week that dinosaur fossils believed to date back to the Cretaceous period had been discovered on Port Island in the northeastern waters of the SAR.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Chong Got was the first to arrive for the opening of the display.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “I don’t know about it actually, that’s why I’m coming here to learn from it. It’s amazing to see the fossils. When I was young, going to the museum, to the souvenir shop, and looking at this small, tiny piece of stone, and then you could find the fossil of a silhouette of, like, a beetle or a shell. It’s already amazing enough,” he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “Here we are talking about dinosaurs. I don’t know how many millions of years now. So it really would be an amazing opportunity for me, to open my eyes.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Also at the exhibition was Rick Dong who said he has seen dinosaur fossils in other museums, but was excited to see the first found in Hong Kong.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “It’s a very good opportunity for the local citizens to come here to see this fossil. And with the development, I think we’ll have more fossils to develop and be shown here for the citizens to see,” he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “[It’s a] very good operation, because for science, there’s no boundary. We should work together with the scientists from all over the world to develop and do research.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Gavin Kwai had taken his six-year-old son Joshua to the exhibition, saying it was an educational opportunity.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “It’s a very good chance for them to learn… When we went to, like, the Science Park’s exhibition beforehand about dinosaurs, sometimes they asked us if we are going to see dinosaurs in Hong Kong or if we are going to discover some. Or they will ask us if it was discovered in Hong Kong and where it was in Hong Kong,” he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “But like beforehand, we usually disappointed them by saying, ‘It’s from other countries, you are not likely to find something like this in Hong Kong.’ It’s very amazing this time that we can really truly discover something in Hong Kong.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   History lover Nitin Gupta said he didn't know much about dinosaurs, but was glad there were staff available to explain the fossils to him.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Ringo Ng, assistant curator of archaeological preservation at the centre, said staff will be arranged to provide explanations from time to time, but they hope to have guides stationed there in the future.

   Financial Secretary Paul Chan has concluded his three-day visit to New York and is expected to be back in Hong Kong on Friday night.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   On the final day of his stay, Chan met representatives from several family offices at a breakfast meeting, introducing them to Hong Kong's advantages as a global hub for asset and wealth management, as well as the latest developments in this field.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Before leaving New York, Chan toured a local startup accelerator platform, Newlab, and told them about Hong Kong’s plan to establish more accelerator bases to support the growth of startups. The finance minister also invited the platform to consider setting up a base in the SAR.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Earlier in his trip, Chan met local political and business figures, think tanks, as well as financial and banking professionals to address their questions and brief them about Hong Kong’s latest situation and opportunities.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He also held discussions about China-US economic and trade relations with Acting Consul General of China in New York Ma Xiaoxiao.

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Four time NBA champion Klay Thompson scored 22 points in his Dallas debut on Thursday, giving a lift to Mavericks superstar Luka Doncic in a 120-109 NBA victory over the San Antonio Spurs.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Slovenian star Doncic scored 28 points and grabbed 10 rebounds for the Mavs, who fell to the Boston Celtics in last season's NBA Finals and acquired Thompson in a free agent deal in the off-season with the hope of going even further this season.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Thompson, who won four titles in 13 seasons with the Golden State Warriors, was delighted with his first outing for the Mavs.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Blue is my favorite colour," he told broadcaster TNT. "And Mavs blue looks good on me."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Kyrie Irving scored 15 points for Dallas, and the Mavericks harried the Spurs defensively.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   San Antonio star Victor Wembanyama, aiming to build on last season's Rookie of the Year campaign, connected on just five of 18 shots from the field on the way to 17 points.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Spurs coughed up 19 turnovers leading to 17 Mavericks points.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Chris Paul, an 11-time All-Star point guard brought in to lend veteran experience to the young San Antonio squad trying to get the Spurs back in the playoffs after a five-season absence, scored all of his points on a lone three-pointer, finishing one-of-six from the field with eight assists.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Couldn't ask for a better start," Thompson said. "Just sharing the flow with Kyrie, Luka and the rest of the guys – very special after a hard month of really good work."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "But it's just a small step for where we want to go," he added.  (AFP)

   Hong Kong stocks opened higher on Friday, following overnight gains in US markets.

   Earlier, the Nasdaq Composite Index and the S&P 500 closed higher, driven by Tesla's positive earnings forecast and a decline in Treasury yields, but the Dow Jones Industrial Average finished lower.

   The Dow fell by 140.59 points, or 0.33 percent, to 42,374.36. The S&P 500 added 12.44 points, or 0.21 percent, to 5,809.86, and the Nasdaq Composite Index increased by 138.83 points, or 0.76 percent, to 18,415.49. (Xinhua)

   Portugal forward Félix has struggled to make an impact since returning for a second spell with Chelsea in August.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Yet to start a Premier League game following his move from Atlético Madrid, the 24-year-old seized the chance to prove a point to Chelsea boss Enzo Maresca.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Félix's only goal in seven previous appearances this season came on his debut at Wolves on August 25.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He ended his six-game barren run in the first half against out-classed Panathinaikos and netted again after the interval.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Mykhailo Mudryk and Christopher Nkunku were also on target as Chelsea made it two wins from two games in the tournament.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The most important thing is no matter how many players we change, you can see the identity of the team. The identity is quite clear," Maresca said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "What we want is exactly what they're doing, taking the chance when we give it to them," he added. "Tonight once again they showed that."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Maresca made 11 changes from the side that lost at Liverpool last weekend, but still fielded a strong side that was far too dynamic for the Greeks. (AFP)

    Mourinho sees red as Fenerbahce hold Man Utd

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Fenerbahce boss José Mourinho said his former club Manchester United escaped Istanbul with a point after he was sent to the stands in a 1-1 Uefa Europa League draw on Thursday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   United have drawn all three of their European games this season and a point does little to ease the pressure on under-fire manager Erik ten Hag.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Christian Eriksen fired a depleted United in front on 15 minutes, but Fenerbahce had the better of the chances and got their reward when Youssef En-Nesyri equalised early in the second half.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We were better than them, so overall a good result for Manchester United," Mourinho said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A point leaves United languishing in 21st of the 36-team table and with their chances of securing a top-eight finish to progress directly to the last 16 fading.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Fenerbahce are in 14th on five points, with a top-24 finish enough to qualify for the playoff stage.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Mourinho also came into the game under pressure early in his reign with Fenerbahce trailing rivals Galatasaray by eight points at the top of the Turkish Super Lig.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "If we play like this in the Turkish league, we destroy every team," added Mourinho, who was shown a red card for his protests after appeals for a penalty were waived away in the second half. "He (the referee) told me something incredible. He could see the action in the box, and my behaviour on the touchline.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I congratulate him because it is incredible his peripheral vision. During the game, 100 miles per hour, he had one eye on the penalty situation and one eye on the bench and my behaviour," Mourinho said. "That is why he is one of the best referees in the world."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   United were without 10 players, including captain Bruno Fernandes, due to suspension or injury.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In Fernandes' absence, defender Noussair Mazraoui started in an unfamiliar attacking midfield role and had a part to play in an impressive opening goal. (AFP)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The Nasdaq and the S&P 500 gained on Thursday, driven by Tesla's positive earnings forecast and a decline in Treasury yields from a three-month high, which buoyed market sentiment despite declines from some corporate results.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Shares of Tesla soared, with the EV-maker set to add more than US$140 billion to its market capitalization, after it reported robust third-quarter profits and surprised investors with a prediction of 20 percent to 30 percent sales growth next year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   This helped take the Consumer Discretionary sector higher.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It was a blowout from the perspective of Tesla," said Charlie Ripley, senior investment strategist for Allianz Investment Management.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The benchmark S&P posted its first daily gain this week. However, sentiment was somewhat shaky. Most of the S&P sectors were in the red, as other earnings reports and pressure from lower, but still high Treasury yields weighed.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note eased to 4.20 percent, after reaching a three-month high the day before. It went as high as 4.26 percent in Wednesday's session, which saw all three major equity indexes lose ground.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "In the near term, the greatest influence we've seen in stocks in October has been the move higher in rates. From a 10-year Treasury below 4 percent to where we stand now has been relatively quickly," said Bill Northey, senior investment director at US Bank Wealth Management.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Earnings announced before the bell include IBM, which lost after missing third-quarter revenue estimates, while Honeywell declined after it forecast annual sales below estimates, with both weighing on the blue-chip Dow.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Dow fell a third of a percent to 42,374. The S&P gained a fifth of a percent to end at 5,809, while the Nasdaq gained 0.76 percent to 18,415.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Materials dropped, dragged down by Newmont as higher costs and weaker Nevada output saw it miss profit estimates. Boeing also lost after factory workers voted on Wednesday to reject a contract offer and continue a more than five-week-long strike.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Stocks have eased from record levels over the past few sessions due to a reassessment of bets on the Federal Reserve's rate cuts, rising Treasury yields, corporate earnings and uncertainty surrounding the upcoming US election.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Weekly jobless claims also fell unexpectedly for the week ended Oct. 19. (Reuters)

    Abandon 'mad pursuit' of money, says Pope

  <img alt="Pope Francis delivered the message in a new encyclical letter, the highest form of papal teaching. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1776073_1_20241024211531.jpg&q=90" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Pope Francis urged the world's 1.4 billion Catholics to abandon the "mad pursuit" of money and instead devote themselves to their faith in a new encyclical letter, the highest form of papal teaching, released on Thursday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Francis' fourth encyclical over his 11-year papacy largely abstains from talking about political issues, a departure from his earlier writings, which also addressed themes such as global climate change and "trickle-down" economic policies.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Dilexit nos" (He loved us) instead encourages believers to strengthen their religious lives. The world is living in an "age of superficiality," the pope says, and Catholics and other Christians "need to rediscover the importance of the heart".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "In a world where everything is bought and sold, people's sense of their worth appears increasingly to depend on what they can accumulate with the power of money," Francis writes.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The love of Christ has no place in this perverse mechanism, yet only that love can set us free from a mad pursuit that no longer has room for a gratuitous love," says the pontiff.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The 142-page text focuses on spiritual themes, rather than calls for concrete political action.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The pope's 2015 letter "Laudato Si'" (Praise Be) urged the world to care for the environment and has been credited by some world leaders with influencing discussions ahead of the 2016 Paris Agreement. His 2020 letter "Fratelli Tutti" (Brothers All) called for a reconsideration of economic policies in the aftermath of the global coronavirus pandemic.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The new letter instead offers reflections on a Catholic spiritual practice promoted by a 17th century French nun. Sr. Margaret Mary Alacoque, who reportedly experienced several visions of Jesus.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Christians should emulate Jesus' love by also caring for those in need, the pope says. "There is no greater way for us to return love for love," he states.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Release of the papal document comes as Francis is leading a month-long summit of global Catholic leaders at the Vatican, which is expected to release its own text on Saturday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Discussions around most of the divisive issues originally part of the summit's considerations, such as the possibility of letting women be ordained as Catholic clergy, have now been put on hold. (Reuters)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The Observatory issued the Standby Signal No. 1 early on Friday, and said the signal will remain in force until at least 6pm as Severe Tropical Storm Trami moves across the central and northern parts of the South China Sea.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It said Trami is forecast to stay more than 600 kilometres from Hong Kong for most of the daytime hours, and its strong winds have not yet had an effect on the vicinity of the Pearl River Estuary.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Observatory warned that the combined effect of Trami and the northeast monsoon would bring occasionally strong winds offshore and on high ground, but it also said local winds won't strengthen significantly during the day due to terrain sheltering effect.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The need to issue Strong Wind Signal No. 3 thereafter will depend on the distance between Trami and Hong Kong and the change in local wind strength," it said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Observatory added that Trami will move towards the vicinity of Hainan Island and local winds will weaken later on Sunday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It said it would closely monitor Trami and assess the need to keep the signal in effect.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Observatory warned people living in low-lying areas or places exposed to the high winds should take precautions.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It advised the public not to engage in water sports and fishing vessels in the open sea should seek shelter.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   At least 1.1 million people on India's eastern coast hunkered down in storm shelters ahead of a powerful cyclone set to hammer the low-lying region early Friday morning.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Cyclone Dana is likely to hit the coasts of West Bengal and Odisha states -- home to around 150 million people -- as a "severe cyclonic storm", India's weather bureau said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It predicts winds gusting up to 120 kilometres per hour to cause "major damage" to thatch-roofed houses, which are common on the coast.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Downpours began lashing areas of neighbouring West Bengal state, prompting officials there to be on high alert, while Odisha already saw strong winds and rain on Thursday morning.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Authorities have closed schools, cancelled more than 200 trains, suspended flights and warned fishermen not to venture out to sea.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   India's navy said two ships were "standing by with supplies and rescue and diving teams".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The eye of the storm is predicted to make landfall early Friday, near the coal-exporting port of Dhamra.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Government disaster response teams drove the streets, broadcasting warnings from loudspeakers urging people to take shelter.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Crashing waves are expected to inundate swathes of coastal areas, with water predicted to surge up to two metres above usual tide levels.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   India’s eastern coasts have long been prone to cyclones, but the number of intense storms is increasing along the country’s coast, with global warming driven by planet-heating gases causing them to become more extreme and unpredictable.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Last year was India’s deadliest cyclone season in recent years, killing 523 people and costing an estimated US$2.5 billion in damage. (AP/AFP)

    Jailed British nurse Lucy Letby loses appeal

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Former British nurse and convicted child serial killer Lucy Letby on Thursday lost an attempt to appeal against her conviction for trying to murder a newborn baby, amid questions over the fairness of her trials.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Letby, 34, was found guilty of murdering seven children and attempting to murder seven more between June 2015 and June 2016 while working in the neonatal unit of the Countess of Chester Hospital in Chester, northern England, making her Britain's worst serial child killer of modern times.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   She was convicted of an eighth count of attempted murder at a retrial earlier this year, after the original jury was unable to reach a verdict on a charge that Letby tried to kill a baby girl by removing her breathing tube.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Prosecutor Nick Johnson told Manchester Crown Court that, little more than an hour after the child was born, a senior doctor found the baby's breathing tube dislodged and Letby standing there "doing nothing".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Letby's lawyer Benjamin Myers told London's Court of Appeal on Thursday that Letby "maintains and has maintained she is not guilty of the offences".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He argued that the retrial was an abuse of process as Letby could not have a fair trial because of extensive coverage of her convictions, which featured "intense hostility towards her" and comments made by the Crown Prosecution Service and police.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "There was no way in which the jury in trial two were going to have the publicity and the comment and the hostility ameliorated," Myers said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Judge William Davis refused Letby's application for leave to appeal against the conviction from her retrial.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Letby attended the hearing by videolink from prison and sat impassively as the judge stated the court's reasons for refusing her application.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The outcome of the first trial undoubtedly led to an unusually large amount of publicity and online debate," Davis said. "That is because, on its face, the case was extraordinary."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Letby's attempt to overturn her convictions from the first trial was refused in May. She can now only challenge those convictions if the Criminal Cases Review Commission refer those cases back to the Court of Appeal.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Since her trials, Letby's conviction has come under a spotlight, following criticism by some experts of medical and statistical evidence presented by the prosecution.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Some media have questioned whether she might be the victim of a miscarriage of justice, while a public inquiry into her crimes continues.  (Reuters)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   The government on Thursday strongly condemned overseas individuals exerting improper pressure on a senior judge, labelling it as blatant interference of ongoing criminal proceedings in the SAR.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   There have been media reports that Court of Final Appeal non-permanent judge Patrick Keane was met by protests when he spoke at an event in Sydney, with demonstrators calling for the release of former media tycoon Jimmy Lai.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The 66-year-old joined the bench of Hong Kong's top court in 2023, following his retirement from the High Court of Australia.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Any attempt by any organisation or individual to exert pressure on judges and judicial officers, and interfere with the criminal justice process by means of political power or any other means, is clearly a reprehensible act undermining the rule of law of the SAR and should be vehemently condemned," a government spokesman said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The spokesman pointed out legal proceedings regarding Jimmy Lai's case are still ongoing, and it was inappropriate for any person to comment on the details of the case, or exert improper interference.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "All defendants will receive a fair trial strictly in accordance with laws applicable to Hong Kong and as protected by the Basic Law and the Hong Kong Bill of Rights," the statement added.

   Three pedestrians were hospitalised after the glass wall of a Tsuen Wan shopping mall shattered on Thursday, sending pieces of glass onto the pavement below.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Police said that at about 6.30pm, a five-by-three-metre section of the curtain wall cracked and fell from the fifth floor of Citywalk One.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Images from the scene show shards of glass littered across a cordoned-off section of the pavement on Wo Tik Street.
   <br/>
   <br/>

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Secretary for Labour and Welfare Chris Sun on Thursday said he is highly concerned about an abuse case at a care home and that the government will take serious follow-up actions.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Hong Chi Association, which operates the facility, said in a statement on Wednesday that the case was discovered in August, and they immediately reported it to police and the Social Welfare Department.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The department confirmed the case on Wednesday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sun told reporters on Thursday that officials wanted to ensure that the alleged victims and their families were in a stable emotional state.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “We want to prevent them from experiencing further harm. Therefore we felt it was important to wait until their situation was stable before making the announcement,” he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “This is a matter of balance that we hope to achieve.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The case involved a 38-year-old male staff member of the care home, who has been arrested for allegedly sexually assaulting two residents while on duty.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The association said they terminated the employee, and will set up an independent review committee to evaluate protective measures for service users.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   President Xi Jinping on Thursday told the Brics summit in the Russian city of Kazan that world peace and development are still facing formidable challenges and urged the group to be a "stabiliser" to ensure global security.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Addressing other leaders of Brics nations on the final day of the summit, Xi noted that China is doing what it can to prevent the conflict in the Middle East from spreading.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We will continue to advance the ceasefire efforts in Gaza and to start new initiatives to make sure that the war will not extend to Lebanon," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Xi also said that the "common march of the Global South towards modernity is a major event in world history".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We have to show collective wisdom and strength to make our contribution and show the responsibilities to build a community of shared future for mankind. We have to uphold peace and achieve common security," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We have to be the stabiliser to ensure security and also to continue our efforts to solve problems to ensure global security."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Brics grew out of meetings between China, Russia, and India, who then began to meet more formally, eventually adding Brazil, then South Africa, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran and the United Arab Emirates. (Additional reporting by AFP, Reuters)
