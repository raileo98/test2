<div class="itemFullText">
 Medical experts are calling on the public to maintain good hygiene and get flu jabs, after clinics reported a surge in infections.
 <br>
  <br>
  The president of the Hong Kong Medical Association, Cheng Chi-man, said on a RTHK programme on Monday that clinics have seen a significant increase in patients in the last two weeks.
  <br>
  <br>
  University of Hong Kong microbiologist Dr Ho Pak-leung said the SAR may see a more serious flu outbreak if temperatures drop.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Winter in Hong Kong is generally mild. This Lunar New Year in January, the flu outbreak could be less serious as long as the weather isn't that cold and temperatures just fall to between 10 and 15 degrees" he said on a radio programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But if temperatures dip below 10 degrees, the outbreak could happen quickly and it could be more serious than in the past.”

    Govt to shift focus to talent retention: Chris Sun

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Labour and welfare minister Chris Sun says the government will shift its focus from luring talent to retaining talent in the SAR, adding the talent hunt will continue beyond international sports stars.
 <br>
  <br>
  In an exclusive interview with the Wen Wei Po newspaper, Sun also said there are no plans to expand labour importation schemes to cover more sectors other than construction, transport and care homes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Recently, snooker stars Judd Trump and Ronnie O'Sullivan both became Hong Kong residents through the Quality Migrant Admission Scheme.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sun said the fact that international sports stars come to Hong Kong via various talent admission schemes shows how attractive the city is.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They are internationally renowned sports stars and foreigners. They have many choices, but they chose Hong Kong. I believe this is the best way to show the world Hong Kong's appeal. It speaks louder than words," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will continue our talent search, not limited to sports stars. Through our talent schemes, we are searching for some world-class talent."
  <br>
  <br>
  Since late 2022, around 175,000 people have come to Hong Kong through various talent admission schemes, adding around 350,000 to the city's population along with their families.
  <br>
  <br>
  The labour chief added there are no plans to provide housing allowances for imported professionals as the government makes housing a priority for local permanent residents.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Trade Development Council (TDC) says it will lead a delegation to Indonesia next month to try to drum up business with Asean's largest economy.
 <br>
  <br>
  Around 100 people, including senior executives and start-up bosses, will join the trip to Jakarta, visiting companies and taking part in networking events.
  <br>
  <br>
  TDC research director Irina Fan on Monday said Hong Kong is Indonesia's second largest investor, but the country is only the SAR's sixth largest trading partner when it comes to Asean members.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Many of the enterprises that invest in Indonesia through Hong Kong are mainland subsidiaries or branches in the SAR. Their parent company is on the mainland, but they enter the Indonesian market through Hong Kong," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fan said figures from Indonesian officials show the SAR invested a total of US$18.5 billion in over 8,400 projects in the country between 2018 and 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  She added that Indonesia has been participating in the TDC's exhibitions, with products such as clothing, electronics and toys, showing that firms there are very much interested in reaching out to buyers from the mainland and elsewhere.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A driver involved in a fatal crash in Jordan was arrested on suspicion of dangerous driving causing death, police said on Monday, after one person was killed and two other pedestrians were injured when the car he was driving mounted a pavement in Jordan.
 <br>
  <br>
  Officers said they were notified at around 10am of the incident near Luen Tak Building on Jordan Road.
  <br>
  <br>
  The vehicle was reportedly travelling westbound on the road before ploughing into pedestrians.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When approaching the junction of Jordan Road and Shanghai Street, the private car reportedly went out of control and knocked down three pedestrians after running onto the pavement," a police statement read.
  <br>
  <br>
  The three were rushed to Queen Elizabeth Hospital.
  <br>
  <br>
  One of them, an elderly person who was found unconscious, was pronounced dead after sustaining multiple serious injuries.
  <br>
  <br>
  The driver, 42, reported feeling unwell and was sent to Kwong Wah Hospital, officers added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police have classified the crash as a fatal traffic accident.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Transport Department said the accident resulted in a stretch of Jordan Road to be closed to traffic.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korea's acting President Choi Sang-mok on Monday ordered an emergency safety inspection of the country's entire airline operation system as investigators worked to identify victims and find out what caused deadliest air disaster in the country.
 <br>
  <br>
  All 175 passengers and four of the six crew were killed when a Jeju Air Boeing 737-800 belly-landed and skidded off the end of the runway at Muan International Airport, erupting in a fireball as it slammed into a wall. Two crew members were pulled out alive.
  <br>
  <br>
  The top priority for now is identifying the victims, supporting their families and treating the two survivors, Choi told a disaster management meeting in Seoul.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Even before the final results are out, we ask that officials transparently disclose the accident investigation process and promptly inform the bereaved families," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As soon as the accident recovery is conducted, the transport ministry is requested to conduct an emergency safety inspection of the entire aircraft operation system to prevent recurrence of aircraft accidents," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The transport ministry said authorities were considering whether to conduct a special inspection of all 101 Boeing 737-800 aircraft operated by South Korean airliners.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jeju Air flight 7C2216, arriving from the Thai capital Bangkok with 175 passengers and six crew on board, was trying to land shortly after 9am on Sunday at the airport in the southwest of the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  Investigators are examining bird strikes and weather conditions as possible factors in the crash, fire officials have said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Experts say many questions remain, including why the plane, powered by two CFM 56-7B26 engines, appeared to be travelling so fast and why its landing gear did not appear to be down when it skidded down the runway and into a wall.
  <br>
  <br>
  CFM International is a joint venture between GE Aerospace and France's Safran.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Monday, transport ministry officials said as the pilots made a scheduled approach they told air traffic control the aircraft had suffered a bird strike, shortly after the control tower gave them a warning birds were spotted in the vicinity.
  <br>
  <br>
  The pilots then declared mayday and signalled their intention to go around shortly before the aircraft came down on the runway in a belly landing and crashed into a structure at the end of the runway.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials are investigating what role the wall at the end of the runway played in the crash, including the embankment on which it was standing, transport ministry officials told a media briefing.
  <br>
  <br>
  The crash killed mostly local residents who were returning from holidays in Thailand, while two Thai nationals also died.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Monday morning, investigators were trying to identify some of the last remaining victims, as anguished families waited inside the Muan airport terminal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Park Han-shin, who lost his brother in the crash, said he was told by authorities that his brother had been identified but has not been able to see his body.
  <br>
  <br>
  Park called on other victims' families to unite in responding to the disaster and recovery efforts, citing a 2014 ferry sinking that killed more than 300 people. Prolonged efforts to identify the victims and cause of the sinking followed that disaster.
  <br>
  <br>
  Emergency workers were sifting through wreckage that was nearly completely destroyed when the aircraft was engulfed in an explosion of flames and debris at the regional airport near the country's winding western coastline.
  <br>
  <br>
  Transportation ministry officials said the jet's flight data recorder was recovered but appeared to have sustained some damage on the outside and it was not yet clear whether the data was sufficiently intact to be analysed.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Muan airport remains closed through Wednesday but the rest of the country's international and regional airports including the main Incheon International Airport near Seoul were operating as scheduled. (Reuters)

    Investigators seek arrest warrant for President Yoon

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Investigators probing South Korea's Yoon Suk-yeol over his short-lived declaration of martial law on Monday said they sought an arrest warrant for the suspended president after he failed to report for questioning.
 <br>
  <br>
  Yoon briefly suspended civilian rule this month, plunging South Korea into its worst political crisis in decades.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was stripped of his presidential duties by parliament over the action, but a constitutional court ruling is pending on whether to confirm the impeachment.
  <br>
  <br>
  The conservative leader also faces criminal charges of insurrection, which could result in life imprisonment or even the death penalty.
  <br>
  <br>
  A former prosecutor himself, Yoon had been summoned three times by investigators for questioning, but refused to present himself each time -- including by yesterday's deadline.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Joint Investigation Headquarters filed an arrest warrant for President Yoon Suk-yeol with the Seoul Western District Court", said the probe team in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The application by investigators marks the first attempt in the country's history to forcibly detain a president before the impeachment procedure is complete.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon is being investigated by prosecutors as well as a joint team comprising police, defence ministry, and anti-corruption officials. (AFP)

 Indiana's Tyrese Haliburton scored 31 points as the Pacers turned the tables on the NBA champion Celtics with a confident 123-114 victory in Boston.
 <br>
  <br>
  Two days after Jaylen Brown's 44 points propelled the Celtics to a 142-105 blowout victory over the Pacers, Indiana got their revenge.
  <br>
  <br>
  Haliburton added six rebounds and seven assists without a turnover and six players scored in double figures for Indiana, whose lights-out shooting in the second quarter saw them seize a seven-point halftime lead that they would push to as many as 16.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brown stayed hot, delivering 31 points on 13-of-21 shooting with six assists. Jayson Tatum added 22 points with nine rebounds and six assists.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pascal Siakam and Andrew Nembhard scored 17 points each for Indiana, with Nembhard adding eight rebounds and eight assists as he returned after missing Friday's game with left knee tendinitis.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nembhard said maintaining their pace in the fourth quarter – when Boston cut an 11-point deficit to two with seven and a half minutes to play, was key for Indiana.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think that was the biggest thing we did late in the game," he said. "We kept pace in the game. We didn't slow it down and worry about the score too much."
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, in Orlando, Cole Anthony drove for the game-winning layup as the Magic erased a 21-point deficit to beat the Brooklyn Nets 102-101.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rookie Tristan da Silva scored 21 points to lead the injury-ravaged Magic. Goga Bitadze added 19 and Anthony scored five of his 10 in the fourth quarter, as Orlando closed the game on a 22-4 scoring run.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cam Thomas, back after missing 13 games with a hamstring strain, came off the bench and led Brooklyn's scoring with 25 points but missed a jump shot as time expired.
  <br>
  <br>
  Anthony admitted that da Silva, who scored 13 points in the fourth quarter, was supposed to get the ball on the play that yielded his game winner.
  <br>
  <br>
  When that failed to pan out, he said, "I'm like, alright, I'm gonna go get a layup".
  <br>
  <br>
  The Nets were without veteran Dorian Finney-Smith, who was traded along with Shake Milton to the Los Angeles Lakers on Sunday in a deal that sent D'Angelo Russell back to Brooklyn. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Jimmy Carter "lived a life measured not by words, but by his deeds," President Joe Biden said on Sunday in televised remarks addressing the death of the former US leader.
 <br>
  <br>
  Biden's tribute, like many that came in from US and global leaders, focused on Carter's character, with the outgoing president describing his predecessor as seeming to be from a "bygone era."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Just look at his life, his life's work," Biden said, speaking from the US Virgin Islands, where he was on vacation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He worked to eradicate disease, not just at home, but around the world. He forged peace, advanced civil rights, human rights, promoted free and fair elections around the world. He built housing for the homeless with his own hands."
  <br>
  <br>
  Biden also declared January 9 a national day of mourning for Carter, calling on Americans to visit their places of worship to "pay homage" to the late US leader.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I call on the American people to assemble on that day in their respective places of worship, there to pay homage to the memory of President James Earl Carter, Jr," Biden said in a White House proclamation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I invite the people of the world who share our grief to join us in this solemn observance."
  <br>
  <br>
  Among the former US presidents, Bill Clinton said his predecessor had "worked tirelessly for a better, fairer world."
  <br>
  <br>
  George W. Bush said Carter "dignified the office. And his efforts to leave behind a better world didn't end with the presidency."
  <br>
  <br>
  Barack Obama hailed Carter for teaching "all of us what it means to live a life of grace, dignity, justice, and service."
  <br>
  <br>
  In Europe, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer paid tribute to Jimmy Carter for his "lifelong dedication to peace" and said the former US president had "redefined the post-presidency with a remarkable commitment to social justice and human rights".
  <br>
  <br>
  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Jimmy Carter served as US president when Ukraine was not yet independent but "his heart stood firmly with us in our ongoing fight for freedom".
  <br>
  <br>
  "We deeply appreciate his steadfast commitment to Christian faith and democratic values, as well as his unwavering support for Ukraine in the face of Russia's unprovoked aggression."
  <br>
  <br>
  In Cuba, the island's leader Miguel Diaz-Canel said on Sunday his nation would remember Carter "with gratitude".
  <br>
  <br>
  During his presidency, Carter made moves to normalise diplomatic ties and relax US sanctions on the country, and "our people will remember with gratitude his efforts to improve relations," Diaz-Canel said in a post on social media.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere, Panama's President Jose Mulino said negotiations with Carter "achieved the transfer of the Canal to Panamanian hands and the full sovereignty of our country."
  <br>
  <br>
  US President-elect Donald Trump, who will return to the White House in January, has threatened to demand the key waterway be returned to the United States, which originally completed and operated it. (AFP)

<img alt="Eagles running back Saquon Barkley runs past Cowboys cornerback DaRon Bland. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1785413_1_20241230080417.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Philadelphia Eagles clinched the NFC East division title after handing the Dallas Cowboys a humiliating 41-7 defeat, while the Buffalo Bills secured the second seed in the AFC with a 40-14 crushing of the New York Jets.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Cowboys were already eliminated from playoff contention and without top receiver CeeDee Lamb with a shoulder injury, but it was their defence that struggled.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eagles starting quarter-back Jalen Hurts missed the game due to concussion. Kenny Pickett got the start but had to leave the game in the third quarter with a rib injury with Philadelphia 24-7 up.
  <br>
  <br>
  That meant third-choice Tanner McKee took over under the centre and two of his four passes were for touchdowns.
  <br>
  <br>
  The real damage to the Cowboys, who gave up four turnovers, was done by the Eagles star running back Saquon Barkley who put up 167 yards on 31 carries to pass the 2,000 yard mark for the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Barkley, who has 2,005 yards needs to put up 101 yards next week to break Eric Dickerson's record for the most rushing yards in a season, set for the Los Angeles Rams in 1984.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It’s cool, I’m not going to downplay it," Barkley said of the division crown. “At the end of the day, you’re not getting remembered for being a 2024 NFC East division champ.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The win means the Eagles are guaranteed at least the number two seed in the NFC.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the Bills took the second seed in the AFC behind defending champions Kansas City Chiefs, after taking care of business against the New York Jets.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Bills led 12-0 at the half before their quarterback Josh Allen took total control of the game with touchdown passes to Amari Cooper and Keon Coleman either side of a rushing score from James Cook.
  <br>
  <br>
  Allen, who threw for 182 yards, had opened the scoring with a one-yard rush.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jets quarterback Aaron Rodgers threw two interceptions and was sacked four times.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It speaks to the staff that we’ve got here, the guys that we’ve got in this locker room, how this team is put together and the culture that we have,” Allen said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We didn’t really pay attention to the preseason notions, but we heard them and we saw them and we knew what people were saying," he added. "But it had no effect on us.” (AFP/AP)

    Former US president Jimmy Carter dies, aged 100

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Jimmy Carter, the earnest Georgia peanut farmer who as US president struggled with a bad economy and the Iran hostage crisis but brokered peace between Israel and Egypt and later received the Nobel Peace Prize for his humanitarian work, died at his home in Plains, Georgia, on Sunday, the Carter Center said. He was 100.
 <br>
  <br>
  “My father was a hero, not only to me but to everyone who believes in peace, human rights, and unselfish love,” said Chip Carter, the former president’s son. “My brothers, sister, and I shared him with the rest of the world through these common beliefs. The world is our family because of the way he brought people together, and we thank you for honoring his memory by continuing to live these shared beliefs.”
  <br>
  <br>
  A Democrat, he served as president from January 1977 to January 1981 after defeating incumbent Republican President Gerald Ford in the 1976 US election. Carter was swept from office four years later in an electoral landslide as voters embraced Republican challenger Ronald Reagan, the former actor and California governor.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carter lived longer after his term in office than any other US president. Along the way, he earned a reputation as a better former president than he was a president - a status he readily acknowledged.
  <br>
  <br>
  His one-term presidency was marked by the highs of the 1978 Camp David accords between Israel and Egypt, bringing some stability to the Middle East. But it was dogged by an economy in recession, persistent unpopularity and the embarrassment of the Iran hostage crisis that consumed his final 444 days in office.
  <br>
  <br>
  In recent years, Carter had experienced several health issues including melanoma that spread to his liver and brain. Carter decided to receive hospice care in February 2023 instead of undergoing additional medical intervention. His wife, Rosalynn Carter, died on Nov. 19, 2023, at age 96. He looked frail when he attended her memorial service and funeral in a wheelchair.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carter left office profoundly unpopular but worked energetically for decades on humanitarian causes. He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2002 in recognition of his "untiring effort to find peaceful solutions to international conflicts, to advance democracy and human rights, and to promote economic and social development."
  <br>
  <br>
  Carter had been a centrist as governor of Georgia with populist tendencies when he moved into the White House as the 39th US president. He was a Washington outsider at a time when America was still reeling from the Watergate scandal that led Republican Richard Nixon to resign as president in 1974 and elevated Ford from vice president.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm Jimmy Carter and I'm running for president. I will never lie to you," Carter promised with an ear-to-ear smile.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked to assess his presidency, Carter said in a 1991 documentary: "The biggest failure we had was a political failure. I never was able to convince the American people that I was a forceful and strong leader."
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite his difficulties in office, Carter had few rivals for accomplishments as a former president. He gained global acclaim as a tireless human rights advocate, a voice for the disenfranchised and a leader in the fight against hunger and poverty, winning the respect that eluded him in the White House.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carter won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2002 for his efforts to promote human rights and resolve conflicts around the world, from Ethiopia and Eritrea to Bosnia and Haiti. His Carter Center in Atlanta sent international election-monitoring delegations to polls around the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  A Southern Baptist Sunday school teacher since his teens, Carter brought a strong sense of morality to the presidency, speaking openly about his religious faith. He also sought to take some pomp out of an increasingly imperial presidency - walking, rather than riding in a limousine, in his 1977 inauguration parade.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Middle East was the focus of Carter's foreign policy. The 1979 Egypt-Israel peace treaty, based on the 1978 Camp David accords, ended a state of war between the two neighbours.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carter brought Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin to the Camp David presidential retreat in Maryland for talks. Later, as the accords seemed to be unravelling, Carter saved the day by flying to Cairo and Jerusalem for personal shuttle diplomacy.
  <br>
  <br>
  The treaty provided for Israeli withdrawal from Egypt's Sinai Peninsula and establishment of diplomatic relations. Begin and Sadat each won a Nobel Peace Prize in 1978.
  <br>
  <br>
  By the 1980 election, the overriding issues were double-digit inflation, interest rates that exceeded 20% and soaring gas prices, as well as the Iran hostage crisis that brought humiliation to America. These issues marred Carter's presidency and undermined his chances of winning a second term.
  <br>
  <br>
  On November 4, 1979, revolutionaries devoted to Iran's Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini had stormed the US Embassy in Tehran, seized the Americans present and demanded the return of the ousted shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who was backed by the United States and was being treated in a US hospital.
  <br>
  <br>
  The American public initially rallied behind Carter. But his support faded in April 1980 when a commando raid failed to rescue the hostages, with eight US soldiers killed in an aircraft accident in the Iranian desert.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carter's final ignominy was that Iran held the 52 hostages until minutes after Reagan took his oath of office on January 20, 1981, to replace Carter, then released the planes carrying them to freedom.
  <br>
  <br>
  In another crisis, Carter protested the former Soviet Union's 1979 invasion of Afghanistan by boycotting the 1980 Olympics in Moscow. He also asked the US Senate to defer consideration of a major nuclear arms accord with Moscow.
  <br>
  <br>
  Unswayed, the Soviets remained in Afghanistan for a decade.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carter won narrow Senate approval in 1978 of a treaty to transfer the Panama Canal to the control of Panama despite critics who argued the waterway was vital to American security. He also completed negotiations on full US ties with China.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carter created two new US Cabinet departments - education and energy. Amid high gas prices, he said America's "energy crisis" was "the moral equivalent of war" and urged the country to embrace conservation. "Ours is the most wasteful nation on earth," he told Americans in 1977.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 1979, Carter delivered what became known as his "malaise" speech to the nation, although he never used that word.
  <br>
  <br>
  "After listening to the American people I have been reminded again that all the legislation in the world can't fix what's wrong with America," he said in his televised address.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The threat is nearly invisible in ordinary ways. It is a crisis of confidence. It is a crisis that strikes at the very heart and soul and spirit of our national will. The erosion of our confidence in the future is threatening to destroy the social and the political fabric of America."
  <br>
  <br>
  As president, the strait-laced Carter was embarrassed by the behaviour of his hard-drinking younger brother, Billy Carter, who had boasted: "I got a red neck, white socks, and Blue Ribbon beer."
  <br>
  <br>
  Jimmy Carter withstood a challenge from Massachusetts Senator Edward Kennedy for the 1980 Democratic presidential nomination but was politically diminished heading into his general election battle against a vigorous Republican adversary.
  <br>
  <br>
  Reagan, the conservative who projected an image of strength, kept Carter off balance during their debates before the November 1980 election.
  <br>
  <br>
  Reagan dismissively told Carter, "There you go again," when the Republican challenger felt the president had misrepresented Reagan's views during one debate.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carter lost the 1980 election to Reagan, who won 44 of the 50 states and amassed an Electoral College landslide.
  <br>
  <br>
  James Earl Carter Jr. was born on October 1, 1924, in Plains, Georgia, one of four children of a farmer and shopkeeper. He graduated from the US Naval Academy in 1946, served in the nuclear submarine program and left to manage the family peanut farming business.
  <br>
  <br>
  He married his wife, Rosalynn, in 1946, a union he called "the most important thing in my life." They had three sons and a daughter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carter became a millionaire, a Georgia state legislator and Georgia's governor from 1971 to 1975. He mounted an underdog bid for the 1976 Democratic presidential nomination, and out-hustled his rivals for the right to face Ford in the general election.
  <br>
  <br>
  With Walter Mondale as his vice presidential running mate, Carter was given a boost by a major Ford gaffe during one of their debates. Ford said that "there is no Soviet domination of Eastern Europe and there never will be under a Ford administration," despite decades of just such domination.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carter edged Ford in the election, even though Ford actually won more states - 27 to Carter's 23.
  <br>
  <br>
  Not all of Carter's post-presidential work was appreciated. Former President George W. Bush and his father, former President George H.W. Bush, both Republicans, were said to have been displeased by Carter's freelance diplomacy in Iraq and elsewhere.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2004, Carter called the Iraq war launched in 2003 by the younger Bush one of the most "gross and damaging mistakes our nation ever made." He called George W. Bush's administration "the worst in history" and said Vice President Dick Cheney was "a disaster for our country."
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2019, Carter questioned Republican Donald Trump's legitimacy as president, saying "he was put into office because the Russians interfered on his behalf." Trump responded by calling Carter "a terrible president."
  <br>
  <br>
  Carter also made trips to communist North Korea. A 1994 visit defused a nuclear crisis, as President Kim Il Sung agreed to freeze his nuclear program in exchange for resumed dialogue with the United States. That led to a deal in which North Korea, in return for aid, promised not to restart its nuclear reactor or reprocess the plant's spent fuel.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Carter irked Democratic President Bill Clinton's administration by announcing the deal with North Korea's leader without first checking with Washington.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2010, Carter won the release of an American sentenced to eight years hard labor for illegally entering North Korea.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carter wrote more than two dozen books, ranging from a presidential memoir to a children's book and poetry, as well as works about religious faith and diplomacy. His book "Faith: A Journey for All," was published in 2018. (Reuters)

 Rampant Liverpool smashed West Ham 5-0 on Sunday to stretch their lead at the top of the Premier League to eight points as Manchester City returned to winning ways at troubled Leicester.
 <br>
  <br>
  Nottingham Forest climbed to second in the table with a fifth straight win at Everton, while Ange Postecoglou's Tottenham conceded late to draw 2-2 against Vitor Pereira's rejuvenated Wolves.

  Arne Slot's Liverpool look unstoppable in their quest for a record-equalling 20th English top-flight title, recording their 23rd win in 27 matches in all competitions this season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Luis Diaz opened the scoring against Julen Lopetegui's hapless team on the half-hour, before Mohamed Salah set up Cody Gakpo for the second with some audacious footwork.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Egypt international then scored his 20th goal of the season shortly before half-time to put the visitors in total control.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trent Alexander-Arnold made it 4-0 with a deflected shot from distance in the 54th minute and Diogo Jota completed the rout, courtesy of another Salah assist following a surging run.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I enjoyed it a lot because it doesn't happen many times that I could just sit back and enjoy," said Slot, flying in his first season in the Anfield hotseat after replacing Jurgen Klopp.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool's striking success has come against the background of mounting speculation over the futures of Salah, Alexander-Arnold and captain Virgil van Dijk.
  <br>
  <br>
  All three can discuss a move to a foreign club on a free transfer from January 1 but remain focused on winning a second Premier League title together.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The only thing on my mind is I want Liverpool to win the league and I want to be part of that," Salah told Sky Sports.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I will do my best for the team to win the trophy. There are a few other teams catching up with us and we need to stay focused and humble."
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier, defending champions City travelled to relegation-threatened Leicester drained of confidence after just one win in all competitions since late October.
  <br>
  <br>
  Their frailties over the past two months, which resulted in nine defeats in their previous 13 games, were on display again.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Savinho's first-half goal and an Erling Haaland header after the break made it 2-0.
  <br>
  <br>
  City's bid for a fifth straight title looks to be over as they are 14 points behind leaders Liverpool, who have a game in hand.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the result lifts them to fifth in the table and within striking distance of fourth-placed Chelsea.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is not enjoyable right now, it is just relief. We have done incredible things for many years," said City boss Pep Guardiola.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our mood is in a better position. It was tight in the second half, they were much better.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We don't have energy to sustain 90 minutes. Hopefully the new year can help us bounce back."
  <br>
  <br>
  Nuno Espirito Santo's Forest beat Everton 2-0 at Goodison Park, leapfrogging Chelsea and Arsenal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chris Wood chipped over Jordan Pickford for the opening goal in the 15th minute after being set up by Anthony Elanga.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wood turned provider for Forest's second, which came just after the hour mark when Morgan Gibbs-White produced some neat footwork before firing home.
  <br>
  <br>
  Injury-hit Spurs were on track to end a torrid December on a high after first-half goals by Rodrigo Bentancur and Brennan Johnson cancelled out Hwang Hee-chan's brilliant opener for Wolves.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tottenham captain Son Heung-min also squandered a 43rd-minute penalty, but it did not appear to be too costly until substitute Jorgen Strand Larsen smashed home in the 87th minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm the person in charge, so of course it hurts," said Postecoglou, whose team have won just one of their past seven Premier League matches.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When I see how hard they are trying, it hurts even more because you want them to get a reward and I think today they deserved a reward for their efforts."
  <br>
  <br>
  Crystal Palace won just their second home league game of the season, seeing off bottom club Southampton 2-1, thanks to goals from Trevoh Chalobah and Eberechi Eze.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dango Ouattara scored an 89th-minute leveller as Bournemouth drew 2-2 at Fulham.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chelsea and Manchester United are in action on Monday, with Arsenal travelling to Brentford on Wednesday. (AFP)

<img alt="Ahmed al-Sharaa is the leader of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, the Islamist group that led the coalition that seized power in Damascus. File photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1785401_1_20241230042017.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Syria's leader Ahmed al-Sharaa told Al Arabiya on Sunday that elections could take four years, noting the importance of ties with Iran and Russia and calling for the United States to lift sanctions.
 <br>
  <br>
  "The election process could take four years," Sharaa told the Saudi-owned Al Arabiya television, three weeks after his Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham and allied rebels ousted longtime ruler Bashar al-Assad.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We need to rewrite the constitution" which could take "two or three years", he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the wide-ranging interview, he expressed hope that the incoming administration of US President-elect Donald Trump would lift sanctions imposed on his now war-torn and impoverished country under Assad.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The sanctions on Syria were issued based on the crimes that the regime committed," Sharaa said, adding that since Assad was gone, "these sanctions should be removed automatically".
  <br>
  <br>
  Sharaa's Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) is proscribed as a terrorist organisation by many governments including the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  The leader also noted the importance of ties with Russia and Iran, which were both key allies of Assad.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Syria cannot continue without relations with an important regional country like Iran, but they must be based on respect for the sovereignty of both countries and non-interference in the affairs of both countries," Sharaa said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Russia is an important country and is considered the second most powerful country in the world," he said, noting the "deep strategic interests between Russia and Syria".
  <br>
  <br>
  "All Syria's arms are of Russian origin, and many power plants are managed by Russian experts... We do not want Russia to leave Syria in the way that some wish," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sharaa also said local Kurdish-led forces which Turkey opposes would be integrated into the national army.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Weapons must be in the hands of the state alone. Whoever is armed and qualified to join the defence ministry, we will welcome them," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Based on these criteria, "we will open a negotiations dialogue with the SDF, to perhaps find an appropriate solution," referring to the US-backed, Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces in Syria's north and northeast. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Two drug trafficking cases will be brought up at West Kowloon Magistrates Courts on Monday, after 30 kilos of suspected ketamine - with a street value of HK$14 million - was seized at Hong Kong International Airport on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The first case involves a man, aged 25 who had flown in from Frankfurt, and a 24-year woman who was arrested later at Hong Kong International Airport. The second involves a 47-year-old woman who had flown from Frankfurt, via Taipei.
  <br>
  <br>
  Customs said all three suspects were locals.

    South Korea mourns after 179 die in Muan plane crash

<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korea's acting President Choi Sang-mok, in an emergency meeting on Sunday evening, declared a national mourning period until January 4 over the plane crash at Muan International Airport.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Jeju Air passenger plane skidded off a runway, slammed into a concrete fence and burst into flames after its front landing gear apparently failed to deploy. All but two of the 181 people on board died in one of the country’s worst aviation disasters.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Transport Ministry said the plane was a 15-year-old Boeing 737-800 jet that had arrived in the South Korean city from Bangkok and that the crash happened at 9.03 am.
  <br>
  <br>
  A total of 179 people - 85 women, 84 men and 10 others whose genders weren’t immediately identifiable - died in the fire, the South Korean fire agency said. Emergency workers pulled two people, both flight attendants, to safety. Health officials said they are conscious and not in life-threatening condition.
  <br>
  <br>
  A transport official said both black boxes - the flight data recorder and the cockpit voice recorder - have been found.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a televised news conference, Kim E-bae, Jeju Air’s president, bowed deeply with other senior company officials as he apologised to bereaved families and said he felt “full responsibility” for the incident. Kim said the company hadn’t identified any mechanical problems with the aircraft following regular checkups and that he would wait for the results of government investigations into the cause of the incident.
  <br>
  <br>
  Family members wailed as officials announced the names of some victims at a lounge in the Muan airport.
  <br>
  <br>
  Boeing said in a statement on X it was in contact with Jeju Air and is ready to support the company in dealing with the crash.

    Hong Kong Food Festival sees dip in footfall

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Vendors at the Hong Kong Food Festival have remained conservative on sales with some finding less visitors this year than before.
 <br>
  <br>
  The five-day event ending Sunday began on Christmas Day at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre in Wan Chai.
  <br>
  <br>
  One merchant, surnamed Lok, said the weeks-long Hong Kong Brands and Products Expo in Causeway Bay has pulled away potential customers.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It's obviously because the Brands and Products Expo is being held at Victoria Park at the same time. It opened a day earlier than us. Its admission fee is HK$10, and here, it is HK$30. Admissions are free there after 7pm, but people still need to pay here," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "From the perspective of consumers, I think they will go to the expo and check out local brands."
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite the drop in footfall, vendor Wong said his business saw a 15 to 20 percent jump from last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This year, people are relatively more willing to spend. It's true that there are fewer people than previously, but the purchasing power is stronger," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  A resident, surnamed Mak, said he spent around HK$1,000 at the festival.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I don't normally buy this much. I bought more than usual because of the variety and promotions," he said. “There were less people this year, it was more crowded last year. It could be because some left Hong Kong to spend elsewhere."
  <br>
  <br>
  This year's food festival was held alongside several other shopping events, with around 1,000 booths participating in total.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Security Chris Tang has described the successful enactment of the national security legislation under Article 23 of the Basic Law this year as the most formidable challenge of his career.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a video shared on his social media platform on Sunday, he said he and his team fearlessly hit back at smears and refuted false accusations along the way.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that he managed to put up with a number of physical ailments as he and his colleagues worked on the legislation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I remember the time when I suffered from inflamed eyes due to a lack of sleep. My frozen shoulder and gout also relapsed. However, witnessing all my colleagues tirelessly working day and night, I forgot about these minor inconveniences. At that time, none of us could even keep track of how many takeaway meals we had," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We were driven by a determination to face challenges head-on, so we persevered. Eventually, the legislation was passed unanimously, allowing me to feel truly honoured to have completed this historic mission hand in hand with my comrades. Upholding national security is our mission. Promoting national security and patriotic education is also our duty."
  <br>
  <br>
  Tang also highlighted changes in immigration policies for the SAR this year, such as bringing back multiple-entry visas for Shenzhen residents and introducing mainland travel cards for non-Chinese Hong Kong residents.
  <br>
  <br>
  Looking ahead, the security chief said he and his colleagues will continue to push ahead with various stress tests at Kai Tak Sports Park to ensure the smooth opening of the facility.

 The stench of gasoline hangs over Muan International Airport. Behind a police cordon, plane seats, suitcases and twisted bits of metal are scattered, close to the wrecked fuselage of Jeju Air flight 2216.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Boeing 737-800 carrying 181 people from Bangkok to South Korea crashed as it attempted an emergency landing on Sunday, smashing into a wall and bursting into flames, leaving all but two people aboard feared dead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hundreds of emergency workers put out the fire and combed through the wreckage, but only two people, both flight attendants, were rescued alive, with 177 confirmed dead.
  <br>
  <br>
  By late afternoon, floodlights illuminated the twisted wreckage as a huge yellow crane lifted the fuselage, allowing officials to continue the search and rescue mission.
  <br>
  <br>
  Behind a police cordon tape stretched across the wire fence at the edge of the runway, plane seats and other chunks of metal could be seen, offering a glimpse into the catastrophic impact of the crash.
  <br>
  <br>
  Inside the airport terminal, family members gathered to wait for news, many looking stunned and tearful.
  <br>
  <br>
  One woman was carried away on a stretcher, apparently having passed out from shock.
  <br>
  <br>
  The boards typically used for arrival and departure information were instead displaying the names, dates of birth and nationalities of the victims.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I had a son on board that plane ... He has yet to be identified," one elderly man waiting in the airport lounge, who asked not to be named, told AFP
  <br>
  <br>
  Wailing and screaming echoed through the two-storey airport, as the names and identities of victims were confirmed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Many of the passengers, who were all Korean nationals except for two Thais, had been returning home after their winter holidays.
  <br>
  <br>
  "My younger sister went to heaven today," one 65-year-old woman who gave only her surname Jo told AFP.
  <br>
  <br>
  Her sister had been in Bangkok with her friends on holiday, the woman, wearing a mask and a grey knit hat, said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "My husband is now trying to check whether she's been identified," Jo added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The flight had 175 passengers, including two Thai nationals, and six crew onboard.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to authorities, the youngest passenger was a three-year-old boy and the oldest was a 78-year-old.
  <br>
  <br>
  Five of the dead were children under the age of 10, authorities said, citing the passenger manifest.
  <br>
  <br>
  The only sounds near the crash site were the whirring of cameras and the murmur of reporters broadcasting live, as hundreds of relatives, lost for words, awaited news of their loved ones aboard the burned plane.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the area around the runway, AFP reporters could see duty-free booklets and sanitary gloves worn by the flight crew scattered across the field, not far from the charred tail of the aircraft.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is the deadliest aviation accident on South Korean soil and the worst in years involving the country's carriers.
  <br>
  <br>
  A moment of silence was held at sporting events, including volleyball and basketball games, on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  All major South Korean broadcasters changed their schedules to emergency news programming.
  <br>
  <br>
  End-of-the-year entertainment award shows and comedy shows were cancelled.
  <br>
  <br>
  The accident comes as South Korea is in the midst of political chaos, after suspended president Yoon Suk-yeol was impeached earlier this month over his ill-fated attempt to declare martial law.
  <br>
  <br>
  The acting president was also impeached on Friday, leaving the country with its third leader in three weeks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Civic groups said they were reviewing whether to postpone mass impeachment rallies in light of the accident.
  <br>
  <br>
  Heartbreaking stories of family members were also shared online, with one saying his mother and his five aunts were one the plane.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I was told they would arrive around 8.50 am today, so I came to the airport to pick up my mother and aunts, but I've heard no word from them," he told local media anxiously.
  <br>
  <br>
  The runway at Muan airport will be closed until later this week, authorities said, as investigators probe the cause of the crash.
  <br>
  <br>
  One heart-wrenching screenshot of the final Kakao Talk message exchange between a passenger and their family has been widely reported in local media.
  <br>
  <br>
  The message from the parent and passenger reads: "Wait, a bird is stuck in the wing. Unable to land now... Should I leave a will?"
  <br>
  <br>
  It was the last message, sent at 9.01 am.
  <br>
  <br>
  Their child replies: "Why can't I make a call with you?". It was delivered at 9.37 am and has remained unread.

 Respiratory health expert David Hui on Sunday called on people to get vaccinated as soon as possible, saying there’s been a rise in influenza cases in the city.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a TV programme, the professor of respiratory medicine at Chinese University said both public hospitals and private clinics have reported an increase in patients with flu symptoms.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hui said he’s expecting the flu season to peak next month, as people wrap up their holidays and return from places which saw outbreaks of H1N1 flu like the mainland, Japan, and Taiwan.
  <br>
  <br>
  The expert reminded high risk groups, including the elderly, children and those who’re overweight, to stay vigilant and get their flu jabs if they haven't already done so.

<img alt="Australia's Nathan Lyon bats on day four of the fourth cricket Test match between Australia and India in Melbourne. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1785372_1_20241229164710.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A Marnus Labuschagne half-century and stubborn tail-end batting drove Australia to a 333-run lead at the end of day four in the fourth test in Melbourne on Sunday, leaving India facing a record chase to steal victory.
 <br>
  <br>
  Nathan Lyon and Scott Boland marched off to a big ovation from home fans at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, having combined for an unbeaten 55-run partnership for the final wicket as Australia went to stumps at 228 for nine.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lyon was 41 not out, with number 11 Boland on 10 and India's hopes of winning badly diminished in the final hour.
  <br>
  <br>
  With the five-test series level at 1-1, India's pace dynamo Jasprit Bumrah threatened to turn the match with a three-wicket burst before tea in front of 43,867 fans.
  <br>
  <br>
  But number three Labuschagne (70) and his captain Pat Cummins (41) steadied Australia with a 57-run partnership before Boland and Lyon frustrated India further.
  <br>
  <br>
  The day ended sourly for the tourists when Bumrah had Lyon caught in the slips by a juggling KL Rahul in the final over -- with a no-ball.
  <br>
  <br>
  Only one team has chased more than 300 for victory in an MCG test; England mowed down 332 to beat Australia in 1928.
  <br>
  <br>
  While Boland and Lyon made the going look easy, Labuschagne said there was enough in the pitch for Australia's bowlers on day five.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The movement (off the seam) has probably been the same but just the amount of bounce is significantly lower," Labuschagne told reporters of the changing wicket.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So that makes for pretty tricky batting because more balls are hitting the stumps from a shorter length."
  <br>
  <br>
  As impressive as Australia's rearguard resistance was, it followed some shoddy middle order batting.
  <br>
  <br>
  Having been in command at 80 for two, Australia crumbled in a Bumrah-led onslaught to slump to 91 for six.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mohammed Siraj triggered the collapse when Steve Smith chased a wide, full delivery and nicked behind to wicketkeeper Rishabh Pant to be out for 13.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bumrah had Travis Head caught at square leg for one to earn his 200th test wicket.
  <br>
  <br>
  He struck again four balls later to remove number six Mitchell Marsh for a duck with a gloved catch to Pant before bowling Alex Carey through bat and pad for two.
  <br>
  <br>
  Australia were wobbling but Cummins rode out the storm with typical defiance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Having scored 49 in the first innings, he produced a vital 41 to stall India's momentum.
  <br>
  <br>
  When Labuschagne was out lbw to Siraj, Cummins added another 25 runs with Mitchell Starc (five) and Lyon before falling to the spin of all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fielding mishaps also cost India.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yashasvi Jaiswal dropped two chances, with Labuschagne spared at 46 when he nicked Akash Deep to the gully and opener Usman Khawaja reprieved on two with a spill at leg gully.
  <br>
  <br>
  Khawaja went on to make 21 before Siraj bowled him in the morning.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nitish Kumar Reddy also missed a tough chance to remove Cummins for nine, misjudging the flight of the ball when chasing the Aussie skipper's slog over mid-off.
  <br>
  <br>
  India may still count themselves blessed to be in the game at all. They were on the ropes on day three until Reddy rescued them with a maiden century.
  <br>
  <br>
  The all-rounder finished with 114, his 189-ball vigil ended by spinner Lyon a few overs into the fourth morning.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If you ask me, I think everyone is capable of playing on this pitch," the 21-year-old told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We'll come back strong in the batting order."
  <br>
  <br>
  The healthy day four crowd brought total match attendance to 299,329, a record for a Boxing Day test in Melbourne. (Reuters)

<img alt="Firefighters and rescuers work near the wreckage of a Jeju Air Boeing 737-800 at Muan International Airport. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1785363_1_20241229143707.jpg&q=80">

<div class="itemFullText">
 A passenger plane burst into flames on Sunday after it skidded off a runway at a South Korean airport and slammed into a concrete fence when its front landing gear apparently failed to deploy, killing at least 151 people, officials said, in one of the country's worst aviation disasters.
 <br>
  <br>
  The National Fire Agency said rescuers raced to pull people from the Jeju Air passenger plane carrying 181 people at the airport in the town of Muan, about 290 kilometres south of Seoul. The Transport Ministry said the plane was a 15-year-old Boeing 737-800 jet that was returning from Bangkok and that the crash happened at 9.03 am. local time.
  <br>
  <br>
  At least 124 people — 57 women, 54 men and 13 others whose genders weren’t immediately identifiable — died in the fire, the fire agency said. The death toll is expected to rise further as the rest of the people aboard the plane remain missing about six hours after the incident.
  <br>
  <br>
  Emergency workers pulled out two people, both crew members, to safety, and local health officials said they remain conscious. The fire agency deployed 32 fire trucks and several helicopters to contain the fire. About 1,560 firefighters, police officers, soldiers and other officials were also sent to the site, it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Footage of the crash aired by YTN television showed the Jeju Air plane skidding across the airstrip, apparently with its landing gear still closed, and colliding head-on with a concrete wall on the outskirts of the facility. Other local TV stations aired footage showing thick plumes of black smoke billowing from the plane, which was engulfed in flames.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee Jeong-hyeon, chief of the Muan fire station, told a televised briefing that the plane was completely destroyed, with only the tail assembly remaining recognizable among the wreckage. Lee said that workers were looking into various possibilities about what caused the crash, including whether the aircraft was struck by birds, Lee said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Transport Ministry officials later said their early assessment of communication records show the airport control tower issued a bird strike warning to the plane shortly before it intended to land and gave its pilot permission to land in a different area. The pilot sent out a distress signal shortly before the plane went past the runway and skidded across a buffer zone before hitting the wall, the officials said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Senior Transport Ministry official Joo Jong-wan said workers have retrieved the flight data recorder from the plane’s black box and are still looking for the cockpit voice recording device. He earlier said that government investigators arrived at the site to investigate the cause of the crash and fire.
  <br>
  <br>
  Emergency officials in Muan said the plane’s landing gear appeared to have malfunctioned.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Transport Ministry said the plane's passengers include two Thai nationals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thailand’s prime minister, Paetongtarn Shinawatra, expressed deep condolences to the families of those affected by the accident in a post on social platform X. Paetongtarn said she ordered the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to provide assistance immediately.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kerati Kijmanawat, the director of the Airports of Thailand, confirmed in a statement that Jeju Air flight 7C 2216 departed from Suvarnabhumi Airport with no reports of abnormal conditions with the aircraft or on the runway.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jeju Air in a statement expressed its “deep apology” over the crash and said it will do its “utmost to manage the aftermath of the accident.”
  <br>
  <br>
  In a televised news conference, Kim E-bae, Jeju Air’s president, deeply bowed with other senior company officials as he apologised to bereaved families and said he feels “full responsibility” for the incident. Kim said the company hadn’t identified any mechanical problems with the aircraft following regular check-ups and that he would wait for the results of government investigations into the cause of the incident.
  <br>
  <br>
  Boeing said in a statement on X it was in contact with Jeju Air and is ready to support the company in dealing with the crash.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We extend our deepest condolences to the families who lost loved ones, and our thoughts remain with the passengers and crew,” Boeing said.
  <br>
  <br>
  It’s one of the deadliest disasters in South Korea’s aviation history. The last time South Korea suffered a large-scale air disaster was in 1997, when a Korean Airline plane crashed in Guam, killing 228 people on board. In 2013, an Asiana Airlines plane crash-landed in San Francisco, killing three and injuring approximately 200.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sunday’s accident was also one of the worst landing mishaps since a July 2007 crash that killed all 187 people on board and 12 others on the ground when an Airbus A320 slid off a slick airstrip in Sao Paulo and collided with a nearby building, according to data compiled by the Flight Safety Foundation, a non-profit group aimed at improving air safety. In 2010, 158 people died when an Air India Express aircraft overshot a runway in Mangalore, India, and plummeted into a gorge before erupting into flames, according to the safety foundation.
  <br>
  <br>
  The incident came as South Korea is embroiled into a huge political crisis triggered by President Yoon Suk-yeol’s stunning imposition of martial law and ensuing impeachment . Last Friday, South Korean lawmakers impeached acting President Han Duck-soo and suspended his duties, leading Deputy Prime Minister Choi Sang-mok to take over.
  <br>
  <br>
  Choi ordered officials to employ all available resources to rescue the passengers and crew before he headed to Muan. Yoon’s office said his chief secretary, Chung Jin-suk, will preside over an emergency meeting between senior presidential staff later on Sunday to discuss the crash. (AP)

<img alt="The Labour Department says it is conducting a thorough probe into the industrial accident in Yau Ma Tei. Image courtesy: Google Maps" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1785360_1_20241229134253.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Labour Department (LD) said it is deeply concerned about a fatal accident at a construction site in Yau Ma Tei, in which a 53-year-old worker was killed on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Officials said the male worker was struck by a falling glass panel while it was being lifted with a set of lifting equipment.
  <br>
  <br>
  It's understood the accident happened at a site above the Hong Kong West Kowloon Station.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We commenced an immediate on-site investigation as soon as we were notified of the accident and issued suspension notices to the contractors concerned, suspending all curtain wall installation work of the construction site, including lifting and handling of glass panels. The contractors cannot resume the work process until the LD is satisfied that measures to abate the relevant risks have been taken," a department spokesperson said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will complete the investigation as soon as possible to identify the cause of the accident, ascertain the liability of the duty holders and recommend improvement measures. We will take actions pursuant to the law if there is any violation of the work safety legislation."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Association for the Rights of Industrial Accident Victims also said on Sunday that it is saddened and very concerned about the accident, and called on the Labour Department to be transparent with its findings.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said it will provide the worker’s family with support and assistance.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan said on Sunday that Hong Kong's economy remains strong and resilient, despite potential market volatility stemming from uncertainties like geopolitics and high interest rates by 2025.
 <br>
  <br>
  Writing in his weekly blog, Chan said Hong Kong's asset market has shown substantial improvement, with the local stock market rising by about 18 percent this year and the Hang Seng Index rebounding to 20,000 points.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Trading volume has also significantly increased, reaching a historical high of over HK$600 billion in a single day in October. This year, the average daily trading volume exceeds HK$132 billion, up more than 25 percent from last year," he wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The initial public offering (IPO) market has also become more active, with fundraising from new listings exceeding HK$80 billion, ranking fourth globally."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said family office businesses are also thriving, with about 2,700 single family offices now operating in the SAR. Additionally, the number of companies from the mainland and overseas in Hong Kong has nearly reached 10,000, including around 4,700 start-ups.
  <br>
  <br>
  The finance chief also pointed out that authorities are actively working to attract more professionals to Hong Kong, having received approximately 410,000 applications through various talent schemes over the past two years, and approving around 260,000 of them.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan acknowledged that the retail and dining sectors continue to face challenges, but he believes that the reintroduction of multiple-entry visas for Shenzhen residents, along with the holiday season, will bring in more visitors and give the industry a much needed boost.
  <br>
  <br>
  Looking ahead to the new year, he stressed that Hong Kong will continue to capitalise on its unique advantages, enhance systematic investment in local innovation and technology, and solidify the SAR's position as an international financial, trade, and shipping hub.

 A Jeju Air plane carrying 181 people from Bangkok to South Korea crashed on arrival Sunday, killing at least 120, emergency services said, with a bird strike and adverse weather conditions cited as likely causes.
 <br>
  <br>
  Two survivors -- one crew and one passenger -- were plucked from the wreckage as part of an ongoing rescue operation, the national fire agency said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Video shared by the local MBC broadcaster showed the Jeju Air plane landing at Muan International Airport's runway, with smoke streaming out from the engines, before the entire aircraft was quickly engulfed in flames.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The cause of the accident is presumed to be a bird strike combined with adverse weather conditions. However, the exact cause will be announced following a joint investigation," Lee Jeong-hyun, chief of Muan fire station, said during a briefing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee had earlier warned that "the tally could rise due to the critically injured".
  <br>
  <br>
  The accident took place at 9.03am local time (0003 GMT) on Sunday during the landing of Jeju Air Flight 2216, the Ministry of Land said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A total of 175 passengers -- including two Thai nationals -- and six crew members were onboard," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jeju Air apologised and vowed to do all it could to help.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We at Jeju Air will do everything in our power in response to this accident. We sincerely apologise for causing concern," the airline said in a statement posted on its social media channels.
  <br>
  <br>
  Acting President Choi Sang-mok called for the mobilisation of all resources to save the passengers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "All related agencies... must mobilise all available resources to save the personnel," he instructed officials in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Choi convened an emergency meeting with cabinet members to discuss rescue operations and response, his office said, adding that the acting president, who took office only on Friday, is on his way to Muan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thailand’s prime minister, Paetongtarn Shinawatra, expressed deep condolences to the families of those affected by the accident.
  <br>
  <br>
  Paetongtarn said in a social media post that she had ordered the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to provide assistance immediately.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is the first fatal accident in the history of Jeju Air, one of South Korea's largest low-cost carriers, which was set up in 2005.
  <br>
  <br>
  On August 12, 2007, a Bombardier Q400 operated by Jeju Air carrying 74 passengers came off the runway due to strong winds at the southern Busan-Gimhae airport, resulting in a dozen injuries. (AFP, AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A prototype of the CR450 bullet train that will run at 400 kilometres per hour made its debut in Beijing on Sunday, said the country's railway operator.
 <br>
  <br>
  China Railway said the train, which has a sleek, bullet-shaped nose and resembles an arrow when viewed from the side, is capable of running at a top speed of 450 kilometres per hour during trials.
  <br>
  <br>
  It’s tipped to become the world’s fastest commercial train when it starts operations next year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Reports said the train can essentially cut travel time from Beijing to Shanghai from the current four hours, to just 2.5 hours.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Norwegian police said an officer in his twenties and a suspect had died after an overnight shootout on Saturday in the Nordic nation where police rarely die in the line of duty.
 <br>
  <br>
  The last time a police officer was shot and killed in the line of duty in Norway dated back to 2004, according to the Norwegian news broadcaster NRK.
  <br>
  <br>
  Saturday's deadly shooting took place in Klepp near the city of Stavanger in southwest Norway, and also resulted in another officer being wounded, police said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The mission last night had the worst possible outcome. Two human lives have been lost and the police have lost a dear colleague," said police commissioner Marie Benedicte Bjornland in a statement on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is the ultimate and most tragic consequence of police work," she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police had been alerted to reports of a threatening situation involving weapons after midnight on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two police officers and the suspected gunman in his forties, who was sitting in a car, were shot in the subsequent exchange of gunfire.
  <br>
  <br>
  Critically injured, one of the police officers and the suspected man died on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fatal shootings of police officers are extremely rare in Norway and the other Nordic nations.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is a very serious and tragic event that affects us all", said Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store to NRK. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 An Israeli military raid targeting Hamas militants has forced a major hospital in northern Gaza out of service and led to the detention of its director, the WHO and health officials said on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The assault on Kamal Adwan Hospital has rendered the facility "useless", further worsening Gaza's severe health crisis, the Palestinian territory's health officials said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The World Health Organisation said the operation had put the "last major health facility in north Gaza out of service."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Initial reports indicate that some key departments were severely burnt and destroyed during the raid," it added in a statement on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  The WHO said 60 health workers and 25 patients in critical condition, including some on ventilators, reportedly remained in the hospital.
  <br>
  <br>
  Patients in moderate to severe condition were forced to evacuate to the destroyed, non-functioning Indonesian Hospital, the UN health agency said, adding it was "deeply concerned for their safety."
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamas-run Gaza's health ministry reported that Israeli forces had detained Kamal Adwan's director, Hossam Abu Safiyeh, along with several medical staff members.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gaza's civil defence agency said Abu Safiyeh was held alongside its north Gaza chief, Ahmed Hassan al-Kahlout.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Israeli military did not comment on the detentions. (AFP)

    EU universal charger rules come into force

<img alt="Apple, the world's biggest seller of smartphones, had been slow to comply. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1785316_1_20241228205033.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 EU rules requiring all new smartphones, tablets and cameras to use the same charger came into force on Saturday, in a change Brussels said will cut costs and waste.
 <br>
  <br>
  Manufacturers are now obliged to fit devices sold in the 27-nation bloc with a USB-C, the port chosen by the European Union as the common standard for charging electronic tools.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Starting today, all new mobile phones, tablets, digital cameras, headphones, speakers, keyboards and many other electronics sold in the EU will have to be equipped with a USB Type-C charging port," the EU Parliament wrote on social media X.
  <br>
  <br>
  The EU has said the single charger rule will simplify the lives of Europeans and slash costs for consumers.
  <br>
  <br>
  By allowing consumers to purchase a new device without a new charger, it will also reduce the mountain of obsolete chargers, the bloc has argued.
  <br>
  <br>
  The law was first approved in 2022 following a tussle with US tech giant Apple. It allowed companies until December 28 this year to adapt.
  <br>
  <br>
  Makers of laptops will have extra time, from early 2026, to also follow suit.
  <br>
  <br>
  Most devices already use these cables, but Apple was more than a little reluctant.
  <br>
  <br>
  The firm said in 2021 that such regulation "stifles innovation", but by September last year it had begun shipping phones with the new port.
  <br>
  <br>
  Makers of electronic consumer items in Europe had agreed on a single charging norm from dozens on the market a decade ago under a voluntary agreement with the European Commission.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Apple, the world's biggest seller of smartphones, refused to abide by it and ditch its Lightning ports.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other manufacturers kept their alternative cables going, meaning there were about half a dozen types knocking around, creating a jumble of cables for consumers.
  <br>
  <br>
  USB-C ports can charge at up to 100 Watts, transfer data up to 40 gigabits per second, and be used to hook up to external displays.
  <br>
  <br>
  At the time of its approval, the commission said the law was expected to save at least 200 million euros (US$208 million) per year and cut more than a thousand tonnes of EU electronic waste every year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's time for THE charger," the European Commission wrote on X on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It means better charging technology, reduced e-waste, and less fuss to find the chargers you need." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Russia warned on Saturday of severe environmental damage from a huge oil spill in the Black Sea caused when two tankers collided in a storm near Crimea, which declared a state of emergency.
 <br>
  <br>
  One tanker sank and another ran aground on December 15 in the Kerch Strait between Russia and the annexed Crimean peninsula.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thousands of volunteers have been mobilised for clean-up operations that have been criticised as insufficient by some Russian scientists.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tankers were carrying 9,200 tonnes of fuel oil, around 40 percent of which may have spilled into the sea, according to authorities.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The situation is truly critical," said Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, quoted by Russian press agencies.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is unfortunately impossible to calculate for the moment the extent of the environmental damage but specialists are working regularly on it," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Moscow-installed governor of Crimea, Sergei Aksionov, said on Telegram he had declared a state of emergency "because of the oil products spill in the Kerch Strait."
  <br>
  <br>
  Russia's transport ministry insisted on Saturday that "all polluted aquatic areas that have been identified have been cleaned" and "no recurring pollution has been detected."
  <br>
  <br>
  But Emergency Situations Minister Alexander Kurenkov was more cautious, saying: "The threat of a new fuel oil leak in the Black Sea from the tankers and spills on the coast persists."
  <br>
  <br>
  President Vladimir Putin earlier this month called the oil spill an "ecological disaster." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Air travellers in Britain faced further disruption on Saturday, as fog that has blanketed much of the country in recent days grounded flights and hampered landings and take-offs.
 <br>
  <br>
  London Gatwick airport was most affected, according to aircraft tracking website Flightradar24.
  <br>
  <br>
  Various airports saw disruption on Friday, including Manchester and the country's busiest hub, Heathrow.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As widespread fog continues to affect some UK airports today, temporary air traffic restrictions remain in place at locations with low visibility," the air traffic control authority NATS said.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said the restrictions were to maintain safety and that its teams were working closely with the airports and airlines to minimise disruption.
  <br>
  <br>
  In some areas, thick fog patches could reduce visibility down to just 100 metres, Britain's weather agency, the Met Office, said.
  <br>
  <br>
  A spokesperson for Gatwick Airport said the temporary air traffic restrictions in place due to fog causing poor visibility could lead to delays "throughout the day."
  <br>
  <br>
  The disruption comes at one of the busiest times of the year for air travel. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Jaylen Brown delivered a 44-point gem as the NBA champion Boston Celtics snapped a two-game losing streak with a 142-105 blowout of the Indiana Pacers on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Brown set the tone with 15 points in the first quarter, when the Celtics out-scored the Pacers 39-22 to take control.
  <br>
  <br>
  He finished with six of the Celtics' 23 three-pointers and came up with four steals, posting his highest scoring output since he scored 50 in a win over Orlando in January 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He was big-time," Celtics coach Joe Mazzulla said of Brown, who energised the TD Garden crowd with an array of thunderous dunks. "He has the ability to impact a team and an arena with his energy and his physicality.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When he gets into a certain zone he just gets locked in, and you kind of saw that on both ends of the floor."
  <br>
  <br>
  Jayson Tatum scored 22 points and pulled down 13 rebounds and Payton Pritchard added 18 points, eight rebounds and 10 assists off the bench for the Celtics, who shrugged off the absence of Kristaps Porzingis and Jrue Holiday to post their biggest points total of the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tyrese Haliburton scored 19 points and Bennedict Mathurin scored 18 for the Pacers, who were without injured Obi Toppin and Andrew Nembhard.
  <br>
  <br>
  The lopsided win over the team they vanquished in last season's Eastern Conference finals saw the Celtics avoid their first three-game skid of the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also kept them in touch with Eastern Conference leaders Cleveland, who improved their league-best record to 27-4 with a 149-135 victory over the Denver Nuggets.
  <br>
  <br>
  Donovan Mitchell scored 33 points to lead six Cavaliers players in double figures as Cleveland won their sixth straight – and their 10th in 11 games.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Cavs drilled 23 three-pointers and led by as many as 21, withstanding a triple-double of 27 points, 14 rebounds and 13 assists from Denver's NBA Most Valuable Player Nikola Jokic.
  <br>
  <br>
  It came down to the wire in Houston, where Minnesota's Anthony Edwards drilled a step-back three-pointer with 23.2 seconds remaining to lift the Timberwolves to a 113-112 victory over the Rockets.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fred VanVleet had a chance to win it for Houston, but missed a three-pointer with 1.8 seconds left.
  <br>
  <br>
  Julius Randle scored 27 points and Edwards finished with 24 for the Timberwolves, who trailed by 16 points, 106-90, with 4:57 left to play.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Made it happen!" Edwards said. "Got some stops, we made some big shots – made a big shot at the end right there."
  <br>
  <br>
  Alperen Sengun led the Rockets with 38 points and 12 rebounds. Amen Thompson added 20 points as all five Houston starters scored in double figures only to come up short at the end.
  <br>
  <br>
  The New York Knicks pushed their winning streak to six games with a convincing 108-85 victory over the Magic in Orlando.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jalen Brunson scored 26 points and handed out nine assists and Josh Hart added 23 points and 13 rebounds for the Knicks, who made just four of their 15 three-point attempts but converted 24 of their 34 free-throw attempts.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Magic, with top contributors Paolo Banchero, Franz Wagner and Moritz Wagner on the injured list, were led by 27 points from Jalen Suggs.
  <br>
  <br>
  San Antonio star Victor Wembanyama delivered 19 points and seven rebounds as the Spurs heated up in the second half to beat the Nets 96-87 in Brooklyn.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Spurs connected on just 11 of their 40 shot attempts in the first half and were tied 41-41 at half-time.
  <br>
  <br>
  They broke it open in the third quarter, connecting on 13 of their 18 shots. Wembanyama made four of his five attempts in the period, including three three-pointers, as the Spurs seized a 74-62 lead going into the fourth quarter. (AFP)

    Indian state funeral for former PM Manmohan Singh

<img alt="Soldiers accompany the coffin of India's late former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh through the streets of New Delhi. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1785299_1_20241228162108.jpg&q=55">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 India on Saturday accorded former premier Manmohan Singh, one of the architects of the country's economic liberalisation in the early 1990s, a state funeral with full military honours, complete with a gun salute.
 <br>
  <br>
  Singh, who held office from 2004 to 2014, died at the age of 92 on Thursday, after which seven days of state mourning were declared.
  <br>
  <br>
  The honours were led by President Draupadi Murmu with Prime Minister Narendra Modi in attendance, along with the country's top civilian and military officials. Bhutan's King Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck also attended the ceremony.
  <br>
  <br>
  Opposition leader Rahul Gandhi, who called the former prime minister his mentor and guide, joined Singh's family as they prayed before his cremation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier, mourners gathered to pay their respects to Singh. His coffin, draped in garlands of flowers, was flanked by a guard of honour and carried to his Congress Party headquarters in New Delhi.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was then taken through the capital to the cremation grounds, accompanied by guards of soldiers and accorded full state honours.
  <br>
  <br>
  Modi called Singh one of India's "most distinguished leaders."
  <br>
  <br>
  US President Joe Biden called Singh a "true statesman," saying that he "charted pathbreaking progress that will continue to strengthen our nations – and the world – for generations to come."
  <br>
  <br>
  The former prime minister was an understated technocrat who was hailed for overseeing an economic boom in his first term.
  <br>
  <br>
  Singh's second stint ended with a series of major corruption scandals, slowing growth and high inflation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Singh's unpopularity in his second term, and lacklustre leadership by Nehru-Gandhi scion Rahul Gandhi, the current opposition leader in the lower house, led to Modi's first landslide victory in 2014.
  <br>
  <br>
  Born in 1932 in the mud-house village of Gah in what is now Pakistan and was then British-ruled India, Singh studied economics to find a way to eradicate poverty in the vast nation.
  <br>
  <br>
  He won scholarships to attend both Cambridge, where he obtained a first in economics, and Oxford, where he completed his doctorate.
  <br>
  <br>
  Singh worked in a string of senior civil service posts, served as a central bank governor and also held various jobs with global agencies including the United Nations.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was tapped in 1991 by then Congress prime minister PV Narasimha Rao to serve as finance minister and reel India back from the worst financial crisis in its modern history.
  <br>
  <br>
  Though he had never held an elected post, he was declared the National Congress's candidate for the highest office in 2004.
  <br>
  <br>
  In his first term, Singh steered the economy through a period of nine percent growth, lending India the international clout it had long sought.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also sealed a landmark nuclear deal with the United States that he said would help India meet its growing energy needs.
  <br>
  <br>
  President Murmu said Singh would "always be remembered for his service to the nation, his unblemished political life and his utmost humility." (AFP)

    'Yoon authorised shooting during martial law bid'

<img alt='According to a prosecution indictment report, troops trying to enter the National Assembly on December 3 were told to get in quickly, "even if it means shooting." Photo: AFP' src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1785298_1_20241228161211.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korea's suspended president Yoon Suk Yeol authorised the military to fire their weapons if needed to enter parliament during his failed bid to impose martial law, according to a prosecutors' report.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 10-page summary from former defence minister Kim Yong-hyun's prosecution indictment report, which was provided to the media, also says Yoon vowed on December 3 to declare martial law three times if necessary.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon, who was stripped of his duties by the National Assembly this month, is under investigation for his short-lived attempt to scrap civilian rule, which plunged the country into political turmoil and led to his impeachment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon's lawyer Yoon Kab-keun dismissed the prosecutors' report, saying it was "a one-sided account that neither corresponds to objective circumstances nor common sense."
  <br>
  <br>
  As lawmakers rushed to parliament on December 3 to vote down Yoon's martial law declaration, heavily armed troops stormed the building, scaling fences, smashing windows and landing by helicopter.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to the prosecution indictment report, Yoon told the chief of the capital defence command, Lee Jin-woo, that military forces could shoot if necessary to enter the National Assembly.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Have you still not got in? What are you doing? Break down the door and drag them out, even if it means shooting," Yoon told Lee, according to the report.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon also allegedly told the head of the Defence Counterintelligence Command, General Kwak Jong-keun, to "quickly get inside" the National Assembly since the quorum for the martial law declaration to be lifted had not been met.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So quickly get inside the National Assembly and bring out the people inside the chamber, and break down the doors with an axe if necessary and drag everyone out," the report quotes Yoon as saying at the time.
  <br>
  <br>
  After lawmakers rushed inside parliament and voted 190-0 to nullify Yoon's declaration in the early hours of December 4, the report says Yoon told Lee, "Even if it's lifted, I can declare martial law a second or third time, so just keep going."
  <br>
  <br>
  The report also included screenshots of senior defence officials' messages from the day of the martial law declaration.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said there was evidence that Yoon had been discussing declaring martial law with senior military officials as early as March.
  <br>
  <br>
  The declaration followed a budget tussle between Yoon's party and the opposition.
  <br>
  <br>
  Days later, Yoon said in a speech that he apologised for the "anxiety and inconvenience" and promised that there would not be a second declaration of martial law.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ex-defence minister Kim was arrested this month over his role in the failed martial law bid.
  <br>
  <br>
  Opposition Democratic Party lawmaker Kang Sun-woo said in a statement on Saturday that "the prosecution has laid bare the undeniable ugly truth about Yoon Suk Yeol, the treasonous ringleader," adding that he must be "arrested immediately."
  <br>
  <br>
  South Korea's Constitutional Court held its first preliminary hearing on the validity of Yoon's impeachment on Friday, with the suspended president's legal team attending.
  <br>
  <br>
  The court will also decide the fate of Yoon's replacement, Han Duck-soo, who was impeached on Friday over his refusal to complete Yoon's impeachment process and bring him to justice. (AFP)

    Reddy's defiant maiden ton claws India back into Test

<img alt="Nitish Kumar Reddy celebrates after passing 100 on day three of the fourth Test against Australia. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1785295_1_20241228154625.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Nitish Kumar Reddy scored a defiant maiden century on Saturday as India fought back to reach 358-9 on a rain-hit third day of the fourth Test against Australia.
 <br>
  <br>
  Rising all-rounder Reddy was applauded off the Melbourne Cricket Ground on 105 not out after rain ended play for the day midway through the final session.
  <br>
  <br>
  Having provided much-needed stability to another shaky Indian batting effort, the 21-year-old will resume on Sunday alongside Mohammed Siraj, on two, with the first-innings deficit reduced to 116 runs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Australia's push for a much bigger advantage after scoring 474 was stymied by Reddy and spin-bowling all-rounder Washington Sundar, who scored 50 as the pair put on 127 for the eighth wicket.
  <br>
  <br>
  To the roar of a large contingent of Indian supporters among a record 83,073 third-day crowd at the MCG, Reddy lofted Scott Boland over mid-on to reach three figures just before play was halted.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was an innings memorable for resolute defence, mixed with classical strokeplay.
  <br>
  <br>
  Reddy faced 176 balls, hitting 10 fours and one six, continuing the fine batting form that has marked his debut series.
  <br>
  <br>
  In his first six Test innings, he has scored 284 runs at an average of 71.
  <br>
  <br>
  Seamers Boland, who took 3-57, and Pat Cummins with 3-86 were the most productive Australian bowlers in conditions that offered little assistance despite overcast skies.
  <br>
  <br>
  The recalled Sundar's dogged knock off 162 balls ended when he was caught at first slip by Steve Smith from off-spinner Nathan Lyon.
  <br>
  <br>
  It ended a partnership that traversed the entire second session after India had advanced from 164-5 overnight to 244-7 at lunch.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sundar survived the most freakish moment of the day when on 18.
  <br>
  <br>
  Attempting to flick a leg-sided delivery from Mitchell Starc, the ball flew from the back of the bat into the slip cordon where a diving Smith spilled a one-handed opportunity.
  <br>
  <br>
  India lost Rishabh Pant and Ravindra Jadeja in the opening session.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pant's innings of 28 ended when he over-balanced while attempting a ramp shot for six off Boland, top-edging the ball to third man where Lyon held the catch.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jadeja was trapped lbw when on 17, playing back to a Lyon delivery that skidded on.
  <br>
  <br>
  The crowd of 83,073 was a record for the third day of a Boxing Day Test, according to Cricket Australia, and the largest day three crowd at the Melbourne Cricket Ground since 1937.
  <br>
  <br>
  The record total attendance for a Boxing Day Test is 271,865, which looks certain to be smashed on Sunday after 255,462 spectators came through the gates on the first three days.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rain threatened throughout the day and about 40 minutes of play was lost in a period either side of tea.
  <br>
  <br>
  The series is locked at 1-1 with the fifth and final Test to be played in Sydney next week. (AFP)

    Arsenal edge Ipswich to go second in Premier League

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Arsenal began life without Bukayo Saka by beating Ipswich 1-0 to move into second place in the English Premier League and cut Liverpool's lead to six points on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Kai Havertz scored the only goal as Arsenal failed to turn their dominance into a more convincing scoreline.
  <br>
  <br>
  The lack of a clinical goalscorer may ultimately cost Mikel Arteta's men a first league title in more than 20 years, but they took advantage of Chelsea's shock 2-1 defeat against Fulham on Thursday to become Liverpool's closest challenger.
  <br>
  <br>
  Saka is set to be sidelined for "many weeks" in the words of Gunners' boss Arteta with fears the England international could be out until March due to a hamstring injury suffered in last weekend's 5-1 victory at Crystal Palace.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arteta's solution was to start with Gabriel Martinelli in Saka's normal role wide right with Gabriel Jesus continuing up front after scoring five times in Arsenal's previous two outings.
  <br>
  <br>
  The home side were dominant in possession but had few clear-cut chances to show for it until the final quarter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal were frustrated by Everton in a 0-0 draw in their last league game at the Emirates so there was relief when Havertz broke the deadlock on 23 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The German prodded high into the net from Leandro Trossard's low cross for his 12th goal of the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jesus did find the net once more with a cheeky finish between the legs of Arijanet Muric from an almost impossible angle, but was flagged offside.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal's prowess from set-pieces has been well-documented and they should have added to their goals from corners this season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gabriel Magalhaes headed against the outside of the post from point-blank range when it seemed easier to score.
  <br>
  <br>
  As Ipswich's ambition grew as the second half wore on, so the chances at the other end began to flow.
  <br>
  <br>
  Martin Odegaard had given the home crowd a scare by going down holding the left ankle that saw him sidelined by injury for two months earlier in the campaign.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Arsenal captain, though, was quickly back on his feet and weaving his way through the Ipswich defence with a mazy run and powerful strike that Muric tipped over.
  <br>
  <br>
  From the resulting corner, Declan Rice's powerful shot was blocked by Dara O'Shea.
  <br>
  <br>
  Havertz then wasted a glorious chance for his second and Muric saved once more from Mikel Merino to ensure a nervy ending.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Arsenal held out to leapfrog Nottingham Forest and Chelsea into second.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ipswich remain second from bottom, three points adrift of safety.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brighton missed the chance to move within one point of the top five as their poor run continued in a 0-0 draw at home to Brentford.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Seagulls are now winless in their past six games but they remain two points above their opponents.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brentford had the ball in the net early on through Yoane Wissa but the goal was ruled out for offside after a VAR check.
  <br>
  <br>
  Just Brentford's second point away from home all season is enough to edge the Bees ahead of Tottenham into 11th. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 One Mega Millions player has plenty of dough to ring in the New Year after drawing the winning number. After three months without anyone winning the top prize, a ticket worth an estimated US$1.22 billion was sold for the drawing on Friday night.
 <br>
  <br>
  The winner matched the white balls 3, 7, 37, 49, 55 and the gold Mega Ball 6. The identity of the winner was not immediately known.
  <br>
  <br>
  The total amount of the Mega Millions jackpot would only be distributed to a winner who chooses an annuity paid over 29 years. Nearly all grand prize winners opt to take a cash payout, which for Friday night’s drawing is an estimated US$549.7 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite the game’s long odds of 1 in 302.6 million, players continued to purchase tickets as the size of the grand prize grew. Until Friday, the last time a Mega Millions player hit the top prize was September 10.
  <br>
  <br>
  The largest-ever Mega Millions jackpot ticket worth US$1.6 billion was sold in Florida in August 2023. Two prizes for its compatriot Powerball lottery have been larger.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mega Millions and Powerball are sold in 45 states, as well as Washington DC, and the US Virgin Islands. Powerball also is sold in Puerto Rico. (AP)

<img alt="Quality Tourism Services Association chairman Simon Wong says the catering and retail industries need to adapt. File Photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1785288_1_20241228125627.jpg&q=65">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The chairman of the Quality Tourism Services Association on Saturday reassured the catering and retail sectors that they will still have business as long as they grasp the new consumption habits of mainland tourists.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a television programme, Simon Wong pointed out that the industries should not expect mainland visitors to fork out as much as they used to.
  <br>
  <br>
  He revealed that compared to the peak of pre-Covid times, the spend for each mainland tourist who stays overnight has reduced by HK$3,000 in retail, which is the greatest among all sectors.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong said this might not be due to weaker consumption power among mainlanders.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The catering and retail industries should start to accept that the so-called weakening spending power of tourists from the mainland might only be them normalising their spending," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Maybe we should not fantasise that their spending will be doubled within a short period of time, to be as high as in the past. It might be because their consumption power was particularly strong at that time, and it is only now normalising."
  <br>
  <br>
  While the market will not be booming, he said there will still be business for the catering and retail industries if they recognise such changes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, Wong estimated that businesses have surged up to 20 percent month-on-month during the Christmas holidays.
  <br>
  <br>
  But it has dropped by 10 percent compared to a year ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that the resumption of the multi-entry visa scheme for Shenzhen residents has also boosted the economy.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Invest Hong Kong (InvestHK) said it will expand its overseas network in search for more investment opportunities.
 <br>
  <br>
  Startups in Hong Kong employed about 18-thousand people this year, according to the agency, which was a seven percent growth year-on-year, making a substantial contribution to the labour market.
  <br>
  <br>
  InvestHK's director-general, Alpha Lau, said on Saturday that the government spent a lot of effort in promoting emerging sectors and companies.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The 2024 startup survey shows that we have got a remarkable growth in the total number of startups. Now we have 4,700, up 10 percent from last year," she said in an interview with the Information Services Department.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This year we have seen some new sectors emerging, indicating that the Hong Kong government’s effort to promote industries in this area has now seen a very good result."
  <br>
  <br>
  CEO of a local fintech startup, Ben Wong, said Hong Kong's well-established financial structure was vital for his company's development.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We want to be an international company and Hong Kong provides us with that base on the strategic location. In just a four-hour ride we are able to go into Southeast Asia," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The talent in Hong Kong to me, when it comes to being able to support a financial business, is one of the best in the world. They are highly skilled, and also highly knowledgeable, in helping us grow our business. At the same time, we have been able to also attract international talent."
  <br>
  <br>
  InvestHK said it will particularly focus on countries along the Belt and Road Initiative, and that a new office will be established in Turkey in the first quarter of next year.

    International driving permit kiosks to be launched

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Self-service kiosks where the public can apply for international driving permits will soon be up and running at two locations in Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Transport Department said they can be found at two licensing offices, in Admiralty and Cheung Sha Wan, from January 13, 2025.
  <br>
  <br>
  There will be a daily quota of around 32 applications per kiosk, and  drivers can make reservations from Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The department's CEO of licensing, Chow Wai, said the application process will now be easier for the public with the two kiosks.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They can get their permit within the same day or within an hour after submitting the application. If they use the non-counter means - [applying] online, [via] drop-in box, or by post, usually it would take up to ten working days to send the permit to the applicants," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "One of the benefits of using the kiosk is that they can save waiting time to get the permit."
  <br>
  <br>
  The department said drivers need an iAM Smart+ account, with a digital signing function of a valid personal digital certificate, to use the kiosks.
  <br>
  <br>
  It added that authorities will look into whether more licensing offices can introduce self-service kiosks.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Technology minister Sun Dong said that the business community has a key role to play in Hong Kong's pursuit of becoming an innovation and technology hub.
 <br>
  <br>
  He told an RTHK radio programme on Saturday that I&T is crucial in attaining economic growth.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In terms of the development of the I&T sector, it is without a doubt that the government will play an important leading role, but the government alone is not enough. The whole of society has to participate," Sun said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Therefore, the government's major challenge ahead is how to unite all sectors, particularly business, to boost the development of I&T in the coming five to ten years."
  <br>
  <br>
  He also revealed that the government will roll out land preferential measures to attract businesses to set up production lines in the region.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sun said the Innovation, Technology and Industry Bureau has been conducting talks with relevant organisations, such as the Science Park, and he hopes the policies can be introduced in the near future.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The measures will focus on attracting strategic enterprises to set up factories, production lines as well as actual production facilities and links that can create value to Hong Kong's economic growth," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Of course, apart from providing them land at an attractive price, we will also require these companies to have a certain value of output and return to society within a certain period."
  <br>
  <br>
  Sun also pointed out that the first three buildings of the Hong Kong section of the Hetao Shenzhen-Hong Kong Science and Technology Innovation Cooperation Zone, are expected to be launched next year, adding that leasing arrangements are underway.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tech zone that spans across the Shenzhen River consists of 87-hectare Hong Kong Park, and 300-hectare Shenzhen Park.

    US homelessness hits new record in 2024: report

<div class="itemFullText">
 The number of people in the United States experiencing homelessness reached a new record this year, with lingering inflation and high housing prices among likely drivers, a government report said on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  An estimated 771,480 people were homeless on a single night in January 2024, rising 18 percent from 2023, said the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) in an annual assessment.
  <br>
  <br>
  This translates to about 23 in every 10,000 people in the country, home to the world's biggest economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  The uptick came as households felt the pressure from housing costs, with the median rent for January 2024 being 20 percent higher than that in January 2021, according to the National Low Income Housing Coalition.
  <br>
  <br>
  Apart from housing costs, the HUD report flagged "stagnating wages among middle- and lower-income households, and the persisting effects of systemic racism" as other factors.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other contributing issues included natural disasters that displaced people, rising immigration and an end to homelessness prevention programs introduced during the Covid-19 pandemic.
  <br>
  <br>
  "While this data is nearly a year old, and no longer reflects the situation we are seeing, it is critical that we focus on evidence-based efforts to prevent and end homelessness," said HUD agency head Adrianne Todman in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nearly 150,000 children experienced homelessness on a single night this year, a 33 percent jump over 2023, the report said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Children under the age of 18 were the age group seeing the biggest surge in homelessness between 2023 and 2024. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Gao Xinyu came back from one set down and Zhang Zhizhen was almost flawless as China began the mixed team United Cup with a 3-0 victory over Brazil in Perth on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  China had a 2-0 lead ahead of the mixed doubles after Gao and Zhang prevailed in contrasting singles matches at RAC Arena.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fifth-seeded China's chances of a deep run in the tournament appeared to take a major hit when women's world No. 5 Zheng Qinwen pulled out, prioritising rest ahead of the Australian Open.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the 175th-ranked Gao filled her shoes brilliantly after bravely overcoming cramp to edge Beatriz Haddad Maia 5-7, 6-4, 7-5 in a three-hour, 22-minute thriller that was the longest women's singles match in the tournament's history.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gao required a medical timeout in the second set and had her left thigh heavily strapped before the 17th-ranked Haddad Maia also succumbed to cramp during a gripping third set and resorted to several underhand serves.
  <br>
  <br>
  Haddad Maia moved better after that, but Gao was not to be denied and clinched the biggest victory of her career in her first match against a top 50-ranked player.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I have no idea what happened, my brain was empty and my whole body was cramping," Gao said. "It's a really big stage and it was a high quality match. I just pushed myself."
  <br>
  <br>
  It was far easier for the 45th-ranked Zhang, who thrashed Thiago Monteiro 6-3, 6-0 in a 54-minute demolition.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zhang dictated rallies from the back of the court and completely overwhelmed his 109th-ranked opponent to ensure China sealed the Group E tie. (Xinhua)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Sacramento Kings have fired their head coach Mike Brown, ESPN reported on Friday, citing sources.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Kings lost each of a recent five-game home-stand and sit 12th in the Western Conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  ESPN said sources had told them that assistant coach Doug Christie is expected to take over on an interim basis.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sacramento is 13-18 this season, three games behind the last playoff position, and lost 114-113 to the Detroit Pistons on Thursday, blowing a 19-point third quarter lead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brown was voted the NBA's Coach of the Year in 2023 after ending the Kings' 16-year absence from the playoffs. He was handed a three-year contract extension in June.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 54-year-old has previously coached the Cleveland Cavaliers and the Los Angeles Lakers and was an assistant coach to Steve Kerr at the Golden State Warriors before joining Sacramento. (AFP)

    Trump asks US Supreme Court to pause TikTok ban

<img alt="US President-elect Donald Trump said TikTok is needed for competition. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1785258_1_20241228064422.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President-elect Donald Trump filed a brief on Friday urging the Supreme Court to pause a law that would ban TikTok the day before his January 20 inauguration if it is not sold by its Chinese owner ByteDance.
 <br>
  <br>
  "In light of the novelty and difficulty of this case, the court should consider staying the statutory deadline to grant more breathing space to address these issues," Trump's legal team wrote, to give him "the opportunity to pursue a political resolution."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump was fiercely opposed to TikTok during his 2017-21 first term, and tried in vain to ban the video app on national security grounds.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump called for a US company to buy TikTok, with the government sharing in the sale price, and his successor Joe Biden went one stage further - signing a law to ban the app for the same reasons.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has now, however, reversed course.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Now (that) I'm thinking about it, I'm for TikTok, because you need competition," he recently told Bloomberg.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If you don't have TikTok, you have Facebook and Instagram -- and that's, you know, that's Zuckerberg."
  <br>
  <br>
  Facebook, founded by Mark Zuckerberg and part of his Meta tech empire, was among the social media networks that banned Trump after attacks by his supporters on the US Capitol on January 6, 2021.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ban was driven by concerns that he would use the platform to promote more violence.
  <br>
  <br>
  Those bans on major social media platforms were later lifted.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the brief filed on Friday, Trump's lawyer made it clear the president-elect did not take a position on the legal merits of the current case.
  <br>
  <br>
  "President Trump takes no position on the underlying merits of this dispute," John Sauer wrote in the amicus curiae - or "friend of the court" - brief.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Instead, he respectfully requests that the court consider staying the act's deadline for divestment of January 19, 2025, while it considers the merits of this case, thus permitting President Trump's incoming Administration the opportunity to pursue a political resolution of the questions at issue in the case."

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks stumbled on Friday as major companies saw their shares fall towards the end of a holiday week.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.8 percent to 42,992, while the broad-based S&P 500 slid 1.1 percent to 5,970.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index plunged 1.5 percent to 19,722.
  <br>
  <br>
  Steve Sosnick of Interactive Brokers said the sell-off caught many people by surprise.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think a lot of people got very complacent about the idea that we would have a Santa Claus rally," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was referring to a tendency for markets to fare well in the last five trading days of the year, and the first two in the new year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The selling is very much across-the-board. There's not an obvious catalyst for it today," said Sosnick, noting that the trend was more ferocious as volumes were light.
  <br>
  <br>
  Major companies in particular saw their shares fall, with Microsoft slipping 1.7 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Amazon lost 1.4 percent, while Nvidia dropped 2.0 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Peter Cardillo of Spartan Capital said the slump was both a "year-end adjustment" and due to a rise in US Treasury bond yields.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That's putting the brakes on, applying the brakes to the market," he said. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A man who killed 35 people in a car attack in Zhuhai last month was on Friday sentenced to death.
 <br>
  <br>
  Fan Weiqiu was on trial at the Zhuhai Intermediate People's Court on charges of endangering public safety by dangerous means.
  <br>
  <br>
  The court heard that Fan, 62, deliberately drove through people exercising outside a sports complex in his small SUV on November 11.
  <br>
  <br>
  The court said his motives "were extremely vile, the nature of the crime extremely egregious, the methods particularly cruel, and the consequences particularly severe, posing significant harm to society", state media said.
  <br>
  <br>
  In front of some of the victims' families, officials and members of the public, Fan pleaded guilty, it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The court found Fan had decided to vent his anger over a broken marriage, personal frustrations and dissatisfaction with the division of property after divorce, the report said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fan was also deprived of his political rights for life.
  <br>
  <br>
  The incident in Zhuhai has been described as the worst attack in China in a decade. (Xinhua/AFP)

<img alt="Frank-Walter Steinmeier announces a new election will be held on February 23 next year. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1785236_1_20241227214510.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier dissolved parliament on Friday and confirmed the expected February date for an early general election after the collapse of Olaf Scholz's government last month.
 <br>
  <br>
  Scholz's coalition was brought down by internal fights over how to revive Europe's largest economy, but a deadly car-ramming attack at a Christmas market last week has renewed the country's heated debates over security and immigration.
  <br>
  <br>
  Confirming the February 23 date for the election, Steinmeier emphasised the need for "political stability" and appealed for the campaign to be "conducted with respect and decency."
  <br>
  <br>
  A Saudi doctor, Taleb al-Abdulmohsen, 50, was arrested at the scene of the attack on the Christmas market in the eastern city of Magdeburg which left five people dead and more than 200 injured.
  <br>
  <br>
  Interior Minister Nancy Fraser has said Abdulmohsen held "Islamophobic" views but his exact motive remains unclear.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the wake of the attack, Scholz appealed to Germans to "link arms" and to not allow "hatred to determine our coexistence."
  <br>
  <br>
  The conservative CDU/CSU is leading in the polls on around 32 percent under its leader Friedrich Merz and even before last week's attack it had been promising a harder line on immigration as well as a rightward shift on social and economic policy.
  <br>
  <br>
  In second place on 19 percent is the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), which held what it called a "memorial" rally in Magdeburg on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  At the event, the AfD's regional leader Jan Wenzel Schmidt said Germany could "no longer take in madmen from all over the world" and demanded the country "close the borders." (AFP)

<img alt="Steve Smith's epic innings ended when he danced down the wicket looking to drive but got an inside edge, with the ball bouncing off his pads and trickling onto leg stump. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1785235_1_20241227213610.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Australia's fiery pace attack destroyed India's top order on Friday to put them in the driving seat of the fourth Test after they set a daunting first innings target on the back of Steve Smith's 34th Test century.
 <br>
  <br>
  The visitors were 164-5 at the close on day two at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, still 310 runs adrift after Australia were out for 474 soon after lunch on the back of Smith's stylish 140.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rishabh Pant was not out six and Ravindra Jadeja on four, with three wickets in the final half-hour bursting India's momentum after they were 153-2.
  <br>
  <br>
  Scott Boland and Pat Cummins grabbed two wickets each.
  <br>
  <br>
  Skipper Rohit Sharma reverted to his usual role as opener after dropping to six in the past two Tests.
  <br>
  <br>
  But it did nothing to help his woeful recent form and he was out for three, spooning an attempted pull shot off Pat Cummins to Boland at mid-on for a simple catch.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cummins pounced again to remove the in-form KL Rahul with the last ball before tea, bowling him for 24.
  <br>
  <br>
  But opener Yashasvi Jaiswal stood firm with a high-quality innings, playing well off the front foot and crunching a series of stylish boundaries in his 82.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 22-year-old, who scored 161 in the first Test at Perth, looked destined for another century but threw his wicket away in a comical mix up with Virat Kohli.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jaiswal set off for a quick single off Boland but his teammate said no, leaving the youngster stranded, ending a dangerous 102-run stand.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kohli, who was fined 20 percent of his match fee for a day one shoulder charge on Australian debutant Sam Konstas, was caught behind by Alex Carey for 36 off Boland, who then removed nightwatchman Akash Deep without scoring.
  <br>
  <br>
  The hosts resumed on 311-6 after a dominant opening day and plundered another 163 runs, with the composed Smith slamming 13 fours and three sixes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Smith padded up again on 68, with Cummins alongside him on eight.
  <br>
  <br>
  They took 15 off one Deep over before Smith hooked Jasprit Bumrah for six to rub salt in the wounds, with India's body language showing their frustration.
  <br>
  <br>
  Smith reached his 34th Test century with a boundary off Nitish Kumar Reddy, which came on the back of a return to form in the last Test in Brisbane where he made 101.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was a patient innings from the 35-year-old and moved him alongside four other players on the all-time list of century-makers, including Sunil Gavaskar and Brian Lara.
  <br>
  <br>
  Only six men have scored more, led by Sachin Tendulkar's 51.
  <br>
  <br>
  With the landmark out of the way, both men began swinging the bat and Cummins paid the price, caught for a fine 49 by Reddy in the deep off Jadeja to end a 112-run stand.
  <br>
  <br>
  Starc was bowled by Jadeja for 15 in the first over after lunch, with Smith following in bizarre fashion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Facing Deep, he danced down the wicket looking to drive but got an inside edge, with the ball bouncing off his pads and trickling onto leg stump.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nathan Lyon (13) was the final wicket to fall, lbw to Bumrah who ended with 4-99.
  <br>
  <br>
  The five-match series is locked at 1-1 after India won by 295 runs in Perth before being crushed by 10 wickets in Adelaide. The rain-affected third Test in Brisbane was drawn. (AFP)

    Govt outlines plans for two new border towns

<img alt="In documents submitted to the legislature, the government says the planned University Town is within a priority area for development for the New Territories North New Town." src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1785222_1_20241227193051.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government said it plans to build some 180,000 flats in two new towns in northern New Territories near the border, under the final stages of the wider Northern Metropolis project.
 <br>
  <br>
  One of the sites is the New Territories North New Town, which covers more than 1,400 hectares and stretches from the Heung Yuen Wai and Man Kam To border points to near Lo Wu.
  <br>
  <br>
  The land area accounts for about one-third of the entire Northern Metropolis.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Development Bureau said on Friday there will be about 170,000 flats in the new town, housing half a million people.
  <br>
  <br>
  About 200 hectares would be considered a priority zone for development, which includes the University Town – an idea that was floated earlier – an enterprise park in Heung Yuen Wai and a commercial and residential zone near the border.
  <br>
  <br>
  Outside the priority area, officials said the plot could house new industries such as advanced construction and manufacturing. There will also be sites earmarked for sports and culture.
  <br>
  <br>
  The other new town is Ma Tso Lung.
  <br>
  <br>
  It's smaller in size, covering about 55 hectares, and could house around 10,000 units.
  <br>
  <br>
  A Development Bureau spokesperson said officials have scaled back the size of the Ma Tso Lung project, so it won't touch on wetland conservation zones or buffer areas.
  <br>
  <br>
  The spokesperson added the plan is to build mostly private flats in both new towns, noting that the government's target of building 300,000 public flats over a decade is met by plots elsewhere.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Excluding New Territories North and Ma Tso Lung, the government has already found land that can build 410,000 public flats," the spokesperson said. "So from this point of view, it seems we shouldn't give public flats priority when developing these two places."
  <br>
  <br>
  Another spokesperson said the two new towns could be attractive for residents who often travel across the border.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials also said the development scheme would result in the eviction of 13 non-indigenous villages, three of which are in Ma Tso Lung.
  <br>
  <br>
  Construction work for the Ma Tso Lung project will begin in 2027 and that of the priority area in the New Territories North New Town is expected to start a year later.
  <br>
  <br>
  The first batch of residents could move in seven years afterwards.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials will launch a two-month public consultation exercise on the preliminary plans in the middle of next month.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Officials have called on tourists to stay in Hong Kong overnight after the New Year countdown next week.
 <br>
  <br>
  Authorities announced earlier on Friday that service hours at two border crossings will be extended on January 1, with the Shenzhen Bay Control Point operating throughout the early morning hours and the Lo Wu Control Point staying open until 2am, two hours longer than normal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials from the Transport Department said visitors could consider staying in the city after the fireworks display
  <br>
  <br>
  "We encourage mainland tourists to consider staying one more day in Hong Kong after the countdown, so they can fully immerse themselves in the diverse tourism experience in Hong Kong," Principal Transport Officer for the New Territories, Ken Wong, said at a press briefing.
  <br>
  <br>
  There will be a 12-minute fireworks display at Victoria Harbour to usher in 2025.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Acting Superintendent for Kowloon West Traffic, Ho Chun-hin, called on people to use public transport and not to go to the Hung Hom Promenade.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the past, some people would go to the promenade in Hung Hom to watch the fireworks. However, due to ongoing construction work there, it cannot be used as a viewing area this time. We kindly ask members of the public to choose other places," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police also said they will cordon off some roads in Central, Wan Chai, Eastern District and Tsim Sha Tsui in the evening on December 31.

 China on Friday warned the United States it did not tolerate interference over Washington's comments this week on rewards offered by the Hong Kong government leading to the arrest of six national security suspects.
 <br>
  <br>
  "China is strongly dissatisfied and firmly opposes this. Hong Kong affairs are purely China's internal affairs, and we do not tolerate interference and meddling by any external power," Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning told reporters at a regular press briefing.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The extraterritorial application of Hong Kong's national security laws is fully consistent with international law and practice."
  <br>
  <br>
  On Tuesday, Hong Kong authorities announced six more people living overseas were placed on the national security wanted list, offering rewards of HK$1 million each for information leading to their arrest. The US State Department called it "a form of transnational repression", adding some of those individuals were based in the US. (Agencies)

<img alt="National Assembly speaker Woo Won-shik bangs a gavel after the vote to impeach acting President Han Duck-soo. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1785194_1_20241227163536.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korea's parliament impeached acting President Han Duck-soo on Friday over a short-lived martial law, plunging the country deeper into political chaos, as the Constitutional Court said it would swiftly trial suspended President Yoon Suk-yeol.
 <br>
  <br>
  The impeachment of Han, who has been acting president since Yoon was impeached on December 14 for declaring martial law on December 3, has thrown South Korea's once-vibrant democratic success story into uncharted territory.
  <br>
  <br>
  The motion led by opposition parties passed with 192 of the 300 votes amid rowdy scenes by ruling People Power Party members who surrounded the speaker's podium, chanting the vote was invalid and parliament had committed "tyranny".
  <br>
  <br>
  Ahead of the parliamentary session, opposition leader Lee Jae-myung said his Democratic Party, which has majority control of parliament, will go ahead with the plan to impeach the acting president, accusing Han of "acting for insurrection".
  <br>
  <br>
  "The only way to normalise the country is to swiftly root out all the insurrection forces," Lee said in a fiery speech, adding the party was acting on the public order to eradicate those who have put the country at risk.
  <br>
  <br>
  There has been overwhelming public support for Yoon's removal, according to opinion polls conducted after his martial law attempt.
  <br>
  <br>
  The plan for a vote to impeach Han was unveiled on Thursday by the main opposition Democratic Party after he declined to immediately appoint three justices to fill vacancies at the Constitutional Court, saying it would exceed his acting role.
  <br>
  <br>
  Until just before voting began, it was unclear how many votes were needed to impeach Han as acting leader. The threshold for a prime minister is a simple majority, while a two-thirds majority is needed for a president.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaker Woo Won-shik declared a simple majority would constitute parliamentary approval.
  <br>
  <br>
  Han said in a statement after the vote that he would step aside to avoid more chaos and will await a Constitutional Court ruling on his impeachment.
  <br>
  <br>
  By law, Finance Minister Choi Sang-mok will assume the acting presidency.
  <br>
  <br>
  Choi earlier pleaded with parliament to withdraw the plan to impeach Han, saying it would do serious damage to the country's economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  The South Korean won retreated to 1,475.4 per dollar, down 0.53 percent at 0707 GMT ahead of the parliamentary vote.
  <br>
  <br>
  The vote to determine Han's fate comes on the same day the Constitutional Court held its first hearing in a case reviewing whether to overturn the impeachment and reinstate Yoon or remove him permanently from office. It has 180 days to reach a decision. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China on Friday launched its first Type 076 new-generation amphibious assault ship, the Sichuan, in Shanghai.
 <br>
  <br>
  Named after Sichuan province, the independently-developed new vessel was put into the water at a launch-and-naming ceremony.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was given the hull number 51.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Sichuan has a full-load displacement of over 40,000 tonnes and features a dual-island superstructure along with a full-length flight deck.
  <br>
  <br>
  It incorporates innovative electromagnetic catapult and arrestor technologies, enabling it to carry fixed-wing aircraft, helicopters and amphibious equipment.
  <br>
  <br>
  As the new-generation amphibious assault ship of the People's Liberation Army Navy, it plays a key role in advancing the Navy's transformation and enhancing its combat capabilities in the far seas, according to Navy officials.
  <br>
  <br>
  Following its launch, the ship will undergo a series of planned tests, including equipment commissioning, mooring tests and sea trials.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Navy unveiled its inaugural 075-class amphibious assault ship, the Hainan, in Shanghai in 2019. Two more Type 075 amphibious assault ships, the Guangxi and the Anhui, have also been commissioned.  (Xinhua)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Cantonese opera enthusiasts are making the most of the iconic Sunbeam Theatre before it closes down in March after more than 50 years.
 <br>
  <br>
  The theatre in North Point is to be transformed into a church.
  <br>
  <br>
  Veteran Cantonese opera singer Joyce Koi on Friday described the theatre as her second home and the place where she built her fame in the industry.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said she will enjoy the remaining days performing in the theatre, adding that she hopes to see more theatre spaces open up for shows.
  <br>
  <br>
  A woman surnamed Ngai, 76, said she witnessed the history of Sunbeam Theatre, recalling fond memories of going there with her mother. Ngai said she will try to watch as many shows as she can before the theatre closes on March 3.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's like coming home. I usually come here with my friends and family. It makes me very happy because we watch the performance and then go out for dinner. Sometimes we watch a show in the morning, go to dim sum, then another in the afternoon followed by a dinner with ten to twenty people," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a press conference about her upcoming show, Cantonese opera singer Angel Leung, who will perform during the theatre's final days, said the venue holds many memories.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think most Cantonese opera actors and actresses have a lot of memories here at Sunbeam Theatre because most of us would have been audience members sitting down there at the auditorium, and then gradually we became performers performing on this stage, and we have acted many different roles and characters on this stage, so I think every one of us [will] actually miss this place very much," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As for future plans, although this venue will not be used in the future, it will be used for other religious purposes. However we still have other venues such as the West Kowloon Xiqu Centre and also some other government venues such as Ko Shan Theatre, we will still have a lot of performances there."
  <br>
  <br>
  Leung added that she hopes to see Cantonese opera continue to grow in the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There are many things that we can do, especially focusing on promoting this art form to our next generation and also promoting it to the international audience groups," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think it's actually a very iconic culture in Hong Kong that represents this place because Cantonese opera in Hong Kong has its own style. I think it's really a very good way of promoting this city to foreigners."
  <br>
  <br>
  The theatre will be taken over by the Island Evangelical Community Church, with the sale spanning the ground floor through to the sixth floor, and also the rooftop of Kiu Fai Mansion.

 Service hours at two border checkpoints will be extended in the early hours of New Year's Day, the government said on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Shenzhen Bay Control Point, which usually closes at midnight, will stay open throughout the night, while Lo Wu Control Point will stay open an extra two hours longer than normal until 2am.
  <br>
  <br>
  East Rail Line services will be extended, with the last train to Lo Wu leaving Admiralty at 00.56am.
  <br>
  <br>
  Private cars, other than those with permits for the Lok Ma Chau checkpoint, will be able to cross the border via the Shenzhen Bay port, a statement said.
  <br>
  <br>
  An emergency transport coordination centre will operate round-the-clock to monitor traffic conditions and public transport services, and will carry out contingency measures when necessary to meet service demands.
  <br>
  <br>
  A government spokesman thanked mainland authorities for making the special arrangements.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The full support and co-ordination of the leaders and relevant departments of Guangdong Province and Shenzhen Municipality are crucial to the implementation of the special boundary-crossing arrangements, reflecting the effective and close co-operation between Hong Kong and Shenzhen," he said.
