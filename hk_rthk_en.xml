<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Some brands of tumblers and travel mugs have a lower capacity than is claimed, the Consumer Council said on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The watchdog also found that plastic mugs are not as effective in keeping drinks hot or cold.
  <br>
  <br>
  The council tested 18 models of tumblers and travel mugs, which claimed a capacity from 350ml to 900ml.
  <br>
  <br>
  But only four models had the actual capacity that was stated. The rest of them held less liquid than claimed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Five mugs or tumblers, from Muji, 24Bottles, Decathlon, National Geographic, and PoleBear, were found to have a discrepancy in capacity of more than 10 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The Council reminds manufacturers that their product design must take into consideration the actual usage by consumers and clearly and accurately state on the product label the actual capacity,” said convenor of the council’s advisory group on digital economy and information technology Jack Poon.
  <br>
  <br>
  The watchdog also passed the results to the Customs and Excise Department for potential follow up actions.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the thermal insulation efficacy test, two stainless steel tumblers from NOC and Stanley performed well as they were able to keep the water temperature at over 60 degrees Celsius after six hours.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thirteen models could maintain the water temperature at above 40 degrees Celsius, but the water temperature in three plastic mugs or tumblers, dropped significantly to between 29 and 26.3 degrees.
  <br>
  <br>
  For cold drinks with temperatures from five degrees to minus one degree Celsius, temperatures from three plastic models rose to as much as 22 degrees after six hours.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two-thirds of samples showed a satisfactory performance in the leak-proof test.
  <br>
  <br>
  The council reminded people to clean their tumblers or mugs as often as they could and recommended they use tools like small brushes to wash narrow bottles.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It's better for you to clean it thoroughly because you never know when the pathogenic bacteria will breed in your container. So the cleaner it is, the better for your food safety,” the council’s chief executive Gilly Wong said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “When you buy this kind of tumbler, check out how many parts they have so that you know you have to open it up and how to clean it and put it back, ensure that you know it performs as well as its original,” she said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong may need to import halal food for all the Muslim tourists it aims to entice to the city, a minister said on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Plans for new measures to attract visitors from the Middle East and Southeast Asia were announced in last year's chief executive policy address.
  <br>
  <br>
  On RTHK's Overview Policy programme, Deputy Chief Secretary Warner Cheuk said as Hong Kong develops into a Muslim-friendly tourist destination, halal food could be brought in from abroad.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong may not have many Muslims, but we need to make a lot of halal food. There are many Muslim countries in Asean, and we can attract restaurants and import food from these nations," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other government moves aimed at attracting more visitors from Muslim nations include encouraging hotels to set up worship facilities, and persuading taxis drivers to provide information in Arabic.

    'Alimony mediation helps divorcees reach settlement'

<img alt="Home and youth affairs chief Alice Mak says a pilot scheme offering mediation services on spousal maintenance has helped divorcees. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1787625_1_20250115123120.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A pilot scheme which helps separating or divorcing couples from low-income families handle spouse maintenance has processed nearly 40 cases in the first two months since its introduction, taking less than a month on average to close a file.
 <br>
  <br>
  In October last year, authorities introduced a programme through the Community Care Fund to offer free mediation services.
  <br>
  <br>
  The initiative, set to last for three years, aims to process a total of 1,200 cases and help 2,400 people who are going through a separation or divorce.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alice Mak, secretary for home and youth affairs, said the scheme handled 38 cases relating to alimony as of the end of November.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Sixty percent of the cases have either reached an agreement or partially made an agreement, meaning there's an outcome from the mediation. For those completed cases, it takes roughly 24 days from opening to closing a file," she said during an exclusive interview with RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We can see that these mediation services have indeed helped some divorcees to reach maintenance agreements. Some of the participants told us that they found it helpful and they would recommend programme to those in need around them."
  <br>
  <br>
  As for the remaining 40 percent, Mak said the administration would look into possible follow-up actions after collecting more data.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, the minister said her bureau and the Family Council will jointly organise the "Hong Kong Excellent Family Awards" in the second quarter, with participants being judged on a number of areas.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said families must show how well they support each other and whether they have experiences on educating the next generation which are worthy of being referenced, among other criteria.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Last year's runner-up Zheng Qinwen was knocked out of the Australian Open in the biggest shock of the tournament so far, while defending champion Aryna Sabalenka had to battle serve jitters to make the third round.
 <br>
  <br>
  Fifth seed Zheng was sent packing 7-6, 6-3 at the John Cain Arena by World No. 97 Laura Siegemund of Germany, the second-oldest player in the draw at age 36.
  <br>
  <br>
  Over on centre court Sabalenka dropped her serve three times and faced 11 break points before overcoming Spain's Jessica Bouzas Maneiro 6-3, 7-5, rattling off the last five games in a row.
  <br>
  <br>
  "She played incredible tennis today and it was a really tough one. I expected this tennis from her, I'm really glad I was able to win this match," said Sabalenka.
  <br>
  <br>
  The win kept the Belarusian World No. 1 on course for a rare hat-trick of consecutive Australian Open titles, a feat last achieved 26 years ago by Martina Hingis and only matched by four other women in history.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Olympic champion Zheng's attempt to become only the second Chinese player to win a Grand Slam singles title after Li Na is over, after being out-thought by the powerful Siegemund.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I knew I just had to play more than my best tennis. I had nothing to lose so I just told myself to swing free," said the German. (AFP)

<img alt="Miachel Cheuk accepted a petition from Kelvin, whose brother is among those detained in Southeast Asia. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1787597_2_20250115102627.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Undersecretary for Security Michael Cheuk said he hopes 12 Hong Kong residents who remain unlawfully detained in Southeast Asia can come home before Chinese New Year, as a six-member task force he led concluded their two-day trip to Thailand.
 <br>
  <br>
  Cheuk was also pleased with the progress made by the task force, and expressed gratitude to their Thai counterparts for attaching great importance to the matter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters upon landing at Hong Kong airport on Tuesday evening, the former assistant police commissioner confirmed that 11 of the trapped SAR residents are in Myanmar, while the remaining one is in Cambodia.
  <br>
  <br>
  He described their locations as chaotic and not safe, while armed forces are also present.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cheuk pointed out that all of the victims fell for job scams, and were lured by the syndicates to Bangkok and picked up at the airport.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So far, none of the 72 people who sought assistance were abducted. In this regard, Thailand remains a very safe place," he said, although he cautioned against visiting regions bordering Myanmar, Laos or Cambodia.
  <br>
  <br>
  SAR authorities will now reach out to their counterparts in Myanmar, but admitted the situation was quite complicated.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cheuk also quoted Thai officials as saying that safety measures will be rolled out this week to enhance the safety of tourists.
  <br>
  <br>
  These include a 24-hour hotline that supports eight languages, and a mobile app that allows users to share their real-time location to law enforcement in emergency situations.
  <br>
  <br>
  The number two security official in Hong Kong also explained why the task force embarked on a visit to Thailand when the SAR residents are held elsewhere.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said Thailand has a lot of exchanges with neighbouring countries both historically and culturally, and Thai officials have numerous ways to talk to people in the region, including unofficial means.
  <br>
  <br>
  Before he left the airport, Cheuk received a petition letter from a man whose brother is among those unlawfully detained.
  <br>
  <br>
  The man, who gave his name as Kelvin, hopes to meet the task force soon and receive the latest update on the situation.

    Test strips to be used to detect space oil drug

<img alt="The rapid test kit contains a swabbing strip, a bottle of solution, a pair of surgical gloves, and a sample bag. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1787604_2_20250115101808.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police will begin using rapid test kits to detect a regulated sedative from Saturday to tackle the emerging use of the space oil drug.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chief Inspector of the narcotics bureau Kelvin Cheung said the test will serve as an aid during operations when officers suspect products could contain etomidate, a short-acting anaesthetic normally used as an ingredient for the narcotic.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The officers will conduct the stop-and-search in an ordinary manner. When they find the vapes, they will conduct enquiries, they will ask questions, and they will also conduct observations before conducting the interception," Cheung said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If they, after conducting all the necessary enquiries at the scene, are still unable to form the reasonable belief, and they still suspect that the vapes actually contain etomidate... they will use the test kit."
  <br>
  <br>
  The kit contains a testing strip used to swab samples of alternative smoking products. It will then be mixed with a solution that can show a positive or negative result in less than a minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  The accuracy of the test can reach up to 99 percent, Cheung said, adding that the force has procured a sufficient amount of testing kits.
  <br>
  <br>
  Etomidate is a controlled drug that is prescribed by a doctor and is currently classified as a Part 1 poison.
  <br>
  <br>
  The number of arrests relating to the controlled drug skyrocketed from eight in 2023 to 206 in the first 11 months of last year. Nearly 23 percent of those arrested last year were people aged below 21, with the youngest being only 12 years old.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sky, who is said to be about 20 years old, first got a taste of the space oil drug at a bar. Speaking at a police press event, Sky said it looked like a normal e-cigarette. Sky later became addicted to the drug and started experiencing memory loss.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Sometimes I forgot what I did. I also had errors in my judgement. When my friends saw the traffic light was red, I thought it was green and walked out onto the road," Sky said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Leo Man, from the Hong Kong Federation of Youth Groups, told the same event that etomidate is very addictive. He said there has been a case where someone taking the drug died after mistaking a window for a door.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government is planning to list etomidate as a dangerous drug on February 14.
  <br>
  <br>
  Once listed, those illegally possessing or consuming space oil drugs containing the sedative would face a maximum of seven years in prison and a fine of HK$1 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  And those trafficking or illegally importing the drug would be liable to a maximum penalty of life imprisonment and a fine of HK$5 million.

    South Korea's impeached President Yoon arrested

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korean authorities arrested impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol on Wednesday over insurrection accusations related to his December 3 martial law declaration, investigators said.
 <br>
  <br>
  A motorcade was seen leaving the gates of his hillside residence where Yoon has been holed up for weeks behind barbed wire barriers and a small army of personal security.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 3,000 police officers and anti-corruption investigators had gathered there before dawn, pushing through throngs of Yoon supporters and members of his ruling People Power Party who protested attempts to detain him.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon's lawyers have argued attempts to detain Yoon are illegal and are designed to publicly humiliate him. The warrant investigators secured for his arrest is the first-ever issued against an incumbent South Korean president.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon has justified his declaration of martial law as a legitimate act of governance against an "anti-state" opposition employing its legislative majority to thwart his agenda.
  <br>
  <br>
  The anti-corruption agency is leading a joint investigation with police and the military over whether Yoon's martial law declaration amounted to an attempted rebellion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Law enforcement officers had sought to bring him into custody after he ignored several summons for questioning. (Agencies)

 Millions of Southern Californians faced new wildfire warnings on Tuesday, and tens of thousands saw their power shut off as strong winds blew across the parched landscape around Los Angeles where two massive blazes have been burning for a week.
 <br>
  <br>
  Santa Ana winds that began gusting over the mountains before sunrise were forecast to continue until Wednesday morning with enough force to carry fire-sparking embers for miles and stoke new outbreaks in a region where at least 25 people have already been killed.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Life threatening and destructive and widespread winds are already here,” LA city fire chief Kristin Crowley told a news conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  Much of Southern California was under elevated fire risk, with crews on high alert from the Mexican border to Central California, far north of Los Angeles.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nearly 90,000 households lost electricity as utilities shut off power to prevent their lines from sparking new blazes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Weary and anxious residents were told to be ready to flee at a moment’s notice.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police announced roughly 50 arrests, for looting, flying drones in fire zones, violating curfew and other crimes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The biggest worry remained the threat from intense winds predicted to reach nearly hurricane force in some areas. Tuesday's forecast included a rare warning: The winds, combined with severely dry conditions, have created a “Particularly Dangerous Situation,” the National Weather service said, meaning that any new fire could explode in size.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gusts were forecast to pick up strength in the evening and into Wednesday before decreasing, and red-flag warnings from Central California to the Mexican border were to remain through most of Wednesday, weather service meteorologist Ariel Cohen said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Planes doused homes and hillsides with bright pink fire-retardant chemicals while crews and fire engines deployed to particularly vulnerable spots with dry brush.
  <br>
  <br>
  Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass and other officials - who were criticised over their initial response - expressed confidence that the region was ready to face the new threat.
  <br>
  <br>
  With almost no rain in more than eight months, the brush-filled region has had more than a dozen wildfires this year, mostly in the greater Los Angeles area.
  <br>
  <br>
  Just under 90,000 people in the county remained under evacuation orders, half the number from last week. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Elon Musk was sued on Tuesday by the US Securities and Exchange Commission, which accused the world's richest person of waiting too long to disclose in 2022 he had amassed a large stake in Twitter, the social media company he later bought.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a complaint filed in Washington, DC federal court, the SEC said Musk violated federal securities law by waiting 11 days too long to disclose his initial purchase of five per cent of Twitter's common shares.
  <br>
  <br>
  An SEC rule requires investors to disclose within 10 calendar days, or by March 24, 2022 in Musk's case, when they cross a five per cent ownership threshold.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SEC said that at the expense of unsuspecting investors, Musk instead bought more than US$500 million of Twitter shares at artificially low prices before finally revealing his purchases on April 4, 2022, by which time he owned a 9.2 percent stake.
  <br>
  <br>
  Twitter's share price rose more than 27 per cent following that disclosure, the SEC said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tuesday's lawsuit seeks to force Musk to pay a civil fine and disgorge profits he didn't deserve.
  <br>
  <br>
  Musk eventually purchased Twitter for US$44 billion in October 2022, and renamed it X.
  <br>
  <br>
  Musk has also been sued in Manhattan federal court by former Twitter shareholders over the late disclosure.
  <br>
  <br>
  In that case, Musk has said it was implausible to believe he wanted to defraud other shareholders, and that "all indications" were that his delay was a mistake. (Reuters)

    US TikTok users flock to Chinese app Xiaohongshu

<div class="itemFullText">
 As the threat of a TikTok ban looms in the United States, users there are flocking to the Chinese social media app Xiaohongshu - making it the top downloaded app in the US.
 <br>
  <br>
  Some of the “TikTok refugees,” as they call themselves, say the TikTok alternative, a Chinese app, is being chosen in protest of the TikTok ban.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US Supreme Court is due to rule on a law that stipulates TikTok must be divested from its Chinese parent company ByteDance by January 19 or face a ban in the US over national security concerns.
  <br>
  <br>
  After the justices seemed inclined to let the law stand, masses of TikTok users began creating accounts on Xiaohongshu, including hashtags such as #tiktokrefugee or #tiktok to their posts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since Monday, Xiaohongshu has become the top downloaded free app on Apple’s App Store in the US.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xiaohongshu, which in English means “Little Red Book”, is a Chinese social media app that combines e-commerce, short video and posting functions.
  <br>
  <br>
  The app has gained traction in China and other regions and countries with a Chinese diaspora, racking up 300 million monthly active users, a majority of whom are young women who use it as a de-facto search engine for product, travel and restaurant recommendations, as well as make-up and skincare tutorials.
  <br>
  <br>
  The #tiktokrefugee topic has racked up over 160,000 posts on Xiaohongshu, many of which are videos of American users introducing themselves and asking for tips on how to navigate the app, which they are calling “RedNote”.
  <br>
  <br>
  An American user with the handle Definitelynotchippy made a video addressed to the Chinese users of Xiaohongshu, explaining why Americans are downloading the app.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The reason that our government is telling us that they are banning TikTok is because they’re insisting that it’s owned by you guys, the Chinese people, government, whatever,” she said. “And they’re trying to make us think that you guys are bad.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Chinese users on Xiaohongshu have so far welcomed American users, with some offering to teach them Chinese. Others have offered tips on navigating the Chinese internet. In some cases, Chinese students have asked the Americans for help with their English homework. (AP)

    UK launches probe into dominance of Google search

<img alt="The Competition and Markets Authority will probe whether Google is using its position to prevent innovation by others in the search engine market. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1787536_1_20250114213240.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Britain's competition watchdog on Tuesday launched an investigation into Google's dominant position in the search engine market and its impact on consumers and businesses.
 <br>
  <br>
  The investigation could lead to the US tech giant being handed "strategic market status", subjecting it to special requirements under new UK regulations, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CMA will probe whether "Google is using its position to prevent innovation by others" in the search engine market and whether it gives "self-preference" to its own services.
  <br>
  <br>
  It will also look into "potential exploitative conduct" including investigating the collection and use of large quantities of consumer data without informed consent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under the UK's tougher new regulation that came into force this year, the watchdog has been given more powers to develop and enforce conduct requirements on companies to prevent anti-competitive behaviour in digital markets.
  <br>
  <br>
  Potential requirements could include Google having to make the data it collects available to other businesses or giving publishers more control over how their data is used, the CMA said.
  <br>
  <br>
  A similar tech competition law from the European Union, the Digital Markets Act, carries hefty financial penalties for giants like Apple, Google and Meta in the event of infringements.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Millions of people and businesses across the UK rely on Google's search and advertising services, with 90 percent of searches happening on their platform and more than 200,000 UK businesses advertising there," CMA chief executive Sarah Cardell said in the statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That's why it's so important to ensure these services are delivering good outcomes for people and businesses and that there is a level playing field," she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Google is also fighting an antitrust crackdown in the United States after the Department of Justice (DOJ) asked a federal court in November to order it to sell its widely-used Chrome browser.
  <br>
  <br>
  The DOJ also asked the court to ban deals for Google to be the default search engine on smartphones and prevent it from exploiting its Android mobile operating system. (AFP)

<img alt="Nottingham Forest's Chris Wood celebrates after scoring his side's opening goal against Liverpool. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1787576_1_20250115074123.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Liverpool's charge towards the Premier League title was halted by stubborn Nottingham Forest in a 1-1 draw between the top two as Manchester City's resurgence came undone in a 2-2 draw at Brentford.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chris Wood fired Forest in front early on at a raucous City Ground, but Liverpool dominated almost the entire 97 minutes and got back on level terms thanks to substitute Diogo Jota's goal with his first touch.
  <br>
  <br>
  Only a brilliant goalkeeping performance from Matz Sels denied the leaders victory, but the point maintained a six-point cushion over Forest for Arne Slot's men, who also have a game in hand.
  <br>
  <br>
  Forest had won their last seven games in all competitions to raise the possibility of matching Leicester's incredible title win the 2015 to 2016 campaign.
  <br>
  <br>
  The in-form Wood had the home fans believing after just eight minutes when he slotted in Anthony Elanga's pass.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool enjoyed over 70 percent possession and had 23 shots on goal but only posed a serious threat in front of goal after the break.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jota had only been on the field a matter of seconds when he nodded in Kostas Tsimikas' corner.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sels then made incredible saves to deny Jota, Mohamed Salah and Cody Gakpo a winner, while Salah also had a goalbound effort cleared off the line.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I could not have asked for more," said Liverpool manager Arne Slot. "Second half was outstanding."
  <br>
  <br>
  "There are not many teams that can create so many chances against an opponent so defensively strong," he added. "Unfortunately we couldn't get a second."
  <br>
  <br>
  "There are not many teams that can create so many chances against an opponent so defensively strong. Unfortunately we couldn't get a second."
  <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool had to settle for a second consecutive league draw, allowing Arsenal the chance to cut the gap at the top to four points when they host Tottenham in the north London derby.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, any suggestion City could get themselves back in the title race was ended in a late collapse in west London as Brentford struck twice in the final 10 minutes for a deserved point.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Long balls we won and we could run and in that moment we didn't take the right decisions," said City manager Pep Guardiola. "Maybe that would have been different but at the same time they had chances. Their strikers are really good, Wissa and Bryan Mbeumo are really dangerous."
  <br>
  <br>
  Phil Foden's double had City on course for a fourth consecutive win after a run of just one victory in 13 games.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the English champions' defending was not convincing all night. They were punished as Yoane Wissa and Christian Norgaard netted for the Bees.
  <br>
  <br>
  Foden's return to the form that saw him crowned Premier League player of the year last season was the one positive for City.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Pep Guardiola will reflect on a missed opportunity to make up ground on the top four as City remain down in sixth, 12 points off the top.
  <br>
  <br>
  Foden produced a brilliant deft touch from Kevin De Bruyne's inviting delivery and then smashed in a rebound for his fourth goal in five league games.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brentford wasted a host of chances before conceding but finally got some reward for their attacking endeavour when Wissa slotted in from Mads Roerslev's cross to become the club's all-time leading goalscorer in the Premier League.
  <br>
  <br>
  They completed the comeback in stoppage time when Norgaard's header had too much power for Stefan Ortega.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fourth-placed Chelsea's miserable run extended to five league games without a win but they were grateful for captain Reece James' stoppage-time equaliser salvaging a point in a 2-2 draw at home to Bournemouth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cole Palmer's cool finish from Nicolas Jackson's through ball had given Chelsea the perfect start.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Bournemouth hit back through Justin Kluivert's penalty, before Antoine Semenyo's blistering near-post effort put the visitors in front.
  <br>
  <br>
  James has endured another injury-hit season but showed his quality by curling home a free-kick at the death.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think we deserved much more, especially in the first half," Chelsea manager Enzo Maresca said after the match.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The negative thing is that we changed how we played after conceding. The game was completely in our control and it's something we need to improve," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere, West Ham boss Graham Potter enjoyed a winning home debut as Fulham were beaten 3-2 at the London Stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carlos Soler, Tomas Soucek and Lucas Paqueta were on target for the Hammers to take Potter's men above Manchester United and Tottenham into 12th. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks were mixed after a choppy session as traders digested better-than-expected inflation data and looked ahead to bank earnings.
 <br>
  <br>
  The producer price index rose 0.2 percent last month, a reassuring figure to investors concerned about inflation risk.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the recent jump in the 10-year US Treasury note, which edged down on Tuesday, has left investors worried that equities may be overvalued in light of the risk of higher interest rates for longer, said Art Hogan of B. Riley Wealth Management.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished up 0.5 percent at 42,518.
  <br>
  <br>
  The broad-based S&P 500 edged up 0.1 percent to 5,842, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index declined 0.2 percent to 19,044.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hogan said Wednesday's deluge of bank earnings should show strong profitability. A key question will be the companies' expectations for the incoming Trump administration in Washington.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There's a lot of interest ... in how they see the future," Hogan said of expectations that Trump could ease bank regulation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among individual companies, Eli Lilly dropped 6.6 percent after it said 2024 revenues would be lower than previously thought.
  <br>
  <br>
  Biogen sank 4.7 percent after Sage Therapeutics said the company had submitted an unsolicited bid to purchase the smaller company. Sage dropped 1.2 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  But KB Home rose 4.8 percent after reporting higher earnings and profits, describing a solid housing market.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Buyers continued to demonstrate a desire for home ownership and housing market conditions improved relative to last year, despite ongoing mortgage interest rate headwinds," said KB Homes Chief Executive Jeffrey Mezger. (AFP)

<img alt="People gather inside the barricade blocking the road leading to the residence of impeached South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol in Seoul. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1787563_1_20250115051133.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korean investigators seeking to arrest impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol were involved in clashes as they tried to execute a new warrant at his official residence, Yonhap news agency reported on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Investigators in physical clash as they attempt to forcibly enter presidential residence," the agency reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  It came as thousands of the embattled leader's die-hard supporters massed outside the presidential residence in the capital Seoul to protect Yoon, AFP reporters saw.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon's short-lived December 3 imposition of martial law plunged the country into its worst political crisis in decades, after he directed soldiers to storm parliament in an unsuccessful attempt to stop lawmakers voting down his move.
  <br>
  <br>
  Investigators said they would detain anyone who tried to block their bid to execute a new warrant, after they arrived at the presidential residence Wednesday, Yonhap news agency reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Two CIO vehicles have arrived in front of the (presidential) residence," Yonhap News TV reported, referring to the Corruption Investigation Office that is probing Yoon's declaration.
  <br>
  <br>
  If the court-ordered warrant is successfully executed, Yoon would become the first sitting president in South Korean history to be arrested.
  <br>
  <br>
  But a first attempt to arrest Yoon on January 3 failed after a tense hours-long standoff with his presidential guards, who refused to budge when investigators tried to execute their warrant.
  <br>
  <br>
  A joint team of the CIO and police have since secured a new warrant and massed as many as 1,000 personnel for Wednesday's attempt to detain Yoon, according to local media reports.
  <br>

  They have also threatened to detain any guards who obstruct the sitting leader's arrest.
  <br>
  <br>
  Personnel who appeared to be guarding the entrance from outsiders were seen walking from the residence towards its entrance gate early Wednesday, AFP reporters saw.
  <br>
  <br>
  Supporters of Yoon were also heard chanting "illegal warrant!" while waving glow sticks and South Korean and American flags. (AFP)

<img alt="Los Angeles city fire chief Kristin Crowley says teams are in place ready to repel any new fires. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1787545_1_20250114224256.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hot, powerful winds on Tuesday threatened to rekindle and whip up major fires that have devastated the hills and suburbs of Los Angeles, killing at least 24 people and changing the face of America's second biggest city forever.
 <br>
  <br>
  A week after blazes erupted and spread uncontained, forecasters predicted "particularly dangerous" dry Santa Ana winds would spike the wildfire threat for already exhausted firefighters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Stay aware of your surroundings. Be ready to evacuate. Avoid anything that can spark a fire," the National Weather Service warned.
  <br>
  <br>
  A large part of Southern California was under a Red Flag warning, indicating that intense dryness and furious winds would make conditions ripe for wildfire.
  <br>
  <br>
  Part of Los Angeles County and much of neighbouring Ventura County were in a "Particularly Dangerous Situation," according to the NWS, a designation that was also declared before last week's deadly blazes erupted.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials insisted they were poised, with Los Angeles city fire chief Kristin Crowley telling reporters a huge firefighting operation was well placed.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I have strategically pre-positioned engine strike teams and task forces which are dedicated to rapid response for any new fire that breaks out," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The renewed danger comes with 24,000 acres (9,700 hectares) of the upmarket Pacific Palisades in ruins and 14,000 acres of the city of Altadena badly charred.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 90,000 evacuees are desperate to get back to their homes – or even just to see if anything at all survived.
  <br>
  <br>
  "My house is gone, I know that. I've seen pictures and all that's left is the chimney. But I need to see it by myself to believe it," said Fred Busche.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among the desperation, there were stories of fortitude.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jeff Ridgway told how he had refused to abandon the apartment complex he manages, defending it against the fires by hauling buckets of water from the pool.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was just a war," the 67-year-old said, pointing to a eucalyptus tree he extinguished when it caught fire and threatened the building last week.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But I was just stubborn. I was like: 'I'm not going to be defeated by you. I'm sorry, this is just not gonna happen.'"
  <br>
  <br>
  Search teams using cadaver dogs have been scouring the rubble for days, with Los Angeles County Sheriff Robert Luna saying he expected more victims would be unearthed.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Every day we're doing this, we're running across the remains of individual community members," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I believe we'll continue to find remains."
  <br>
  <br>
  With so many in dire straits, the city was clutching for any sliver of good news.
  <br>
  <br>
  That was offered by the Los Angeles Rams, who beat the Minnesota Vikings in an NFL playoff game on Monday night to take them one step closer to the Super Bowl.
  <br>
  <br>
  The game, which had been scheduled to take place in Los Angeles, was moved to Arizona to relieve pressure on stretched law enforcement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Basketball fans also had a welcomed diversion from the fires when the Lakers played the San Antonio Spurs at home, although they lost 102-126.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Lakers were among a dozen city sports clubs – also including the Dodgers baseball team – that have pledged US$8 million toward wildfire relief.
  <br>
  <br>
  The mainstay entertainment industry was also stepping up, with major studios and streamers including Netflix, Disney, Amazon, Warner and Universal parent company Comcast having all announced eight-figure donations to the recovery effort.
  <br>
  <br>
  But there were also many stories of individual generosity.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a converted parking lot in Arcadia, 600 people showed up in a single day to distribute donated supplies to evacuees, organisers said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Many had been redirected from other shelters that also could not accommodate the extra help.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's a very different experience than any other volunteering that I typically do. Because there's really no difference between the people that are helping and the people that are being helped," said 19-year-old student Gianna Karkafi.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's just, like, luck." (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Maro Itoje was selected on Tuesday as England's captain for the Six Nations rugby tournament, replacing Jamie George.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 30-year-old lock takes the role for the first time, having previously deputised for George when the hooker has been replaced in the second half of games.
  <br>
  <br>
  George, who has had the armband since the 2023 Rugby World Cup, was demoted to vice-captain alongside Ellis Genge.
  <br>
  <br>
  Itoje, who has 88 caps, was appointed as Saracens captain for this season, also ahead of George.
  <br>
  <br>
  “He’s a calm, influential leader, renowned for his commitment to upholding high standards and his ability to motivate those around him," England coach Steve Borthwick said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “His strong rapport with the squad and coaches, combined with his leadership experience at Saracens, makes him ideally placed to take on this responsibility," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Borthwick has picked a 36-man squad for the Six Nations that includes No 8 Tom Willis, but is missing veteran prop Dan Cole and scrumhalf Ben Spencer. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The government's task force to help Hong Kong residents who were allegedly lured to Southeast Asian countries to engage in illegal work on Tuesday concluded its visit to Thailand.
 <br>
  <br>
  Led by Under Secretary for Security Michael Cheuk, the task force arrived in the country on Sunday to follow up on the cases.
  <br>
  <br>
  A government statement said Cheuk received positive feedback in a Tuesday meeting to exchange intelligence with Thailand's senior inspector general Thatchai Pitaneelaboot.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pitaneelaboot said Thai authorities will further strengthen the prevention of transnational crimes, and do their utmost to assist the safe return of Hong Kong residents.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cheuk also met Thailand's vice minister for tourism and sports Jakkaphon Tangsutthitham and the commissioner of the tourist police bureau Saksira Pheuak-um to learn about the latest measures to protect tourists.
  <br>
  <br>
  Members of the task force later met a deputy commissioner general of the Thai National Police Prachuab Wongsuk to reflect the situation of the cases involving Hong Kong residents.
  <br>
  <br>
  The statement also said Cheuk expressed gratitude to the Chinese Embassy in Thailand and Thai authorities for attaching great importance to the requests for assistance from Hong Kong people.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[Authorities] will continue to maintain close liaison with the embassy and the Thai authorities in the future to exchange intelligence on the latest situation of the cases, and to provide appropriate advice and all practicable assistance to the assistance seekers and their families," it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The task force is expected to return to Hong Kong on Tuesday night.

    'Cooperation needed to ensure safe AI development'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A British computer scientist on Tuesday urged countries to prioritise cooperation when it comes to the issue of safety in the development of artificial intelligence.
 <br>
  <br>
  Stuart Russell, co-chair of the World Economic Forum's Council on AI, made the remarks after delivering a keynote speech at the 18th edition of the Asian Financial Forum, where he stressed the importance of governance in AI.
  <br>
  <br>
  When asked about the latest AI chip export rules proposed by the outgoing Biden administration in the US, Russell pointed out that while competition is normal among nations and firms, cooperation should always come first when it comes to the question of safety.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The US and China have agreed not to use AI to control the launch of nuclear weapons, which I think is pretty sensible," he said. "Safety failures damage the entire industry. So I really hope we can cooperate on this dimension."
  <br>
  <br>
  He also referred to artificial general intelligence technology (AGI) – which is a type of AI that is equal to or surpasses human intelligence – as a source of infinite wealth, which will be responsible for the vast majority of economic output in the future.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Arguing over who owns [AGI] is like arguing over who has more copies of the digital newspaper. Why would you argue with that when you could just make as many more copies as you want?" he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If we have a source of unlimited wealth for humanity, we should just use it for humanity and not try to own it or prevent others from gaining access to it," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Touching on Hong Kong's AI development potential, Russell said the city can make use of its unique financial strengths to develop targeted AI systems for its trade-related services.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two-day financial forum hosted some 3,600 policymakers and business leaders from more than 50 countries and regions.

    Ex-professor guilty of yoga ball murder in retrial

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A scholar has been convicted of killing his wife and daughter with a yoga ball filled with lethal gas following a retrial, with a High Court judge sentencing him to life imprisonment.
 <br>
  <br>
  A seven-member jury unanimously found Khaw Kim Sun, a former Chinese University medical professor, guilty of causing the deaths of his wife and second child, after less than four hours of deliberation.
  <br>
  <br>
  The academic appeared calm when the verdict was handed down and chose not to make a mitigation plea.
  <br>
  <br>
  He had been accused of putting a yoga ball filled with carbon monoxide in the boot of a Mini Cooper in 2015, with the gas leaking out and killing the pair.
  <br>
  <br>
  Khaw was first convicted of two counts of murder in 2018 and sentenced to life behind bars.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2023, the top court quashed his murder conviction and ordered a retrial, after ruling the initial trial judge had misdirected the jury.
  <br>
  <br>
  During the retrial that began in November last year, Khaw opted to defend himself and claimed he had bought carbon monoxide for an experiment.
  <br>
  <br>
  But prosecutors challenged his claims, saying the experiment was a "sham" to hide his real motive of possessing the lethal gas.

    50,000 elderly people to get food coupons

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Tuesday launched a caring food coupon programme, allowing elderly people in need to taste dishes at discounted prices from the Lunar New Year holiday.
 <br>
  <br>
  About 50,000 seniors, including those living alone, will receive a set of five coupons so they can try signature dishes from five catering groups for just HK$25 each.
  <br>
  <br>
  The coupons will be accepted from January 29 to late March.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chief Secretary Eric Chan, who officiated at a launching ceremony, said he hopes the elderly people will feel warmth through the programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is a collaboration between the government, the business sector and the community, building a harmonious and caring society together," Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are going to test out this programme, and see how to review it based on the experience. We hope more catering groups and restaurants will participate in the future."
  <br>
  <br>
  One of the fast food chains taking part in the programme, Café de Coral, said it is a meaningful way to help the elderly.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This time, we have HK$25 baked pork chop rice, which is our signature dish. All the Café de Coral stores will offer this special price for the programme's participants," general manager Nelson Lo said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other chains will offer dishes like boneless Hainan chicken rice, fish burgers, and char siu rice with sunny-side up eggs.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President-elect Donald Trump would have been convicted for his alleged effort to overturn the 2020 election result if he hadn't been elected four years later, said a report by then special counsel Jack Smith released early on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The US Department of Justice's "view that the Constitution prohibits the continued indictment and prosecution of a President is categorical and does not turn on the gravity of the crimes charged, the strength of the Government's proof, or the merits of the prosecution, which the Office stands fully behind," the report said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Indeed, but for Mr Trump's election and imminent return to the Presidency, the (Special Counsel's) Office assessed that the admissible evidence was sufficient to obtain and sustain a conviction at trial."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump, who returns to the White House on January 20, had been accused of conspiracy to defraud the United States and conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding -- the session of Congress called to certify US President Joe Biden's election win but which was violently attacked on January 6, 2021 by a mob of the Republican's supporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Smith, who was special counsel appointed to investigate Trump, dropped the federal criminal case against the incoming leader after he won November's presidential election.
  <br>
  <br>
  Soon after the report's overnight release, Trump hit back on his Truth Social platform, calling Smith "deranged", and adding he "was unable to successfully prosecute the Political Opponent of his 'boss'."
  <br>
  <br>
  "To show you how desperate Deranged Jack Smith is, he released his Fake findings at 1am in the morning," Trump added in another post.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's attorneys had earlier urged US Attorney General Merrick Garland not to release the report, calling the plan to release it "unlawful, undertaken in bad faith, and contrary to the public interest."
  <br>
  <br>
  Smith's report details Trump's alleged efforts to persuade state-level Republican lawmakers and leaders to "change the results" of the 2020 election.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Mr Trump contacted state legislators and executives, pressured them with false claims of election fraud in their states, and urged them to take action to ignore the vote counts and change the results," according to the report released by the Department of Justice.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Significantly, he made election claims only to state legislators and executives who shared his political affiliation and were his political supporters, and only in states that he had lost," it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  In addition, the report alleges Trump and co-conspirators planned to organise individuals who would have served as his electors, if he had won the popular vote, in seven states where he lost -- Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, New Mexico, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin -- "and cause them to sign and send to Washington false certifications claiming to be the legitimate electors."
  <br>
  <br>
  They ultimately "used the fraudulent certificates to try to obstruct the congressional certification proceeding," the report said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The special counsel office concluded that "Trump's conduct violated several federal criminal statutes and that the admissible evidence would be sufficient to obtain and sustain a conviction."
  <br>
  <br>
  Judge Aileen Cannon, a Trump appointee, dismissed a separate case against the former and future president last year -- over Trump's handling of top secret documents after leaving the White House -- but charges are still pending against two of his former co-defendants.
  <br>
  <br>
  Smith left the justice department last week, days after submitting his final report as special counsel. (AFP)

<img alt="About a third of mainland residents in Hong Kong felt the SAR could cut down on red tape. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1787463_1_20250114144638.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Nearly a third of mainland students and workers in Hong Kong said there is too much red tape in the city, according to a survey by a concern group helping young mainlanders.
 <br>
  <br>
  Around 800 young and educated mainlanders who are working or studying in Hong Kong, participated in an online survey jointly conducted by the Youth Expats Association and two lawmakers, Gary Zhang and Johnny Ng.
  <br>
  <br>
  The respondents were asked about their life in Hong Kong and their perspectives on the economy, culture and policies in the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 30 percent said there is too much red tape in Hong Kong, such as regulations governing money transfers.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The banking system is very troublesome if you want to make a legal transfer back to mainland China,” Zhang said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said some drifters also encountered difficulties when starting a business in Hong Kong, such as getting licences.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Like if they want to open a restaurant, the requirements from different government departments are quite complicated and stringent,” Zhang said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some 45 percent of respondents also said they had trouble building connections at work.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zhang said the drifters also needed more support as they do not have family and friends in Hong Kong, and the language barrier also hindered them from building relationships in the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 10 percent of respondents found there was a lack of smoking areas in Hong Kong, and think the government should not impose more tobacco control measures at this stage.

    Serious abuse of public housing could be made a crime

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Serious misuse of public housing could be made a criminal offence, Housing Department sources said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  At present the toughest punishment for tenants who break the rules, for example by subletting their units or using them for business purposes, is eviction.
  <br>
  <br>
  But plans are in place to amend the Housing Ordinance to allow the Housing Authority to prosecute offenders, with proposed fines of up to HK$500,000 and jail terms of up to a year.
  <br>
  <br>
  It's understood the authority also wants officials to be given the power to check the identity of any suspicious people they encounter while carrying out inspections at public flats. Anyone who refuses to hand over their details could be fined HK$10,000 or imprisoned for six months.
  <br>
  <br>
  Providing false statements to the authorities can already lead to prosecution, but officials want to extend the time period for bringing cases to court to six years after the offence, or one year after it is discovered, whichever comes first.
  <br>
  <br>
  The authority's subsidised housing committee held a meeting on Tuesday morning to discuss the plans.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters afterwards, Cleresa Wong, who chairs the committee, said she believes the proposed legislation would have a deterrent effect.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We do not propose to encompass all abuses under the new piece of legislation that we are proposing. We will only focus on the severe abuses and the reason is because if convicted, the people who are charged with these kinds of crimes would be criminalised, and they would have a criminal record. And so that, I think, is a deterrence,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The proposed legal amendments would not be applied retrospectively, it is believed.
  <br>
  <br>
  “As a matter of law, legal principles, it is very rare for a government to introduce crimes with retrospective effect because this is somehow contrary to natural justice and fairness,” Wong said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I think that would have a very draconian effect and that should be avoided in my personal view.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Sources said the proposals will be reviewed by Legco's housing panel next month and are still subject to change.
  <br>
  <br>
  It’s believed the authority hopes to bring a bill to Legco for vetting in April.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The impeachment trial of suspended South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol began on Tuesday, with the country's Constitutional Court deciding whether to strip him of his duties over a failed martial law bid.
 <br>
  <br>
  "It has started," the Constitutional Court's spokesperson told international media, adding that the first hearing -- out of a confirmed five -- ended minutes later with Yoon not in attendance.
  <br>
  <br>
  The following sessions will take place on January 16, 21, 23 and February 4.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon's December 3 power grab plunged South Korea into its worst political crisis in decades, after he directed soldiers to storm parliament in an unsuccessful attempt to stop lawmakers voting down his suspension of civilian rule.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was impeached soon after and suspended from duty, but has gone to ground in his residence since, refusing summonses from investigators probing him on insurrection charges and using his presidential security team to resist arrest. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 North Korea on Tuesday test-fired multiple missiles toward its eastern waters, South Korea’s military said, as it continued its weapons demonstrations ahead of Donald Trump’s return to the White House.
 <br>
  <br>
  South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said the short-range ballistic missiles were fired from a northern inland area and flew about 250 kilometres before landing in waters between the Korean Peninsula and Japan.
  <br>
  <br>
  The joint chiefs said the South Korean military had strengthened surveillance while sharing the launch information with the US and Japanese militaries.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said it strongly condemns the test, describing it as a “clear provocation" that poses a serious threat to the region's peace and stability.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was North Korea’s second launch event of 2025, following a ballistic launch last week.
  <br>
  <br>
  North Korea said the January 6 test was a new hypersonic intermediate-range missile designed to strike remote targets in the Pacific as leader Kim Jong-un vowed to further expand his collection of nuclear-capable weapons to counter rival nations.
  <br>
  <br>
  North Korea is coming off a torrid year in weapons testing.
  <br>
  <br>
  The systems it demonstrated in 2024 included solid-fuel intercontinental ballistic missiles designed to strike the US mainland and various shorter-range missiles designed to overwhelm missile defences in South Korea. (AP)

 Chief Executive John Lee said on Tuesday authorities will comprehensively investigate any suspected links people or organisations may have with those who endanger national security, to see if any support or assistance has been given.
 <br>
  <br>
  His comments came a day after prominent pollster Robert Chung was was taken away from his home on Monday morning, and brought to the Wong Chuk Hang office of the Public Opinion Research Institute (Pori), of which he is president and chief executive officer.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officers also took away computers and boxes of materials from his office.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sources said the investigation was to do with his former deputy at the institute, Chung Kim-wah, who was put on the national security wanted list last month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ahead of the Executive Council meeting, Lee said professional bodies have nothing to worry about if they have no intention to break the law, saying the security laws clearly define what constitutes an offence.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If professional organisations don't have any intention to endanger national security, they just need to follow their own work process, their ethics, their code of conduct in carrying on with their business, and that will be fine," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's stated clearly in the law which sorts of acts constitute offences. And then each time, in every operation, the law enforcement agency will explain clearly what sorts of acts constitute the offence of endangering national security."
  <br>
  <br>
  The chief executive stressed that officers will get to the bottom of every case in accordance with the law.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, sources said the wife and son of Chung Kim-wah were taken to the police station to assist with the investigation.

    Redevelopment still on despite Carrie Lam move: CE

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee said on Tuesday that plans to redevelop a cluster of government buildings in Wan Chai will go ahead, even though his predecessor, Carrie Lam, is moving her office there.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lam's relocation to Immigration Tower later this year comes after lawmakers complained about how much public money is being spent on the rent for her current office in Pacific Place.
  <br>
  <br>
  Immigration Tower is earmarked for redevelopment, with the building to be used for conventions and commercial use.
  <br>
  <br>
  Before the weekly Executive Council meeting, Lee said Lam's move will be temporary and will ensure the proper use of government resources.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Wan Chai redevelopment plan will go ahead as planned," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The buildings that have been vacated, we should make good use of them. That is why we're now renovating, so as to allow the former chief executive to move in."
  <br>
  <br>
  The government earlier explained that Lam rented the Grade A office space in Admiralty after her term ended in 2022 because there was no room for her at offices for former CEs in Mid-Levels.

<img alt="Houston Rockets guard Jalen Green scored 42 points against the Memphis Grizzlies at Toyota Center. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1787438_1_20250114121505.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Jalen Green matched his career-high with 42 points and the Houston Rockets rallied from a 13-point fourth-quarter deficit to defeat the visiting Memphis Grizzlies 120-118 on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Jake LaRavia supplied the Grizzlies with a 100-87 lead when he stole the ball and sank a layup with 9:55 to play. The Rockets then began their comeback.
  <br>
  <br>
  There were seven lead changes and two ties in the fourth quarter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thompson posted 19 points, 13 rebounds, five blocks and two steals while teammate Alperen Sengun logged 17 points, eight rebounds and five assists. Cam Whitmore tallied 16 points and hit four 3-pointers off the bench. Houston made 16 of 31 from behind the arc and shot 50.6 percent overall.
  <br>
  <br>
  Morant paced the Grizzlies with 29 points but committed seven turnovers. Desmond Bane scored 15 of his 25 points in the third quarter for Memphis, which shot 52.9 percent but could not corral Green throughout the game.
  <br>
  <br>
  Houston has won all three meetings with Memphis this season, two of them in the past five days.
  <br>
  <br>
  Morant scored 10 points as the Grizzlies jumped in from 18-11, but the Rockets answered with a 10-0 run that featured 3-pointers from Green and Dillon Brooks and yielded a 21-18 lead. Memphis responded with a 9-0 spurt capped by a Jaren Jackson Jr. 3-pointer that was part of a 12-2 close to the first period.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Grizzlies made 6 of 14 3-point attempts in the first and turned to their bench whenever the Rockets attempted to rally in the second. LaRavia scored 10 of Memphis' 24 first-half bench points, delivering a timely tip-in and a 3-pointer before a five-point surge from Whitmore.
  <br>
  <br>
  Green completed a four-point play that gave Houston a 55-54 lead, but Memphis scored the next six points and took a 60-57 halftime lead. (Reuters)

 Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday said the government is doing what it can to help Hong Kong residents who were reportedly lured to Southeast Asia for illegal work.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters before the weekly Executive Council meeting, Lee said a task force led by Under Secretary for Security Michael Cheuk has made significant progress.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The visit by the Security Bureau task force I think has achieved some positive results, and they have been met by the Minister of Justice in Thailand," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Thailand officials have already indicated that they will attach great importance to the cases and try all their means to try to rescue those Hong Kong people who are [in captivity]."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee added that authorities will consider various factors when deciding whether to raise Thailand's travel alert to red.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have included a lot of information on the Security Bureau's web page in relation to travel information to Thailand, so I have asked the SB [Security Bureau] to update it regularly with the latest information and developments."
  <br>
  <br>
  SAR officials have received 28 requests for assistance in relation to Hong Kong residents who are allegedly being detained in various Southeast Asian countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sixteen of these people have already returned to Hong Kong, while the other 12 remain stranded.

 Hong Kong passport holders can obtain tourist visas when they arrive at designated control points in Saudi Arabia starting on Wednesday, Chief Executive John Lee announced.
 <br>
  <br>
  Visitors can apply for a multiple-entry visa with stays for up to 90 days or a single-entry visa for a maximum 30-day stay.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That means holders of [an] SAR passport could visit all six members of the Cooperation Council of the Arab States, including Kuwait, Qatar, UAE, Oman and so on," Lee told reporters on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So they could all enjoy either visa-free access or visa-on-arrival application on arrival."
  <br>
  <br>
  Also from Wednesday, Saudi Arabian nationals will be able to visit Hong Kong without a visa for up to 90 days instead of 30, Lee added.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, the Immigration Department said the new arrangements would foster closer ties between the two places.
  <br>
  <br>
  "These arrangements and the extension of the visa-free visit period for nationals of Saudi Arabia will enhance tourism, cultural and economic ties between the two places."

    Three hurt in excavator, rubbish truck smash

<div class="itemFullText">
 Three men were injured on Tuesday when a rubbish truck was crushed by a collapsing noise barrier that had been hit by an out-of-control excavator.
 <br>
  <br>
  The excavator rolled down a slope at a construction site in Lin Tak Road, Lam Tin at around 9.40am, firefighters said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The drivers of both vehicles were among those hurt, but were able to free themselves and were said to have suffered minor injuries.
  <br>
  <br>
  A passenger was trapped in the truck and firefighters spent about two hours freeing him.
  <br>
  <br>
  “After conducting a risk assessment and stabilising the injured person, the Disaster Response and Rescue Team arranged a crane to secure and lift the excavator and the stone block, while simultaneously using explosive tools to create enough space to enable us to rescue him,” Assistant Divisional Officer Kao Chung-lei said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The three men aged between 25 to 50, were conscious when taken to United Christian Hospital for treatment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police said they were investigating the cause of the incident.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong Construction Industry Employees General Union said frontline staff and inspectors should do more to ensure site safety.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Working on-site we have safety personnel and construction workers. They all bear significant responsibility. In situations like this, it's important to find out whether the frontline construction workers and management did their jobs properly," said chairman Chau Sze-kit.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Edward Ma from the Association for the Rights of Industrial Accident Victims said the group is really worried about serious industrial accidents occurring two days in a row, adding that safety awareness is still lacking.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eleven people were injured in a scaffolding collapse at a construction site in Kai Tak on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The code of practice on bamboo scaffolding safety was revised in October, requiring workers to hold a valid safety training certificate before carrying out such works.
  <br>
  <br>
  Labour minister Chris Sun said on Tuesday that the administration would hold a conference with relevant stakeholders to seek improvements in the industry workflow.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Apart from looking into whether or not those involved, have fully complied with the code of practice, we have to look at, which is why we're going to hold a stakeholders conference, inviting not just those involved in scaffolding work, but also the principal contractors as well as those responsible for installing external glass walls,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It's because we have to look at not just the scaffolding work itself, but also the workflow, and also the related work procedures.”
  <br>
  <br>
  He added the government will step up its inspections, as well as take enforcement action against those violating the law.

    Thailand still safe for tourists: travel agency boss

<img alt="Thailand is one of Hong Kong residents' favourite destinations, attracting around 1 million visitors from the SAR each year before Covid. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1787420_2_20250114120033.jpg&q=30">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A leading travel agency said on Tuesday it has no plans to adjust the itinerary of its package tours to Thailand, amid an ongoing investigation by the Hong Kong government to see if any SAR resident was unlawfully detained there.
 <br>
  <br>
  In an interview with RTHK, EGL Tours executive director Steve Huen insisted Thailand remains safe for recreational travellers, and dismissed fears that people would be abducted on the streets.
  <br>
  <br>
  He pointed out the SAR's amber outbound travel alert was issued years ago in response to mass demonstrations in Thailand, and had nothing to do with the current situation.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Huen admitted that enquiries for travel products in the region have dropped. A few individual customers who decided to go ahead signed up for package tours because they felt safer to stick to a group, he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  He did offer some general tips for travellers whenever they are overseas.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When heading out at night for a drink or walk, you should be careful," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You should also stay alert, and for instance, not let others exploit our kindness and trick us into into suffering financial losses."
  <br>
  <br>
  He was confident the jitters will die down soon, especially after government officials clarified on Monday that none of the Hongkongers involved in the alleged incidents of false imprisonment were abducted
  <br>
  <br>
  A task force led by Undersecretary for Security Michael Cheuk is expected to return from Bangkok on Tuesday evening.

<img alt="CES 2025 saw more than 138,000 attendees, according to the Consumer Technology Association. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1787411_1_20250114100720.jpg&q=45">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Everything from autonomous snow blowers to humanoid robots filled the show floors at this year's Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas.
 <br>
  <br>
  Considered the World Cup of technology, the world's largest personal electronics convention wrapped up on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Making their tech presence felt at the four-day event were nearly 100 registered companies from Hong Kong, more than half supported by the Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks Corporation (HKSTP).
  <br>
  <br>
  "So this year, we bring 51 companies from Hong Kong... it's actually a huge growth compared to last year. Last year we have about 18," says Derek Chim, Head of Startup Ecosystem at HKSTP.
  <br>
  <br>
  HKSTP-supported companies brought in three CES Innovation Awards.
  <br>
  <br>
  One of those, Vidi Labs, demonstrated how their wearable device - with AI-driven software - could describe the surrounding environment for a visually-impaired user.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This actually proves a lot that the route that we are on is actually the right one, because a product like this not only is for Hong Kong, it's actually for the rest of the world," said Turzo Bose, co-founder & CEO of Vidi Labs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Also at the Hong Kong Pavilion, South Korean Minji Seo - who earned her PhD in Hong Kong - displays technology that rejuvenates your eyeballs with hot yoga therapy. It's intended to help people with dry eyes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We create a vacuum seal, using the silicone band around the goggle, and that's the chamber that we are controlling the temperature and pressure. Our main goal to join this event was to, like, verify whether we have a market here. And we definitely verified it," said Seo, founder of Ooley Care.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another Hong Kong exhibitor, Michael Wong - a veteran of the Hong Kong hair care industry - uses a scanner to take images of your hair and scalp, and provide an analysis and recommendation for the right shampoo, conditioner and treatment.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We use over millions of pictures to train our AI models so that's why it's accurate, over 90 percent. So everything just can do it within three minutes. So every American has their hair growth again, said Wong, founder and CEO of HairCoSys.
  <br>
  <br>
  His showmanship helps his startup, HairCoSys, stand out among the more than 4,500 exhibitors.
  <br>
  <br>
  But so do products with unique compositions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fever Chu, co-founder of Zence Object Technology, displays everything from a TV remote that integrates recycled tea leaves, to a calculator frame composed of coffee grounds.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are using their waste and turn it into new material and give back to them. Somehow we can help them to promote their waste product, the material, to the bigger market," said Chu.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chu says their products have drawn plenty of interest.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Last night... over 60 [emails] within two days to the potential clients."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chu says he has already heard back from many of them, confirming his belief that companies around the world want a greener supply chain.

    Former heavyweight champion Fury retires from boxing

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Heavyweight Tyson Fury declared he's retiring from boxing in a brief social media post on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The former heavyweight champion, 36, claims he's calling it quits for the fourth time. "The Gypsy King" suffered a second consecutive defeat last month to Oleksandr Usyk.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hi everybody, I'm going to make this short and sweet. I'd like to announce my retirement from boxing," Fury said in a video shared via Instagram.
  <br>
  <br>
  In May 2024, Usyk handed Fury his first career loss by split decision to spoil a career 34-0-1 record. Usyk won the rematch in December.
  <br>
  <br>
  By claiming a unanimous decision, Usyk retained the WBA, WBO and WBC heavyweight championships in the fight held in Saudi Arabia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fury retired briefly in 2013, 2017 and 2022. Most recently, he defeated Dillian Whyte via sixth round technical knockout in April 2022 and declared it was his final bout.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he returned to the ring in October 2023 to defeat Derek Chisora in a trilogy fight that was stopped late in the 10th round. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks finished mostly higher on Monday, shrugging off a weak opening and another uptick in Treasury bond yields amid shifting monetary policy expectations.
 <br>
  <br>
  US indices began the day in the same posture as Friday's session, when equities sold off after a strong jobs report was seen as dimming the odds for Federal Reserve interest rate cuts.
  <br>
  <br>
  But two of the three major indices finished the day in positive territory, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 0.9 percent at 42,297.
  <br>
  <br>
  The broad-based S&P 500 climbed 0.2 percent to 5,836, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index declined 0.4 percent to 19,088, well above its session lows.
  <br>
  <br>
  LBBW's Karl Haeling said the market is less overbought compared with a few weeks ago after the sluggish beginning to 2025 equity trading.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The market is showing less sensitivity to higher bond yields," Haeling said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among individual companies, Johnson & Johnson rose 1.7 percent after announcing a deal to acquire Intra-Cellular Therapies for about US$14.6 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Intra-Cellular, which focuses on treatments for depression and schizophrenia, jumped 34.1 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Moderna sank 16.8 percent as it projected 2025 revenues of between US$1.5 and US$2.5 billion, falling from the 2024 level of around US$3 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Retail shares were mixed following financial updates that included inputs from the critical holiday shopping season. Macy's dropped 8.2 percent and Abercrombie & Fitch slumped 15.6 percent but Lululemon Athletica climbed 0.9 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  This week's calendar includes earnings from large banks, as well as economic releases on US inflation and retail sales. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Joe Biden said on Monday that a ceasefire and hostage-release deal between Hamas and Israel is "on the brink" of being finalised, amid growing optimism in Washington about negotiations in the Middle East.
 <br>
  <br>
  "In the war between Israel and Hamas, we're on the brink of a proposal that I laid out in detail months ago finally coming to fruition," Biden said in a farewell speech at the State Department.
  <br>
  <br>
  Biden has been working the phones as he seeks a prized peace deal in his final days in office before Donald Trump returns to the White House on January 20.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the proposed agreement would include a surge of aid to Palestinians in Gaza, the release of hostages held by Hamas and a halt to the fighting in the enclave.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're working urgently to close this deal," Biden said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The outgoing US president said he would be speaking soon to Egypt's President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, who has played a key role in negotiations.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also spoke to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday and called the ruler of mediator Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani, on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  A peace deal has seemed within reach on a number of previous occasions since the Gaza war broke out following Hamas's October 6, 2023 attack on Israel, only then to collapse.
  <br>
  <br>
  But optimism is growing in Washington that an agreement is possible.
  <br>
  <br>
  US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said earlier Monday as that a truce was "close."
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are close to a deal, and it can get done this week," Sullivan told reporters at the White House.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm not making a promise or prediction, but it is there for the taking, and we are going to work to make it happen."
  <br>
  <br>
  Sullivan said the "gaps have fundamentally narrowed down" between Israel and Hamas. (AFP)

    'Thailand vows to help secure safe return of HKers'

<div class="itemFullText">
 Security chief Chris Tang on Monday said senior Thai officials have promised to do all they could to secure the safe return of Hongkongers who were reportedly lured to Southeast Asia for illegal work.
 <br>
  <br>
  "The minister of justice gave great importance of our concern, and had responded positively. [Thai authorities] said they would do their utmost to help with the safe return of the Hong Kong people," said Tang, who stressed that none of those involved were abducted.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tang's comments came as a task force, led by Under Secretary for Security Michael Cheuk, met Thai officials and representatives of the Chinese embassy in Bangkok.
  <br>
  <br>
  They spoke with representatives from Thailand's justice ministry who sit on the Anti Trafficking-in-Persons Committee chaired by the country's prime minister.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cheuk said he is confident that Thai authorities would do their best to help those affected, noting that Hongkongers involved had been brought to areas near borders with Myanmar and Laos.
  <br>
  <br>
  He declined to disclose further details, saying that the SAR government wishes to rescue these residents as soon as possible.
  <br>
  <br>
  The task force also held talks with Wu Zhiwu, the deputy chief of mission at the Chinese embassy in Thailand, on topics such as offering consular assistance, before meeting with staff at the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office in the Thai capital to discuss further actions.
  <br>
  <br>
  The delegation is set to meet representatives of the Royal Thai Police on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  SAR authorities have so far received 28 requests for assistance in relation to Hong Kong residents alleging to be detained in Southeast Asian countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sixteen of these people have already returned to Hong Kong, while the remaining 12 reported that there were restrictions on their movement but were safe and able to remain in touch with the task force.

    China's economy to surpass US from 2030: economist

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A prominent Chinese economist and national political advisor said China is likely to surpass the United States and become the world's largest economy in about five years, as he dismissed concerns of a second Trump administration's impact on the nation.
 <br>
  <br>
  The remarks came as Professor Justin Lin, former chief economist and senior vice president at the World Bank, spoke to reporters during the 18th edition of the Asian Financial Forum in Hong Kong, following a luncheon speech.
  <br>
  <br>
  Noting that China's economy was experiencing a slowdown, declining from earlier annual growth rates of around nine percent to now about five percent, Lin said that was still about a couple of percentage points higher than the US, which saw its economy expand at around 2.7 percent for 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lin said that if such a trajectory continued, the Chinese economy would be able to surpass the US as the world's largest between 2030 and 2035.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, Lin dismissed concerns about the potential impact of tariffs, one week ahead of US President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We hope Trump will be reasonable, because to charge 60 percent of tariff rates on China, or 25 percent of tariffs on other countries, I don't think that is good for the US, certainly, that's not good for the world [either]," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have no control over the trade policies from the US. But if the US is unreasonable, we should be reasonable. And if we maintain togetherness, I think we will be able to weather through any challenges," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the short-term economic outlook in the country, the senior economist noted the Chinese economy would be able to grow about five percent this year, and the nation would continue to contribute 30 percent or more to global growth.

    'Marriage a goal for many same-sex couples in HK'

<img alt="A CUHK survey suggests many members of sexual minorities in the city hope to get married one day. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1787324_1_20250113172035.jpg&q=70">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A survey carried out by Chinese University researchers suggests many same-sex couples in Hong Kong would like to get married one day.
 <br>
  <br>
  The government last year said it was working on an alternative legal framework, after the city's top court ordered authorities to look at how to recognise same-sex relationships by October.
  <br>
  <br>
  CUHK researchers on Monday said a survey involving 908 people who identify as members of sexual minorities in Hong Kong in 2023 found 90 percent believe same-sex marriage is important, and around 70 percent would like to get married themselves one day.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Right now, so for married heterosexual couples, they already have an existing framework. So if they can pass on kind of the same pattern of laws, which they can call civil partnership, they can call it marriage, but then make it comparable to non-heterosexual couples, then that would be great," said Alan, who joined the researchers' press conference along with his partner Hong.
  <br>
  <br>
  The couple, who wed in the US in 2022, said the lack of legal recognition of same-sex marriages in Hong Kong at the moment can pose challenges.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For example, when my spouse gets sick, I would like to use my insurance package from work so that he can also be covered for medical visits. But I know in Hong Kong, not all insurance companies explicitly state that your spouse also includes same-sex couples," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And also inheritance rights, that's also a significant hurdle for us," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, CUHK said another survey involving 146 people with non-heterosexual children found more than half of the parents were worried their sons and daughters would not get married due to their sexual orientation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Seventy percent of the parents expressed fears that their children would have no one to take care of them when they are older.

    Four critically injured in scaffolding collapse

<div class="itemFullText">
 Eleven people on Monday were injured in a scaffolding collapse at a construction site in Kai Tak, with four in critical condition and one seriously hurt.
 <br>
  <br>
  Emergency personnel received reports of the incident on Shing Cheong Road at around 4pm.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bamboo structure, measuring 60 by 20 metres, was said to give way at the site where the New Acute Hospital is being built.
  <br>
  <br>
  One worker was temporarily trapped five metres above ground after the collapse, according to firefighters, who said the rescue operation took about an hour.
  <br>
  <br>
  Given the seriousness of the incident, police said they are working with government departments to conduct in-depth investigations.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We would see whether anyone should bear criminal responsibility... The cause of the scaffolding collapse is one of the directions of our investigation," said senior Inspector Li Ka-wai of the Kowloon East regional crime unit.
  <br>
  <br>
  The project at the Kai Tak Development Area is set to be one of the largest hospitals in Hong Kong, with 2,400 beds, and 37 operating theatres.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hospital Authority (HA) expressed concerns over the incident and said the injured workers were hired by the contractor, China State Construction Engineering (Hong Kong) Limited.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The incident occurred at one of the buildings at the new acute hospital construction site, where curtain wall installation works were undergone," the authority said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "All scaffolding work at the site will be temporarily suspended, and the HA reserves the right to hold the construction contractor accountable."
  <br>
  <br>
  The authority has instructed the contractor to implement all necessary safety measures as soon as possible and requested it to thoroughly investigate the cause of the incident and to submit a report.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fay Siu from the Association for the Rights of Industrial Accident Victims noted that a similar incident happened in Kai Tak almost a year ago, saying it showed that there are safety hazards when bamboo scaffolding is used.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The government should review the safety of bamboo scaffolding, because they are not made from a very stable material," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If we are continuing to use bamboo scaffolding, there should be better inspections. The use of metal scaffolding should be encouraged too."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong Construction Industry Employees General Union has also strongly urged labour authorities to conduct an in-depth probe and make its report public.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Labour Department must seriously learn from the hard lessons of past industrial accidents, quickly review regulatory and enforcement loopholes, swiftly address deficiencies, and effectively strengthen supervision and inspection work," it said.

    'Reducing sodium will not affect dim sum taste'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Centre for Food Safety of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department urged dim sum restaurants to reduce sodium content in their dishes after its survey revealed that a small decrease in salt would not affect its taste.
 <br>
  <br>
  The department conducted a test among 72 people to evaluate standard and reduced-sodium samples of two types of classic dim sum dishes, including shrimp siu mai and steamed pork ribs in black bean sauce.
  <br>
  <br>
  The results showed that only 15 people were able to identify the altered shrimp siu mai, while only 13 spotted the modified steamed pork ribs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tony Chow, principal medical officer of risk assessment and communication at the Centre for Food Safety, said restaurants could consider choosing ingredients with lower sodium content or using natural ingredients for flavouring and marinating.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We advise the [dim sum] trade to consider the reformulation of the dim sum so that the sodium content can be reduced because our study indicates that for the 10 to 20 percent reduction in sodium, the consumer will not differentiate the difference in the sodium content," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They should not worry [that] the less salty food will be rejected by the consumer."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chow also said people should request that their dim sum be served separately from sauces when possible, and to taste before including additional flavouring.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also recommended that people share dim sum dishes when possible to avoid indulging, adding that the elderly should be more mindful of sodium levels when choosing their dishes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The department said the World Health Organisation recommends less than five grammes of salt intake daily, as excessive sodium intake could increase the risk of high blood pressure, and other diseases.

    Blue Origin pushes back launch of giant new rocket

<div class="itemFullText">
 Jeff Bezos's Blue Origin will have to wait a little longer for the long-anticipated maiden orbital flight of its brand-new rocket after a launch attempt dragged on for hours before being canceled due to unspecified technical issues.
 <br>
  <br>
  The towering 98-metre rocket, dubbed New Glenn in honor of legendary astronaut John Glenn, was scheduled to lift off from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station during a three-hour window starting at 1am (0600 GMT) on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the countdown repeatedly stalled as teams scrambled to resolve anomalies, before the mission was officially "scrubbed" around 3.10am.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are standing down today's launch attempt to troubleshoot a vehicle subsystem issue that will take us beyond our launch window," said Ariane Cornell, a Blue Origin executive, during a livestream watched by hundreds of thousands of viewers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cornell added: "We are reviewing opportunities for our next launch attempt."
  <br>
  <br>
  With the mission, dubbed NG-1, billionaire Amazon founder Bezos is taking aim at the only man in the world wealthier than him: Elon Musk, whose company SpaceX dominates the orbital launch market through its prolific Falcon 9 rockets, vital for the commercial sector, the Pentagon and Nasa.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bezos, who celebrated his 61st birthday on Sunday, watched the events unfold from the nearby launch control room.
  <br>
  <br>
  Musk, for his part, wished Blue Origin "Good luck!" on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  "SpaceX has for the past several years been pretty much the only game in town, and so having a competitor... this is great," G. Scott Hubbard, a retired senior Nasa official, told AFP, expecting the competition to drive down costs.

    SKorea to adapt airport barriers after plane crash

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korean authorities on Monday said they would change the concrete barriers used for navigation at airports around the country after the Jeju Air crash that left 179 people dead.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Boeing 737-800 was flying from Thailand to Muan, South Korea, on December 29 carrying 181 passengers and crew when it belly-landed at Muan airport and exploded in a fireball after slamming into a concrete barrier.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was the worst-ever aviation disaster on South Korean soil.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Improvement was deemed necessary including the localiser and its foundations for a total of nine facilities across seven airports, including Muan airport," the land ministry said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The changes would also apply to international airports in the cities of Jeju and Gimhae.
  <br>
  <br>
  South Korean and US investigators are still probing the cause of the crash, which prompted a national outpouring of mourning with memorials set up across the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  Attention has focused on several possible causes but questions have been raised about why the concrete barricade, known as a localiser and used to help planes navigate their landings, was at the end of the runway.
  <br>
  <br>
  The barrier at Muan airport was blamed for exacerbating the crash's severity.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ministry said it would finalise plans to adapt the localisers by the end of January, with the aim of "completing upgrades within this year".
  <br>
  <br>
  The investigation was further clouded on Saturday when the transport ministry said the black boxes holding the flight data and cockpit voice recorders for the crashed flight stopped recording four minutes before the disaster.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities have raided offices at Muan airport, a regional aviation office in the southwestern county, and Jeju Air's office in the capital Seoul as the probe continues.
  <br>
  <br>
  The land ministry added that Muan airport's closure period had been extended until January 19. (AFP)

    HK can help companies diversify risk: FS

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan said on Monday that Hong Kong can offer professional services to companies seeking to diversify risk by moving their businesses to different places.
 <br>
  <br>
  At the annual Asian Financial Forum, the minister noted that many firms are realigning or restructuring their industrial and supply chains across different countries, particularly in the Global South.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said Hong Kong, as a supply chain management centre, has things to offer companies seeking diversification.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The [firms] would require project finance, corporate treasury and logistics services, professional consultancies and extensive international connections," Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong is well positioned and geared up to provide all these services as a one-stop shop to help businesses expand their presence in the region and beyond effectively."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said the SAR will navigate the global geopolitical and economic landscape with caution and confidence, saying opportunities come with every challenge.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that Hong Kong can also offer technological solutions and sustainable development for the region, with its plans to develop an innovation and technology cooperation zone with Shenzhen in the Hetao area, also known as the Lok Ma Chau Loop.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said the SAR is looking to expand in areas such as artificial intelligence, biotech and new energy.
  <br>
  <br>
  And the Loop, he said, is an example of Hong Kong forming synergy with sister cities in the Greater Bay area for IT development, such as speeding up the development of medicines.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[The zone] will be a base to pioneer with innovative policies and collaborations, such as joint clinical trials that leverage on data and bio-samples from both the mainland and Hong Kong," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister stressed that these areas of development come on top of the SAR's traditional positioning as an international financial centre.

    Seoul says 300 NKorean soldiers killed in Ukraine

<img alt="A photograph shows an alleged North Korean soldier detained by Ukrainian authorities at an undisclosed location in Ukraine. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1787299_1_20250113153440.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Around 300 North Korean soldiers have been killed and 2,700 wounded while fighting for Russia, a South Korean lawmaker said Monday, citing information from Seoul's spy agency.
 <br>
  <br>
  Seoul has previously claimed that North Korean leader Kim Jong-un sent more than 10,000 soldiers to fight in the Ukraine conflict, in return for Russian technical assistance for Pyongyang's heavily sanctioned weapons and satellite programmes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Over the weekend, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Kyiv had captured two North Korean soldiers, releasing video of the injured combatants being interrogated and raising the possibility of a prisoner swap for captured Ukrainian troops.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The deployment of North Korean troops to Russia has reportedly expanded to include the Kursk region, with estimates suggesting that casualties among North Korean forces have surpassed 3,000," lawmaker Lee Seong-kweun told reporters after a briefing from the spy agency.
  <br>
  <br>
  This includes "approximately 300 deaths and 2,700 injuries," Lee said, after a briefing from Seoul's National Intelligence Service (NIS).
  <br>
  <br>
  The soldiers, reportedly from North Korea's elite Storm Corps, have been ordered to kill themselves rather than be taken prisoner, Lee said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Notably, memos found on deceased soldiers indicate that the North Korean authorities pressured them to commit suicide or self-detonate before capture," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that some of the soldiers had been granted "amnesty" or wanted to join North Korea's ruling Workers' Party, hoping to improve their lot by fighting.
  <br>
  <br>
  The NIS analysis also revealed that the North Korean soldiers have "a lack of understanding of modern warfare," and are being used by Russia in a manner leading to "the high number of casualties," the lawmaker said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee -- speaking for South Korea's intelligence committee in parliament -- said in the coming year, US president-elect Donald Trump, who has previously tried to woo North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, "may push for dialogue... once again".
  <br>
  <br>
  He also said Kim may "weigh the possibility of a visit to Russia in the first half of this year" after meeting Russian President Vladimir Putin in late 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a post on the social media platform X on Sunday, Zelensky said: "Ukraine is ready to hand over Kim Jong-un's soldiers to him if he can organise their exchange for our warriors who are being held captive in Russia."
  <br>
  <br>
  There would "undoubtedly be more" North Korean soldiers captured by Kyiv, he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For those North Korean soldiers who do not wish to return, there may be other options available," said Zelensky.
  <br>
  <br>
  Neither Moscow nor Pyongyang has acknowledged that North Koreans have been deployed to fight. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Tourism officials on Monday called on industry leaders to find ways to attract more overnight visitors to Hong Kong during the Lunar New Year "golden week" holiday on the mainland, as they expect a significant rise in tourist numbers over the eight-day period.
 <br>
  <br>
  Rosanna Law, the secretary for culture, sports and tourism, noted the upcoming holiday is a peak travel season and the SAR would be holding a series of festive activities.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We expect there to be a significant increase in tourists visiting Hong Kong during the Lunar New Year golden week," Law said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We encourage the industry to seize this opportunity and be flexible to provide visitors with more high-quality and innovative experiences, attract them to stay overnight in Hong Kong to fully experience Hong Kong's unique festive atmosphere."
  <br>
  <br>
  Law, who chaired a meeting with various government departments and representatives of the tourism and hotel sectors, also said relevant authorities would continue to maintain close communication and make preparations on welcoming visitors.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The chief executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, Eddie Yue, has welcomed news that the People's Bank of China will unveil various measures to boost financial collaboration between the SAR and the mainland.
 <br>
  <br>
  PBOC Governor Pan Gongsheng made the announcement during a speech on the first day of the Asian Financial Forum.
  <br>
  <br>
  The measures include the linking of Hong Kong's Fast Payment System (FPS) to the mainland's Internet Banking Payment System (IBPS).
  <br>
  <br>
  “Residents in the two places can make real-time cross-boundary payments using their phone number,” Yue told reporters after attending the forum.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We expect to launch part of the service in the middle of the year, and will expand the scheme slowly and in an orderly manner, based on our actual implementation situation and experience.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Other measures include the launch of a trade finance scheme to help enterprises trading in yuan improve liquidity.
  <br>
  <br>
  There will be 100 billion yuan available in currency swaps for one, three and six months.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yue said the scheme will be rolled out by February.
  <br>
  <br>
  From Tuesday, the clearing time for Southbound Trading under Bond Connect will be pushed back by one hour to 4.30pm, while mainland investors will also be allowed to buy securities of more currency types, including the US dollar and the euro.
  <br>
  <br>
  Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury Christopher Hui, for his part, said the various measures show the central bank’s support in consolidating Hong Kong’s role as a financial centre.

    400mil pilgrims gather for giant Hindu festival

<div class="itemFullText">
 Vast crowds of Hindu pilgrims in India began bathing in sacred waters on Monday as the Kumbh Mela festival opened, with organisers expecting 400 million people -- the largest gathering of humanity.
 <br>
  <br>
  The millennia-old Kumbh Mela, a show of religious piety and ritual bathing -- and a logistical challenge of staggering proportions -- is held at the site where the Ganges, Yamuna and mythical Saraswati rivers meet.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the cool pre-dawn gloom, pilgrims surged forward to begin bathing in the waters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I feel great joy," said Surmila Devi, 45.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For me, it's like bathing in nectar."
  <br>
  <br>
  Businesswoman Reena Rai's voice quivered with excitement as she spoke about the "religious reasons" that brought her to join the sprawling tents, packed along the river banks in the north Indian city of Prayagraj in Uttar Pradesh state.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As a Hindu, this is an unmissable occasion," said the 38-year-old, who travelled around 1,000 kilometres from Madhya Pradesh state to take part in the festival, which runs from Monday until February 26.
  <br>
  <br>
  Saffron-robed monks and naked ash-smeared ascetics roamed the crowds offering blessings to devotees, many of whom had walked for weeks to reach the site.
  <br>
  <br>
  The massive congregation is also an occasion for India's Hindu nationalist government to burnish its credentials.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prime Minister Narendra Modi called it a "divine occasion", that brings together "countless people in a sacred confluence of faith, devotion and culture".
  <br>
  <br>
  Yogi Adityanath, a Hindu monk and Utter Pradesh's chief minister, welcomed devotees to "experience unity in diversity" at the "world's largest spiritual and cultural gathering".
  <br>
  <br>
  Organisers say the scale of the Kumbh Mela is that of a temporary country -- with numbers expected to total around the combined populations of the United States and Canada.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Some 350 to 400 million devotees are going to visit the mela, so you can imagine the scale of preparations," festival spokesman Vivek Chaturvedi said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hindu monks carried huge flags of their respective sects, while tractors turned into chariots for life-size idols of Hindu gods rolled by behind them accompanied by elephants.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pilgrims exulted in the beat of drums and honking horns.
  <br>
  <br>
  The festival is rooted in Hindu mythology, a battle between deities and demons for control of a pitcher containing the nectar of immortality.
  <br>
  <br>
  Organising authorities are calling it the great or "Maha" Kumbh Mela. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Governor of the People's Bank of China (PBOC) Pan Gongsheng on Monday said Beijing will significantly increase the proportion of its national foreign exchange reserves and asset allocation in Hong Kong, as part of efforts to boost the development of the city's financial markets.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at the 18th annual Asian Financial Forum in the SAR, Pan also said authorities will continue to deepen the financial market connectivity between Hong Kong and the mainland, to attract foreign capital.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Prosperous capital markets are the cornerstone of Hong Kong as an international financial centre...We'll support more quality enterprises to list and issue bonds in the SAR, and continue to improve connectivity between the mainland and Hong Kong in areas like stocks, bonds, wealth management and interest rate swaps, to deepen financial cooperation within the Greater Bay Area," he told forum participants.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will significantly increase the proportion of our foreign exchange reserves and our asset allocation in Hong Kong to open up a broader space for Hong Kong's financial development."
  <br>
  <br>
  Pan said the PBOC and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority will introduce relevant policies to improve Hong Kong's offshore renminbi markets, while providing more convenience regarding cross-border payment and settlements.
  <br>
  <br>
  One of the measures is the launch of an additional renminbi trade financing liquidity fund, with terms of one month, three months and six months, totalling 100 billion yuan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, Zhou Ji, executive deputy director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office (HKMAO), said the central government will continue to support the SAR in consolidating its status as a global financial hub.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the future, the central government will, as always, do its utmost to support the consolidation of Hong Kong's status as an international financial centre, trade centre and shipping centre, and will support the SAR in accelerating the pace of developing scientific and technological innovation," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  On another note, Zhou said Beijing will continue to create new advantages by developing new quality productive forces to help with regional growth, stressing that the Chinese economy remains resilient with stable fundamentals.

    China's foreign trade hits new high in 2024

<img alt="Chinese exports surged to record highs in 2024 as the prospect of a testing second Trump administration looms. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1787274_1_20250113125415.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China's exports surged to a record high in 2024, providing a much-needed boost for the economy as the prospect of biting tariffs imposed by US President-elect Donald Trump looms.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump, set to return to the White House next week, has proposed hefty tariffs on Chinese goods, sparking fears of a renewed trade war between the two superpowers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Total exports in 2024 exceeded 25 trillion yuan for the first time, reaching 25.45 trillion yuan (US$3.47 trillion), a year-on-year increase of 7.1 percent", according to state media.
  <br>
  <br>
  Imports rose 2.3 percent to 18.39 trillion yuan, state media said, adding that combined trade swelled five percent to reach a record 43.85 trillion yuan.
  <br>
  <br>
  With exports outpacing imports, China's trade surplus grew to US$104.84 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a government press conference in Beijing on Monday, General Administration of Customs deputy head Wang Lingjun said that China's foreign trade growth in 2024 was relatively fast among major economies in the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China has become a major trading partner of more than 150 countries and regions, and the country's circle of friends in foreign trade is getting larger," Wang said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The official said that the structure of import and export products had also been continuously optimised and upgraded last year, with high-tech products reporting good growth numbers and a boom in new types of trade such as cross-border e-commerce.
  <br>
  <br>
  China's exports are likely to remain strong in the near-term, said Huang Zichun of Capital Economics, as businesses try to “front-run” potentially higher tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Outbound shipments are likely to stay resilient in the near-term, supported by further gains in global market share thanks to a weak real effective exchange rate," she wrote in a note.
  <br>
  <br>
  But exports will likely weaken later in the year if Trump follows through on his threat to impose tariffs, Huang said. (Xinhua/Agencies)

    'High hopes for the SAR's task force in Thailand'

<img alt="Former security minister Lai Tung-kwok said he was confident the SAR task force in Thailand would deliver results. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1787266_1_20250113115736.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Former security minister Lai Tung-kwok said he was optimistic about the prospects of the SAR's task force in Thailand, which is investigating allegations that Hongkongers have been lured to Southeast Asian countries to engage in illegal types of work.
 <br>
  <br>
  The task force, led by Undersecretary for Security Michael Cheuk, with members from Security Bureau and the Immigration Department, flew to Thailand on Sunday, after receiving 28 requests for assistance connected to Hong Kong residents who were allegedly held in the region against their will.
  <br>
  <br>
  So far, 16 people have managed to return to Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  Seven men and five women reported restrictions on their movement, but are safe and able to remain in touch with the task force. It is thought they were not forcibly abducted.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a RTHK programme on Monday, Lai said the SAR government was highly concerned which is why it sent the task force led by Cheuk.
  <br>
  <br>
  He had high hopes for the task force's prospects given it has been liaising with Thai authorities.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lai also believed the Thai police would also pay high attention to such incidents, considering the potential impact on tourism.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The Thai police also attach importance to this issue because it seriously affects the country's tourist industry. There have been media reports that many mainland tourists have cancelled trips to Thailand over the upcoming Lunar New Year - so I think Thailand wants to handle any incidents well,” Lai said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lai said many were lured to Southeast Asia on bogus job offers.
  <br>
  <br>
  He called on authorities to raise public awareness about the dangers of getting lured by such schemes.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The death toll from massive wildfires that have ravaged Los Angeles rose to 24 on Sunday, with officials warning of incoming dangerous winds that could whip the blazes up further.
 <br>
  <br>
  The fires continued to rip through the United States' second-largest city for the sixth day, reducing whole communities to scorched rubble and leaving thousands without homes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Massive firefighting efforts have staunched the spread of the Palisades Fire, which was looming toward upscale Brentwood and the densely populated San Fernando Valley.
  <br>
  <br>
  But conditions are set to dramatically worsen, with "extreme fire behavior and life threatening conditions" over the coming days.
  <br>
  <br>
  Winds up to 110 kilometers per hour mean a "particularly dangerous situation (PDS)" will be declared from early Tuesday, said National Weather Service meteorologist Rose Schoenfeld.
  <br>
  <br>
  These gusts could fan flames and whip up embers from existing burn zones into new areas, firefighters warned.
  <br>
  <br>
  Los Angeles County Fire Department chief Anthony Marrone said his department had received resources including dozens of new water trucks and firefighters from far afield and was primed to face the renewed threat.
  <br>
  <br>
  Questioned whether hydrants could run dry again, as they did during the initial outbreak of fires last week, Mayor Karen Bass replied: "I believe the city is prepared." (AFP)

    Pollster under probe over 'assisting absconder'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Security minister Chris Tang has confirmed that national security police are investigating whether pollster Robert Chung or his research organisation had provided assistance to an absconder.
 <br>
  <br>
  Sources earlier said Chung was taken away from his home on Monday morning, and brought to the Wong Chuk Hang office of the Public Opinion Research Institute, of which he is president and chief executive officer.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Chung was being invited back to the police station for investigations on suspected assistance to an absconder. At this moment in time, Chung has not been arrested," Tang told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This has nothing to do with any research being done by Chung or his organisation. Our whole investigation is focusing on how Chung and his organisation [allegedly assisted] the absconder. It's absolutely nothing to do with the result of their poll."
  <br>
  <br>
  It's understood the probe is related to the pollster's former deputy at the institute, Chung Kim-wah.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last month, Chung Kim-wah was last month put on a police wanted list for alleged national security offences.
  <br>
  <br>
  He is suspected of inciting secession on social media and colluding with foreign forces, and police are offering a HK$1 million reward for information leading to his arrest.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee has told thousands of business leaders from around the world that Hong Kong is working towards developing itself into an international gold trading centre.
 <br>
  <br>
  Delivering his opening remarks at the Asian Financial Forum on Monday, Lee revealed that the SAR will build world-class gold storage facilities, and strengthen support services in insurance, testing and certification, as well as logistics.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Ultimately, we plan to create a holistic gold trading centre with an industry chain," Lee said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The stability in Hong Kong amidst rapid changes in geopolitics around the world will provide a world of investors a secure environment for gold storage as well as other forms of wealth management."
  <br>
  <br>
  He also said the SAR will build on its existing advantages, and expand its overseas network, particularly with Belt and Road countries and regions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our strategies include strengthening financial cooperation with the Middle East and the 10-member states of ASEAN, as well as other established and emerging markets."
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will also organise more international financial events, seek collaboration in financial products, talent and experience sharing, and attract more overseas enterprises and capital to Hong Kong."
  <br>
  <br>
  The 18th edition of the two-day Asian Financial Forum - themed "Powering the Next Growth Engine" - has attracted some 3,600 business and financial leaders from more than 50 countries and regions this year.

<img alt="Denver Nuggets guard Russell Westbrook motions to Mavericks fans after scoring on a layup. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1787254_1_20250113102753.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Denver Nuggets, fired by standout performances from Russell Westbrook and Nikola Jokic, rallied from a 19-point third-quarter deficit to beat the Dallas Mavericks 112-101.
 <br>
  <br>
  Westbrook scored 21 points with 10 rebounds and seven assists, reigning NBA Most Valuable Player Jokic scored 19 points with 18 rebounds and nine assists and the Nuggets out-scored the Mavs 33-12 in the fourth quarter to seize the victory in Texas.
  <br>
  <br>
  In fact the Nuggets put together two impressive comeback runs, erasing a seven-point deficit to take a one-point lead early in the third quarter only for the Mavericks to race away again.
  <br>
  <br>
  Denver took the lead for good on Westbrook's running layup for a 97-96 lead with 5:21 to play. Jokic drove for a basket and Westbrook added another layup and the Nuggets pulled away.
  <br>
  <br>
  Klay Thompson scored 25 points to lead the Mavericks, who were again without star guards Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I believe we lead the league in double-figure comebacks, and that's a catch-22 because I don't like the fact that we've been down that many times double figures," Nuggets coach Michael Malone said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "What I love about this group is how resilient they are," he added. "We get down, we stay the course, there is no panic – we stay the course and try to find a way. Didn't like the start, but I loved the finish, and that's all that counts."
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere, Jalen Brunson scored 44 points and Karl-Anthony Towns added 30 points and 18 rebounds to lead the New York Knicks in a 140-106 rout of the Milwaukee Bucks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brunson set a tone with 23 points in the first quarter and shook off a hard fall early in the third, as the Knicks rebounded from a lopsided loss to the Oklahoma City Thunder on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Giannis Antetokounmpo scored 24 points and Damian Lillard added 22 for the Bucks, whose three-game winning streak ended.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the Indiana Pacers erased a 15-point deficit to bring Cleveland's 12-game NBA winning streak to an emphatic end, beating the league-leading Cavaliers 108-93.
  <br>
  <br>
  Andrew Nembhard scored 19 points, Pascal Siakam added 18 and Myles Turner had 15 points and 10 rebounds for the Pacers, who weathered the half-time departure of star guard Tyrese Haliburton with a tight left hamstring.
  <br>
  <br>
  Indiana handed the Cavaliers just their second home defeat of the season, notching their own sixth straight victory by a double-digit margin.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's nothing to lose," Nembhard said of the Pacers' second-half push. "This is the best team in the league right now. We just had to play hard, play together, put some more physicality in the game on the defensive side and play off that." (AFP)
