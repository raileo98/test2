  <div class="itemFullText">
   Manchester United have sacked manager Erik ten Hag, the Premier League club said on Monday, with the Old Trafford side 14th in the standings after nine games.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Erik ten Hag has left his role as Manchester United men’s first-team manager," the club said in a statement.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Ruud van Nistelrooy will take charge of the team as interim head coach, supported by the current coaching team, whilst a permanent head coach is recruited."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The 54-year-old Dutchman's job was the subject of speculation for most of last season as United recorded their worst Premier League finish in eighth, and with British billionaire and INEOS chairman Jim Ratcliffe taking charge of football operations.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A surprise FA Cup final win over Manchester City, however, plus the fact Ten Hag was able to blame numerous injuries for their poor form earned Ten Hag another chance.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He signed a new contract to extend his stay until 2026 and get another chance to restore the 20-times English league champions to former glories.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Early results this season, however, suggested Ten Hag was not going to achieve that. (Reuters)

    HKO seeks HK$55m for new radar system

  <img alt="The Hong Kong Observatory wants HK$55 million from the Legislative Council for a new weather radar system. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1776578_1_20241028175838.jpg&q=85" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The Hong Kong Observatory (HKO) is hoping to set up a new radar system to better monitor and predict severe weather across the city.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The "phased array weather radar system" would provide detailed weather images that update quickly, helping to detect fast-changing weather conditions.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Environment and Ecology Bureau is seeking funding approval from Legco for HK$55 million to buy three sets of the radars.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   At a Legco panel meeting on Monday, Environment Secretary Tse Chin-wan said the system would benefit the development of a low-altitude economy.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Weather of course is important when it comes to low-altitude flying. This radar system could detect weather changes up to a few hundred metres above ground, So the weather radar system will help to enhance the safety of low-altitude vehicles and devices," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Together with an existing one in Sha Lo Wan, the proposed new radars in Cheung Chau, Lau Fau Shan and Tung Lung Chau would cover the whole territory.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Asked how to monitor "ionospheric scintillation" which affects drones, HKO's assistant director Chan Sai-tick said the observatory is using space weather data from the mainland and other countries and looking for ways to track ionosphere changes.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Chan added that the new radars offer higher resolution and faster updates, allowing more accurate predictions of severe weather such as hail and tornadoes.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Cathay Pacific on Monday relaunched direct passenger flights between Hong Kong and Saudi Arabia’s capital, Riyadh, with Financial Secretary Paul Chan taking the first flight servicing the two cities since the route was suspended in 2017.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The flag carrier will operate three flights per week, as authorities push for more cooperation with Middle East countries.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Chan who was aboard flight CX647 is leading a delegation of over 100 representatives from the financial and innovation and technology sectors to Riyadh.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “This symbolises a more frequent and direct people-to-people flow and also trade and cargo flow between the two regions. Cathay Pacific will be increasing its services to this region,” he said before boarding.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “[We are] opening up new markets, attracting new sources of capital, new sources of investment. This is an important move.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Cathay’s chief customer and commercial officer, Lavinia Lau, said the carrier’s aim was to reach 100 worldwide destinations by next year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   She said Cathay received a good response from travellers on the resumption of direct flights to Riyadh.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “The booking is pretty promising, at least for the first few flights… but going forward, we are also seeing a variety of travellers on our flights,” Lau said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “Some of them originating from Hong Kong, a lot actually coming back from the other side, Saudi Arabia, to Hong Kong to visit, or going via Hong Kong to places like Japan to visit. We also see good traffic flows from Southeast Asia, via Hong Kong to Riyadh.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Another passenger on the flight to Riyadh was Nelson. The startup worker said flying direct was much more convenient.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “Last time, I think we had to change from Qatar, so this is really convenient for us. It’s a direct flight. The difference is, first of all, time, and also it’s more convenient for business,” he told RTHK.

    Fast payments to mainland banks possible in 2025: HKMA

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The Monetary Authority on Monday said that locals will soon be able to transfer small amounts of money to mainland accounts through a scheme similar to the Faster Payment System (FPS).
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Its chief executive Eddie Yue said officials are working with their mainland counterparts on the details, and a trial scheme could kick off in the middle of next year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   On the sidelines of the Hong Kong Fintech Week, Yue told reporters that cross-border transfers could be done around the clock and could be made to an account that is linked with a mainland phone number, much like how FPS operates.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Separately, the Securities and Futures Commission said it will consult the trade early next year in creating the roadmap for a new regulatory regime for virtual asset trading platforms.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Currently, three such licences have been approved, with the commission saying it is processing more applications.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The SFC’s intermediaries executive director, Eric Yip, said all licensees will be invited to take part in the consultative panel.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We expect the panel deliberation will result in a comprehensive virtual assets white paper that outlines the development roadmap for products and services, as well as potential enhancement in compliance and risk management," he said in his speech at Fintech Week.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Next is our work to piece the rest of the regulatory regime puzzle. To establish a comprehensive framework for virtual assets, we should make reference to how trading, settlement, and custody work in the traditional securities market."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Yip added that the commission will step up investor education regarding virtual assets, as well as its monitoring of suspicious platforms and alerting investors of potential harm.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   A newly approved hostel project for young Hongkongers has started taking applications, with the first batch of tenants expected to move in as early as December.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Last week, the government gave the green light for the Regal Oriental Hotel in Kowloon City to be partially converted into a youth hostel named “YOT Hub”.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Non-governmental organisation Yan Oi Tong will take ownership of 80 rooms, accommodating up to 160 adults under 30.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Hostel tenants will be asked to take part in 200 hours of activities each year, such as training courses and trips to other parts of the Greater Bay Area.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Henry Cheng, who chairs the organisation’s board of directors, said on Monday that tenants can choose what activities to join.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “The goal to organise these activities is to broaden their horizon and for their personal development,” he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “National education is just one of them. We are looking to take them to the Greater Bay Area, to different enterprises, to let them know how the country has changed, as China has grown quite substantially for the last 10 years.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Employed individuals who meet the income and asset requirements can make single-person applications to be matched with a roommate, or apply as a pair for the same unit.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The total monthly rent of a room ranges from HK$9,000 to HK$9,300.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   As of 4pm on Monday, the project had received about 110 applications, according to the charitable organisation.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The youth hostel will initially run for three years, with tenants signing a two-year contract.

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Former Cyberport CEO Peter Yan has been appointed as Director-General of the Office for Attracting Strategic Enterprises (OASES).
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The government made the announcement on Monday following an open recruitment exercise.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Unveiled in the 2022 Policy Address, OASES aims to attract high-potential and representative enterprises to Hong Kong from industries including fintech, AI and data science.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Yan will assume office on Tuesday and has left his role as a member of the board of directors of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEX).
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He has worked in the technology field for over 39 years and held various senior management positions in large consulting and information technology services companies.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Financial Secretary Paul Chan said in a statement that Yan has rich experience and extensive knowledge in the field of information technology.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I am confident that Mr Yan will lead OASES in attracting more strategic enterprises to Hong Kong, thereby contributing to the city's innovation and technology development as well as its economic upgrading and transformation," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Meanwhile, Herbert Chia has taken the spot on the HKEX board vacated by Yan.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Chia is chairman of the data governance advisory committee of Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks Corporation and a venture partner of Sequoia Capital China.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   South Korean phenom Tom Kim on Monday said he is feeling confident ahead of his return to the Link Hong Kong Open in November, for the first time since 2020.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Kim was speaking to reporters on the heels of a nail-biting defeat to compatriot An Byeong-hun at the 2024 Genesis Championship in Incheon on Sunday, a loss which he is hoping to use as motivation for the SAR tournament.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Link Hong Kong Open, which will be staged for a 63rd time at the Hong Kong Golf Club in Fanling from November 21 to 24, is set to feature a star lineup with the likes of Englishman Justin Rose, who won in 2015.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I'm not thinking too much ahead of myself. I think that's the biggest thing," said the world number 25 – who last year became the youngest golfer since Tiger Woods to land three PGA Tour titles.

   <br/>
   "Golf is golf – anything can happen. Just because you're the highest-ranked player in the world, it doesn't always mean you're going to get the win."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But the 22-year-old, who already has two Asian Tour titles to his name, said he remains unfazed by the pressure, as he begins training to improve on his previous showing in the SAR when he finished 18th.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Seoul-born athlete also shared how looking past the burden of growing expectations has helped him navigate the many challenges of his golf career.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Looking at my career from the very beginning, I've always had steps that I've grown into," Kim said. "And over the past year, there've been times where I've felt stuck."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "So long as I take these hits and learn from them, I can be humble and grateful for when good moments do come," he added.

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris said on Sunday that “no one can sit on the sidelines” in this year's presidential election, capping a day of campaigning across the largest city in the crucial battleground state of Pennsylvania.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “We are focused on the future and we are focused on the needs of the American people," Harris said, "as opposed to Donald Trump, who spends full time looking in the mirror focused on himself.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Speaking at a city recreation centre, the US Vice President singled out young voters, praising them for being “rightly impatient for change," and told the audience that “there is too much at stake” in the campaign.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “We must not wake up the day after the election and have any regret about what we could have done in these next nine days," Harris said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Energising voters in Philadelphia, a traditional Democratic stronghold, is crucial for Harris’ chances of beating Republican presidential candidate Trump.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   If turnout falls short here, she will struggle to overcome her opponent's advantages in the state's rural areas.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Meanwhile, Trump hosted a rally featuring crude and racist insults at New York’s Madison Square Garden on Sunday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   With just over a week before Election Day, speakers at the New York rally labelled Puerto Rico a “floating island of garbage” and called Harris “the devil”.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “I don’t know if you guys know this, but there’s literally a floating island of garbage in the middle of the ocean right now. I think it’s called Puerto Rico,” said Tony Hinchcliffe, a stand-up comic whose set also included lewd and racist comments about Latinos, Jews and Black people, all key constituencies in the election just nine days away.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   His joke was immediately criticised by Harris’ campaign as it competes with Trump to win over Puerto Rican communities in Pennsylvania and other swing states.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Puerto Rican music superstar Bad Bunny backed Harris shortly after Hinchcliffe's appearance.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The normally pugnacious Trump campaign took the rare step of distancing itself from Hinchcliffe. “
   <br/>
   <br/>
   This joke does not reflect the views of President Trump or the campaign," senior adviser Danielle Alvarez said in a statement.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But other speakers also made incendiary comments.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Trump’s childhood friend David Rem referred to Harris as “the Antichrist” and “the devil" while businessman Grant Cardone told the crowd that Harris' handlers "will destroy our country.” (AP)

    LDP heavyweight resigns after Japan election drubbing

  <div class="itemFullText">
   The election committee chief of Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) resigned on Monday after the party suffered its worst result since 2009, a party official said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Shinjiro Koizumi, the son of a former prime minister, submitted a letter of resignation, the official said, with media reports quoting him as saying he wanted to "take responsibility" for the result.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba’s ruling coalition lost a majority in the 465-seat lower house in a snap parliamentary election held on Sunday, a punishment by voters' outrage over the governing party’s extensive financial scandals.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Ishiba's LDP remains the top party in Japan's parliament, and a change of government is not expected. But the results create political uncertainty.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Falling short of a majority makes it difficult for Ishiba to get his party’s policies through parliament, and he may need to find a third coalition partner.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The LDP’s coalition retains a majority in the less powerful upper house.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   All told, the ruling coalition with junior partner Komeito secured 215 seats, down sharply from the majority of 279 it previously held, according to Japanese media.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Ishiba took office on October 1 and immediately ordered the election in hopes of shoring up support after his predecessor, Fumio Kishida , failed to address public outrage over the LDP’s scandals.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “The results so far have been extremely severe, and we take them very seriously," Ishiba told Japan's national NHK television late Sunday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “I believe the voters are telling us to reflect more and become a party that lives up to their expectations."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Ishiba said the LDP would still lead a ruling coalition and tackle key policies, compile a planned supplementary budget and pursue political reform.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He indicated that his party is open to cooperating with opposition groups if that suits the public's expectations.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan, led by centrist leader Yoshihiko Noda, made huge gains to 148 seats, from its previous 98.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “We accomplished our goal of preventing the ruling coalition from a majority, which was a major achievement,” Noda said. (Agencies)

    Govt announces AI policy statement for finance market

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The government delivered a policy statement on Monday on the responsible use of artificial intelligence (AI) in the finance market, saying it is addressing challenges the technology brings and encouraging its development.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In the statement, the administration said it is both open and prudent towards the application of AI, while saying it wants the sector to use it in a responsible manner, noting issues such as cybersecurity and intellectual property rights.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Financial Secretary Paul Chan said officials will closely monitor market developments and draw on experiences on the mainland and overseas.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He said the government will promote the use of AI in finance to accelerate the development of new quality productive forces tailored to Hong Kong's conditions.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We consider it appropriate to adopt a dual-track model to AI. We will continue to encourage the adoption of AI to capture opportunities, while assessing its associated risks from time to time and mitigate them," the minister said during a speech at Hong Kong Fintech Week.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury Christopher Hui said the University of Science and Technology will allow financial firms to use its AI language model, called InvestLM.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "[The university is] going to make their model available for use, not just for the big firms, but also the small firms in the financial services sector, including accounting and others, in such a way that they can try for themselves how AI can improve their work processes," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Hui added that around 38 percent of institutions in the local financial sector use AI, about 12 percentage points higher than the global average.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In the policy statement, the government added that it thinks the use of AI in finance is data-driven and dynamic, yet also double-edged in that it has both potential and risks. It said AI is a tool and shouldn't replace human judgement and analysis.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Financial institutions should formulate an AI governance strategy to provide direction on how AI systems should be implemented and used. A risk-based approach should be adopted in the procurement, use and management of AI systems and human oversight will be crucial to mitigating the potential risks," it said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The government said risks posed by the technology have been suitably reflected in relevant regulations and guidelines issued by financial regulators.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Officials also said the police have been exchanging intelligence with their overseas counterparts and the AI industry to address the cyber policing challenges posed by AI.

    'More considered discussion on student suicide needed'

  <img alt="A concern group says there should be more considered discussion of student suicides following a backlash over a scholar's remarks on the issue. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1776522_1_20241028115226.jpg&q=85" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   A concern group on Monday called for more considered and respectful discussion of student suicides, after a scholar's remarks on the issue sparked a backlash.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It came after Professor Ricky Tse, who is with the Life Education Centre of Hong Kong Nang Yan College of Higher Education, said students wouldn't kill themselves if they thought more about social responsibility and parental expectations.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Tse also suggested life education such as watching chicks hatch would prevent students from "doing anything stupid".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Speaking on a radio programme, Heather Yeung from the Hong Kong Student Alliance on Student Suicide, said blaming the students was not helpful.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Pointing the finger at students for their 'wrong values' is not good. The reasons for student suicide are complex and can't be explained by just one cause," she said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We should not attribute suicidal behaviour solely to students' personal values, because it overlooks the influence of other factors."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Paul Yip, head of the Centre for Suicide Research and Prevention at the University of Hong Kong, told the same programme that student suicides should be addressed carefully.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He said terms like "doing stupid things" - commonly used in Chinese to refer to taking one's life - should be avoided because they can be interpreted as blame or dismissal.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The World Health Organisation has said we should not stigmatise suicide. So I always encourage young people: 'It's okay not to be okay.' As long as you're willing to take a step forward and seek help, the help is available," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   RTHK has reached out to Professor Tse for a response.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   The Philippines raised a fresh weather alert on Monday, days after more than 100 people were killed by the country’s worst storm of the year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Nearly a million people are still sheltering at evacuation centres or with relatives after losing their homes or being driven out by floodwaters brought by Severe Tropical Storm Trami, which struck from October 22.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The country's weather agency says Tropical Storm Kong-rey will strengthen into a typhoon by Tuesday and pass close to the northern Philippines as early as Wednesday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The lowest of a five-stage storm alert is in place on the country's northeast coast.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Trami, by contrast, struck some of the country's most populous areas.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The government's disaster agency put the death toll from Trami at 116, with 39 missing.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   About 20 big storms and typhoons hit the Philippines or its surrounding waters each year, damaging homes and infrastructure and killing dozens of people. (AFP)

   The Hong Kong Tourism Board on Monday hailed the success of the Wine and Dine Festival, saying the event recorded 10 percent more visitors compared with the previous year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The board said the five-day festival welcomed about 155,000 locals and tourists, including those from the mainland, the United States, Australia, Japan and Southeast Asia.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Hong Kong also welcomed three international cruise liners as the festival was held, with passengers checking out the more than 300 booths featuring fine cuisine and drinks from around the world.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The board, meanwhile, said the celebration is not over as it holds its Taste Around Town campaign with 400 restaurants and bars offering extensive deals until the end of November.

   Washington rookie Jayden Daniels completed a stunning 52-yard touchdown pass on Sunday's final play to give the Commanders a shocking 18-15 victory over Chicago while the NFL champion Kansas City Chiefs stayed unbeaten.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Daniels, questionable until game time with a rib injury, scrambled to evade defenders then hurled the ball half the field to the goal line.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Bears defender Tyrique Stevenson tipped it from among a pack of players and into the end zone, where Noah Brown caught it for an astonishing "Hail Mary" game-winning touchdown.

   "I just threw the ball up," he added. "I didn't see anything. I just heard people screaming and our sidelined rushing the field – that's how I knew."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Daniels, who completed 21-of-38 passes for 326 yards, called it a miraculous play.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   At Las Vegas, Patrick Mahomes threw for 262 yards and two touchdowns to spark the unbeaten Chiefs over the host Raiders 27-20.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Chiefs became the seventh reigning Super Bowl champion to start the next campaign 7-0, the first since New England in 2019. Only Denver in 1998 managed to win another title after those starts.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We played a pretty good game," Mahomes said. "We're building and going in the right direction."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But the NFL's play of the season was by Daniels, who was feeling rib pain near the end of the game.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It's tough when you've got to throw the ball, have to rotate with it," Daniels said. "I started the game. I wanted to finish it – nothing was going to take me out of the game."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Commanders grabbed a 12-0 lead but Chicago seized the lead on a touchdown with 23 seconds remaining, only to fall on an incredible play.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "That's a hard way to lose," Bears coach Matt Eberflus said. "I've got to look at it, detail it out, and make sure we're better next time."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Commanders stayed atop the NFC East at 6-2. Chicago fell to 4-3.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Brown was overjoyed after catching the NFL's first go-ahead "Hail Mary" touchdown pass in the last 10 seconds of a game since 2020.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We've got a team full of fighters," Brown said. "We don't give up until the final whistle. "Just try and get down there as fast as you can, get good position, hope Jayden can get the ball down there." (AFP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Carlos Sainz cruised to an emotional victory for Ferrari ahead of McLaren's Lando Norris in Sunday's incident-filled Mexico City Grand Prix as Red Bull's series leader Max Verstappen was handed two 10-second penalties on his way to sixth.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The stewards took a dim view of Verstappen's aggressive driving, the Red Bull driver twice forcing his title rival Norris off the track.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Norris grabbed second from Charles Leclerc in the other Ferrari near the finish as the Briton enjoyed a major boost in his quest to deny Verstappen a fourth consecutive world championship.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The McLaren driver cut 10 points off the gap to Verstappen which now stands at 47 with four race weekends remaining.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I knew what to expect from Max," Verstappen said, speaking on the heavy price for his show of ruthlessness. "I respect him a lot as a driver and I expected it but it was not very clean driving in my opinion."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It was the second week in succession that the two title-chasers had clashed following a penalty for Norris at the United States Grand Prix. (AFP)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Manchester United's under-fire manager Erik ten Hag said he could only fault his side's finishing after a damaging 2-1 defeat for the Dutchman at struggling West Ham on Sunday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   United slipped to 14th in the Premier League table after Jarrod Bowen's controversial stoppage time penalty winner handed the Hammers all three points.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Crysencio Summerville put West Ham in front against the run of play 16 minutes from time before Casemiro equalised.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Ten Hag was furious at the award of the spot-kick after VAR intervened when Matthijs de Ligt clashed with Danny Ings inside the box.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   United captain Bruno Fernandes had a red card rescinded after being sent-off in a 3-0 defeat by Tottenham last month and Ten Hag highlighted the inconsistency of when VAR decides to challenge the referee's on-field decision.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Before the season they explained the process of VAR – only when it is clear and obvious they should interfere," said Ten Hag.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "What they didn't do against Spurs, that was a wrong decision," he added. "Now they make a wrong decision interfering and both have big impact on the games. I don't criticise the personnel, I criticise the process."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   However, it was a familiar lack of wastefulness in front of goal that cost United a much-needed victory.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Diogo Dalot missed an open goal, while Alejandro Garnacho and Fernandes were also guilty of missing huge chances in a dominant first-half display.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We created so many chances, played so good football, especially in the first half. How I want my team to play in and out of possession," added Ten Hag.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   United's return of eight goals from their first nine games is their worst in the Premier League era.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Ten Hag's men have won just three of those matches and drawn all three of their opening games in the Europa League to leave their manager clinging on to his job.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But he claimed to have seen positive signs in a 2-1 win over Brentford last weekend and a 1-1 draw at Fenerbahce prior to their visit to the London Stadium.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "At this moment the luck is definitely not on our side. Last season was not different and near the end we turned it around," said Ten Hag.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We are so determined it will be the same this season," he added. "We have to turn this around and it will turn around if we keep playing like we are now." (AFP)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Mohamed Salah's equaliser salvaged Liverpool a 2-2 draw at Premier League title rivals Arsenal on Sunday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Liverpool began the weekend on top after winning 11 of their opening 12 games in all competitions under Arne Slot.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But a draw sees the Reds fall one point behind Manchester City at the top of the table, with Arsenal now five points adrift of the leaders in third.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We're in the business where you can be on top one week and then not," said Liverpool captain Virgil van Dijk. "We are in October and let's see what it brings us at the end of the season. Enjoy the ride."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Bukayo Saka recovered from a hamstring injury to start for Arsenal and gave the home side the perfect start with a stunning touch and finish from Ben White's pass on nine minutes.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Van Dijk quickly levelled from a corner, but Arsenal led again before half-time through Mikel Merino's header.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Liverpool improved after the break and got their reward when Darwin Nunez teed up Salah for his eighth goal of the season."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Credit to Liverpool – we feel like we didn't play the full 90 minutes," said Saka.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "First half we showed our qualities, gave them nothing and they scored from a set piece," he added. "I can't think of another chance they had. Second half we weren't at our best." (AFP)

  <img alt="With almost all seats accounted for, Japanese media say Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's ruling coalition secured 214 seats, down from the 279 it previously held. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1776480_1_20241028064531.jpg&q=90" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Japan's ruling coalition has lost its majority after snap elections, Japanese media projected early on Monday, in what would be a major blow to new Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Ishiba, 67, called Sunday's election only days after taking office on October 1, aiming to bolster his position and that of his scandal-hit Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), which has governed Japan almost continuously for seven decades.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But national broadcaster NHK and other media outlets reported in the hours after polls closed that the LDP – in the party's worst result since 2009 – together with its long-term junior coalition partner Komeito had fallen short of the 233 seats needed for a majority in Japan's lower house.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Voters in the world's fourth-largest economy have been rankled by rising prices and the fallout from a party slush fund scandal that helped sink previous premier Fumio Kishida.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The LDP remains the top party in Japan's parliament, and a change of government is not expected. But the results create political uncertainty.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Falling short of a majority makes it difficult for Ishiba to get his party’s policies through parliament, and he may need to find a third coalition partner.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The LDP’s coalition retains a majority in the less powerful upper house. Public broadcaster NHK reported that the ruling coalition with junior partner Komeito secured 215 seats, down sharply from the majority of 279 it previously held.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We are receiving severe judgement," Ishiba told NHK earlier on Sunday while it was still unclear whether the coalition would secure enough seats.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Voters "expressed their strong desire for the LDP to do some reflection and become a party that will act in line with the people's will," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Footage from the LDP headquarters showed gloomy faces as projections based on exit polls indicated Ishiba's justice and agriculture ministers were likely to lose their seats.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan, led by centrist leader Yoshihiko Noda, made huge gains to 148 seats, from its previous 98.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “We accomplished our goal of preventing the ruling coalition from a majority, which was a major achievement,” Noda said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Noda called the election a rare chance for a change of government, and said he seeks to lead a coalition with other opposition groups to do so. But his party has had trouble finding partners, and some voters were skeptical about the opposition’s ability and inexperience.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   For Ishiba, potential additional partners include the Democratic Party of the People, which calls for lower taxes, and the conservative Japan Innovation Party.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   DPP head Yuichiro Tamaki said he was open to “a partial alliance.” Innovation Party chief Nobuyuki Baba has denied any intention to cooperate. As of early Monday, DPP had 28 seats and the Innovation Party 38.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Experts say a CDPJ-led government is not in the picture because of its lack of viable policies.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “If they take power and try to change the economic and diplomatic policies of the current government, they will only end up collapsing right away,” said Izuru Makihara, a University of Tokyo professor of politics and public policy.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “Realistically, Ishiba's ruling coalition would seek a partnership with either the Innovation Party or the Democratic Party of the People”, he said. (Agencies)

  <img alt='Georgian president Salome Zurabishvili has accused Moscow of orchestrating a special operation that resulted in the "total falsification of the election".

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The Georgian opposition on Sunday called for protests and the European Union demanded an investigation into "irregularities" after a disputed legislative vote that showed a win for the ruling party.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Pro-Western President Salome Zurabishvili accused Moscow of being behind the alleged election fraud, calling it a "Russian special operation".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Amid angry opposition claims over the result, Zurabishvili called for a rally on Monday. Jailed former president Mikheil Saakashvili also called for mass protests.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The European Union had warned that Saturday's vote could determine Tbilisi's chances of joining the bloc.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   EU council president Charles Michel wrote on X that Georgian authorities should "swiftly, transparently and independently investigate and adjudicate electoral irregularities and allegations thereof.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "These alleged irregularities must be seriously clarified and addressed," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   After meeting with opposition leaders in Tbilisi, Zurabishvili said there had been a "total falsification of the election".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We are witnesses and victims of a Russian special operation, a modern form of hybrid war against the Georgian people," she said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   International observers said Saturday's election was "marred by an uneven playing field, pressure and tension". An EU parliament mission also expressed concern about "democratic backsliding", saying it had seen instances of "ballot box stuffing" and the "physical assault" of observers.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Saakashvili said on Facebook that opposition lawmakers should renounce their parliamentary seats.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Now is the time for mass protests. We must show the world that we are fighting for freedom and that we are a people who will not tolerate injustice," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Official tallies from more than 99 percent of precincts showed the ruling Georgian Dream party winning 54 percent of the vote, with the main pro-Western opposition coalition on 37.5 percent.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The result gives Georgian Dream 91 seats in the 150-member parliament – enough to govern but short of the supermajority it had sought to pass a constitutional ban on all main opposition parties.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Our victory is impressive," Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze said in a statement, accusing the opposition of "undermining the country's constitutional order" by questioning his party's victory. (AFP)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Israel's airstrikes "hit hard" Iran's defences and missile production, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Sunday, as Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said the country was considering its response.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   With warfare raging in Gaza and Lebanon, direct confrontation between Israel and Iran risks spiralling into a regional conflagration. But a day after the airstrikes, there was no sign they would spark another round of escalation.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   However, heavy fighting in Lebanon between Israeli forces and Iran-backed Hezbollah, which sharply intensified over recent weeks, continued on Sunday with an Israeli airstrike killing eight people in a residential block in Sidon, medics said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The air force attacked throughout Iran. We hit hard Iran's defence capabilities and its ability to produce missiles that are aimed at us," Netanyahu said in a speech, calling the attack "precise and powerful" and saying it met all its objectives.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Israel’s army chief, Lieutenant General Herzi Halevi, said the strike on Iran had showed what the Israeli response to its enemies would be.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “We struck strategic systems in Iran, which carries great importance, and we will now see how things develop. We are prepared for all scenarios in every arena.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Islamic Republic has not signalled how it will respond to Saturday's long-anticipated strikes, which involved scores of fighter jets bombing targets near the capital Tehran and in the western provinces of Ilam and Khuzestan.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The heavily armed arch-enemies have engaged in a cycle of retaliatory moves against each other for months, with Saturday's strike coming after an Iranian missile barrage on Oct 1, much of which Israel said was downed by its air defences.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Khamenei said Israel's calculations "should be disrupted".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The attack on Iran, which killed four soldiers and caused some damage, "should neither be downplayed nor exaggerated", he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   ranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said Iran was not looking for war but would give an "appropriate response".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   US President Joe Biden called for a halt to escalation, which has raised fears of a wider Middle East war arising from the year-old Israeli-Hamas conflict in Gaza and Israel's thrust into south Lebanon to stop Hezbollah rocketing northern Israel.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Separately, Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said Iran was no longer able to use its allies Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon against Israel.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The two groups "are no longer an effective tool" of Tehran, he said in a speech.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Gallant added that Hamas was no longer functioning as a military network in Gaza and that Hezbollah's senior command and most of its missile capabilities had been eliminated.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Hamas has repeatedly said it is still able to function militarily, and Israel has recently conducted major new operations in devastated north Gaza against what it calls regrouping Hamas militants.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Hezbollah has said its command structure remains intact and that it retains significant missile capabilities. (Reuters)

File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1776469_1_20241028013441.jpg&q=90" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Former Bolivian president Evo Morales said gunmen fired a hail of bullets at his car Sunday as he travelled to a radio interview in the central city of Cochabamba, wounding his driver.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The car in which I arrived has 14 bullet holes," said Morales, adding: "This was planned. The idea was to kill Evo."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The radio station that hosted the interview, Kawsachun Coca, released a video that it said was of the bullet-ridden pickup truck that Morales had been in.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The windshield had three bullet holes and the driver had blood on his head.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Morales blamed the current president, Luis Arce, a former ally and cabinet minister of his with whom he has fallen out, for the attack.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Lucho has destroyed Bolivia and now he wants to eliminate our process by killing Evo," Morales, using the president's nickname, said of his own attempt to regain the presidency.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Morales, a former coca grower who is now 65, served as president from 2006 until 2019. He was highly popular in the Andean country until he tried to bypass the constitution to seek a fourth term.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He was forced to resign after losing the support of the military following an election marked by allegations of fraud, and fled to Mexico.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Morales returned to Bolivia in 2020 seeking political resurrection.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He and Arce are both vying for the nomination of the ruling MAS party in August 2025 presidential elections, although Morales is legally barred from running again.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Morales is being investigated for rape, human trafficking and human smuggling over his alleged sexual relationship with a 15-year-old member of his political youth guard in 2015.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Supporters of Morales have protested by blocking major roads throughout the country for two weeks.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   On Saturday, the government had criticised Morales for "destabilising" the country with two weeks of road blockades that have jammed up supplies of food and fuel around the country. It accused him of trying to "interrupt democratic order".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The government in a statement also said some groups allied to Morales were armed and warned about violence, citing 14 police officers wounded trying to break up the blockades. (Agencies)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Francesco Bagnaia won the Thai MotoGP in wet conditions on Sunday to close the gap on championship leader Jorge Martin, who was second, with two race weekends left.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Spaniard Martin's lead over defending champion Bagnaia, of Italy, was cut from 22 points to 17, ahead of another chapter in their title tussle at Sepang in Malaysia next week.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Pedro Acosta was third at a rainy Buriram, but this was all about Martin and Bagnaia, with the championship now a two-horse race and likely to go right down to the wire.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   After Malaysia, the season finale is at Valencia on November 15-17.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Pramac Ducati's Martin, who is trying to win the world crown for the first time, said he was happy to settle for second, coming home nearly three seconds behind.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The level we are demonstrating -- not a lot of people can understand how fast we are going even in these conditions," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Bagnaia thanked his Ducati team for keeping his hopes of a third world title in a row alive.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We did an incredible job. So, so happy," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Martin began the race on the front row in third and made a lightning start to grab the lead from his pole-sitting rival.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But the 26-year-old did not stay there long, running wide to fall to third as Bagnaia took the lead with six-time MotoGP world champion Marc Marquez in hot pursuit.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   At the halfway point of the 26-lap race it had developed to a duel between Bagnaia and Marquez, with Martin struggling to keep up.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But Marquez pushed too hard in trying to take the lead and slid off on his Ducati.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   That left the title rivals to battle it out for victory, but Bagnaia held his nerve and handled the demanding conditions to see out a crucial ninth win of the campaign.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Bagnaia also started Saturday's sprint race on pole but ended up third, just behind Martin. Bagnaia's Ducati team-mate Enea Bastianini won the sprint.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Earlier, Japan's Ai Ogura was crowned Moto2 world champion as he came second in a red-flagged race won by Spain's Aron Canet.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The 23-year-old Ogura will move up to MotoGP next season. (AFP)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Serbian Olga Danilovic powered past American qualifier Caroline Dolehide 6-3 6-1 in the Guangzhou Open final on Sunday to seal her first trophy of the season and second of her career.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   World number 86 Danilovic, whose previous triumph came on clay in Moscow six years ago, grabbed a break in the fifth game of the first set in her maiden hardcourt final and overcame a late fightback from Dolehide to pull away.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I'm so happy with the way I played during the tournament," said Danilovic.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I'm so proud of myself and my team. I really showed what I can do. I'm very excited to be finishing the season this way."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   After wrapping up the opener with a second break, the 23-year-old appeared distracted by movement in the stands and surrendered her serve early in the second set, but responded strongly to build a 4-1 lead.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Danilovic peppered her fatigued opponent with powerful shots for a double break and closed out the match on serve, finishing with a blistering forehand winner before a huge serve on her third match point. (Reuters)

Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1776455_1_20241027193939.jpg&q=60" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Japan's ruling coalition may fall short of a parliamentary majority, exit polls for Sunday's general election showed, raising uncertainty over the make-up of the government of the world's fourth-largest economy.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A poll by national broadcaster NHK showed the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), which has ruled Japan for almost all of its post-war history, and junior coalition partner were set to win between 174 and 254 of the 465 seats in the lower house of Japan's parliament.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The main opposition Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan is predicted to win 128 to 191 seats. The outcome may force the LDP or CDPJ into power-sharing agreements with other parties to form a government.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A poll by Nippon TV showed the ruling coalition would win 198 seats to the CDPJ's 157, both well short of the 233 seats needed to reach a majority, as voters punished Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's party over a funding scandal and inflation.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It was a tough fight for the LDP," Shinjiro Koizumi, the LDP's election chief, told NHK.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Ishiba called the snap poll immediately after being elected to head the party last month, hoping to win a public mandate for his premiership. His predecessor Fumio Kishida quit after his support cratered due to anger over a cost of living crunch and a scandal involving unrecorded donations to lawmakers.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The uncertainty comes nine days before U.S. voters choose a new president and as Japan faces economic headwinds and increasingly tense relations with neighbouring China.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The LDP has held an outright majority since it returned to power in 2012 after a brief spell of CDPJ rule.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Political wrangling could roil markets and be a headache for the Bank of Japan, if Ishiba chooses a partner that favours maintaining near-zero interest rates when the central bank wants to gradually raise them.
   <br/>

   Japanese shares fell 2.7% last week on the benchmark Nikkei index. (Reuters)

    Twenty more trial events set for Kai Tak Sports Park

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Officials said about 20 more test events will be held before the Kai Tak Sports Park officially opens next year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A local football league match which concluded at the Kai Tak Youth Sports Ground on Sunday was the first of a series of test events.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Over 1,500 spectators turned up in the end, 50 percent more than the original estimate.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The game, featuring Second Division sides Sai Kung and Wong Tai Sin, ended in a 2-2 draw.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Chief Secretary Eric Chan said the overall arrangements were smooth, with most people making use of the MTR to arrive and leave the venue.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The first batch of spectators were able to exit the stadium within six to seven minutes, reaching Sung Wong Toi station another few minutes later, he added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The ultimate goal, officials said, is to host a test event with a full crowd of 50,000 people at the main stadium. The first such event at the core hub is scheduled for January next year, with about 10,000 spectators.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We start from a small scale, but gradually, we will arrange around 20 trial events, and then by that time, we will increase the number of people to up to 50,000," Chan explained.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We are confident that with all these arrangements, all these preparations... we [would have] sufficiently tried everything before it officially opens."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sports and culture minister Kevin Yeung said more transportation methods would be provided in the future.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We hope people can mainly make use of the MTR, the mass transit system, when they leave the venue. But for test events which include more people, we will also arrange bus services, or special bus routes," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Yeung added that questionnaires were distributed to attendees on Sunday, and their comments will be analysed to identity areas of improvement.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Police said on Sunday that a system which can analyse real-time foot traffic will be put to use for the first time at Lan Kwai Fong on Halloween, when revellers are expected to swarm the area to celebrate the festival.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Around 25,000 people are estimated to turn up in the nightlife district on Thursday, similar to last year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Traffic arrangements will be implemented in phases from 2pm. Most roads in the vicinity will be closed to vehicles at night, and party-goers can only enter the area through D'Aguilar Street and exit from Wyndham Street.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Acting Superintendent Fung Chung-pang said CCTV signals will be streamed directly to police's command centre.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The CCTVs will provide real-time footage from various angles, allowing officers to understand the situation live.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The force will also make use of a people-counting system to work out the crowd density at the scene through visual analysis. This will allow us to identify underlying safety risks, and to implement crowd management measures should they be needed," Fung said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Officers said a total of 50 sets of CCTVs have been installed in the area, as well as a public broadcast system to alert citizens in case of emergencies.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Taxi ambassadors will also roam the area to assist revellers to hail a cab home.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Police also warned anyone planning to dress up for the night not to carry any imitation firearm or offensive weapons to avoid falling foul of the law.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   They added that artificial intelligence technology may be used in the future to identify accidents or events at which police assistance is needed.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   A truck driver rammed his vehicle into a crowd of people at a bus stop in central Israel on Sunday, injuring at least 24 people before he was "shot and neutralised", police said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Preliminary police findings showed the driver also hit a bus that had stopped at the same location to drop off passengers, the police said in a statement.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   At least 24 people were injured in the incident, police said, without clarifying whether it was an attack.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The force however said civilians at the site of the incident "shot the truck driver and neutralised him".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Earlier on Sunday the Magen David Adom emergency service said the incident occurred at Aharon Yariv Boulevard in Ramat HaSharon, north of the commercial hub Tel Aviv.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Of those injured, at least 16 people had been transported to nearby hospitals, MDA said in a statement.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Officers and ambulances rushed to the scene, where Israeli television channels showed police cordoning off the area as medics helped the injured and a helicopter hovered above.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The incident comes as Israel holds ceremonies to mark the Hebrew calendar anniversary of the Hamas attack on October 7 last year that sparked the ongoing wars in Gaza and Lebanon. (AFP)

    Smooth sailing as football match goes ahead in Kai Tak

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   A local football league match on Sunday kicked off a series of test events at the Kai Tak Sports Park before it officially opens in the first quarter of next year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Authorities expected 1,000 spectators streamed into the Kai Tak Youth Sports Ground for a Second Division League fixture between Sai Kung and Wong Tai Sin. Around 1,500 turned up in the end.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   One of them was Stephen, an engineer who has worked on the Kai Tak project since five years ago.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Pretty much a bit of professional pride, and proud of what we've built for Hong Kong," he told RTHK.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "[It's] almost there. We're quite excited because it's been five years, and like any other construction projects, it's had its ups and downs. And now we can see it’s almost open."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Another spectator Ivy, who walked from Kowloon City to the stadium, said security was quite strict at the door.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But she was happy to attend the match and support her friend, who’s playing on one of the teams.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "[It's] really exciting. It's huge… My friend is playing football here," she said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Spectators were encouraged to get to the sports ground from Sung Wong Toi - instead of Kai Tak - MTR station.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The MTR Corporation said it had implemented special arrangements at both stations. Plenty of signs were put up pointing passengers to the stadium.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sports minister Kevin Yeung and sports commissioner George Tsoi were both spotted at the stadium.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Also in attendance was security chief Chris Tang, who was happy with what he saw so far before the match.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Everything is smooth. When people depart [from] the MTR, there’s sufficient announcements, as well as notice direction showing how they come here," he told RTHK.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We have adopted a phased approach, so at different stages, we have different [arrangements]. On this occasion, apart from making sure that it’s safe, it's also training to our frontline officers, so that's the reason why we are bringing extra officers to come here to make themselves familiar with the environment."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Another event has been scheduled at the Youth Sports Ground in mid-November, as Hong Kong Men's Rugby Team host Brazil for a two-match international series.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The second match will be played in Kai Tak, with an estimated attendance of 3,000 people.

    Subdivided unit residents fear losing their homes

  <img alt="The Sham Shui Po Housing Concern Mothers’ Group says rent of future subdivided flats may go up under a government initiative to wipe out inadequate housing. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1776430_1_20241027160717.jpg&q=65" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   A concern group on Sunday said residents of subdivided flats may be left homeless as the government proposed plans to put an end to inadequate housing.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The chief executive announced plans in the Policy Address to eradicate substandard subdivided units.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A future legislation will mandate the registration of such dwellings as "basic housing units". Each must be no less than eight square metres, or 86 square feet, in size, and fitted with an individual toilet and at least one window.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Units which fail to meet the set of standards will be outlawed. That could be a headache for tenants, who have to relocate elsewhere.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Sham Shui Po Housing Concern Mothers' Group surveyed about 70 residents of subdivided flats following the announcement of the proposal.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   About eight in 10 respondents said they wished to be directly allocated a public flat, instead of moving to temporary solutions such as light public housing, or transitional homes.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   One of them was Amber, who was worried her landlord would evict them in the future because the unit had to be renovated in order to comply with the rules.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The mother of two added possible rehousing plans by the authorities may not be suitable.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Even if they offer us a light public housing flat or transitional housing, I won't consider. The location is far. I'm not familiar with the new environment, and I don't want my children to transfer to another school," she explained.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Another group member, Lily, feared paying higher rent since there's a minimum size for future units.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We hope they can build more public housing flats quickly. Some of us have waited for eight to 10 years," she appealed to the government.

  <img alt="Two special polling stations were set up in Sheung Shui to facilitate Hongkongers returning from the mainland to vote in the 2023 District Council election. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1776411_1_20241027114458.jpg&q=65" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Constitutional and mainland affairs chief Erick Tsang has revealed the government is looking into setting up more polling stations near the border for Hongkongers on the mainland to vote in next year's Legislative Council elections.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The measure was first implemented in 2021, when the city's borders were shut due to Covid. In the end 17,569 voters cast their ballots at Heung Yuen Wai, Lo Wu and Lok Ma Chau checkpoints without having to enter Hong Kong.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   For last December's District Council election, officials allowed eligible voters on the mainland to vote at one of the designated polling stations near the border in Sheung Shui, sparing them a trip to their home district. Almost 10,000 people made use of the arrangement.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "If necessary, we will continue to set up these polling stations, or even enhance and expand [the arrangement], which we are also considering," he told a televised interview on Sunday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "There might be more choices by then, depending on where the site would be, or whether the location would be suitable as a polling station."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Tsang also confirmed the electronic poll register system would remain in use for the upcoming polls.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The system broke down during last year's DC election, causing major delays at certain stations and prompting Electoral Affairs Commission chairman David Lok to issue a teary apology.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Tsang also said there's no need to further amend the current electoral system, saying it's in line with Hong Kong's long-term development.

    FS reiterates need to issue bonds for development

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Sunday said the government will rely more on long-term capital for infrastructure development in the SAR, including the Northern Metropolis.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Speaking on a radio programme, Chan revealed that the government's recurrent expenditure has gone up by HK$4 billion per year to facilitate new Policy Address measures.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Authorities will continue to issue up to HK$130 billion worth of bonds a year to fund various projects. He pointed out that outstanding government bonds make up only 6 percent of Hong Kong's gross domestic product, a level which is very low compared to other parts of the world.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Hong Kong faces economic restructuring, and geopolitical uncertainties.... we need to take preventive measures, and at the same time we need to enhance development to make ourselves secure," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Chan also estimated the government would return to fiscal balance in about three years. One way of achieving that, he said, was to slash expenditure by one percent each year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   On a separate note, the former development minister said authorities must continue to create land, even as the property market remains volatile.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Recalling the early 2000s when authorities froze their land sale programmes and stopped creating land in response to a market downturn, Chan said the impact of those decisions became evident now.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We can better make use of the land in remote places, so prices for properties near the city centre won't be too high, when compared with remote places," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The financial chief's hectic schedule continues with a visit to Saudi Arabia on Monday, just days after returning from the United States.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Writing on his weekly blog, Chan confirmed he will lead a delegation from the financial and innovation and technology sectors to Riyadh, with an aim to promote Hong Kong and explore business opportunities.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   They will attend the Future Investment Initiative conference, and witness the launch of two exchange-traded funds tracking SAR stock indices on the Saudi Exchange.

  <img alt="Brazil's President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva attends a signing ceremony for an agreement between Vale and BHP and Brazilian authorities. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1776399_1_20241027084829.jpg&q=80" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Mining giants BHP and Vale have signed a deal with Brazil's government to pay nearly US$30 billion in damages for a 2015 dam collapse that triggered the country's worst environmental disaster.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva attended the signing of the deal over the November 5, 2015 collapse of a tailings dam at a mine in the southeastern town of Mariana, which triggered a giant mudslide.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The river of mud swamped villages, rivers and rainforest, killing 19 people on its way to the sea.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I hope the mining companies have learned their lesson: it would have cost them less to prevent (the disaster), much less," Lula said at the ceremony attended by representatives of Brazil's Vale and Australia's BHP, co-owners of the Brazilian company Samarco that operated the iron mine.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The agreement, which Lula declared to be the biggest environmental payout in modern history, comes on the fifth day of a separate mega-trial in London over BHP's role in the dam's failure.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   More than 620,000 complainants, including 46 Brazilian municipalities and several Indigenous communities, are seeking an estimated 36 billion pounds (US$47 million) in damages in the civil trial.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   BHP denies responsibility.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The company said on Friday that the agreement reached in Brasilia did not end the lawsuits pending against the companies, nor prevent others being taken.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The dam's failure released a torrent of over 40 million cubic meters of highly toxic sludge, the equivalent of 12,000 Olympic swimming pools, which coursed through the Doce River all the way to the Atlantic Ocean, over 600 kilometres away.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Over 600 people were left homeless.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Scientists say the mouth of the Doce River and parts of the southeast Atlantic coastline are still contaminated with metals from the spill, affecting the area's population of fish, birds, turtles, porpoises and whales.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   BHP and Vale had already agreed in 2016 to pay 20 billion reais (about US$3.5 billion at today's rate) in damages, but the negotiations were reopened in 2021 due to what the government called their "non-compliance" and the slow progress of Brazil's justice system in resolving the dispute.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Friday's agreement in Brazil, which is subject to approval by the country's Supreme Court, covers the companies' past and future obligations to assist people, communities and ecosystems affected by the disaster. (AFP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Finance ministers of the G7 nations vowed on Saturday to step up efforts to prevent Russia from evading sanctions imposed over the war with Ukraine.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We remain committed to taking further initiatives in response to oil price cap violations," the group said in a statement following a meeting in Washington. Those further steps were not spelled out in detail.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In December 2022, the G7 together with the European Union and Australia agreed to pressure purchasers of Russian oil to not go above a certain price ceiling.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The agreement was intended to limit Russian petroleum sales and revenues without curbing exports so sharply that it would cause global oil prices to soar.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But some countries have continued to import Russian crude oil without observing the price ceiling.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The G7 finance ministers also said they would take additional measures aimed at "increasing the costs to Russia of using the shadow fleet to evade sanctions."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Officials say Russia has used its fleet of shadow tankers, many of them old, unmarked and poorly maintained, to skirt sanctions by transporting oil without properly declaring their cargo or itineraries.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The tankers sometimes load or transfer their cargo at sea to avoid unwanted attention.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The United States and the EU have sanctioned several of these ships and their owners, notably Russia's government-owned maritime company Sovcomflot.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The G7 ministers said they intended "to intensify our efforts to prevent financial institutions from supporting Russia's evasion of our sanctions."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   According to the US Office of Foreign Assets Control, Russian financial institutions have developed a network of foreign subsidiaries to facilitate the purchase or sale of sanctioned goods.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Joining the G7 ministers in the meeting on Saturday were the heads of the seven countries' central banks, plus top officials of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The G7, which groups seven of the world's most advanced economies, announced on Friday it had reached an agreement to provide a loan of around US$50 billion to Ukraine.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The loan will be repaid not by Ukraine but with the interest -- roughly US$3 billion a year -- generated by Russian assets seized and frozen after the war began in February 2022. (AFP)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Erling Haaland fired Manchester City to the top of the Premier League as the striker sealed a 1-0 win against Southampton, while third-placed Aston Villa were frustrated by Bournemouth's last-gasp leveller on Saturday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Haaland had gone three league games without a goal but he ended that mini drought in the first half at the Etihad Stadium.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   That was enough to lift Pep Guardiola's side into first place, two points ahead of second-placed Liverpool, who can regain pole position if they win Sunday's blockbuster clash with title rivals Arsenal.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   City have not lost a league game at the Etihad for two years, a run encompassing 35 games, and bottom-of-the-table Southampton, who have only one point from nine games this season, were never likely to shatter that impressive streak.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   With Jack Grealish and Jeremy Doku ruled out, Guardiola made four changes to the team that thrashed Sparta Prague in the Champions League on Wednesday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Haaland had scored an audacious goal against Sparta and while his effort to kill off Southampton was more prosaic, it was arguably far more valuable given the context of a tense title race.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Matheus Nunes' cross reached Haaland in the fifth minute and the Norwegian showed strength and desire to get to the ball ahead of his marker for a close-range strike.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   City spurned several chances to increase their lead but Haaland's 14th goal in all competitions this season gave the unbeaten champions seven wins from nine league matches as they chase a fifth successive title.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The way Southampton played, they are so demanding. Big credit to them, it was not because we were sloppy or flat. I don't have that feeling," Guardiola said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We created chances and unfortunately couldn't score the second. I think we were there and sometimes they are good. We have to accept that."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Aston Villa's hopes of pushing for the title suffered a setback as Bournemouth snatched a 1-1 draw at Villa Park.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Villa are unbeaten in the Champions League, sitting top of the table after seeing off Young Boys, Bayern Munich and Bologna.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But they couldn't follow their latest European success with a domestic victory despite taking the lead in the 76th minute.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Ian Maatsen crossed and Leon Bailey teed up Ross Barkley to hook in his first goal for the club.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But Evanilson rescued Bournemouth with a headed equaliser six minutes into stoppage-time.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Brentford beat fourth-bottom Ipswich 4-3 in a thrilling clash in west London.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Ipswich's Sam Szmodics produced a fine finish from 15 yards in the 28th minute before George Hirst clipped a composed strike past Mark Flekken three minutes later.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But Yoane Wissa netted in the 44th minute and Harry Clarke's own goal seconds later hauled Brentford level.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Bryan Mbeumo's 51st-minute penalty, awarded for Clarke's foul on Keane Lewis-Potter, put Brentford 3-2 up.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Capping a miserable day for Clarke, he was sent off in the closing stages after fouling Lewis-Potter to earn a second booking.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Liam Delap's 86th-minute equaliser appeared to have spared Clarke's blushes, but Mbeumo snatched victory with the last kick of stoppage-time.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Second-bottom Wolves staged a superb fightback to draw 2-2 at fifth-placed Brighton.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Danny Welbeck bagged his sixth goal of the season in first half stoppage-time and Evan Ferguson struck with a clinical finish from Tariq Lamptey's 85th-minute cross to leave Brighton in control.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But Rayan Ait-Nouri got one back three minutes later and Matheus Cunha saved winless Wolves from a sixth successive league defeat with a deflected equaliser deep into stoppage-time.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Everton forward Beto salvaged a 1-1 draw against Fulham as his stoppage-time header cancelled out Alex Iwobi's 61st-minute strike against his former club at Goodison Park.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Although Everton are unbeaten in their last six games, they sit just three places above the relegation zone. (AFP)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   New Zealand made history with their first Test series triumph in India as spinner Mitchell Santner's heroic performance delivered a 113-run win in the second match on Saturday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   New Zealand bowled out India for 245 in their chase of 359 on day three in Pune to take an unbeatable 2-0 lead in the three-match series.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It marks India's first Test series defeat at home since December 2012, when Alastair Cook's England beat them 2-1.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Santner, who's 7-53 in India's first innings of 156 set up the famous win, rattled the Indian chase with six wickets on a turning pitch and trumped the hosts at their own spin game.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The left-hander bowled unchanged from one end, returning figures of 6-104 in 29 overs.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Ajaz Patel took the final two wickets and ended Ravindra Jadeja's resistance on 42 when the batsmen holed out in the deep and New Zealand celebrated to pin drop silence from the stands.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Before Saturday, a visiting New Zealand team had never won a Test series in India dating back to their first trip in 1955.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   India bowled out New Zealand for 255 inside the first hour of play and opener Yashasvi Jaiswal in his 65-ball 77 came out attacking to raise hopes of a miracle.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   India lost skipper Rohit Sharma for eight but raced to 81-1 at lunch in 12 overs.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Santner took down Shubman Gill for 23 soon after the break to end a 62-run second-wicket stand with the left-handed Jaiswal, who powered on after reaching his fifty.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The in-form spinner finally had Jaiswal caught at slip, run out Rishabh Pant for a duck and trapped Virat Kohli lbw, dousing India's chances.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Glenn Phillips chipped in with the wicket of Washington Sundar for 21.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   India spinners Sundar and Jadeja shared seven wickets between them in the second New Zealand innings, with Jadeja claiming three of the five to fall on Saturday morning.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sundar, a lanky off-spinner, returned to the Indian Test team after more than three years and took 7-59.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   New Zealand made 259 in their first innings riding on knocks from Devon Conway (76) and Rachin Ravindra (65) before Santner took charge.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   New Zealand have now won four Tests in India after their opening triumph was the first on Indian soil since 1988.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The series victory comes after New Zealand's recent 2-0 loss in Sri Lanka on a sub-continent tour, which began with a washed-out Test against Afghanistan near New Delhi.
   <br/>

    Death toll from Trami approaches 100 in Philippines

  <img alt="Vast swathes of the Bicol region in the northern Philippines remain under water and many people are still missing or stranded. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1776364_1_20241026201337.jpg&q=90" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Rescuers in the Philippines raced on Saturday to reach people still stranded in areas made inaccessible by flooding from Tropical Storm Trami, which has killed at least 97 people.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Trami battered the main island of Luzon and forced nearly half a million people to flee their homes as heavy rain caused widespread floods and landslides.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In the hardest-hit Bicol region, residents trapped on the roofs and upper floors of their homes were still awaiting desperately needed assistance, officials said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The floods have yet to subside. Calls asking for help are still pouring in," said Bicol regional police director Andre Dizon.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We need to rescue them as soon as possible because starvation can be a problem. We're hearing reports that children are already getting sick."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In the region's Camarines Sur province, food and drinking water were in increasingly short supply as some areas remained completely submerged and difficult to access, he added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   President Ferdinand Marcos visited the province on Saturday to inspect the damage.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Our main problem here is that many areas are still flooded," he told government officials during a briefing.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We have flood control systems but the amount of water is unmanageable. This is climate change. This is all new, so we have to come up with new solutions too," Marcos added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Trami's death toll rose on Saturday as rescuers retrieved more bodies from floodwaters and landslide sites, mostly from the Bicol region and Batangas province, south of Manila.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Police have recorded 36 deaths in Bicol, most due to drowning.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The number of confirmed dead in Batangas has risen to 54, provincial police chief Jacinto Malinao said, with at least 21 people missing.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Two were reported dead in separate incidents of electrocution and drowning in Cavite province, police said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Five more deaths have been confirmed in other provinces, bringing the total to 97, according to a tally based on official police and disaster agency sources.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In Batangas, two hours south of the capital, rescuers were using backhoes and shovels to dig through mud as high as three metres in a desperate search for the missing in areas hit by landslides.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Cadaver-sniffing dogs have also been deployed to assist the operations.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Reporters who visited the province on Friday saw roads blocked by felled trees, vehicles half-submerged in mud and homes severely damaged by flash flooding.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We are still hoping for the best," said Malinao, the police chief.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We will not stop until all bodies are retrieved."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The national disaster agency said on Saturday that about 495,000 people have been displaced by the flooding, which has submerged hundreds of villages in swathes of the northern Philippines. (AFP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   A suicide bomber detonated at a checkpoint in western Pakistan on Saturday, killing eight people and wounding five more, officials said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The bomber set off the blast from the back of a motorbike rickshaw near the town of Mir Ali in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, a local police officer said on condition of anonymity.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Four police officers were killed alongside two members of a state paramilitary force and two civilians in the attack near the border with Afghanistan, he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Pakistan has seen an increase in militancy since the Afghan Taliban returned to power in 2021, with Islamabad claiming hostile groups are now using the neighbouring country for shelter.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Among the five injured personnel, the condition of three is critical, and they have been transferred to a local military hospital," the police officer said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A local government official who also did not want to be named confirmed the same toll of dead and wounded.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The attack was claimed by a little-known militant group calling itself "Aswad ul-Harb."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Another checkpost near the Afghan border was raided this week by the Pakistani Taliban, killing 10 police officers.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Last year, the country saw more suicide attacks than any year since 2014, according to the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   There were 29 suicide attacks registered, killing 329 people in Pakistan's deadliest year in a decade. (AFP)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   At least 50 people have been killed in a single attack by Sudanese paramilitaries who have besieged and raided villages in al-Jazira state, activists said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) have been at war with Sudan's regular army since April 2023 but have in recent days intensified their violence against civilians in al-Jazira, south of the capital Khartoum, after their commander in the state defected to the army.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The villages of al-Sariha and Azraq have been under attack" since Friday morning, the resistance committee in Hasaheisa, one of the hundreds of volunteer groups coordinating aid in Sudan, said in a statement late on Friday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In al-Sariha alone, the attack killed 50 and wounded more than 200, the resistance committee added, reporting a total "inability to evacuate the wounded from the village due to the shelling and snipers" from the RSF.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   With a near-total communications blackout, tolls are impossible to verify and often hard to gather.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The resistance committee said that the nearby village of Azraq had been placed under a "total siege, suffering the same violations as al-Sariha," although it was not possible to provide a death toll.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   On Friday, the Sudanese doctors' union called on the United Nations to press for safe humanitarian corridors into villages that "are facing genocide at the hands of the Rapid Support militia."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The doctors' union added that rescue operations had become impossible and that "the army is incapable of protecting civilians."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   According to medical sources in several villages, nearly all health facilities capable of receiving emergency cases have been forced shut.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The war in Sudan has killed tens of thousands of people, with some estimates of 150,000 dead.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It has also caused what the UN calls the world's largest displacement crisis, with more than seven million uprooted.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In June, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the United States ambassador to the UN, said Sudan is the planet's "largest humanitarian crisis."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Famine was declared in July in the Zamzam camp for displaced people near the town of El-Fasher, in Sudan's western Darfur region bordering Chad.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Last Sunday the army announced that the RSF's al-Jazira commander Abu Aqla Kaykal had abandoned the paramilitaries, bringing "a large number of his forces" with him, in what it said was the first high-profile defection to its side.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Activists reported at least 20 people killed in subsequent paramilitary attacks in eastern al-Jazira. They also said an air strike by the Sudanese Armed forces on a mosque in the state capital, Wad Madani, killed 31 people.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   On Thursday, neighbouring Chad denied helping to arm the paramilitaries after the governor of Sudan's Darfur region, Minni Minnawi, accused them of doing so.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Chad has no interest in amplifying the war in Sudan," said Chadian Foreign Minister Abderaman Koulamallah, pointing out that Chad was "one of the rare countries upon which this war has had major repercussions."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sudanese authorities have previously charged that Chad was facilitating the delivery of weapons from the United Arab Emirates to Sudan, which both Chad and the UAE have denied.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The International Monetary Fund's director for Africa, Catherine Pattillo, said this week that the war in Sudan was likely to cause heavy economic damage to its already struggling neighbours.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "And then to be confronted with the refugees, the security issues, the trade issues, is very challenging for their growth," she said. (AFP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   The Observatory has cancelled all typhoon signals at 12:20 am on Sunday as Trami continued to move westwards away from Hong Kong.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It had issued the Strong Wind Signal Number 3 at 10:40 am, after Trami intensified into a typhoon, skirting to the south of Hong Kong at a distance of about 500 kilometres.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Observatory said winds will be strong offshore and on high ground overnight and in the morning.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Members of the public are advised to stay away from the shoreline and remain on alert.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It is expected that Trami will linger and weaken over the coast of central Vietnam today and tomorrow. It may then turn eastward, moving across the central part of the South China Sea again.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Observatory will closely monitor its movement.

    Commonwealth says 'time has come' for talks on slavery

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The 56-member Commonwealth agreed the "time has come" for discussions about the legacy of the "abhorrent" transatlantic slave trade on Saturday, in a landmark joint statement that raised the prospect of future reparations.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Gathering for a summit in Samoa, leaders held lengthy and occasionally tense talks over one of the most sensitive aspects of their shared and troubled past.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The bloc brings together Britain and most of its former colonies, many of which are still scarred by the brutal trade that saw an estimated 10-15 million slaves ripped from Africa over four centuries.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   African, Caribbean and Pacific nations have pressed for Britain – and other European powers – to pay financial compensation for slavery, or to make political amends.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In a closing statement, Commonwealth leaders noted calls for "reparatory justice" for the "abhorrent" transatlantic trade and agreed that "the time has come for a meaningful, truthful and respectful conversation."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   While Britain and other colonial powers have occasionally apologised for slavery in broad terms, they have baulked at the idea of paying financial reparations, which could come with a hefty price tag.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   During the summit, London tried to avoid making explicit commitments, while trying to prove the Commonwealth was still relevant and could work together.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The meeting's conclusion was delayed for hours as leaders and officials tried to hammer out a compromise.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   That compromise text may stop short of what some former colonies wanted.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The time has come to have a real dialogue about how we address these historical wrongs," Prime Minister Philip Davis of the Bahamas told the summit.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The horrors of slavery left a deep, generational wound in our communities, and the fight for justice and reparatory justice is far from over."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But experts said the summit could be historic nonetheless.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The commitment to conversations on reparatory justice wedges open the door for dialogue," said Kingsley Abbott, of the University of London's Institute of Commonwealth Studies.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The Commonwealth" he said, "should see this as an opportunity to lead on a potentially historic process, and to do so with vision and courage."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   For Britain – still staking out its place in the world after empire and leaving the European Union – the summit had high stakes.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Among the delegates were Prime Minister Keir Starmer and King Charles, his first summit as monarch and as head of the Commonwealth.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The British royal, whose family benefited from the slave trade over centuries, had faced calls to apologise personally.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He stopped well short of that on Friday, asking delegates to "reject the language of division."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I understand, from listening to people across the Commonwealth, how the most painful aspects of our past continue to resonate," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "None of us can change the past. But we can commit, with all our hearts, to learning its lessons and to finding creative ways to right inequalities that endure."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Charles left to return to London before the final summit communique had been agreed.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Commonwealth leaders found more common cause on the "existential" issue of climate change.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   They agreed to an "Ocean Declaration," which recognises national maritime boundaries even if sea levels continue to rise.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   They also agreed to protect at least 30 percent of the ocean and to restore at least 30 percent of degraded marine ecosystems by 2030.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "What the ocean declaration seems to do and to say is that once your marine boundaries are fixed, they are fixed in perpetuity," said outgoing Commonwealth Secretary-General Baroness Patricia Scotland.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Commonwealth leaders also agreed to name Ghana's foreign minister Shirley Ayorkor Botchwey as the new secretary general.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A former lawmaker, she has served as foreign minister for the past seven years, notably steering Ghana's two-year tenure on the UN Security Council, ending December 2023.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   She has backed the drafting of a free trade agreement among Commonwealth member states and has previously said she stands for reparations.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Truly humbled by the overwhelming support of the Commonwealth Heads of Government in selecting me as the incoming Secretary-General of the Commonwealth" she posted on social media.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The work indeed lies ahead!" (AFP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   The All Blacks crushed Eddie Jones's Japan 64-19 in a one-off Test in Yokohama on Saturday as the visitors scored 10 tries in a routine victory.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The match was the first in an All Blacks tour that will see them take on England, Ireland, France and Italy on successive weekends.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Japan drew first blood with Fiji-born winger Jone Naikabula steaming in to touch down by the posts in the fifth minute.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   New Zealand hit back when Mark Tele'a rampaged down the left wing and scored in the corner. Captain Patrick Tuipulotu then held off three tackles to bundle over the line before Damian McKenzie converted to make it 14-7.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Japan bounced back immediately, attacking off a line-out, punching holes in the defence before loose forward Faulua Makisi crashed through a wide gap off a close-range ruck.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Japan lock Warner Dearns thought he had put the hosts back in front, taking a lucky bounce to break clear and gallop over the line, only for the try to be disallowed.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Then the floodgates opened for New Zealand with Billy Proctor, Sam Cane, Samipeni Finau and Pasilio Tosi all going over the line, the latter after a barnstorming run by hooker Asafo Aumua to make it 36-12.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Just before the break the All Blacks packs smashed their way over the line with Tamaiti Williams grounding the ball off the back of a maul and McKenzie converting to make it 43-12 at halftime.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Cam Roigard opened the scoring in the second half and took the visitors over the 50-point mark in the 44th minute after being let fly by hooker Aumua.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Japan managed to give the scoreboard operators a respite, repeatedly pinning the now sloppy All Blacks in their 22, but not breaching the wall of the New Zealand defence.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   All Blacks attacks were frequently blunted and Japan again and again looked the more likely to score, but handling errors and New Zealand turnovers frustrated their efforts.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In the 67th minute, Yoshitaka Yazaki made a blistering run down the right but to the agony of the full-capacity Nissan stadium was brought down just short by McKenzie.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Seconds later however Japan's reserve prop Uwe Helu, on his debut, scored the hosts' third try and a successful conversion.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   All Blacks replacement back Ruben Love, on debut, claimed two late tries in three minutes off the bench as the Japanese defence faded. (AFP)

   The Observatory said on Saturday that the Strong Wind Signal No. 3 will stay in place at least until 10 pm, adding that local winds are expected to strengthen with a few squally showers in Hong Kong, as the winds veer to the east later on.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   However, it expects the winds to ease off gradually on Sunday morning as Trami leaves.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Earlier, the forecaster had issued the Strong Wind Signal No. 3 at 10.40 am on Saturday, after Trami intensified into a typhoon in the morning, skirting to the south of Hong Kong at a distance of about 500 kilometres.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Education Bureau said kindergartens and schools for children with physical and intellectual disabilities were suspended for the day.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The organiser of the Hong Kong Food Carnival said the event has been postponed due to the typhoon.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Tourism Commission said the light-and-sound show, "A Symphony of Lights", will be cancelled.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Harbour Lounge at the Hong Kong Wine & Dine Festival is also closed, but the doors of the festival remain open as usual.

  <img alt="Shigeru Ishiba could become Japan's shortest-serving prime minister in the post-war period. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1776354_1_20241026180240.jpg&q=99" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Candidates in Japan's super-tight election made last-ditch appeals to voters on Saturday, with opinion polls suggesting the ruling coalition might fall short of a majority.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Such a bombshell outcome in Sunday's vote would be the worst result for the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) since 2009, and potentially a knockout blow to Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Ishiba – a fan of trains, 1970s pop idols and making model ships and planes – only last month took the helm of the LDP, which has governed Japan for almost all of the past seven decades.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   After a tough internal contest, the 67-year-old former defence minister became premier on October 1. Days later, he called the snap parliamentary elections, promising a "new Japan."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Ishiba pledged to revitalise depressed rural regions and to address the "quiet emergency" of Japan's falling population through family-friendly policies such as flexible working hours.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But he has since rowed back his position on issues including allowing married couples to take separate surnames.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He also named only two women ministers in his cabinet.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Rising prices have rankled voters, and also dogging Ishiba is the fallout from a party slush fund scandal that helped sink his predecessor, Fumio Kishida.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A poll on Friday by the Yomiuri Shimbun daily suggested that the LDP and its coalition partner Komeito might struggle to get the 233 lower house seats needed for a majority.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Ishiba has set this threshold as his objective, and missing it would undermine his position in the LDP and mean finding other coalition partners or leading a minority government.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Local media speculated that Ishiba could potentially even resign immediately to take responsibility, becoming Japan's shortest-serving prime minister in the post-war period. (AFP)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Pakistan sealed a memorable Test series win as they thrashed England by nine wickets on Saturday after Noman Ali and Sajid Khan delivered a spin masterclass.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Noman and Sajid knocked over all 10 England wickets to dismiss the visitors for 112 before Pakistan raced to victory in Rawalpindi before lunch on day three of the third Test.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Shan Masood hammered five boundaries in six balls, launching Shoaib Bashir over the ropes to complete a resounding victory, his first series triumph as captain.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Noman finished with figures of 6-42 and Sajid 4-69 after England resumed the day on 24-3 but were dismissed in 37.2 overs for their lowest total in Pakistan.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   England won the first Test by an innings and 47 runs while Pakistan took the second by 152 runs, both in Multan.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Pakistan lost opener Saim Ayub for eight but Masood's six-ball 23 not out ended the match.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Pakistan captain had lost his previous two series in charge – 3-0 to Australia and 2-0 to Bangladesh – since being appointed last year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Noman and Sajid were brought into the line-up after England destroyed the hosts in the first Test in Multan by an innings and 47 runs.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The duo have knocked over 39 wickets between them in the subsequent two Tests, turning what looked like an easy England series victory Pakistan's way.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Joe Root top-scored with 33 while none of the other England batters could last long enough to stop Pakistan's charge towards a first home series win since beating South Africa in February 2021.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   England's previous lowest total was 130 in Lahore in 1987.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   England's fate was sealed once Noman dismissed overnight batsman Harry Brook caught behind by Mohammad Rizwan for 26 and skipper Ben Stokes leg-before for three.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Stokes once again fell in bizarre fashion as he offered no stroke to a Noman delivery, expecting it to go down the leg side but it struck him in front of the stumps.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The England skipper, who missed the first Test with a hamstring injury, managed just 53 runs in four innings.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sajid made it 6-75, dismissing Jamie Smith who tried to hit him out of the ground only to miss the ball and lose his stumps for three.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Noman completed his sixth five-wicket haul when Root edged a sharp turning delivery to Rizwan, quashing all hopes of an England fightback.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sajid dismissed Rehan Ahmed for seven while Noman wrapped up the innings with the wicket of Jack Leach, bowled for ten. (AFP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Secretary for welfare Chris Sun on Saturday said it’s not necessary to disclose every violation that happens at care homes, saying it depends on the severity of individual incidents.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Social Welfare Department has issued warnings to 15 care homes for persons with disabilities, in the past year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   One of them was issued to Hong Chi Association in August, which operates a care home in Tai Po.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A 38-year-old staff member from the facility has been charged on suspicion of sexually assaulting two residents while on duty.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The case was confirmed by the Social Welfare Department on Wednesday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Speaking to reporters, Sun said the standard procedure for the department is to upload the issuance of warnings to its website.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He said it’s not necessary to share details of every case to the public.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “It depends on the severity of individual violations as well as social awareness. These are judgments we need to make. For example, regarding the Hong Chi case, of course we think the incident was serious, and society is highly concerned, so we believe it’s necessary to explain to the public the details of the case,” he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “Some other violations are really about technical problems. For such violations, we just follow procedures that we think are suitable.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sun reiterated that he doesn't think it's wrong to delay the announcement for two months, adding that officials want to make sure the alleged victims and their families are in a stable emotional state and will not experience further harm.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   The two giant pandas presented to Hong Kong by the central government - An An and Ke Ke - have completed their month-long isolation period.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Ocean Park said on Saturday that the pair's health conditions have met the requirements of the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But it will take at least another 30 days before the public can meet the pandas, as they are still adapting to their new home.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The park revealed that the duo enjoy tailor-made facilities at their habitats.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Separately, the public is invited to suggest new names for the giant pandas until tomorrow. Participants have to submit their proposals along with a 100-word explanation.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A drawing competition for people to portray the pandas will last until November 8.

    'Market drives the site for gold storage facilities'

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury Christopher Hui said on Saturday that gold storage facilities do not have to be located at the airport.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The government unveiled in the Policy Address last week that it hopes to build an international gold trading market by promoting the development of world-class gold storage facilities.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The capacity of the gold vault at the city's international airport stands at 150 tonnes, and the Airport Authority announced that it is finalising the expansion plan of precious metal depository in line with the government's initiative.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   However, speaking on an RTHK radio programme, Hui said storage facilities do not have to be sited at the airport.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Of course, the airport has an innate advantage, because it's safe and secure. In terms of planning, it also allows us to get a better idea of the quantity and scale involved, because the plot of land is relatively level," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "But can we say that other sites can't be used as storage facilities? I don't think so. It's mainly driven by the market, and whether we could meet the storage requirements."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Hui also revealed that he will set up a working group to review the drive of world-class storage facilities in the region, by the end of this year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   While Hong Kong has always been a distribution centre for gold, apart from import and export of the precious metal, Hui hopes the city can make a breakthrough in trading as well as prices of gold.

  <img alt="Los Angeles Dodgers' Freddie Freeman (R) is celebrated after hitting a grand slam during the tenth inning of the World Series Game 1 against the New York Yankees at Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles.

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Freddie Freeman described his walk-off grand slam as a dream come true on Friday after helping the Los Angeles Dodgers snatch a jaw-dropping World Series game one victory over the New York Yankees.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Freeman's 10th-inning blast - the first ever walk-off grand slam in a World Series game - was the latest improbable twist to what has been a roller-coaster season for the 35-year-old first baseman.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Freeman, an avid student of the game, was delighted to learn he had etched his name into baseball history with his winning homer.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "That's pretty cool," Freeman said. "Obviously it's kind of amazing. When you get told you do something like that in this game that's been around a very long time -- I love the history of this game, to be a part of it, it's special.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I've been playing this game a long time, and to come up in those moments, you dream about those moments even when you're 35 and been in the league for 15 years, you want to be a part of those."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The fact that Freeman has made it to the postseason is a minor miracle in itself after a challenging year beset by injuries, all overshadowed by a serious illness for his three-year-old son, Max.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   An emotional Freeman returned to play later that month but then saw his postseason hopes clouded by a serious ankle sprain in late September that left him barely able to run.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   After celebrating his walk-off with team-mates, Freeman sprinted over to the seats behind home plate to share a moment with his father.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "He's been throwing me batting practice since I can remember," Freeman said. "My swing is because of him. My approach is because of him. I am who I am because of him. It was kind of spur of the moment."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Dodgers manager Dave Roberts meanwhile believed that Freeman's moment of glory was just reward for one of the most popular players in baseball.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The game honors you, and when you do things the right way, you play the right way, you're a good team-mate, I just believe that the game honors you," Roberts said. "Tonight Freddie was honored. (AFP)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Secretary for transport Lam Sai-hung on Saturday said the bureau will do all it can to cope with the series of test events to be held at the Kai Tak Sports Park.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The first test event will take place on Sunday, featuring a youth football match with about 1,000 invited spectators.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   There will be no parking or drop-off areas available at the Sports Park and people were urged to use MTR to enter the area.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Writing on his official blog, Lam noted that the bureau is aware of the broad public's concerns about transport arrangements for the sports park during large-scale events.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He said the government anticipated many spectators will use the Kai Tak Station and Sung Wong Toi Station to access the park, stressing that the MTR will strengthen services on the Tuen Ma line and Kwun Tong line based on actual needs and circumstances.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lam said there are also plenty of nearby buses connecting all parts of Hong Kong near the park and bus operators will launch special bus routes to cope with special transportation needs during major events.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He added that the transport bureau‘s emergency coordination centre will work closely with other governmental departments and public transport operators to monitor the situation and issue timely updates to the public.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Hong Kong Rugby Sevens, scheduled to take place from March 28 to 30 in 2025, is expected to be the first major event to be held at the Sports Park.

    Expansion of '1+' mechanism to lift healthcare quality
   </title>

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The Secretary for Health emphasised that the expansion of the "1+" mechanism will not affect the quality of medicine.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Starting next month, the mechanism will cover all new drugs, including vaccines and advanced therapy products. Currently, it only includes new drugs for treating life-threatening or severely debilitating diseases.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Speaking on a Commercial Radio programme on Saturday, Lo Chung-mau pointed out that the relaxation only changes the mode of approval, not the requirements for approval.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He believes the move will elevate the region's healthcare standard - the reason being that Hong Kong-registered drugs can be used in designated health institutions on the mainland, even if they have not been registered there.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We will be able to, one, allow patients in Hong Kong and even in the Greater Bay Area to enjoy more advanced therapy products or new drugs...with the improvement of healthcare standard in the whole area."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Two, with more choices, the cost of these new treatment drugs or advanced therapy products will be lowered. Thirdly, it will promote the development of R&D - research and development - in the area."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lo pointed out that the move will be attractive for pharmaceutical companies, as they can enjoy access to a bigger market.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Once the drug or device gets approved and registered in Hong Kong and is in-use at public hospitals, it will have a 'green channel' for use in the 86 million population of the GBA."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Meanwhile, Chief Executive John Lee voiced his support towards building a third medical school by local universities, in his third policy blueprint.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The health chief said it's "definitely good" to have one more medical institute, but warned that if the third medical institute is not up to scratch, it may affect the quality of the current two schools.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We have to be cautious, because a medical school involves a lot of resources, not just capital, for medical training, such as professors...a teaching hospital, and even patients. Because teaching is not only held in classrooms, we need medical cases to do so."

    Crime up slightly in first nine months of 2024

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Police Commissioner Raymond Siu on Saturday unveiled that Hong Kong recorded 70,015 crimes in the first nine months of the year, marking a 4.8 percent increase from the same period last year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The rise mainly comes from a surge in fraud, theft and blackmail cases.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Former police chief Andy Tsang’s home in Tai Po was recently burglarised, with reports saying that over HK$100,000 worth of items were stolen.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   On a Commercial Radio programme, Siu mentioned that burglary cases saw a 50 percent year-on-year increase in the first quarter.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He noted the force had since enhanced prevention measures, leading to a decline in such crimes in the first nine months, when compared with last year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We have strengthened patrols, especially on village houses and detached homes. We have also done more intelligence gathering, and we're using technology as well. We use drones from the Government Flying Service to monitor remote areas to identify if there are suspicious persons,” he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “Moreover, we have enhanced communication with residents, and urged them to report to the police immediately if they spot any suspicious activities. All these measures have led to a noticeable improvement.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Siu noted there were 32,120 fraud cases in the first nine months of the year, 2,470 more compared with the same period last year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He highlighted that the surge primarily came from a new method of deception, where scammers pretend to be customer service representatives at e-commerce stores.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The police chief went on to say that the force had implemented targeted promotions and initiatives aimed at combating these types of fraud crime in the past few months, leading to a monthly decline in figures since July.

   The Observatory has issued the Strong Wind Signal No. 3 at 10.40am on Saturday and said it will remain in force for most of the day.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The forecaster said Trami intensified into a typhoon this morning, skirting to the south of Hong Kong at a distance of about 500 kilometres.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Education Bureau said kindergartens and schools for children with physical and intellectual disabilities would be suspended for the day.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Social Welfare Department said all child-care centres, facilities providing after-school care programmes, elderly services centres, rehabilitation units as well as day activity centres, will remain open during normal operating hours.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The organiser of the Hong Kong Food Carnival said the event has been postponed due to the typhoon, noting that the carnival will be cancelled for the rest of the day if Signal No. 3 remains in force after 1pm.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Tourism Commission said the light-and-sound show, "A Symphony of Lights", will be cancelled.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Habour Lounge at the Hong Kong Wine & Dine Festival is also closed under the strong wind signal number 3, but the doors of the festival remain open as usual.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Observatory said the Strong Wind Signal No. 3 will stay in place at least until 10pm, adding that local winds are expected to strengthen with a few squally showers in Hong Kong, as the winds veer to the east later on.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   However, it expects the winds to ease off gradually on Sunday morning as Trami leaves.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Israel announced the launch of "precise strikes" on military targets in Iran on Saturday, in retaliation for attacks against it, as Iranian state media reported several explosions around the capital.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "In response to months of continuous attacks from the regime in Iran against the State of Israel - right now the Israel Defense Forces (Israeli military) is conducting precise strikes on military targets in Iran," the military said in a statement.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Israel had vowed, following Iran's October 1 missile attack, to hit back.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Hostilities between Iran and Israel soared since Israel launched it's offensive in Gaza last October, which has so far killed over 42,000 Palestinians.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Israel has since broadened the scope of its operations to Lebanon, vowing to secure its northern border after nearly a year of cross-border attacks by Lebanese group Hezbollah.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Our defensive and offensive capabilities are fully mobilised," the Israeli military said in a statement.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Military spokesman Daniel Hagari in a separate statement called on the people to be "alert and vigilant".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Iranian state television said on Saturday "strong explosions" were heard around the capital, though it did not specify the cause of the blasts.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Minutes ago, the sound of strong explosions were heard from around Tehran, the source of these sounds is not yet clear," a state TV presenter said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Iranian media said no fire or explosions had been reported at a main oil refinery near Tehran.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The United States said strikes by its ally Israel on military targets in Iran are "an exercise of self-defence" following the attack earlier this month.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In a possible indication of the scope of Saturday's strike, Syrian state news agency SANA said Syrian air defences had intercepted what it described as "hostile targets" near the capital city, Damascus.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Our anti-aircraft defence is confronting hostile targets in the skies around Damascus," SANA said on Telegram.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It also reported "sounds of explosions" in the vicinity of Damascus, though the origin of those blasts was unclear. (AFP)

   The Observatory says it will issue the Strong Wind Signal No. 3 at 10.40am as Severe Tropical Storm Trami skirts the SAR.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Education Bureau said kindergartens and schools for children with physical and intellectual disabilities would be suspended for the day.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Observatory said local winds are expected to pick up gradually in Hong Kong as the winds veer to the east later on, and some places which were previously sheltered become exposed.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   However, it expects the winds to ease off gradually on Sunday morning as Trami leaves.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It said Trami was an estimated 560 kilometres south of Hong Kong, and is forecast to move across the South China Sea in the direction of the waters south of Hainan Island.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   The Nasdaq ended higher on Friday, driven by megacap shares, as investors awaited quarterly results from some of Wall Street's biggest companies next week.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Tesla shares rose 3.36 percent a day after surging 22 percent on the electric vehicle maker's sales forecast. Amazon, Apple and Microsoft also rose.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Tesla numbers helped rekindle some optimism of investors that the Magnificent Seven rally is not over," said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He was referring to the group of interest rate-sensitive technology stocks which have surged on enthusiasm for artificial intelligence. Chip heavyweight Nvidia gained, briefly overtaking Apple as the world's most valuable company based on its shares.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The benchmark 10-year Treasury note yield edged higher as investors awaited US employment data next week for clues on the likely path of Federal Reserve interest rate cuts. Earlier this week, the yield reached a three-month high of 4.26 percent, weighing on the stock market.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.61 percent to 42,114. The S&P 500 lost 0.03 percent to 5,808, and the Nasdaq composite gained 0.56 percent, to 18,518.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Dow was dragged down by banking shares, with Goldman Sachs down 2.27 percent, and it was also hit by a 2.97 percent fall in fast-food chain McDonald's, which has been hit by an E. coli outbreak linked to its hamburgers.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Banks have rallied as (US presidential candidate Donald) Trump's odds (of winning) increased, so it seems investors are taking some profits," said Michael Rosen, chief investment officer at Angeles Investments.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Regional lender New York Community Bancorp dropped 8.26 percent after reporting its fourth straight quarterly loss, primarily due to its commercial real estate loans.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Continued uncertainty around the US election has made investors cautious.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Equities have been unsettled this week by a rapid rise in yields as bets on rate cuts by the Fed unraveled on expectations of a stronger economic outlook.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Only the Nasdaq closed the week with gains. The tech-heavy index rose 0.16 percent, while the S&P fell 0.96 percent and the Dow sank 2.68 percent. (Reuters)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   A man whose home had to be demolished because of coastal erosion lost a landmark legal claim on Friday against the UK government that accused it of failing to meet obligations to protect citizens from the effects of climate change.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Kevin Jordan, whose seaside home on the Norfolk coast in eastern England had to be knocked down, was one of two private claimants who brought the case, along with environmental campaign group Friends of the Earth.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Co-claimant Doug Paulley, a disability activist, lives in a care home in northern England and says hotter summers affect his health and puts him at increased risk of serious harm.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   They both claimed the government's climate adaptation aims policy, drawn up by the previous Conservative government, failed to comply with the country's 2008 Climate Change Act.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The claim also said the policy failed to assess impacts on protected groups under equality law and that it breached the human rights of the two individual claimants due to the lack of provision for the specific risks they faced.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But a judge at the High Court in London ruled on Friday that the government's plans were lawful – a decision described by Jordan as "extremely disappointing."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Friends of the Earth said its legal team will "study the detail of this judgement before we decide whether to lodge an appeal."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "A robust and comprehensive adaptation plan is urgently needed to help protect us from increasingly severe storms, floods and heatwaves – particularly marginalised groups, such as older and disabled people, and those living in areas most at risk from climate change," it added, urging the new Labour government to act. (AFP)

  <img alt="The bank directly blamed high government spending for inflation and said it could hike rates yet again if the pace of price rises does not cool. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1776235_1_20241025202739.jpg&q=80" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Russia's central bank hiked interest rates to 21 percent on Friday, taking borrowing costs to their highest level in more than 20 years amid surging inflation.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The rise takes rates above an emergency level introduced in February 2022 – just after Moscow ordered troops into Ukraine – and to their highest since 2003.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Further tightening of monetary policy is required to ensure the return of inflation to the target and reduce inflation expectations," the bank said in a statement announcing the increase.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The bank directly blamed high government spending for inflation and said it could hike rates yet again if the pace of price rises does not cool.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Additional fiscal spending and the related expansion of the federal budget deficit in 2024 have pro-inflationary effects," it said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Inflation has surged amid a massive increase in government spending on the Ukraine offensive that has triggered labour shortages across the economy.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Price rises were running at 8.6 percent on an annual basis in September, more than double the official 4.0-percent target.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Russian lawmakers voted on Thursday to increase defence expenditure by almost 30 percent next year, another sign Moscow is not planning to halt its spending on the offensive, grinding through its third year, anytime soon.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Several sectors of the economy are facing intense labour shortages, as hundreds of thousands of men have been called up to fight, fled the country or been recruited by a booming domestic weapons' industry.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   That has created strong growth despite an unprecedented package of Western sanctions that Washington hoped would cripple the Russian economy.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The International Monetary Fund this week raised its growth forecast for Russia in 2024 to 3.6 percent.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But it has also led to a cycle of spiralling wages and prices that the Central Bank has long warned undermines economic stability.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Official borrowing costs in Russia have not been above 20 percent since 2003.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   They regularly topped 100 percent throughout the 1990s, a decade of economic volatility and hardship following the collapse of the Soviet Union.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   For years President Vladimir Putin has boasted of economic stability under his leadership, with his first years in office in the 2000s seeing an oil-led boom and rising wealth.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But his conflict in Ukraine has threatened Moscow's future prosperity, cutting it off from lucrative Western export markets and much of the global financial system.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Putin had hoped to advance plans for alternative international payment systems at the Brics summit in Kazan this week, the largest diplomatic gathering in Russia since the start of the offensive.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But speaking on Thursday, he indicated little progress had been made on talks over launching a possible competitor to the Belgium-based Swift financial messaging system.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "As for Swift and any alternatives, we have not created and are not creating any alternatives," Putin told reporters at the end of the summit.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "One of the key problems today is the problem of payments, that is why we are moving towards the use of national currencies," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "As for a unified Brics currency, we are not considering that question at the moment," he added. (AFP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   The nation's top legislative body will meet from November 4 to 8, Xinhua News Agency reported on Friday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Draft laws and amendments to be discussed at the meeting of the National People's Congress Standing Committee will cover mineral resources, energy, anti-money laundering measures, maritime issues and other areas, Xinhua said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lawmakers would also review a draft preschool education law, and a draft revision to the Law on Protection of Cultural Relics.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Xinhua reported that the meeting will examine the State Council's financial work report, the management of state-owned assets and a special report on the administrative undertakings of state-owned assets last year.
