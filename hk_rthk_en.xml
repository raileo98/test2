<img alt="The High Court says overturning the administration's decision can lead to re-conducting the public consultation and seeking comments from environmental advisers. File photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1781778_1_20241202182743.jpg&q=30">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The High Court has overturned the government's approval of an environmental study into plans to build public flats on part of the Fanling Golf Course, calling on authorities to consult the public on the matter again.
 <br>
  <br>
  Judge Russell Coleman on Monday handed down the judgement after the Hong Kong Golf Club filed a legal challenge against an environmental impact assessment (EIA) report that would set the stage for building public housing units on 9.5 hectares of the century-old course.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said overturning the administration's decision could lead to re-conducting the public consultation and seeking comments from environmental advisers "with the benefits of the fruits of that re-consultation".
  <br>
  <br>
  The club had argued that a public consultation exercise had not been carried out properly or fairly, saying authorities had been allowed to submit additional information during the assessment but people's responses to the submissions were not taken into account.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As a matter of fact, the public were only consulted on part of the EIA report in its final form. That is contrary to the requirement of the EIA Ordinance," Coleman wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In short, I find that the fairness and integrity of the process, set out in the EIA Ordinance properly construed, demanded re-consultation once the additional information was produced to form part of the EIA report."
  <br>
  <br>
  The director of environmental protection gave conditional approval to the assessment in May last year, before the Town Planning Board rezoned the site from "residential" to "undetermined" use temporarily.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials had attached a number of conditions to the assessment's approval, including having the Civil Engineering and Development Department revise its layout plan to preserve about 0.4 hectares of woodland "as far as practicable".
  <br>
  <br>
  The judge said imposing such a condition “subject to the caveat of practicability” was problematic.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Until the exercise of revision is actually performed, it cannot be known whether the stated current plan [can] be maintained," he wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the High Court judge also rejected part of the club's contention, including an argument that the approval was unlawful because it failed to require the project proponent to carry out mitigation measures identified in the assessment report.
  <br>
  <br>
  The court earlier suspended the environmental review on an interim basis until the judicial challenge was resolved.

    Consultation on subdivided flats plan begins

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A two-month consultation exercise on proposed regulations aimed at ridding the city of poor quality subdivided flats began on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  At a housing panel meeting, several lawmakers said they were concerned landlords might start renovations ahead of the new legislation, leaving existing tenants homeless.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lawmaker Gary Zhang, a panel member, said the government needs to take the opportunity to hear what the public thinks about the policy.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We roll out this policy out of a very good will to ensure the basic humanity level at our housing situation. But if we cannot manage the transition, well I'm afraid ultimately we might cause some people to lose their homes, lose their residences,” he told RTHK after the meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  Deputy Financial Secretary Michael Wong, who leads the Task Force on Tackling the Issue of Subdivided Units, said he doesn't think such evictions will be a big problem.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We have talked to different parties earlier and heard about such sayings. But we haven't found any signs of a widespread issue. Also we have emphasised multiple times that under the existing landlord and tenant ordinance, the protection for tenants is still here. If any landlords break the rules and evict their tenants please let us know, we will address that seriously,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to the proposed policy, subdivided flats will have to have a floor area of at least eight square metres and a minimum ceiling height of at least 2.3 metres.
  <br>
  <br>
  Landlords caught renting out substandard flats would face jail terms of up to three years, as well a maximum fine of HK$300,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials told lawmakers that they will consult the public on how long the grace period should be for landlords to modify their flats to meet the new requirements.
  <br>
  <br>
  During the meeting, some lawmakers said they were worried people might simply switch to renting beds or guests rooms instead, which could be even more cramped than subdivided flats.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong said the government will look into other relevant policies to address potential issues.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A local creative studio is hosting an exhibition called "Panda Go! Fest HK" showcasing 2,500 panda sculptures at various iconic locations across the SAR on weekends in December and during Christmas.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a welcoming ceremony, SK Lam, founder of All Rights Reserved, said the exhibition will be held at the Avenue of Stars, Ngong Ping 360, Ocean Park and Sun Yat Sen Memorial Park.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Based on our past 10 years of experience and also the recent experience we had with [Doraemon], we think these are the more accessible areas that the public can go and visit," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lam also said the team has created six new panda characters inspired by the Ocean Park panda family, consisting of Ying Ying and Le Le, new arrivals currently named An An and Ke Ke, as well as the newborn twins.
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted that the company introduced a giant panda installation a decade ago, featuring 1,600 panda sculptures to symbolise the existing panda population at that time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lam added that thanks to global conservation efforts, the giant panda population has since increased to over 2,500, encompassing both wild and captive pandas.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The local stock market ended higher on Monday with the benchmark Hang Seng Index up 0.65 percent to close at 19,550.
 <br>
  <br>
  Analysts said the gains were driven by encouraging manufacturing data and expectations of continued policy support from Beijing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sentiment was buoyed by data that showed China's factory activity expanded last month, with Beijing's stimulus blitz since September starting to trickle through.

<div class="itemFullText">
 An impeachment complaint was filed on Monday against Philippine Vice President Sara Duterte, who is facing a legal storm over a death threat she made against the president, the alleged misuse of government funds by her office and other criminal accusations.
 <br>
  <br>
  The impeachment bid filed by several prominent opponents and activists in the House of Representatives accuses Duterte of violating the country’s Constitution, massive corruption and other “high crimes,” including the death threats she made against the president, his wife and the speaker of the House of Representatives.
  <br>
  <br>
  The vice president's legal troubles have unfolded in the backdrop of her increasingly bitter political feud with President Ferdinand Marcos Jr and his allies.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said in online news conference on November 23 that she had contracted an assassin to kill Marcos, his wife and Speaker Martin Romualdez if she were killed, a threat she warned was not a joke.
  <br>
  <br>
  She later said she was not threatening him but was expressing concern for her own safety. (AP)

    HK Island to get 'smart and green' transit line

<img alt="The Transport and Logistics Bureau says the 'smart and green mass transit system' it has opted for is more cost effective than a heavy rail project.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Transport officials say they hope to kick-start construction projects for a transit line linking HKU and Wong Chuk Hang MTR stations in 2027.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a paper submitted to Legco, the Transport and Logistics Bureau said rather than the heavy rail originally proposed, the new plan for the South Island Line (West) is to build a "smart and green mass transit system" using viaducts, along with a tunnel through the hilly terrain between Queen Mary Hospital and HKU.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 7.5-kilometre line will also pass through Aberdeen, Tin Wan, Wah Fu and Cyberport and will serve 130,000 residents and 50,000 people working in the areas, officials said.
  <br>
  <br>
  No expected completion date was given.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bureau said it hopes to begin detailed planning and design for the project next year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lawmaker Gary Zhang, who's a former railway engineer, said he expects construction work to be completed within five to six years' time.
  <br>
  <br>
  He pointed out that the capacity of the mass transit system is much lower than the original.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The new smart [and] green system - capacity could reach around 8,000. But normally the optimal capacity could be something around 5,000," he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So the capacity, yes, would be a disadvantage. But construction costs would be much much lower."

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police in Georgia fired tear gas and water cannon on Sunday on a fourth straight day of pro-EU protests that drew tens of thousands of people, as the prime minister rebuffed calls for new elections.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Black Sea nation has been rocked by turmoil since the governing Georgian Dream party claimed victory in October 26 parliamentary polls that the pro-European opposition said were fraudulent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The turmoil has deepened since Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze announced on Thursday that Georgia was shelving accession talks with the European Union until 2028, sparking a wave of protests in the capital, Tbilisi, and other cities.
  <br>
  <br>
  The opposition is boycotting the new parliament, while pro-EU President Salome Zurabishvili has asked the constitutional court to annul the election result, declaring the new legislature and government "illegitimate".
  <br>
  <br>
  Critics accuse Georgian Dream, in power for more than a decade, of having steered the country away from the EU in recent years, an accusation it denies.
  <br>
  <br>
  The interior ministry has said about 150 demonstrators have been arrested in this latest protest wave, while the Georgian Young Lawyers' Association put the number at 200.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police in some instances have chased protesters through the streets, beating them and firing rubber bullets and tear gas.
  <br>
  <br>
  Waving European and Georgian flags, tens of thousands rallied outside parliament on Sunday evening.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some demonstrators tossed fireworks and stones at riot police, while others banged on the metal door blocking parliament's entrance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police later fired water cannon, but were unable to disperse the crowds.
  <br>
  <br>
  Late at night, riot police in full gear moved in, using tear gas and water cannon to disperse the rally.
  <br>
  <br>
  The leader of the opposition United National Movement party, Levan Khabeishvili, told journalists that he was attacked by around 15 masked police officers attempting to detain him, but said he had managed to escape with the help of protesters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another protest took place outside the offices of Georgia's Public Broadcaster, widely accused of acting as a propaganda tool for the ruling party.
  <br>
  <br>
  The broadcaster conceded to the protesters' demand to grant Zurabishvili airtime, which it had previously denied her.
  <br>
  <br>
  Simultaneous protests took place in cities across Georgia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fuelling popular anger, Kobakhidze ruled out new parliamentary elections, saying that "the formation of the new government based on the October 26 parliamentary elections has been completed".
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier this week, the party nominated far-right former football international Mikheil Kavelashvili for the largely ceremonial post of president.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Zurabishvili told AFP in an exclusive interview on Saturday that she would not step down until last month's contested parliamentary elections are re-run.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brussels has not recognised the outcome of the October elections, and demanded an investigation into "serious electoral irregularities".
  <br>
  <br>
  The European Parliament has called for a re-run and for sanctions against top Georgian officials, including Kobakhidze.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zurabishvili on Saturday said that she was "the only legitimate institution in the country", and that "as long as there are no new elections... my mandate continues".
  <br>
  <br>
  Constitutional law experts have questioned the legitimacy of the new parliament, citing the fact it approved its own credentials in violation of a requirement to await a court ruling on Zurabishvili's bid to annul the election results.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hundreds of public servants, including from the ministries of foreign affairs, defence and education, as well as a number of judges, issued joint statements protesting Kobakhidze's decision to postpone EU accession talks. (AFP)

 Romania's ruling leftist Social Democrats (PSD) looked set to win the most votes in a parliamentary election on Sunday, fending off a resurgent far-right movement that challenged the country's pro-Western orientation, partial results showed.
 <br>
  <br>
  The vote is the second of three consecutive ballots for both a new parliament and a new president, after the first round of the presidential election on November 24 saw an independent far-right candidate, Calin Georgescu, emerge from relative obscurity to become the frontrunner.
  <br>
  <br>
  His unexpected win ushered in support for ultra-nationalist, hard-right parties, some with overt pro-Russian sympathies, which political analysts said could undermine Romania's support for Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  If final results confirm the preliminary count, a pro-Western coalition led by the PSD would likely have enough seats in parliament to form a government, although the far right would be a substantial force in the legislature.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, a broad coalition would be difficult to form amid disagreements over reforms and measures needed to rein in the country's gaping budget deficit, now the highest in the EU at eight percent of economic output.
  <br>
  <br>
  After a campaign dominated by voters' concerns over budget problems and the cost of living, the election pitted the far-right contenders against pro-European mainstream parties that have angered their voters with infighting and corruption allegations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Far-right parties have also used Romania's championing of Ukraine to stoke fears the war could spill over the border unless the country halts its support, as well as resentment over alleged preferential treatment for refugees from Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  Romania has the EU's biggest share of the population at risk of poverty, and swathes of the country need investment to attract jobs. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Monday said Hong Kong would continue to leverage its advantages under the One Country, Two Systems framework and use its global network to become an international education hub.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lee made his remarks while addressing the Global University Presidents and Leaders Summit, where attendees included leaders and presidents from more than 50 global universities.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Our unique advantages spring from One Country, Two Systems. Thanks to this unique principle, we enjoy unwavering support from our country together with global connectivity," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Hong Kong attracts students from more than 100 countries. Over half of the academic staff in our institutions comes from outside Hong Kong. And we are building on that solid foundation, the Hong Kong SAR government endeavors to develop Hong Kong into an international post-secondary education hub,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CE noted the SAR has five universities among the world's top 100, and three in Asia's top 10.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added the government would continue to promote the “study in Hong Kong brand” as well as encourage local universities to seek more collaboration with overseas and mainland institutions, especially with other cities in the Greater Bay Area.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at the same occasion, the director of the central government's liaison office, Zheng Yanxiong, said under support from the central government, Hong Kong has upheld its universities' independence and academic freedom since the city's return to the motherland.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also expressed hope that local universities would work even more closely with their global counterparts.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I hope local universities will seize the opportunity at this forum to deepen their connections with the global higher education sector, enhancing mutual understanding, respect and trust, as well as collaboration in joint programmes and academic exchanges,” Zheng said.

    Govt expects deficit to balloon to HK$100bn

<img alt="Paul Chan has revised the government's budget deficit estimate this year to around HK$100 billion." src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1781721_1_20241202122432.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government has doubled its estimated deficit for the current financial year to around HK$100 billion, citing lower revenue mainly due to poor asset market performances.
 <br>
  <br>
  When Financial Secretary Paul Chan announced his budget in February, he forecast a shortfall of a little more than HK$48 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he told lawmakers on Monday that as well as relatively poor asset market performances, revenue from profits tax is lower because firms aren't doing too well at present.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the latest estimate was made after considering revenue from government bonds and repayments due.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Due to geopolitical tensions and other uncertainties, the asset markets continue to be under pressure and this has somewhat affected the revenue from land sales and stamp duty," Chan said at a financial affairs panel meeting in the legislature.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We'll continue to consider our fiscal balance as well as long-term needs of our society. We'll put in place arrangements with a view to restoring fiscal balance in the coming few years."
  <br>
  <br>
  He said SAR officials have met credit rating agencies and they agree with the government's assessment that it shouldn't try to reverse the deficit in one to two years as that would "bring a major shock to the society".
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said the government is conducting transitional fiscal consolidation, mainly by cutting expenditure, while raising revenue is considered to be supportive only.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister said US President-elect Donald Trump's economic policies could contribute to global uncertainties next year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said Trump's threat to impose new tariffs against different countries, including China, could affect Hong Kong's re-exports of mainland goods to the US.
  <br>
  <br>
  The secretary also reassured lawmakers that they need not worry too much about the government's dwindling fiscal reserves, saying the key is "taking care of our own business".

<img alt="A vehicle on fire in the aftermath of what the White Helmets said was an strike on Idlib, with the Syrian government vowing to drive out rebel forces from northwest Syria. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1781715_1_20241202121126.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 At least 25 people were killed in northwestern Syria in air strikes carried out by the Syrian government and Russia, the Syrian opposition-run rescue service known as the White Helmets said early on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Russian and Syrian jets struck the rebel-held city of Idlib in northern Syria on Sunday, military sources said, as President Bashar al-Assad vowed to crush insurgents who had swept into the city of Aleppo.
  <br>
  <br>
  The army also said it had recaptured several towns that rebels had overrun in recent days.
  <br>
  <br>
  Insurgents led by jihadi group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham launched a two-pronged attack on Aleppo and the countryside around Idlib last Wednesday, before moving toward neighbouring Hama province.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Sunday, government troops created a “strong defensive line” in northern Hama, as they attempted to stall the insurgents’ momentum, according to Britain-based opposition war monitor the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.
  <br>
  <br>
  The surge in fighting has raised the prospect of another violent, destabilising front reopening in the Middle East at a time when Israel is fighting Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, conflicts that have repeatedly threatened to ignite an even wider regional war.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also risks drawing Russia and Turkey — each with its own interests to protect in Syria — into direct heavy fighting against each other.
  <br>
  <br>
  The insurgents announced their offensive last Wednesday, just as a ceasefire started between Hezbollah and Israel that raised some hope tensions in the region might be calming.
  <br>
  <br>
  The surprise offensive is an embarrassment for Assad, and it comes at a time when his allies — Iran and groups it backs and Russia — are preoccupied with their own conflicts.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to a statement from Assad’s office, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi reassured the Syrian leader during a visit to Damascus that Tehran was ready to support the government in their counter-offensive.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arab leaders, including Jordan’s King Abdullah II and United Arab Emirates President Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, have also called Assad to express their solidarity.
  <br>
  <br>
  The civil war, which has killed hundreds of thousands of people and displaced many millions, has ground on since 2011 with no formal end.
  <br>
  <br>
  Most of the heavy fighting stopped years ago after Iran-backed militias and Russian air power helped Assad win control of all major cities. (Agencies)

    'Shallow waters contributed to whale's death'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department revealed on Monday that Hong Kong's shallow waters was a factor leading to the death of a whale in Tai O.
 <br>
  <br>
  The stranded animal passed away despite rescue efforts by a team of veterinarians.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on an RTHK radio programme, Assistant Director (Fisheries & Marine Conservation) Jim Chu pointed out that beaked whales usually inhabit deep waters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Its natural habitat is in waters with a depth of between 300 metres and even a kilometre. The waters of Hong Kong are only around tens of metres deep," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Around Tai O, the water depth is around 10 metres or less. So these conditions are totally unsuitable for these animals to survive."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chu revealed the cetacean was first discovered in Yi O on Saturday afternoon, before it appeared in Tai O in the evening.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities also said that a canvas bag was discovered inside the whale, and Chu said it was not known for how long it had been inside the animal's digestive system.
  <br>
  <br>
  But as the bag was still in good shape, it showed the cetacean was unable to digest it.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chu also said autopsy showed the whale's stomach did not have any food, and it is likely this was due to the bag blocking its digestive system.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added the Response Plan to the Sighting of non-resident Cetaceans in Hong Kong Waters was activated for the first time during this incident.
  <br>
  <br>
  It aims to minimise the nuisance caused by people to external species and provide emergency assistance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Taison Chang, chairman of the Hong Kong Dolphin Conservation Society, told the same programme the animal was likely a tropical bottlenose whale.
  <br>
  <br>
  He believes the cetacean, measuring six to seven metres long, was an adult whale.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A residential care home serving people with disabilities for almost six decades in Hong Kong is seeking support to enhance its care services for ageing residents.
 <br>
  <br>
  Home of Loving Faithfulness is one of the 11 beneficiaries of this year's Operation Santa Claus (OSC), and has been providing life-long care for children and adults with special needs since 1965.
  <br>
  <br>
  What sets this facility apart is its commitment to lifetime care, accepting residents as young as six years old and allowing them to stay indefinitely, the home's Superintendent Matthew Chu said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chu said the charity has launched a project called Lifelong Services to address the increasing challenges in caring for elderly residents who experience deteriorating body functions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When they age, the need for their caring [becomes] more challenging because sometimes their swallowing is not very good. Sometimes they have difficulties in excreting their urine," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chu said the charity operates entirely on donations without government subsidies and it will use the funds from OSC to hire more staff and bring in professional services.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will [use] the funds to hire additional staff and also we will [hire] professional services like occupational therapist services to come in to help these residents to maintain their health."
  <br>
  <br>
  Jointly organised by RTHK and South China Morning Post, OSC funds charitable projects that focus on children and youth, the elderly, the community, those with physical and mental disabilities, medical projects, and those concerning the environment.
  <br>
  <br>
  If you wish to make a donation, please visit the Operation Santa Claus website at https://oschk.org/.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Two giant pandas gifted by the central government on Monday made their debut to the media after completing their quarantine at Ocean Park.
 <br>
  <br>
  The pair, currently called An An and Ke Ke, are both five years old and showed their distinct personalities during the visit.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ke Ke climbed up to her wooden platform and leisurely ate her bamboo leaves. An An was much more playful – he walked around exploring his habitat and rolled around on the ground while eating.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ponyo, who works at the park's Whiskers Village, explained how to tell the pandas apart.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For Ke Ke, she is like a princess. She loves to have her me time, and she's a bit curious about the environment outside, and she would like to stay a little bit quiet.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But for An An, he's just like a boy. He's very strong, and he's very curious [about the] outside, and he would like to discover outside, see what is going on."
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 22,600 suggestions have poured in for a naming contest of these national treasures, with the winning names set to be announced at the official debut ceremony on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hongkongers will be able to meet the pandas when their home opens to the public this Sunday.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Donovan Mitchell scored 35 points and the Cleveland Cavaliers avenged a heartbreaking loss with a 115-111 victory over Boston on Sunday in a matchup of the NBA's top teams.
 <br>
  <br>
  Mitchell scored 20 points in the fourth quarter as the Cavs rallied from 14 points down in the second half to defeat the reigning NBA champions.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Cavaliers started the season 15-0 but suffered their first loss at Boston last month by 120-117 and dropped their two prior games, both losses to Atlanta, before staging a fightback home triumph.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For us, we've got to go out there and make a statement," Mitchell said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They beat us in the NBA Cup. No excuse. We've got to go out there and try to build – we had two losses that really hurt," he went on to say. "We weren't playing like ourselves – we needed this win."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Cavs improved to 18-3 to stay atop the Eastern Conference while the Celtics fell to 16-4 as Cleveland snapped their seven-game win streak.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You've got to trust your work and what we've been working on since training camp. That's the biggest thing," Mitchell said. "That's what you saw tonight, and that's what it's going to continue to be."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Celtics were without starting guards Jaylen Brown due to illness and Derrick White with a sprained right foot.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Just because they've got two guys down, they've got a lot of guys who are capable," Mitchell said. "You've got to respect them – they're champions for a reason."
  <br>
  <br>
  Cleveland led 51-49 at half-time but the Celtics dominated the third quarter for an 84-72 lead entering the fourth, Jayson Tatum scoring 17 of his 33 points in the third period to lead Boston.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mitchell responded for Cleveland, including a floater that gave the Cavs a 103-101 lead with 67 seconds remaining and concluded his run of 11 consecutive Cavaliers points.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The biggest thing is you've just got to pick your spots, find your moments throughout the game," said Mitchell. "They kind of went on a run and in the fourth quarter I started to make my imprint.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tatum missed a layup and Mobley followed with a dunk for a 105-101 Cavs lead. Porzingis responded with two free throws with 26 seconds to play but Mitchell sank two free throws of his own for a 107-103 Cavs lead.
  <br>
  <br>
  The teams traded free throws late until Pritchard deliberately missed one trying to get a rebound, but he committed a lane violation and Mitchell added two final free throws to seal the victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  "At the end of the day, we executed on both ends of the floor," said Mitchell.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I scored offensively but we were getting stops and finding ways to get rebounds, loose balls, different things," he added. "That's what ultimately ended up getting us the W." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Netherlands' Sifan Hassan and Botswana's Letsile Tebogo were named World Athletes of the Year on Sunday after they both scooped multiple medals at the Paris Olympics.
 <br>
  <br>
  Hassan won the women's marathon in an Olympic record time of 2.22:55. She also claimed bronze medals in the 10,000m and 5000m events.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Thank you to the fans, to everybody who voted," Hassan, also awarded women's out of stadium athlete of the year, said in Monaco.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I never thought I was going to win this one – this year was crazy," she added. "It's not only me, all the athletes have been amazing. I'm really grateful. What more can I say?"
  <br>
  <br>
  Tebogo, meanwhile, also made history in the French capital as he became the first African to win the Olympic men's 200-metre title and earned Botswana their first ever Olympic gold medal.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also set a national record of 9.86 when finishing sixth in the 100-metre final before being part of Botswana's silver medal-winning men's 4x400-metre team.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It feels amazing to know that the fans are always there for us athletes. It was a great year," Tebogo, also named men's track athlete of the year, said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This means a lot. It's not just about the team that is around you, there are a lot of fans out there that really want us to win something great for the continent," the 21-year-old went on to say.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was a real surprise to hear my name because I didn't expect this." (Reuters)

    Eagles top Ravens, Steelers edge Bengals in Cincinnati

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Philadelphia Eagles on Sunday broke out of a tight encounter with the Baltimore Ravens to record their 10th win of the NFL season when star running back Saquon Barkley burst for a 25-yard rushing touchdown to put his team 21-12 up mid-way through the fourth quarter.
 <br>
  <br>
  A 35-yard Jake Elliott field goal extended the lead to 12 points and although Lamar Jackson found Isaiah Likely with an 11-yard touchdown pass in the final seconds it was too late for a Ravens comeback as the Eagles won 24-19.
  <br>
  <br>
  Baltimore kicker Justin Tucker's woes were evident again as he missed two field goals and an extra point.
  <br>
  <br>
  Barkley, enjoying an outstanding year after being traded by the New York Giants, put up 107 yards on 23 carries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Geno Smith returned to haunt the New York Jets as he led the Seahawks to a 26-21 victory, clinched by Zach Charbonnet's 8-yard rushing score in the fourth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Former Jet Smith threw for 206 yards and a touchdown while opposite number Aaron Rodgers threw for 185 yards and two touchdowns.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Pittsburgh quarterback Russell Wilson continued his renaissance, throwing for 414 yards and three touchdowns as the Pittsburgh Steelers won 44-38 at the Cincinnati Bengals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wilson, a Super Bowl winner with Seattle in 2014, was released by Denver last year and signed on a one-year veteran minimum deal with the Steelers.
  <br>
  <br>
  But having earned the starting role in Pittsburgh ahead of Justin Fields, the 36-year-old is spearheading the team's strong push towards the playoffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wilson's 25-yard touchdown pass to Pat Freiermuth at the end of the third quarter was a reminder of his enduring quality, scrambling out of the pocket and finding his receiver with a fine pass on the run.
  <br>
  <br>
  That score gave the Steelers a 34-24 lead heading into the fourth, and a 21-yard fumble recovery returned by Payton Wilson put them in firm control.
  <br>
  <br>
  Although Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow threw two touchdowns in the final quarter, either side of a 30-yard Chris Boswell field goal for the Steelers, Pittsburgh held on for a crucial win against their divisional rivals.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Steelers lead the AFC North on 9-3 with the Baltimore Ravens second on 8-5.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are working for something and it matters to us, it matters, it was a great day," said Wilson.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are still learning, still growing – there is still a lot more to do," he added. (AFP)

    Biden pardons son over 'miscarriage of justice'

<img alt="Hunter Biden was convicted earlier this year of lying about his drug use when he bought a gun, and pleaded guilty in a separate tax evasion trial.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 President Biden on Sunday issued an official pardon for his son Hunter, who is facing sentencing for two criminal cases related to tax evasion and the purchase of a firearm.
 <br>
  <br>
  "No reasonable person who looks at the facts of Hunter's cases can reach any other conclusion than Hunter was singled out only because he is my son -- and that is wrong," the president said in a statement, calling it "a miscarriage of justice."
  <br>
  <br>
  The younger Biden was convicted earlier this year of lying about his drug use when he bought a gun -- a felony -- and has also pleaded guilty in a separate tax evasion trial.
  <br>
  <br>
  The pardon comes after Biden has repeatedly said he wouldn't intervene in his son's legal troubles. The White House press secretary said as recently as September that Biden wouldn't issue a pardon for Hunter.
  <br>
  <br>
  At the same time, criminal cases against President-elect Donald Trump have come to a standstill after a sweeping ruling on presidential immunity by the Supreme Court -- all but ensuring Biden's Republican rival will likely never see a jail cell, even after his landmark conviction for falsifying business records in May.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I said I would not interfere with the Justice Department's decision-making, and I kept my word even as I have watched my son being selectively, and unfairly, prosecuted," Biden said in Sunday's statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The charges in his cases came about only after several of my political opponents in Congress instigated them to attack me and oppose my election," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I believe in the justice system, but as I have wrestled with this, I also believe raw politics has infected this process and it led to a miscarriage of justice." (AFP)

    Man Utd thrash Everton to give Amorim perfect start

<img alt="Ruben Amorim during Man United's Premier League match against Everton. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1781659_1_20241202053549.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ruben Amorim refused to rule out a top-four challenge after enjoying a dream home Premier League debut as Manchester United thrashed Everton 4-0 thanks to doubles from Marcus Rashford and Joshua Zirkzee on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Portuguese's first Premier League game in charge at Ipswich last weekend showed how much work he has ahead as United blew an early lead to draw 1-1 at Portman Road.
  <br>
  <br>
  But they cut loose against another opponent struggling at the wrong end of the table to the delight of the home crowd as chants of Amorim's name rang around Old Trafford in the closing stages.
  <br>
  <br>
  The former Sporting Lisbon boss made six changes from Thursday's rollercoaster 3-2 win over Bodo/Glimt and was rewarded with a performance full of attacking verve that has been so often lacking from the Red Devils this season.
  <br>
  <br>
  United are up to ninth place, within touching distance of the top four, and Amorim knows a challenge to qualify for the Champions League would be a good first impression at his new club.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's hard for me. If I say no, you will say that I cannot be a Manchester United coach," he said. "I said this many times, I will be judged about the place that we finish. I know that. But let's focus just on the next game and look at the performance."
  <br>
  <br>
  Rashford has found his form under the new boss with three goals in as many games.
  <br>
  <br>
  The England international opened the floodgates on 34 minutes when his effort deflected in off Jarrad Branthwaite.
  <br>
  <br>
  United had tried to sign Branthwaite during the summer transfer window, but his first half to forget continued when he was dispossessed by Amad Diallo before Zirkzee struck his first goal since the opening day of the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Having scored inside two minutes of Amorim's first two games in charge, United this time took just seconds to net from the restart for the second half.
  <br>
  <br>
  Diallo played in Rashford, who showed impressive pace and then poise to beat Jordan Pickford.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zirkzee had netted just once in 18 previous appearances since joining from Bologna.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dutchman looked a different player after the confidence boost of his first goal and rounded off the scoring after the impressive Diallo again won possession and provided the assist.
  <br>
  <br>
  Victory lifts United up to ninth and within four points of the top four.
  <br>
  <br>
  Much tougher challenges are to come, starting with a daunting trip to Arsenal on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  But for a fan base starved of excitement in recent times, Amorim's home Premier League bow delivered exactly what United supporters craved.
  <br>
  <br>
  Amorim saluted the influential Diallo's contribution to United's victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He was really good again. He's in a great moment, but that moment starts with Ruud (van Nistelrooy). I just take advantage of his work with Amad," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He was really good defending and really good attacking, so he has to continue to play like that," Amorim added.
  <br>
  <br>
  By contrast, Everton remain just two points above the relegation zone ahead of a devilishly difficult run of fixtures over the festive period. (AFP)

    Liverpool beat Man City to extend Premier League lead

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Liverpool opened up a nine-point lead at the top of the Premier League as Manchester City's crisis deepened in a 2-0 defeat at Anfield on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Cody Gakpo's 12th-minute goal was scant reward for the Reds' first-half domination and they sealed an 18th win in 20 games under Arne Slot thanks to Mohamed Salah's penalty.
  <br>
  <br>
  City are now 11 points off the runaway leaders down in fifth and winless in seven games, including six defeats.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal and Chelsea are Liverpool's closest challengers as City appear set to lose their crown as English champions after winning an unprecedented four consecutive titles.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pep Guardiola was taunted with chants of "you're getting sacked in the morning" in the closing stages.
  <br>
  <br>
  The City boss responded by showing six fingers, one for each of his Premier League title wins in the past seven seasons.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Guardiola insisted he is not living in the past as he looks to turnaround the worst run of his managerial career.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When you win you laugh, when they win, they laugh. It's part of the game," said Guardiola on his interaction with the crowd.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Now it will be so difficult to repeat (winning the title) this season but all the club, we will reflect together, to try and come back strong," said Guardiola.
  <br>
  <br>
  City's only point since October 26 even felt like a defeat as they blew a 3-0 lead in the final 15 minutes to draw 3-3 with Feyenoord in the Champions League in midweek.
  <br>
  <br>
  Guardiola responded by dropping goalkeeper Ederson, while Kyle Walker and Ruben Dias were restored to the defence.
  <br>
  <br>
  But there was no response from the defending champions as they were blown away in the opening stages.
  <br>
  <br>
  City could barely get out of their half in the opening quarter and the goal duly arrived when Gakpo bundled in Salah's enticing cross to the back post.
  <br>
  <br>
  Virgil van Dijk hit the post and powered another big headed chance inches wide as the chances continued to come for Liverpool.
  <br>
  <br>
  Even during City's finest seasons under Guardiola, they have struggled to contain the power of the Anfield crowd.
  <br>
  <br>
  City's only away win against Liverpool since 2003 remains behind closed doors during the coronavirus-impacted 2021/22 season.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Today really stood out," said Slot on whether this was his finest day as Liverpool boss to day. "The culmination of the energy we had and the energy the crowd had."
  <br>
  <br>
  Guardiola's men did at least manage to stem the bleeding either side of half-time, but should still have been punished several times on the counter-attack.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stefan Ortega saved from Gakpo and Trent Alexander-Arnold, either side of a stunning Salah miss when one-on-one with the German goalkeeper.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another turnover deep inside their own half finally cost City the decisive second goal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Salah had fired wide from the spot in Wednesday's 2-0 Champions League win over Real Madrid.
  <br>
  <br>
  This time the Egyptian found the bottom corner for his 13th goal of the season to round off Liverpool's dream week.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Real Madrid and Manchester City have been and are so good, with managers that have won so many trophies, so it is always nice to come out of those situations as a winner," added Slot.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But they were able to win every single three days," he said. "We understand what we want to achieve is more than this winning once or twice, even against these big teams, if you want to win big things."
  <br>
  <br>
  Guardiola emptied Jeremy Doku, Savinho, Jack Grealish and Kevin De Bruyne off the bench in the second half in search of a lifeline.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, City's reliance on Erling Haaland for goals was again evident as he was marked out of the game by Van Dijk, who had been imperious until a late lapse of concentration should have gifted City a consolation.
  <br>
  <br>
  He presented the ball to De Bruyne, but he could not beat the in-form Caoimhin Kelleher. (AFP)

 The Agriculture, Fisheries, and Conservation Department (AFCD) on Sunday said a tote bag was found inside a whale, which died earlier in the day.
 <br>
  <br>
  The whale had become stranded in shallow waters near Tai O.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bag, measuring 88 by 52 centimetres, was found in the whale's digestive system during a necropsy conducted by vets from Ocean Park, alongside AFCD officials.
  <br>
  <br>
  The preliminary results of the necropsy pointed to it being a male beaked whale of six-to-seven metres in length.
  <br>
  <br>
  Taison Chang is the chairman of the Hong Kong Dolphin Conservation Society. He says the tote bag could have played a role in the whale's death.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The size of the bag is quite large. It is likely to cause malnutrition over time, as it is difficult for the whale to eat other things. This is likely one of the reasons for it being so weak, leading to its accidental entry into Hong Kong waters and ultimate stranding," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The AFCD says the whale showed signs of injury, which could have been sustained when it became stranded.
  <br>
  <br>
  The cause of death and the exact species of the whale are yet to be confirmed.

    Kuwait ruler urges immediate Gaza ceasefire

<img alt="Emir Sheikh Meshal al-Ahmad al-Sabah (left0 also called on the international community to provide protection for innocent civilians. File photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1781644_1_20241201212541.jpg&q=65">

<div class="itemFullText">
 Kuwait's ruler on Sunday urged an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, as he addressed a summit of the Gulf Cooperation Council held after nearly 14 months of war in the Palestinian territory.
 <br>
  <br>
  Emir Sheikh Meshal al-Ahmad al-Sabah called on the international community to implement "an immediate ceasefire, providing international protection for innocent civilians and ensuring the opening of safe corridors and the arrival of urgent humanitarian aid".
  <br>
  <br>
  The meeting of the six-member GCC comes at a time of acute and ongoing uncertainty for the Middle East following Hamas's October 7, 2023 attack on Israel and a subsequent war on Gaza, which has repeatedly threatened spillover into a wider regional conflagration.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sheikh Meshal hit out at what he characterised as the "double standards in the application of relevant international laws, charters and resolutions" which he said had undermined "the region's security and stability".
  <br>
  <br>
  He said Kuwait was "optimistic" about a ceasefire agreed between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon that he said would contribute "to reducing escalation in the region".
  <br>
  <br>
  Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar and other countries also welcomed last week's a truce after a year of conflict that killed thousands in Lebanon and caused mass displacement on both sides of the border.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fighting escalated in September after continuous cross-border strikes, initiated by Iran-backed Hezbollah in support of Hamas.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Kuwaiti ruler spoke in support of Saudi's work to form a global body pushing for an independent Palestinian state and lauded "positive and constructive" work by Iran and the GCC.
  <br>
  <br>
  Saudi Arabia had appeared close to a normalisation deal with Israel prior to October 2023 but Riyadh indicated it was unwilling to move ahead while Israel pursued its campaign in Gaza, hardening its position in recent months saying it would not recognise Israel without an independent Palestinian state.
  <br>
  <br>
  Anxious about being drawn into tit-for-tat strikes between Israel and nearby Iran, also precipitated by fighting in Gaza, the wealthy and traditionally western-allied Gulf monarchies have sought to cultivate improved relations with Tehran.
  <br>
  <br>
  An Israeli air raid on Iran in October was the most recent in a series of retaliatory attacks between the two countries. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Sai Kung District Office on Sunday said a laptop and a mobile phone belonging to one of its care teams have been stolen. The office says the devices contain the personal data of hundreds of people.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, the Sai Kung District Office said it received the theft report from the Sai Kung Hang Hau East Sub-district Care Team on Saturday. It said the laptop and the mobile phone contain the names and phone numbers of hundreds of people, some with addresses and ID card numbers.
  <br>
  <br>
  The district office said the items, used by the Hang Hau District Festival and Special Event Preparatory Committee, had been in a locked room at the Hang Hau Rural Committee office on Hang Hau Road. It said the door lock had been broken.
  <br>
  <br>
  The office said both electronic devices and files were protected by high-strength passwords, so the risk of data leakage should be relatively low.
  <br>
  <br>
  The office has reported the case to the police and the privacy watchdog.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police have classified the case as burglary.

    Centre-right parties to retain power in Ireland

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The incumbent centre-right parties Fianna Fail and Fine Gael looked set to retain power in Ireland as vote counting in the European Union member's general election resumed on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  With around 45 seats of the new 174-seat lower chamber of parliament decided, the parties were ahead of the main opposition party, the left-wing nationalist Sinn Fein.
  <br>
  <br>
  Local media projected Fianna Fail, led by the experienced Micheal Martin, 64, would win the largest vote share and over 40 seats.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fine Gael, whose leader Simon Harris, 38, is the outgoing prime minister (taoiseach), were in second place according to projections, with Sinn Fein in third.
  <br>
  <br>
  To form a majority, a party or coalition requires at least 88 seats.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both centre-right parties have repeatedly ruled out entering a coalition with Sinn Fein.
  <br>
  <br>
  The centre-left opposition Labour party is seen by Fine Gael and Fianna Fail as the most likely junior coalition party, according to local media.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Green Party was the third member of the previous coalition but its support collapsed nationwide, with all but one seat likely to be lost.
  <br>
  <br>
  At the last general election in 2020, the pro-Irish unity Sinn Fein -- the former political wing of the paramilitary Irish Republican Army -- was the most popular party but could not find willing coalition partners.
  <br>
  <br>
  That led to weeks of horse-trading, ending up with Fine Gael, which has been in power since 2011, agreeing a deal with Fianna Fail.
  <br>
  <br>
  During the last parliamentary term, the role of prime minister rotated between the Fianna Fail and Fine Gael leaders.
  <br>
  <br>
  The final seat numbers, which will not be confirmed until early next week, will determine whether Harris returns as taoiseach or Martin takes the role under a rotation arrangement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The new parliament is due to sit for the first time on December 18, but following coalition talks a new government is not expected to be formed until the new year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The three-week campaign, launched after Harris called a snap election on November 8, was dominated by rancour over housing supply and cost-of-living crises, health, public spending, and the economy. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's Olympic fencing champions Edgar Cheung and Vivian Kong are among the winners of the annual Fencing World Cup, after topping the rankings of their respective disciplines over the past season.
 <br>
  <br>
  The pair received their awards at this year's International Fencing Federation Congress in Uzbekistan.
  <br>
  <br>
  At the end of the 2023-24 season, Cheung topped the men's foil table for the first time in his career.
  <br>
  <br>
  He won gold at the Paris Olympics for the SAR and finished on top of Grand Prix events in Turin and Shanghai.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I am really happy to win this award, and I would like to sincerely thank everyone who has helped and supported me," Cheung wrote on social media.
  <br>
  <br>
  For Kong, who announced her retirement from professional fencing after winning gold in the Olympics, she returned to the world number one spot in women's individual epee.
  <br>
  <br>
  She made history at the Paris Games, clinching the first-ever gold medal in the individual epee event for Hong Kong, China.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kong also reached the top of the rankings in the 2018-19 season.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SAR team's fencing coach, Greg Koenig, attended the ceremony and called the pair "the pride of Hong Kong".

<img alt="Kaja Kallas, who took office on Sunday with a visit to Ukraine, said " src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1781619_1_20241201173234.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The EU's new foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas on Sunday warned Georgian authorities over violence against demonstrators protesting the government's decision to shelve its bid to join the bloc.
 <br>
  <br>
  "It is clear that using violence against peaceful protesters is not acceptable, and the Georgian government should respect the will of the Georgian people," Kallas told journalists.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When it comes to European Union, then this clearly has consequences on our relationship with Georgia."
  <br>
  <br>
  Kallas, who took office on Sunday with a visit to Ukraine, said "options" had been put forward to the EU's 27 member states on how to respond, including potentially imposing sanctions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have different options. But of course, we need to come to agreement," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Violent clashes erupted on Saturday outside Georgia's parliament between police and demonstrators protesting the government's decision to delay European Union membership talks amid a post-election crisis, AFP reporters witnessed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thousands of people gathered in Georgia's capital Tbilisi on Saturday for a third night of protests that saw dozens arrested.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Black Sea nation has been rocked by turmoil since the ruling Georgian Dream party claimed victory in an October 26 parliamentary election that the pro-European opposition said was fraudulent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chaotic scenes unfolded for hours as police chased defiant protesters through the streets of central Tbilisi, beating them and making arrests.
  <br>
  <br>
  Masked officers in riot gear fired rubber bullets, tear gas and water cannons as they moved in to disperse protesters hurling fireworks, while flames were seen coming from a window of the parliament building.
  <br>
  <br>
  Demonstrators erected barricades on Tbilisi's main avenue.
  <br>
  <br>
  The interior ministry said "the actions of some individuals present at the protest became violent" and that police would "respond appropriately and in accordance with the law to every violation".
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 100 people have been arrested in the last two days.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze's announcement on Thursday that Georgia would not seek accession talks with the EU until 2028 ignited a furious reaction from the opposition. (AFP)

    Offer public housing to more non-elderly singles: SoCo

<img alt="SoCo says non-elderly one-person applicants of public housing often have to wait for more than 10 years to be assigned a flat. Photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1781617_1_20241201170656.jpg&q=35">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A community group on Sunday called on the government to allow more non-elderly single people to get public housing.
 <br>
  <br>
  According to the Society for Community Organisation (SoCo), about 91,000 non-elderly one-person applicants were waiting to be allocated a public housing unit as of September.
  <br>
  <br>
  A maximum of 2,200 units, or about 10 percent of new public housing units made available, are allocated to them each year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Deputy director of SoCo Sze Lai-shan said that should be raised to up to 30 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Now the government use age in the points system when they [applicants] are waiting for public housing, and the quota for non-elderly persons is very low," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think the government should suspend the points system, and increase the quota allocated to non-elderly single people so it is more fair for them, maybe at least to 20 or 30 percent. It would be more fair and not affect families and elderlies too much."
  <br>
  <br>
  While the average waiting time for public housing units is 5.5 years, Sze said that did not include non-elderly one-person applicants who often have to wait for more than 10 years before being assigned a flat.
  <br>
  <br>
  A 57-year-old man surnamed Suen, who rents a cubicle apartment, said he has been on the waiting list for 16 years.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Four years ago I was 20 points short [on the points system] to be allocated a flat, two years ago I was still 20 points short, and recently I still find myself missing 20 points. How long do I still have to live in this apartment?" he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "No government subsidies are available, and we have to wait longer for public housing, and we are also not eligible to apply for Light Public Housing," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  SoCo also called on the government to include non-elderly one-person applicants in a cash allowance scheme for those who have been on the public housing waiting list for at least three years.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Government departments and public organisations should take the lead in cutting cost and increasing revenue in light of a budget deficit, the director of audit said.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a TVB programme, Nelson Lam noted there is less corruption in the public sector these days, and government workers are being more careful with spending.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lam said the Audit Commission will therefore focus more on public organisations and funds going forward, especially when it comes to big projects involving a lot of public money.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have been looking at whether spending is economical or not. In fact, we will pay more attention to larger expenditures and those involving more public funds," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the Nano and Advanced Materials Institute, under the Innovation and Technology Commission, bearing the cost of the allowance beyond the permitted amount incurred in some business trips as revealed by the latest audit report, Lam said that affected the government's overall expenditure and image.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For us, it's quite surprising. I find it strange why people still make these kinds of mistakes. But I want to emphasise one thing – I hope all public servants understand that when you work in public service, it should be for the public good, not for personal gain," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lam also said future audit work may require cross-border data sharing because of greater cooperation between Hong Kong and Guangdong, including the expansion of elderly healthcare vouchers to mainland cities.

    'Stranded whale might be hurt before entering HK'

<div class="itemFullText">
 An injured whale that died after being stranded in Tai O might have been hurt or fallen sick before entering Hong Kong waters, a marine conservationist said on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Taison Chang, chairman of the Hong Kong Dolphin Conservation Society, believed it could be a rare Longman's beaked whale.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Even before the whale entered Hong Kong waters, it could be sick and got lost, that's why it's found in Hong Kong waters. It's very possible that the whale had some kind of disease or got injured by other reasons," he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department had activated a response plan to rescue the whale after it was sighted in the waters near Tai O on Saturday evening.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When we saw the animal near the evening time in Hong Kong, the animal was already very weak and did not behave normally," Chang said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities said the whale, with a wound on its body, was found to be extremely weak during sedation administered for further diagnosis, and it subsequently died in the early hours of Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chang also said the conditions were unfavourable for the stranded cetacean to leave.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When the residents in Tai O first saw this animal, the tide was very low. That's why when we saw a lot of photos or videos online, the animal was mostly stranded almost on the sand or on land already.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It made the situation very difficult for the animal, even if the animal had the ability to swim," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  A necropsy will be carried out on Sunday to determine the cause of death.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan said the resumption of multi-entry permits for Shenzhen residents visiting Hong Kong will boost the local tourism, retail and catering industries.
 <br>
  <br>
  From Sunday, more than 10 million people in Shenzhen will be allowed to visit the SAR as many times as they like, reversing a policy that limited such trips to once per week.
  <br>
  <br>
  Writing on his weekly blog, Chan said the move will make it easier for people to travel and strengthen economic ties between Hong Kong and Shenzhen.
  <br>
  <br>
  A series of measures by the central government to support the SAR's tourism and efforts by local shops and restaurants to improve their services will boost the Hong Kong economy, Chan added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong's economy has shown moderate overall growth this year, but consumption and export of services still need further improvement," he wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  The finance chief also noted that the new three-runway system at the airport and plans to increase international destinations will consolidate the city's position as an international aviation hub.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Macau's chief executive-elect Sam Hou-fai has pledged to work with Hong Kong in leveraging the advantages of the two SARs to foster development.
 <br>
  <br>
  "On whether we and Hong Kong could complement each other's strengths and foster mutual development, I think there's huge potential in this," Sam said in a press conference on Sunday flanked by his incoming cabinet.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said he will meet with Chief Executive John Lee after he assumes office on December 20.
  <br>
  <br>
  "After I take office, I'll talk to Chief Executive John Lee about how the two SARs can – on each side of the Pearl River and under our common constitutional and political system – fully leverage our respective advantages to foster development.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We'll also look at how we can leverage our strengths and seek opportunities, while integrating into the nation's development, as we strive for achievements for both SARs."
  <br>
  <br>
  Sam and his governing team met the media a day after Beijing approved his nominations and appointed principal officials for the new term of the Macau government.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The formation of this government's principal officials and prosecutor-general embodies the spirit of 'upholding fundamental principles and breaking new ground', which completely aligns with the requirements I set out for principal officials," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The incoming Macau leader added his government will respond to issues the public is most concerned about, and work on key tasks relating to the city's long-term development.

    'Obstruction' blocking pact on plastic pollution

<img alt="Environmentalists have demanded stronger commitments to fight plastic waste at the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee in Busan. File photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1781577_1_20241201094724.jpg&q=40">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 France on Sunday accused a handful of countries of obstructing negotiations in South Korea to reach the world's first treaty to curb plastic pollution.
 <br>
  <br>
  "We also are worried by the continuing obstruction by the so-called like-minded countries," Olga Givernet, France's minister delegate for energy, told reporters, referring to a group of mostly oil-producing nations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nearly 200 countries are in the port city of Busan for negotiations on a deal to curb plastic pollution, with only a few hours left on the clock.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Finding an agreement for us on (an) ambitious treaty that reduces plastic pollution remains an absolute priority for France," Givernet said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are planning on pushing it, pushing it again."
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 90 percent of plastic is not recycled, while plastic production is expected to triple by 2060.
  <br>
  <br>
  Efforts to reach the landmark agreement have been locked over several key sticking points, particularly reducing production and phasing out chemicals believed or known to harm human health.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 100 countries back those measures and insist a treaty without them will fail to solve the pollution crisis.
  <br>
  <br>
  But around a dozen nations -- mostly producers of plastic precursors derived from fossil fuels -- are strongly opposed.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We still have a few hours left in these negotiations, there is time to find common ground, but Rwanda cannot accept a toothless treaty," said Juliet Kabera, director general of the Rwanda Environment Management Authority.
  <br>
  <br>
  The latest draft text remains full of opposing views and contradictory language, and a promised new version after long hours of negotiations into Saturday night has not yet been published.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will continue to fight for an ambitious outcome in Busan," Givernet said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have still a few hours to discuss and make contributions and be certain that our determination (is) to carry on with the negotiation process until the last hour." (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Arsenal thrashed West Ham 5-2 on Saturday to climb up to second in the Premier League, while Justin Kluivert scored the first ever Premier League hat-trick of penalties in Bournemouth's 4-2 win at Wolves.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Gunners have struck 13 goals in a week to refind their form and cut the gap to runaway leaders Liverpool, who host struggling defending champions Manchester City in Sunday's blockbuster clash, to six points.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are back to our best form. We look fluid and dynamic we are all enjoying football right now," said Bukayo Saka, who shone with a goal and two assists.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It has been a top week for us. We have built a lot of momentum and we want to go on to the next few games."
  <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal scored four times before the break in a 6-0 rout at the London Stadium last season and went one better this time as all the goals came in a manic first half,
  <br>
  <br>
  Gabriel Magalhaes' threat from set-pieces is well-known but the Brazilian was inexplicably not picked up to head in Saka's corner on 10 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Saka then teed up Leandro Trossard to double the lead before he stepped aside for Martin Odegaard to score Arsenal's third from the penalty spot.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kai Havertz slotted in from Trossard's pass to make 4-0 after just 36 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another heavy home defeat increased the pressure on West Ham boss Julen Lopetegui.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hammers flickered into life with two goals in two minutes through Aaron Wan-Bissaka and a brilliant Emerson Palmieri free-kick.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Saka restored the three-goal advantage from the spot after Gabriel was felled from another corner.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kluivert made history at Molineux to curtail Wolves' mini-revival.
  <br>
  <br>
  There were three goals inside eight minutes as the Dutchman opened the scoring, Jorgen Strand Larsen replied for Wolves before Milos Kerkez made it 2-1 for the visitors.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kluivert made it 3-1 just 10 minutes later and completed his hat-trick 16 minutes from time after Evanilson also set a record by winning a third penalty.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I was not completely sure I should allow him to take the third one," said Bournemouth boss Andoni Iraola.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is difficult, every time you shoot the first one, you give information to the keeper."
  <br>
  <br>
  Strand Larsen pulled another goal back for Wolves, but Gary O'Neil's men slip back into the relegation zone.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brentford continued their stunning home form to thrash Leicester 4-1 in front of the Foxes' in-coming manager Ruud van Nistelrooy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Facundo Buonanotte had put the visitors in front in west London.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Brentford roared back to make it six wins and one draw from seven home league games this season -- the best points return in the Premier League.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoane Wissa started the comeback before Schade took centre stage.
  <br>
  <br>
  The German had only scored two Premier League goals since joining the Bees in 2023 but matched that tally before half-time to put the home side in front.
  <br>
  <br>
  Schade then rounded off the scoring to show Van Nistelrooy the scale of the task that awaits him ahead of his first game in charge at home to West Ham on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The shining star today was Kevin Schade," said Brentford manager Thomas Frank.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I celebrated so much his first because I know how hard it's been for him because he's had so many injuries and he's wanting to play in the team.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chris Wood's emphatically struck penalty was enough to get Forest back to winning ways and leave Ipswich still in the bottom three.
  <br>
  <br>
  Crystal Palace edged out of the relegation zone on goal difference thanks to late drama in a 1-1 draw against Newcastle.
  <br>
  <br>
  Marc Guehi, who had been the subject of multiple bids from Newcastle during the transfer window, put the Magpies in front early in the second half with an own goal.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the England defender redeemed himself as from his cross Daniel Munoz powered home a header at the back post. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A stranded whale has died near Tai O despite efforts by a team of veterinarians to help it.
 <br>
  <br>
  A spokesman for the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) said on Sunday that veterinarians from Ocean Park had carried out an initial assessment and found that the whale was injured.
  <br>
  <br>
  "During sedation administered for further diagnosis, the veterinarians found the whale in extremely weak condition," the spokesman said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the whale subsequently died during the diagnostic procedures at around midnight.
  <br>
  <br>
  The spokesman added that AFCD staff and Ocean Park vets will examine the carcass to determine the cause of death.

 Gaza's civil defence agency said three aid workers were killed in an Israeli air strike in the Hamas-run territory on Saturday but the Israeli army said it killed a "terrorist."
 <br>
  <br>
  The agency said the aid workers killed were Palestinian employees of World Central Kitchen (WCK). The US aid group did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

  The Israeli army said it had "struck a vehicle with a terrorist that took part in the murderous October 7 massacre," referring to the militant group Hamas's unprecedented attack on Israel last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The claim that the terrorist was simultaneously a WCK worker is being examined," it added in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Civil defence agency spokesman Mahmud Bassal said the bodies of "at least five dead were transported (to hospital), including (those of) the three employees of World Central Kitchen."
  <br>
  <br>
  "All three men worked for WCK and they were hit while driving in a WCK jeep in Khan Younis," Bassal said, adding that the vehicle had been "marked with its logo clearly visible."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Israeli army insisted its strike in the main southern city hit "a civilian unmarked vehicle and its movement on the route was not coordinated for transporting of aid."
  <br>
  <br>
  In April, an Israeli air strike killed seven WCK staff – an Australian, three Britons, a North American, a Palestinian and a Pole.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel said it had been targeting a "Hamas gunman" in that strike but the military admitted a series of "grave mistakes" and violations of its own rules of engagement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The October 2023 attack resulted in the deaths of 1,207 people, most of them civilians, according to a tally of Israeli official figures.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel's retaliatory military offensive has killed 44,382 people in Gaza, according to figures from the territory's health ministry which the United Nations considers reliable. (AFP)

    Saudi Arabia all but certain to host 2034 World Cup

<img alt="Saudi Arabia is planning massive sports infrastructure projects if its bid is successful. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1781554_1_20241130214244.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Saudi Arabia's bid to host the 2034 World Cup was considered "medium risk" for human rights by Fifa in its evaluation report, which said implementing reforms could take "significant time and effort."
 <br>
  <br>
  The release of the report on Saturday comes ahead of the Fifa Congress on December 11, when a vote will be held to select the hosts for the 2030 and 2034 World Cups.
  <br>
  <br>
  Saudi Arabia is the lone candidate for 2034 while Morocco, Spain and Portugal have formed a joint bid for the 2030 tournament, with Uruguay, Argentina and Paraguay all set to host a match as part of the centenary edition.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Saudi bid "presents a very strong all-round proposition, reflected in the results of the technical evaluation, which assesses the proposed infrastructure (both sporting and general) as well as its commercial potential," Fifa said in its report.
  <br>
  <br>
  But football's world governing body cautioned, "in terms of human rights, the undertaking involved in implementing the various measures... particularly in certain areas, could involve significant effort and time."
  <br>
  <br>
  Fifa said that was the basis for the elevated risk rating for a bid that received an average score of 4.2 out of 5 – higher than the combined bid by the United States, Canada and Mexico for the 2026 World Cup.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is important to note that the bid involves significant opportunities for positive human rights impact," added Fifa.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There is good potential that the tournament could serve as a catalyst for some of the ongoing and future reforms and contribute to positive human rights outcomes for people in Saudi Arabia and the region that go beyond the scope of the tournament itself."
  <br>
  <br>
  Saudi Arabia has yet to build several proposed stadiums for a tournament that could be held in winter, as was the case in Qatar.
  <br>
  <br>
  Human rights, a source of deep controversy at the 2022 World Cup in neighbouring Qatar, threatens to become a major talking point once again in the run-up to 2034.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rights groups highlight mass executions in Saudi Arabia and allegations of torture, as well as restrictions on women under the conservative country's male guardianship system.
  <br>
  <br>
  Free expression is severely restricted, with some people handed lengthy jail terms over critical posts on social media.
  <br>
  <br>
  Saudi Arabia, which is hosting several high-profile events including Formula One and the WTA Finals tennis, is often accused of "sportswashing" – using sport to divert attention from its rights record. (AFP)

    Serbia denies involvement in Kosovo canal blast

<img alt="Kosovo police guard the site of Friday's explosion. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1781556_1_20241130215305.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Kosovo stepped up security measures around "critical" infrastructure on Saturday after an explosion at a key canal feeding two of its main power plants, as neighbouring Serbia rejected accusations it had staged the blast.
 <br>
  <br>
  The explosion occurred on Friday near the town of Zubin Potok in a Serb-dominated area in Kosovo's troubled north, damaging the canal supplying water to cooling systems at two coal-fired power plants that generate most of Kosovo's electricity.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prime Minister Albin Kurti called a security meeting late on Friday, saying: "This is a criminal and terrorist attack aimed at damaging our critical infrastructure."
  <br>
  <br>
  "The attack was carried out by professionals. We believe it comes from gangs directed by Serbia," he added without providing any evidence.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government later issued a statement echoing his allegations, saying that "initial indications suggest" the explosion had been "orchestrated by the Serbian state, which has the capacity to carry out such a criminal and terrorist attack."
  <br>
  <br>
  Kosovo also "approved additional measures to strengthen security around essential infrastructure and services, such as bridges, transformers" and other sites, it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Serbia slapped back on Saturday, condemning the attack, while calling the accusation "premature" and "baseless."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Such destructive actions are unacceptable and threaten the fragile stability we are striving to maintain," Serbian Foreign Minister Marko Djuric said on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Serbia unequivocally demands responsibility for the perpetrators of this reckless attack," he added, while suggesting the Kosovar "regime" could be behind the blast and calling for an internationally-led investigation.
  <br>
  <br>
  The main political party representing Serbs in Kosovo, Serb List, also condemned the attack "in the strongest possible terms."
  <br>
  <br>
  Pictures from the scene published by local media showed water leaking heavily from one side of the reinforced canal, which runs from the Serb-majority north of Kosovo to the capital Pristina and also supplies drinking water.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, electricity supplies to consumers were running smoothly on Saturday morning, with authorities having found an alternative method for cooling the plants, Kosovo's Economy Minister Artane Rizvanolli said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Repair work was ongoing, authorities said. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 South Africa had to overcome determined resistance from Sri Lanka's batsmen before winning the first Test by 233 runs at Kingsmead on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Set a massive 516 runs to win, Sri Lanka were bowled out for 282.
  <br>
  <br>
  Left-arm fast bowler Marco Jansen, the destroyer in Sri Lanka's record-low first innings of 42, took four for 73 to finish with match figures of 11 for 86.
  <br>
  <br>
  In contrast to the first innings, the tourists made the South Africans work for their wickets on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dinesh Chandimal (83) and captain Dhananjaya de Silva (59) put on 95 for the sixth wicket and kept South Africa in the field for most of the morning after resuming at 101 for five.
  <br>
  <br>
  The breakthrough for South Africa came when De Silva chipped a catch to midwicket off left-arm spinner Keshav Maharaj.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kusal Mendis made an attacking 48 before he became Jansen's 10th victim of the match, caught behind by Kyle Verreynne.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chandimal and De Silva took advantage of the best batting conditions of the match against bowlers who were not as effective as they had been when the ball was shiny and new.
  <br>
  <br>
  South Africa were also without all-rounder Wiaan Mulder, who was ruled out of the rest of the series with a broken finger.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chandimal, who was 29 not out overnight, continued to defy the bowlers on the ground where he marked his Test debut with two half-centuries 13 years ago. He made his 83 off 174 balls before being caught and bowled by Gerald Coetzee. (AFP)

    Greenpeace activists board tanker in plastic protest

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Greenpeace activists boarded a tanker off South Korea on Saturday in an action intended to draw attention to calls for a treaty to curb plastic pollution, the environmental group said.
 <br>
  <br>
  Nearly 200 countries are in Busan to negotiate the deal, but there is little sign of agreement with just a day left before talks are due to end.
  <br>
  <br>
  Greenpeace said the tanker Buena Alba, anchored off the Hanwha TotalEnergies complex, was scheduled to pick up propylene, which is used to manufacture plastic.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The activists boarded the vessel peacefully and met no reaction from the vessel crew," said Greenpeace spokeswoman Angelica Pago.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We painted 'PLASTIC KILLS' on the side of the vessel and the climbers successfully set up a camp," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They intend to stay in order to continue putting pressure on the negotiators to resist fossil fuel and petrochemical industry interference in the talks and to deliver a treaty that firmly cuts plastic production."
  <br>
  <br>
  A spokesman for South Korea's coast guard said police had been "deployed on the ship, and we are making warning announcements to facilitate a safe disembarkation."
  <br>
  <br>
  He said a "thorough investigation" would be carried out to determine if there were any "illegal elements" to the protest.
  <br>
  <br>
  Attempts to reach an agreement on curbing plastic pollution have stalled over several key sticking points, including whether to cut new plastic production.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dozens of countries, backed by environmental groups, insist a treaty without production cuts will fail to solve the problem, but a group of largely oil-producing states is fiercely opposed.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The brave activists that boarded that vessel today show the courage and should inspire governments here to hold the line and do what everyone knows is obvious," Greenpeace delegation head Graham Forbes told reporters in Busan.
  <br>
  <br>
  The negotiations have reached a "pivotal moment," he said, but "a handful of governments... are looking backwards and refusing to take the steps necessary for us all to advance."
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think we are at a very risky moment right now of being sold out, and that would be an absolute catastrophe," Forbes said. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Sri Lanka's consumer prices fell by 2.1 percent in November, the highest deflation rate recorded by the economically fragile island nation since 1961, official data showed on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  An unprecedented financial crash in 2022 brought months of consumer goods shortages, with inflation peaking at nearly 70 percent that year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since then, a US$2.9 billion bailout loan from the International Monetary Fund, tax hikes and other austerity measures have slowly made headway in repairing the island's economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Headline inflation will remain negative in the next few months, deeper than previously projected, mainly due to larger downward adjustments in energy prices and reduction in volatile food prices," Sri Lanka's central bank said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bank said inflation was likely to return to its target level of five percent in the coming months.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sri Lanka had already seen deflation of 0.8 percent in October and 0.5 percent in September.
  <br>
  <br>
  President Anura Kumara Dissanayake, who was elected in September, has vowed to maintain the IMF bailout programme negotiated by his predecessor that includes higher taxes and cuts to state spending. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Georgia on Saturday said 107 people were arrested during a second day of protests sparked by the government's decision to delay European Union membership talks amid a post-election crisis.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Black Sea nation has been rocked by turmoil since the ruling Georgian Dream party claimed victory in an October 26 parliamentary election that the pro-EU opposition said was fraudulent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The interior ministry said 107 people were detained for "disobedience to lawful police orders and petty hooliganism."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Throughout the night... protesters threw various objects, including stones, pyrotechnics, glass bottles, and metal items, at law enforcement officers," it said, adding that "10 employees of the Ministry of Internal Affairs were injured."
  <br>
  <br>
  The ministry had said that 32 police officers were wounded and 43 protestors detained on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze's statement on Thursday that Georgia will not seek to open accession talks with the European Union until 2028 ignited a furious reaction from the opposition and two days of protests.
  <br>
  <br>
  He later accused the opposition and the EU ambassador to Georgia of distorting his words, and insisted membership in the bloc "by 2030" remains his "top priority."
  <br>
  <br>
  On Friday, riot police fired water cannons and tear gas at pro-EU protesters gathered outside the parliament in Tbilisi, who tossed eggs and fireworks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Clashes broke out later between protesters and police, who moved in to clear the area outside parliament, beating demonstrators, some of whom threw objects.
  <br>
  <br>
  Independent TV station Pirveli said one of its journalists was hospitalised with serious injuries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Protests were also held in other cities across Georgia on Friday, independent TV station Mtavari reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pro-Western opposition parties are boycotting the new parliament, while President Salome Zurabishvili has sought to annul the election results through the country's constitutional court.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a televised address to the nation on Friday evening, the pro-Western president – at loggerheads with the ruling party – said: "The resistance movement has begun... I stand in solidarity with it."
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will remain united until Georgia achieves its goals: to return to its European path, secure new elections."
  <br>
  <br>
  After the October vote, a group of Georgia's leading election monitors said they had evidence of a complex scheme of large-scale electoral fraud. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Sectarian feuding in northwest Pakistan killed 13 more people, a local government official said on Saturday, as warring Sunnis and Shi'ites defied repeated ceasefire orders, bringing the total death toll in a recent spasm of violence to 124.
 <br>
  <br>
  Pakistan is a Sunni-majority country, but Kurram district – in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, near the border with Afghanistan – has a large Shi'ite population and the communities have clashed for decades.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fresh fighting broke out last Thursday when two separate convoys of Shi'ite Muslims travelling under police escort were ambushed, killing more than 40.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since then 10 days of fighting with light and heavy weapons has brought the region to a standstill, with major roads closed and mobile phone services cut as the death toll surged.
  <br>
  <br>
  A Kurram local government official put the death toll at 124 on Saturday after 13 more people were killed in the past two days.

  <br>
  Two were Sunni and 11 Shi'ite, he said, whilst more than 50 people have been wounded in fresh fighting which continued on Saturday morning.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There is a severe lack of trust between the two sides, and neither tribe is willing to comply with government orders to cease hostilities," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Police report that many people want to flee the area due to the violence, but the deteriorating security situation makes it impossible," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  A seven-day ceasefire deal was announced by the provincial government last weekend but failed to hold. Another 10-day truce was brokered on Wednesday but it also failed to stymie the fighting.
  <br>
  <br>
  A senior security official in the provincial capital of Peshawar, also speaking anonymously, confirmed the total death toll of 124.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There is a fear of more fatalities," he said. "None of the provincial government's initiated measures have been fully implemented to restore peace."
  <br>
  <br>
  Police have regularly struggled to control violence in Kurram, which was part of the semi-autonomous Federally Administered Tribal Areas until it was merged with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in 2018.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan said 79 people had been killed in the region between July and October in sectarian clashes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The feuding is generally rekindled by disputes over land in the rugged mountainous region, and fuelled by underlying tensions between the communities adhering to different sects of Islam. (AFP)

 The State Council on Saturday appointed principal officials for the new term of the Macau government, who are due to take office on December 20.

  Among the five secretaries of the current term of government, two were reappointed - the Secretary for Administration and Justice Cheong Weng-chon and the Secretary for Security Wong Sio-chak.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tai Kin-ip will serve as the Secretary for Economy and Finance, O Lam will serve as the Secretary for Social Affairs and Culture, and Tam Wai Man will serve as the Secretary for Transport and Public Works.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 More than 122,000 people have been forced out of their homes as massive floods caused by relentless rains swept through Malaysia's northern states, disaster officials said on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The number surpassed the 118,000 displaced during one of the country's worst floodings in 2014, and disaster officials feared it could rise further as there was no let-up in the torrential downpours.
  <br>
  <br>
  The death toll remained at four recorded across Kelantan, Terengganu and Sarawak.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kelantan state bore the brunt of the flooding, accounting for 63 percent of the 122,631 people displaced, according to data from the National Disaster Management Agency.
  <br>
  <br>
  There were nearly 35,000 people evacuated in Terengganu, with the rest of the displacements reported from seven other states.
  <br>
  <br>
  Heavy rains, which began early this week, continued to hammer Pasir Puteh town in Kelantan, where people could be seen walking through streets inundated with hip-deep waters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "My area has been flooded since Wednesday. The water has already reached my house corridor and is just two inches away from coming inside," said Pasir Puteh resident and school janitor Zamrah Majid.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Luckily, I moved my two cars to higher ground before the water level rose."
  <br>
  <br>
  She said she allowed her grandchildren to play in the water in front of her house because it was still shallow.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But if the water gets higher, it would be dangerous, I'm afraid they might get swept away," she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I haven't received any assistance yet, whether it's welfare or other kinds of help."
  <br>
  <br>
  Muhammad Zulkarnain, 27, who is living with his parents in Pasir Puteh, said they were isolated.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There's no way in or out of for any vehicles to enter my neighbourhood," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Of course I'm scared... Luckily we have received some assistance from NGOs, they gave us food supplies like biscuits, instant noodles, and eggs."
  <br>
  <br>
  Thousands of emergency services personnel have been deployed in flood-prone states along with rescue boats, four-wheel-drive vehicles and helicopters, said Deputy Prime Minister Ahmad Zahid Hamidi, who chairs the National Disaster Management Committee. (AFP)

    Syria war monitor says rebels control 'most of' Aleppo

<img alt="Jihadist fighters keep warm in front of the landmark Aleppo citadel. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1781535_1_20241130161818.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A monitor of Syria's war said on Saturday that jihadist rebels now control a majority of Aleppo city, reporting Russian air strikes on parts of Syria's second city for the first time since 2016.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) and allied factions... took control of most of the city and government centres and prisons," said the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, referring to a jihadist alliance led by Al-Qaeda's former Syria branch.
  <br>
  <br>
  Syrian jihadist rebels have pressed a lightning offensive against forces of the Iranian- and Russian-backed Syrian government since Wednesday, the same day a fragile ceasefire took effect in neighbouring Lebanon between Israel and Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah after two months of all-out war.
  <br>
  <br>
  Overnight, Russian "warplanes launched raids on areas of Aleppo city for the first time since 2016," added the Britain-based Observatory, which relies on a network of sources inside Syria.
  <br>
  <br>
  It raised the death toll in days of clashes to 311 – 183 from HTS and allied Turkish-backed factions, 100 soldiers and pro-government forces, as well as 28 civilians.
  <br>
  <br>
  State media reported that four civilians were killed when HTS shelled a student residence in Aleppo.
  <br>
  <br>
  Iran-backed militias have a heavy presence in the Aleppo region after providing crucial ground support when the Syrian army – backed by Russian air power – recaptured rebel-held areas of the city in 2016.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Observatory said that "the governor of Aleppo and the police and security branch commanders withdrew from the city centre."
  <br>
  <br>
  The overnight air strikes coincided with "the arrival of large (rebel) military reinforcements" to the area, the Observatory added. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau announced on Saturday that starting from next year, the Mega Arts and Cultural Events Fund will adopt a fixed operation cycle to accept applications thrice annually.
 <br>
  <br>
  This comes as the authority unveiled the enhancement to the fund's operation to boost the sector's development more effectively, as well as promote tourism,
  <br>
  <br>
  A matching grant will be rolled out to encourage organisers to seek commercial funding.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government will also assess the effectiveness of events based on one more criterion - its integration with tourism.
  <br>
  <br>
  Applicants also need to ensure that events can boost tourism and the economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  The authority will provide funding for a maximum of four events each round, and it aims to support at most 10 projects each year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The fund was set up back in April last year. It has so far sponsored 20 large-scale arts and cultural events.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A sports professor at the Hong Kong Baptist University on Saturday said now is the best time for Hong Kong to develop sports as an industry and that promoting sports arbitration would be crucial.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chief Executive John Lee mentioned in his Policy Address that the government will look into establishing a sports dispute resolution system and promoting sports arbitration.
  <br>
  <br>
  Patrick Lau from the university's Department of Sport, Physical Education and Health said Hong Kong athletes had some great achievements at international events recently.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the city's sports sector had experienced controversial issues, relating to athlete selection mechanisms, sports associations making use of government funds, and compensation for sports injuries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lau urged the government to do more promotion on sports and legal knowledge.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Although other regions in Asia have set up institutions for sports arbitration, Hong Kong has advantages in internationalisation and its legal talents," he told an RTHK radio programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Together with mature infrastructures and financial supporting facilities, I believe Hong Kong can finish strong and become an important place in Asia for sports arbitration."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lau said the SAR government lacks systematic planning for sports development, and he urged the authorities to set up long-term plans every five years.

<img alt="De'Andre Hunter led the way for Atlanta, who had six players score in double figures. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1781525_1_20241130150617.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 De'Andre Hunter scored 23 points off the bench as the Atlanta Hawks beat league-leading Cleveland again on Friday to advance in the NBA Cup.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Hawks, who handed the Cavs their first home defeat of the season on Wednesday, came out on top at home, parlaying a 52-50 halftime lead into a 117-101 triumph.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was enough to put Atlanta into the NBA Cup knockout rounds as winner of their group after the Boston Celtics beat the Bulls 138-129 in Chicago.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trae Young scored 21 points and handed out 11 assists and Jalen Johnson chipped in 20 points for Atlanta, who had six players score in double figures.
  <br>
  <br>
  Darius Garland scored 29 points for Cleveland and Evan Mobley added 24 points for the Cavs, who opened the season on a 15-0 tear and at 17-3 still boast the best record in the league.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hawks held Cavs star Donovan Mitchell to 12 points and out-scored Cleveland 39-23 in the third quarter to take control for good in the contest that was one of 10 NBA Cup group stage games scheduled on the Thanksgiving holiday on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They outplayed us," Cleveland coach Kenny Atkinson said after the Cavaliers were held to their lowest points total of the season. "Sometimes you just have to call it like you see it."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Los Angeles Lakers, who won the inaugural edition of the Cup last season, were essentially eliminated from the in-season tournament after falling 101-93 to the Oklahoma City Thunder.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shai Gilgeous-Alexander scored 15 of his 36 points in the fourth quarter for Oklahoma City, draining a three-pointer that put the Thunder up 95-91 with 1:35 remaining.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gilgeous-Alexander added a pair of free throws and Jalen Williams came up with a steal and a dunk as the Thunder kept the Lakers at bay.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dalton Knecht was the Lakers' top scorer with 20 points. Anthony Davis added 15 and LeBron James scored 12 points but produced five of the Lakers' 17 turnovers.
  <br>
  <br>
  The NBA champion Celtics, meanwhile, maintained their wildcard hopes with their win over the Bulls – who came into their game fighting the Hawks for group supremacy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jayson Tatum scored 35 points and pulled down 14 rebounds and reserve Payton Pritchard scored 19 of his 29 points in the fourth quarter to help Boston pull away in a see-saw battle that featured 14 lead changes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jaylen Brown and Kristaps Porzingis scored 21 points apiece for the Celtics while Nikola Vucevic led the Bulls with 32 points and 11 rebounds.
  <br>
  <br>
  The New York Knicks, buoyed by Jalen Brunson's fourth-quarter heroics, improved to 3-0 in Cup play with a 99-98 victory over the Hornets in Charlotte.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hornets challenged despite missing five of their top six scorers, with LaMelo Ball, Miles Bridges, Tre Mann, Grant Williams, Mark Williams and Nick Richards all sidelined.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Outside looking in, you're thinking they've got some key guys out, so this is supposed to be an easy game. That's not how the NBA works," New York's Josh Hart told reporters after the game.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brunson scored 11 of his 31 points in the fourth quarter, draining a pair of free throws with 8.6 seconds left that pushed New York's lead to four points.
  <br>
  <br>
  The win left the Knicks tied atop their group with Orlando, who beat the Brooklyn Nets 123-100. The Knicks and Magic will face off for the group crown on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Franz Wagner scored 29 points with eight rebounds and eight assists to fuel the Magic in their fifth straight win.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kentavious Caldwell-Pope added 19 points for Orlando, who had little trouble with a Nets team missing top-scorer Dennis Schroder – who was absent for personal reasons – and injured playmaker Cam Thomas.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere, the Minnesota Timberwolves halted their four-game losing streak with a 93-92 victory over the Los Angeles Clippers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Anthony Edwards connected on just seven of 21 shots from the field but led the Timberwolves with 21 points.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I had a terrible game tonight," said Edwards, adding that Minnesota's defence carried the day.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Defensively I think we dominated the game," he said. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Flooding driven by heavy rains in southern Thailand has killed nine people and displaced more than 13,000, officials said on Saturday, as rescue teams using boats and jet skis worked to reach stranded residents.
 <br>
  <br>
  Local media footage showed residents wading through murky, chest-deep water and cars submerged in flooded streets.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Flooding across eight provinces in southern Thailand has affected 553,921 households and claimed nine lives, prompting agencies to mobilise urgent assistance," the country's disaster agency said on its official Facebook page.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 13,000 people had been forced to flee their homes, with temporary shelters set up in schools and temples, it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nampa, a resident of coastal Songkhla province, told state broadcaster Thai PBS she was concerned about the dwindling food supplies.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are doing fine now, but I am not sure how long can we stay in this condition," she said.

  <br>
  Two hospitals in nearby Pattani province suspended operations to prevent floodwaters from damaging medical facilities.
  <br>
  <br>
  In neighbouring north Malaysia, the rains have forced the evacuation of at least 80,000 people to temporary shelters this week, with disaster officials there saying at least four people have been killed.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Thai Meteorological Department has warned that "very heavy rain" could continue to affect some areas of the country's south through next week.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government has deployed rescue teams to assist affected residents and designated 50 million baht (US$1.7 million) in flood relief for each province.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra said on Friday on social media platform X that the goal was to "restore normalcy as quickly as possible."

    British MPs advance contentious assisted dying law

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 UK lawmakers voted on Friday in favour of assisted dying for terminally ill people in England and Wales, advancing the emotive and contentious legislation to the next stage of parliamentary scrutiny.
 <br>
  <br>
  MPs voted by 330 to 275 in support of legalised euthanasia in the first vote on the issue in the House of Commons for nearly a decade.
  <br>
  <br>
  The result came following an emotionally-charged debate that lasted almost five hours in a packed and hushed chamber, and as competing protesters made their voices heard outside parliament.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill now progresses to the committee stage where lawmakers can table amendments, a process likely to be vexed.
  <br>
  <br>
  The legislation would then face further votes in the Commons and House of Lords upper chamber. The process will likely take months and if it is ultimately passed then a change in the law is expected to be several years away.
  <br>
  <br>
  The House of Commons last debated, and defeated, a euthanasia bill in 2015, but public support for giving terminally ill people the choice to end their lives has since shifted in favour, polls show.
  <br>
  <br>
  A change in the law would see Britain emulate several other countries in Europe and elsewhere that allow some form of assisted dying.
  <br>
  <br>
  Labour MP Kim Leadbeater, who is behind the bill, told the debate that changing the law would give terminally ill people "choice, autonomy and dignity at the end of their lives."
  <br>
  <br>
  Advocates also argue that it would make some deaths less painful.
  <br>
  <br>
  But other MPs expressed concern that people might feel coerced into opting for euthanasia, while some said they were worried it would discriminate against people with disabilities.
  <br>
  <br>
  Opponents also worry that the healthcare system is not ready for such a landmark change and that it could cause a decline in investment for palliative care.
  <br>
  <br>
  "True dignity consists in being cared for to the end," Conservative MP Danny Kruger said, urging colleagues to reject a "state suicide service."
  <br>
  <br>
  Outside, dozens of opponents gathered holding signs with "Kill the Bill, not the ill" and "Care not killing," urging MPs to vote against the proposed legislation.
  <br>
  <br>
  A nearby gathering in favour of the legislation saw people dressed in pink holding placards with slogans such as: "My life, my death, my choice."
  <br>
  <br>
  Assisted suicide currently carries a maximum prison sentence of 14 years in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Scotland, which has a separate legal system and devolved powers to set its own health policy, it is not a specific criminal offence. But it can leave a person open to other charges, including murder.
  <br>
  <br>
  Leadbeater's bill would allow assisted suicide in England and Wales for adults with an incurable illness who have a life expectancy of fewer than six months and are able to take the substance that causes their death themselves.
  <br>
  <br>
  Any patient's wish to die would have to be signed off by a judge and two doctors.
  <br>
  <br>
  The measures are stricter than assisted dying laws in other European countries and also proposed legislation being contemplated in France.
  <br>
  <br>
  Consideration is being given to a similar bill in Scotland.
  <br>
  <br>
  Leadbeater's initiative is a so-called private members' bill and is not part of the government's agenda, although it follows Prime Minister Keir Starmer's vow, before winning power in July, to allow parliament to revisit the issue.
  <br>
  <br>
  MPs had a free vote, meaning predicting the outcome was virtually impossible.
  <br>
  <br>
  Starmer, who voted in favour of permitting assisted suicide in 2015 with "robust" safeguards, did not reveal his view in the run-up to the vote.
  <br>
  <br>
  His ministerial team had been instructed to remain neutral but several expressed views, both in support and against.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two polls last week indicated that a majority of Britons back changing the law.
  <br>
  <br>
  Faith leaders are among the stringent opponents, with nearly 30 signing a joint letter last weekend arguing they are "deeply concerned" by the plans. (AFP)

    HK well-prepared for multi-entry travellers: minister

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Secretary for Security, Chris Tang, said on Saturday that staff at border control points are well-prepared to handle a surge in travellers in the wake of Beijing's decision to restore multi-entry visas for Shenzhen residents.
 <br>
  <br>
  The multi-entry visa scheme will resume from Sunday, and the maximum length of each visit will be seven days.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was scrapped in 2015 at the request of the SAR government due to concerns over parallel trading and overcrowding.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a radio programme, Tang said the scheme's resumption is expected to benefit about 10 million people, and the government will ensure that residents will not be affected.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Border control points may be under pressure, but our staff are well-prepared, and they'll minimise leave and they'll open all the counters, to ensure there's enough manpower," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Customs and police officers will step up patrols at places where a lot of people tended to shop in the past... Similar efforts will be made at tourist spots, to ensure that visitors have a good time, while not affecting our residents."
  <br>
  <br>
  Tang said the government had discussions with the mainland authorities on extending the opening hours of control points on New Year's Eve, to ensure travellers could return to the mainland after countdown celebrations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tourism minister Kevin Yeung, meanwhile, echoed Tang's comments and downplayed the likelihood of parallel trading being an issue.
  <br>
  <br>
  He believes the scheme will boost several sectors.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Especially with Christmas around the corner, Hong Kong has more of a Christmas vibe than the mainland, which has attracted lots of teenagers there to come and enjoy the festivities here," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So with all these factors, generally speaking, the scheme will have a very positive effect on visitor numbers and on businesses between Christmas and Lunar New Year."
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeung noted that the catering and retail industries are already poised to provide high-quality service and encourage visitors to open their wallets.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he said the retail sector, in particular, has more work to do on attracting more tourists.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The retail sector, in particular, has to offer things with Hong Kong characteristics. It may not be about the product, but the service they provide has to allow travellers to enjoy a different shopping experience from the one they have on the mainland. These experiences are also important."

    China's PMI rises for second consecutive month

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China's factory activity expanded modestly for a second straight month in November, an official survey showed, adding to a string of recent data suggesting stimulus measures are having an impact on the world's second-largest economy.
 <br>
  <br>
  The National Bureau of Statistics purchasing managers' index (PMI) on Saturday rose to 50.3 - a seven-month high - from 50.1 in October, above the 50-mark separating growth from contraction and beating a median forecast of 50.2 in a Reuters poll.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two months of positive PMI readings suggest the stimulus announcements are improving sentiment on factory floors.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The economy stabilized recently as fiscal and monetary policies eased after the Politburo meeting on September 26. But the outlook for 2025 remains unclear," said Zhang Zhiwei, president and chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management.
  <br>
  <br>
  The PMI report showed total new orders expanded for the first time in seven months in November, while new export orders contracted for the seventh consecutive month.
  <br>
  <br>
  The PMI index continued to rise in November, indicating more obvious signs of recovery at the bottom of the economy. The effect of policies in boosting business confidence is becoming stronger," said Zhang Liqun, an analyst at the China Logistics Information Center.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, "insufficient demand is still a major constraint on enterprise production activities," said Zhang. "It is necessary especially to strengthen the effective driving of government public investment on enterprise orders."
  <br>
  <br>
  The non-manufacturing PMI, which includes construction and services, fell to 50.0 this month, after it rose to 50.2 in October. Activity in the services sector expanded modestly for a second month in a row.
  <br>
  <br>
  The private sector Caixin factory survey will be released on Monday and analysts expect its reading to edge up to 50.5.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier this month, China unveiled a 10 trillion yuan debt package to ease municipal financing strains. That followed China's central bank in September introducing its biggest stimulus since the pandemic to pull the economy back towards the governments growth target of around 5 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  China's official November composite PMI, which includes both manufacturing and services activity, remained at 50.8 in November. (Reuters)

    VAR breaks Southampton hearts in Brighton

<img alt="Southampton's Flynn Downes celebrates scoring the visitors' first goal against Brighton. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1781500_1_20241130095714.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Southampton were denied victory by a controversial VAR decision in a 1-1 draw at high-flying Brighton on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Flynn Downes had just cancelled out Kaoru Mitoma's opener for Brighton when Cameron Archer thought he had put the Saints 2-1 up.
  <br>
  <br>
  A VAR check of more than four minutes eventually decided Archer was onside but penalised Adam Armstrong, who was offside but did not touch the ball, for interfering with play.
  <br>
  <br>
  Southampton had to settle for a first away point of the season as a result and remain bottom of the table, four points adrift of safety.
  <br>
  <br>
  A point was enough to lift Brighton up to second on alphabetical order ahead of Manchester City, who face leaders Liverpool in the pick of the weekend's action on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brighton were left to rue not making more of a dominant first-half display.
  <br>
  <br>
  Georginio Rutter hit the post and fired another effort wide, while Mitoma wasted a huge chance in the opening stages.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brighton's pressure finally paid off on the half hour mark when Mitoma stooped to head in Tariq Lamptey's cross.
  <br>
  <br>
  Southampton levelled 13 minutes into the second half with the impressive Tyler Dibling the architect.
  <br>
  <br>
  The teenager's square ball teed up Armstrong, whose shot was blocked, but the loose ball found its way to Downes, who hammered home first time from the edge of the area.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eight minutes later Dibling wriggled clear of three Brighton players inside his own half and then spread the ball to Fraser.
  <br>
  <br>
  His low cross evaded Armstrong and was finished at the far post by Archer - only to be chalked off to the dismay of boss Russell Martin.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm fed up talking about decisions," said Martin.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We were told it affects Bart Verbruggen ability (to play the ball) and if Adam's run moved Verbruggen from his position then I would understand the decision, but he hasn't moved.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I cannot see how it has affected the goalkeeper."
  <br>
  <br>
  The VAR delay led to 13 minutes of added time and Brighton nearly snatched victory at the death.
  <br>

<div class="itemFullText">
 US markets ended a holiday-shortened session higher as the US Black Friday shopping spree gathered steam and traders speculated whether President-elect Donald Trump may back off from his threatened tariffs.
 <br>
  <br>
  The yen rallied against the US dollar as higher inflation in Japan fueled expectations that the central bank will hike interest rates again.
  <br>
  <br>
  Traders are closing out a rollercoaster month for assets caused largely by Trump winning a second US presidential election -- and also a result of the wars in Ukraine and Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  Markets are tracking developments surrounding Trump's pledge to hammer China, Canada and Mexico with hefty tariffs on his first day in office in January.
  <br>
  <br>
  US stock markets closed higher on a shortened trading day, with the Dow and S&P 500 hitting fresh records following Thursday's Thanksgiving break.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.4 percent to 44,910.65, the S&P 500 closed up 0.6 percent at 6,032.38 and the Nasdaq gained 0.8 percent to 19,218.17.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chip companies notched gains after a news report that President Joe Biden's administration was mulling further curbs on semiconductor equipment sales to China that were less severe than anticipated.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shares in Nvidia closed 2.2 percent up.
  <br>
  <br>
  The market appears to be "cruising along here without any interference," said Patrick O'Hare of Briefing.com.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Paris and Frankfurt stock markets closed higher, and London finished with more modest gains.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With many US investors still out after being off for Thanksgiving yesterday, the key theme that has emerged in the last few days is the easing of tariff fears," said Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at City Index and Forex.com.
  <br>
  <br>
  This came after a phone call between Trump and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, who afterwards said: "There will not be a potential tariff war."
  <br>
  <br>
  The focus was also on shoppers seeking bargains on Black Friday, a crucial day for retailers around the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  O'Hare said Black Friday has become less of a "frenetic rush" given the popularity of online shopping now -- although there is still a lot of attention on the retail space. (AFP)

    Notre Dame unveils its new interior 5 years after fire

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 After more than five years of frenetic reconstruction work, Notre Dame Cathedral showed its new self to the world on Friday, with rebuilt soaring ceilings and creamy good-as-new stonework erasing sombre memories of its devastating fire in 2019.
 <br>
  <br>
  Images broadcast live of a site visit by French President Emmanuel Macron showed the inside of the iconic cathedral as worshippers might have experienced it back in medieval times, its wide, open spaces filled with bright light on a crisp and sunny winter’s day that lit up the vibrant colours of the stained glass windows.
  <br>
  <br>
  Outside, the monument is still a construction site, with scaffolding and cranes. But the renovated interior – shown in its full glory on Friday for the first time before the public is allowed back in on December 8 – proved to be breathtaking.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gone are the gaping holes that the blaze tore into the vaulted ceilings, leaving charred piles of debris. New stonework has been carefully pieced together to repair and fill the wounds that had left the cathedral's insides exposed to the elements. Delicate golden angels look on from the centrepiece of one of the rebuilt ceilings, seeming to fly again above the transept.
  <br>
  <br>
  The cathedral's bright, cream-coloured limestone walls look brand new, cleaned not only of dust from the fire but also of grime that had accumulated for centuries.
  <br>
  <br>
  The cathedral attracted millions of worshippers and visitors annually before the April 15, 2019, fire forced its closure and turned the monument in the heart of Paris into a no-go zone except for artisans, architects and others mobilised for the reconstruction.
  <br>
  <br>
  Macron entered via the cathedral’s giant and intricately carved front doors and stared up at the ceilings in wonder. He was accompanied by his wife, Brigitte, the archbishop of Paris and others.
  <br>
  <br>
  Powerful vacuum cleaners were used to first remove toxic dust released when the fire melted the cathedral's lead roofs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fine layers of latex were then sprayed onto the surfaces and removed a few days later, taking dirt away with them from the stones' pores, nooks and crevices. In all, 42,000 square metres of stonework were cleaned and decontaminated – an area equivalent to roughly six soccer pitches.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It feels like it was built yesterday, like it’s just been born, even though Notre Dame is very old," said stonemason Adrien Willeme, who worked on the reconstruction. "Because it’s been so carefully restored and cleaned, it looks really extraordinary.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Cleaning gels were also used on some walls that had been painted, removing many years of accumulated dirt and revealing their bright colours once again.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carpenters worked by hand like their medieval counterparts as they hewed giant oak beams to rebuild the roof and spire that collapsed like a flaming spear into the inferno. The beams show the marks of the carpenters' handiwork, with dents made on the woodwork by their hand axes.

  Some 2,000 oak trees were felled to rebuild roof frameworks so dense and intricate that they are nicknamed “the forest.”

  Macron's visit kicked off a series of events ushering in the reopening of the 12th-century Gothic masterpiece. At the end of his tour, the president addressed hundreds of workers gathered inside the cathedral and thanked them for their labours on what he called the "building site of the century.”

  <br>
  “The shock of the reopening will, I want to believe, be as powerful as the one of the fire. But it will be a shock of hope,” he said. “The inferno of Notre Dame was a wound for the nation. And you were its remedy."

  Macron will return on December 7 to deliver another address and will attend the consecration of the new altar during a solemn Mass the following day. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police said on Saturday that they've laid a holding charge of murder against a 52-year-old man on suspicion of setting a Tsim Sha Tsui karaoke parlour on fire 27 years ago, leaving 17 people dead.
 <br>
  <br>
  The case will be mentioned at West Kowloon Magistrates' Court on Saturday morning.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officers said they were informed by their mainland counterparts earlier this week that the suspect had been apprehended. The man was sent back to Hong Kong on Thursday through the Shenzhen Bay border.
  <br>
  <br>
  Superintendent Lam Kai-chor from the Organised Crime and Triad Bureau said the force had verified the man's identity through his fingerprints.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The force has evidence to show that the suspect played a major role in the case," he alleged.
  <br>
  <br>
  The hooded suspect was brought back to the scene on Friday night to re-enact the case. He was given a plastic bottle which resembled a Molotov cocktail.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police said Molotov cocktails were thrown at the now-shuttered Top One Karaoke on January 25, 1997, days after two gangs got into a quarrel at the scene.
  <br>
  <br>
  Seventeen people died due to smoke inhalation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Five other culprits have been arrested and sentenced in connection with the case. Four of them have been jailed for life, while another received 11 years for manslaughter.
  <br>
  <br>
  The remaining suspect, Chan Fok-ching, is still on the run. Police said a HK$400,000 reward continues to be offered for information leading to his arrest.

    Halep blasts tennis doping body for Swiatek leniency

<img alt="Simona Halep is angry because Iga Swiatek seems to have been let off lightly for a similar offence. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1781458_1_20241129204705.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Romania's Simona Halep on Friday rounded on the International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA) for discrepencies in the treatment of world number two Iga Swiatek after testing positive for a banned substance.
 <br>
  <br>
  The ITIA announced a one-month ban on Thursday for Swiatek after the 23-year-old had tested positive for the heart medication trimetazidine (TMZ) in an out-of-competition sample in August 2024, when the Polish player was ranked number one in the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  Halep, now 33, returned to tennis in March this year after her own career had been on hold since October 7, 2022, the date of the start of her provisional suspension after testing positive for roxadustat at the US Open.
  <br>
  <br>
  The winner of the 2018 French Open and 2019 Wimbledon singles titles was then caught up in a second affair, this time "irregularities" in the data of her biological passport.
  <br>
  <br>
  She was handed a four-year ban by the ITIA, but Halep successfully appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) in February, arguing her positive test for roxadustat – used to treat anaemia and banned as a blood doping agent – was the result of a tainted supplement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I wonder why there is such a difference in treatment and judgement? I don't find and I don't think there can be a logical answer," Halep said in a long message posted in Romanian on her Instagram account.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It can only be bad will on the part of the ITIA, the organisation that did everything to destroy me despite the evidence. It wanted at all costs to destroy the last years of my career."
  <br>
  <br>
  Halep, now sitting 877th in the world rankings, added: "I suffered, I suffer and I will perhaps always suffer from the injustice that was done to me.
  <br>
  <br>
  "How is it possible that in identical cases taking place at roughly the same time, the ITIA has completely different approaches, to my detriment?
  <br>
  <br>
  "I lost two years of my career, I suffered many sleepless nights, thoughts, anxiety, unanswered questions... but I got justice. It turned out that it was a contamination and that (the anomaly in my) biological passport was pure invention." (AFP)

<img alt="New World Development has appointed a second CEO in a little more than two months. File photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1781463_1_20241129211925.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 New World Development announced on Friday that Chief Executive Officer Eric Ma has resigned with immediate effect, just a little more than two months into the job.
 <br>
  <br>
  Echo Huang, who's the head of the group's property business in mainland China, has been named as his replacement.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a filing to the local bourse, the developer said Ma, who was also the executive director, wished to pursue "other personal commitments".
  <br>
  <br>
  The former development chief took over from scion Adrian Cheng in September, after the company reported a net loss of more than HK$17 billion the previous financial year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cheng's father and the developer's chairman, Henry Cheng, said "timely phased changes needed to be made" after reviewing the group's development direction.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added he was glad to have found a "more suitable" CEO, citing Huang's experience in real estate and corporate management.
  <br>
  <br>
  The company also appointed Gilbert Ho and Edward Lau as executive directors.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shares of New World Development and sister company, New World Department Store China, fell by around six percent before trading was halted in the afternoon pending the personnel announcement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trading for both firms will resume on Monday.
