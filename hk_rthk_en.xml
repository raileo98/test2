 Thousands of people gathered around Victoria Harbour on Thursday for the New Year firework display, traditionally held on the second day of the Lunar New Year.
 <br>
  <br>
  A secondary school student told RTHK she had arrived at half past three.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I wanted to enjoy the festive atmosphere, and get a good spot. This is the first time I have come to see the fireworks. I think the weather is quite good today. I decided to go out and see how much better watching the fireworks is, compared to seeing them on television," she said, adding that she brought a book and some food to kill time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another man said he is looking forward to seeing the panda patterns, which appear in one of the scenes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I came at around one, and I think it's worth it. I brought a tripod and a camera to take photos. I think fireworks are so beautiful," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  A tourist from Shenzhen said he had come to Hong Kong just for the display.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think having more than 20,000 fireworks will be magnificent, and the themes are also very meaningful. I was busy seeing my relatives on the first day of the Lunar New Year, so I missed the fireworks in Guangzhou. I can also appreciate the view of Victoria Harbour, while seeing the fireworks here," the man said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police closed off a number roads on both sides of the harbour ahead of the display.

    Scores feared dead in Washington DC air collision

<div class="itemFullText">
 Scores of people are feared dead after an American Airlines regional passenger jet and a US Army Black Hawk helicopter collided and crashed into the frigid Potomac River near Reagan Washington National Airport on Wednesday night, officials said.
 <br>
  <br>
  Officials did not provide a death toll from the collision. But US Senator Roger Marshall of Kansas, where the flight originated, suggested that all on board died, saying at a news conference at Reagan airport early Thursday that "it's really hard when you lose probably over 60 Kansans simultaneously."
  <br>
  <br>
  "When one person dies, it's a tragedy, but when many, many, many people die, it's an unbearable sorrow," he said. "It's a heartbreak beyond measure."
  <br>
  <br>
  Jack Potter, the president and CEO of the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority, emphasised at the same news conference that first responders were in "rescue mode."
  <br>
  <br>
  CBS News had reported that at least 18 bodies had been recovered, citing a police official. Two sources told Reuters multiple bodies had been pulled from the water.
  <br>
  <br>
  American Airlines confirmed that 64 people were aboard the jet: 60 passengers and four crew members. Three soldiers were aboard the helicopter, which was on a training flight, a US official said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The mid-air collision occurred as the passenger jet en route from Wichita, Kansas was on approach to land at Reagan. Radio communications between the air traffic control tower and the Black Hawk show that the helicopter crew were aware that the plane was in the vicinity.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Pentagon said it was launching an immediate investigation into the incident, which President Donald Trump appeared to blame on the helicopter crew and air traffic controllers in a post on Truth Social.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The helicopter was going straight at the airplane for an extended period of time. It is a CLEAR NIGHT, the lights on the plane were blazing, why didn't the helicopter go up or down, or turn," Trump wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Why didn't the control tower tell the helicopter what to do instead of asking if they saw the plane. This is a bad situation that looks like it should have been prevented. NOT GOOD!!!"
  <br>
  <br>
  Air traffic control recordings appear to capture the final attempted communications with the helicopter, call sign PAT25, before it collides with the plane, described as CRJ.
  <br>
  <br>
  "PAT25, do you have a CRJ in sight? PAT25, pass behind the CRJ," an air traffic controller says at 8:47 pm (0147 GMT), according to a recording on liveatc.net.
  <br>
  <br>
  Seconds later, another aircraft calls in to air traffic control, saying, "Tower, did you see that?" - apparently referring to the crash. An air traffic controller then redirects planes heading to runway 33 to go around.
  <br>
  <br>
  Video of the crash captured by a webcam at the nearby Kennedy Center showed the moment of impact between the aircraft and the helicopter, with a massive explosion lighting up the night sky.
  <br>
  <br>
  Just after the collision, an air traffic controller was heard saying over the radio, "I just saw a fireball and then it was just gone. I haven't seen anything since they hit the river."
  <br>
  <br>
  Relatives gathered at the airport said they were getting little to no information from officials about the incident, adding that they were hearing more about the incident from news reports.
  <br>
  <br>
  One woman told an airport official, "I don't know if she got on there or not," in apparent reference to a passenger on the crashed jet. She then collapsed in tears.
  <br>
  <br>
  Washington, DC, fire chief John Donnelly said at the news conference that at least 300 first responders were continuing to work on the "highly complex" rescue operation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Conditions out there are extremely rough for the responders," Donnelly said. "It's cold. They're dealing with windy conditions."
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked by reporters whether there were any survivors, he responded that "we don't know yet."
  <br>
  <br>
  Around 1:30 am ET, a Reuters reporter near the airport saw a helicopter circling in the sky and shining a spotlight into the water. A boat with a rescue team floated by with those aboard peering into the water with a flashlight.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier, dozens of police, ambulance and rescue units, some ferrying boats, staged along the river and raced to positions along the tarmac of Reagan airport. Live TV images showed several boats in the water, flashing blue and red lights.
  <br>
  <br>
  Airports authority CEO Potter said the airport would remain closed until at least 11 am on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 1982, Air Florida Flight 90 crashed into the 14th Street Bridge over the Potomac River, killing 70 passengers and four crew members. Only four passengers and one crew member survived.
  <br>
  <br>
  The last deadly major crash involving a commercial airliner in the US was in 2009, when all 49 people aboard a Colgan Air flight died when the plane crashed in New York state. One person also died on the ground.
  <br>
  <br>
  But a series of near-miss incidents in recent years have raised serious safety concerns.
  <br>
  <br>
  PSA was operating Flight 5342 for American Airlines, according to the FAA.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're cooperating with the National Transportation Safety Board in its investigation and will continue to provide all the information we can," American Airlines CEO Robert Isom said in a video statement. (Reuters)

<img alt="Oklahoma City star Shai Gilgeous-Alexander scored a 52-point outburst. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1789706_1_20250130152706.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Golden State Warriors withstood Oklahoma City star Shai Gilgeous-Alexander's 52-point outburst to beat the Western Conference leading Thunder 116-109 on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Andrew Wiggins scored 27 points and Warriors superstar Stephen Curry scored 17 of his 21 points in the second half as Golden State erased a double-digit deficit and pulled away late for the victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We just stayed solid," said Curry, who entered the contest mired in shooting slump and had just four points on one basket in the first half. "Just all-around effort."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Thunder, fuelled by 31 first-half points from Gilgeous-Alexander, led by as many as 14 in the first half and were up 58-48 at the break.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the Warriors turned it around and they went into the fourth quarter tied.
  <br>
  <br>
  The teams traded the lead five times in the opening minutes of the final frame, Kevon Looney putting Golden State ahead for good with a pair of free-throws with 8:18 remaining.
  <br>
  <br>
  Curry's three-pointer put Golden State up 109-103 with 1:52 remaining. Wiggins added a three-pointer and Gary Payton II threw down a dunk as the Warriors pulled away.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We need every win possible," Curry said after the Warriors improved to 24-23 -- knocking on the door for a play-in tournament berth.
  <br>
  <br>
  "(We) haven't really developed anything consistent in terms of the win column. So this is a great test."
  <br>
  <br>
  The defeat dropped the Thunder to 37-9, a hair behind the Cleveland Cavaliers for best record in the league.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Short-handed Cavs, fueled by 34 points from Donovan Mitchell, beat the Miami Heat 126-106 to maintain their lead over the reigning champion Boston Celtics atop the East.
  <br>
  <br>
  Darius Garland, averaging 21.7 points per game for the Cavs, was held out to rest while Caris LeVert and Isaac Okoro remained sidelined by injuries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Evan Mobley scored 22 points and pulled down 15 rebounds and Ty Jerome added 20 points off the bench for Cleveland, who improved to 38-9 and remained 5.5 games ahead of the Celtics, who thumped the Chicago Bulls 122-100 in Boston.
  <br>
  <br>
  The New York Knicks are a further game back after a 122-112 victory over the Denver Nuggets.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kristaps Porzingis was the driving force in Boston, drilling eight three-pointers on the way to 34 points with 11 rebounds and three steals for the Celtics.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jaylen Brown added 28 points, six rebounds and six assists, Derrick White added 22 points and Jayson Tatum -- questionable to start with a sore knee -- scored 16.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Knicks, fuelled by 30 points and 15 assists from Jalen Brunson, notched a fifth straight win.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jamal Murray led the Nuggets with 33 points. NBA Most Valuable Player Nikola Jokic was in foul trouble early and finished with 17 points six rebounds and six assists for Denver, who slumped to a third straight defeat.
  <br>
  <br>
  Things got heated in Indianapolis, where Pascal Siakam scored 37 points and Tyrese Haliburton added 30 points and eight assists for the Indiana Pacers in a 133-119 victory over the Detroit Pistons.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two weeks after tempers flared when the teams met in Detroit, the Pistons' frustration was obvious.
  <br>
  <br>
  Detroit picked up a pair of technical fouls in the first 17 minutes and Isaiah Stewart was ejected after shoving Indiana's Thomas Bryant early in the second quarter.
  <br>
  <br>
  There were tense moments in San Antonio, where Kawhi Leonard and Norman Powell scored 27 points apiece to lead the Los Angeles Clippers to a 128-116 victory over the Spurs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ivica Zubac scored 21 points and grabbed 22 rebounds for the Clippers, and sparked the ire of Spurs star Victor Wembanyama when he gave the Frenchman a shove in the third quarter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wembanyama rose from the court and tried to chase down Zubac before he was held back by teammates and coaches.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zubac said he thought he'd been fouled by Wemby on a prior play and "reacted a little".
  <br>
  <br>
  "I let emotions take over a little bit, but I apologized to him," Zubac said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wembanyama, who finished with 23 points, 12 rebounds and four assists, admitted his own reaction was due to as much to "frustration" as anger at Zubac. (AFP)

    Tesla results come in lower than expected

<img alt="The care maker confirmed plans to unveil new, more affordable vehicles in 2025. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1789704_1_20250130151025.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Tesla reported lower than expected profits on Wednesday but confirmed key 2025 benchmarks, saying it will return to sales volume growth and move forward with fully autonomous driving.
 <br>
  <br>
  The results -- the first since the return of Tesla CEO Elon Musk's ally Donald Trump to the White House -- capped a mixed year for Tesla in which Musk's big bet on US electoral politics was countered by profit pressures as Tesla's streak of annual car volume growth came to an end.
  <br>
  <br>
  The electric car company reported fourth-quarter profits of US$2.3 billion, down 71 percent from the year-ago quarter, where profits were boosted by a one-time tax benefit.
  <br>
  <br>
  Revenues rose two percent to US$25.7 billion, also missing analyst estimates, but reflecting a more than doubling of sales in energy generation and storage.
  <br>
  <br>
  Musk has sought to temper expectations about Tesla's near-term financial growth, while employing superlatives in touting Tesla's autonomous driving and robotic ventures, saying they could make Tesla "the most valuable company in the world by far," worth more than the "next five companies combined."
  <br>
  <br>
  Musk, who spent some US$270 million or more to help Trump win the White House, largely steered clear of political subjects during the 65-minute conference call.
  <br>
  <br>
  The company has been confronted by intensifying EV competition in leading markets, including China and the United States, where General Motors and Ford have introduced more models.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another factor has been lower sales than expected from the Cybertruck, Musk's futuristic auto giant that has won cheers from Tesla fans and jeers from critics.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Tesla expects growth in 2025, saying in its earnings release that "with the advancements in vehicle autonomy and the introduction of new products, we expect the vehicle business to return to growth in 2025."
  <br>
  <br>
  The company confirmed plans to unveil new, more affordable vehicles in 2025 and said its launch of a new robotaxi venture in parts of the United States was on track to begin this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tesla named its driver-assistance programs "autopilot" and "full self-driving" (FSD), even though the programmes require the driver to maintain attention, while rival robotaxi venture Waymo has achieved full driverless functionality in three US cities so far.
  <br>
  <br>
  Musk has repeatedly missed earlier targets towards full autonomy, quipping during Wednesday that he was like the boy who cried wolf.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But I'm telling you, there's a damn wolf this time, and you can drive it," Musk said. "In fact, it can drive you. It's a self-driving wolf."
  <br>
  <br>
  Musk said he intends to launch FSD as a paid service in Austin, Texas this year, where the company also plans to introduce robotaxi services.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Teslas will be in the wild," he said, describing a gradual expansion of service once the company can demonstrate its autonomous service is "unequivocally safer" than a human driver.
  <br>
  <br>
  Musk did not directly comment on how his alliance with Trump will affect Tesla.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shares of Tesla rose 4.4 percent in after-hours trading. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Manchester City came from behind to beat Club Brugge 3-1 and secure their place in the Champions League playoffs, as big guns Real Madrid, Bayern Munich and Paris St Germain also won to progress, while AC Milan and Juventus will join them despite both losing on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  A goal-stacked night of 18 simultaneous kick-offs in the final group match day of the competition's new format, eventually ended as the traditional format usually ended with all the big guns still alive.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool and Barcelona were the only teams already guaranteed a place in the top eight and automatic progress to the round of 16 and they stayed first and second respectively despite Liverpool losing 3-2 to PSV Eindhoven and Barca drawing 2-2 with Atalanta.
  <br>
  <br>
  Joining them are Arsenal, Inter Milan, Atletico Madrid, Bayer Leverkusen, Aston Villa and Lille, who produced the performance of the night to thrash Feyenoord 6-1.
  <br>
  <br>
  Although they eventually progressed reasonably comfortably, it was anything but for Man City at the Etihad. The 2023 European champions were exposed just before half-time when Raphael Onyedika brilliantly finished off a Brugge sweeping move.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mateo Kovacic pulled one back for City early in the second half but at that stage they were still heading out of the competition and they needed an own goal by Joel Ordonez to get the lead and then a third by Savinho to relax.
  <br>
  <br>
  The draw for the two-legged next stage takes place on Friday, where, unlike in previous years, teams from the same country and group can meet.
  <br>
  <br>
  The final is in Munich on May 31. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A US passenger plane carrying 64 people crashed into Washington DC's chilly Potomac River after colliding mid-air with a military helicopter on a night-time training exercise on Wednesday, prompting a major emergency response and the grounding of all flights.
 <br>
  <br>
  The plane had been about to land at nearby Reagan National Airport after flying from Kansas.
  <br>
  <br>
  American Airlines, whose subsidiary operated the flight, said "there were 60 passengers and four crew members on board the aircraft."
  <br>
  <br>
  A US Army official said the helicopter involved was a Black Hawk model carrying three soldiers -- their status currently unknown. They had been on a "training flight," a separate military spokesperson said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Washington police said "there is no confirmed information on casualties at this time."
  <br>
  <br>
  However, a massive search and rescue operation was in progress, with divers visible as they plunged into the Potomac.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Washington Post quoted unnamed sources saying police had started to pull multiple bodies from the snow-lined Potomac.
  <br>
  <br>
  Witness Ari Schulman described "a stream of sparks" and what looked like a large firework when the collision erupted overhead as he drove home.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Initially I saw the plane and it looked fine, normal. It was right about to head over land," he told CNN.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Three seconds later, and at that point it was banked all the way to the right... I could see the underside of it, it was lit up a very bright yellow, and there was a stream of sparks underneath it," Schulman added. "It looked like a Roman candle."
  <br>
  <br>
  President Donald Trump said in a statement that he had been "fully briefed" and said of any victims, "may God bless their souls."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Federal Aviation Administration ordered the grounding of all planes at Reagan National, and Washington's police said on X that "multiple agencies" were responding to the crash site in the Potomac.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kristi Noem, the country's new secretary of homeland security, posted on X that she was "deploying every available US Coast Guard resource for search and rescue efforts in this horrific incident at DCA."
  <br>
  <br>
  Police said fireboats had joined the operation on the river, where any work was complicated by the fact it was dark and close to freezing. Dozens of fire trucks headed toward the airport.
  <br>
  <br>
  The FAA said a Bombardier regional jet operated by American Airlines subsidiary PSA Airlines "collided in midair" with a Sikorsky UH-60 helicopter as it approached for landing at Reagan at around 9:00 pm (0200 GMT). The plane had left from Wichita, Kansas.
  <br>
  <br>
  US Senator Roger Marshall of Kansas said the collision was "nothing short of a nightmare."
  <br>
  <br>
  "I ask the world to join me in praying for Kansas this evening, the first responders, rescue crews, and all those involved in this horrific accident," he wrote on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  Questions were expected to focus on how a passenger plane with modern collision-avoidance technology and nearby traffic controllers could collide with a military aircraft over the nation's capital.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the airspace around Washington is often crowded, with planes coming in low over the city to land at Reagan airport and helicopters -- military, civilian and carrying senior politicians -- buzzing about both day and night.
  <br>
  <br>
  The same airport was the scene of a deadly crash in January 1982 when Air Florida flight 90, a Boeing 737, took off but quickly plummeted, hitting the 14th Street bridge and crashing through the ice into the Potomac River. 78 people died.
  <br>
  <br>
  Investigators concluded the pilot had failed to activate sufficient de-icing procedures.
  <br>
  <br>
  The last major fatal US crash was in 2009, when Continental Flight 3407 from New Jersey to Buffalo, New York crashed and killed all 49 people aboard. (AFP)

    Lunar New Year restaurant reservations up 10 percent

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A catering representative said on Thursday that reservations at Chinese restaurants over Lunar New Year were up ten percent from last year.
 <br>
  <br>
  Association for Hong Kong Catering Services Management chairman, Leung Chun-wah, said despite a number of Hong Kong residents travelling during the holidays, those who stayed in the city were willing to spend.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Lunar New Year is the happiest festival for Chinese people. The number of people flying out was not too many, somewhere between 300,000 to 400,000 people. People still have to eat their meals, and they want to be happy while doing so. So, our business and reservation numbers both saw a ten percent increase," he said on an RTHK programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  A total of 357,927 Hong Kong residents departed the city on Wednesday, according to Immigration Department figures.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, Leung said restaurants generally saw just one round of customers early in the evening, as people's eating habits had changed during the Covid pandemic.
  <br>
  <br>
  "People eat early and leave early. We don't really see a second round of customers - those who go to restaurants at 8:30 pm for dinner," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Leung also noted that customers were spending less than before the pandemic.
  <br>
  <br>
  This year, the average spending per person was between HK$350 to HK$400 - similar to last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that the resumption of the multi-entry visa for Shenzhen residents only benefited restaurants in tourist spots, which recorded an around 20 percent increase in business.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Monetary Authority on Thursday said there's a chance that interest rates in the city will remain at "relatively high levels" for a while, after the US central bank kept the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Federal Reserve had left key overnight interest rates steady in the 4.25 percent to 4.50 percent target range, with its chair Jerome Powell saying there would be no rush to cut them again.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong's de-facto central bank said in response that the policy decision was "in line with market expectations".
  <br>
  <br>
  "However, the pace of future rate cuts remains uncertain as it is dependent on US inflation and labour market data developments, the effect of previous rate cuts, as well as the impact of fiscal, economic and trade policies adopted by the new administration on economic activity," the authority said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Interest rates in Hong Kong might still remain at relatively high levels for some time, and the extent and pace of future US interest rate cuts are subject to considerable uncertainty."
  <br>
  <br>
  The public should exercise caution when making property purchase, mortgage or other borrowing decisions, it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The authority added it would continue to closely monitor market developments and maintain monetary and financial stability.
  <br>
  <br>
  It stressed that the city's financial and monetary markets have continued to operate in a smooth and orderly manner.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Market liquidity condition has remained stable, and the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate stays steady," the authority said.

    Fortune urges practical measures, says rural chief

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A rural leader has urged officials to come up with policies that are practical rather than window dressing in the upcoming budget, after drawing a fortune stick for Hong Kong in an annual Lunar New Year ritual.
 <br>
  <br>
  On Thursday morning, Heung Yee Kuk chairman Kenneth Lau picked a No 24 "neutral" stick at the Che Kung Temple in Sha Tin.
  <br>
  <br>
  The stick corresponds to a prophecy that roughly translates to: "Live a life without wrongdoing, it is only greed that stirs up trouble; with the help of noble people, don't waste your efforts."
  <br>
  <br>
  Interpreting the message, Lau said it means doing the right thing and that Hong Kong needs the support of the country. He also appealed to Financial Secretary Paul Chan to roll out practical economic measures in his budget, which will be unveiled on February 26.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I hope the financial secretary will particularly take care of the middle class and the underprivileged, and not increase fees or taxes," Lau said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When putting in resources, officials should not do things that are just window dressing, they should be practical... Under this global economic situation and high interest rate environment, the government has to promote the economy."
  <br>
  <br>
  Each year, the head of the rural body goes to the Che Kung Temple on the second day of the Lunar New Year to draw a fortune stick.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lau initially thought he drew the number 20 stick, but later said he had made a mistake.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, the chairman of the Sha Tin Rural Committee drew an ill-omened No 82 stick for the Sha Tin community.
  <br>
  <br>
  Of the 96 sticks in the cup, 35 are “positive” sticks, 17 are “negative” ones, while 44 are "neutral".

 More than 500,000 displaced Palestinians have returned to northern Gaza, according to the media office in Gaza.
 <br>
  <br>
  "More than half a million displaced Palestinians have returned in the past 72 hours from the southern and central governorates to Gaza and northern governorates via Al-Rashid and Salah Al-Din roads," the media office said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel began allowing displaced people to return to the north of the Gaza Strip on Monday, following a ceasefire agreement with Hamas that put a pause on 15 months of fighting.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamas's armed wing, the Al-Qassam Brigades, said it would release three Israeli detainees on Thursday. Israeli public radio reported that Israel would free 110 Palestinian prisoners, including 30 minors, in exchange.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gaza's health authorities said hospitals received 63 bodies in the past 24 hours, including 59 recovered from rubble, bringing the total death toll since October 2023, to 47,417.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, at least ten Palestinians on Wednesday were killed and several others injured in the occupied West Bank by an Israeli strike, Palestinian health officials said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Israeli military said it had targeted a cell of "armed terror operatives".
  <br>
  <br>
  The Palestinian health ministry added that Israeli forces killed two people in separate overnight raids in the occupied West Bank, including one at a refugee camp in Jenin, where the Israeli military is conducting a major offensive. (Agencies)

    Rwanda-backed fighters advance in DR Congo

 Rwanda-backed fighters advanced on a second front in their offensive across eastern DR Congo on Wednesday after seizing control of most of the key city of Goma during heavy fighting with the Congolese military.
 <br>
  <br>
  The weeks-long advance by the M23 armed group prompted calls from mediator Angola for urgent talks, as well rising international criticism and warnings of a looming humanitarian crisis.
  <br>
  <br>
  DR Congo has called on the world to stop the M23's march across the vast central African country's mineral-rich east, wracked by decades of conflict that can be partly traced back to the 1994 Rwandan genocide.
  <br>
  <br>
  After days of intense clashes, calm returned to Goma, provincial capital of North Kivu, on Wednesday as residents started venturing from their homes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite international pressure to end the crisis, Congolese President Felix Tshisekedi declined to attend talks with his Rwandan counterpart Paul Kagame on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a videoconference summit of the East African Community, the regional bloc's heads state "called for peaceful settlement of the conflicts", it said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  M23 fighters and Rwandan troops entered Goma on Sunday, progressively seizing the city's airport and other sites of the key mineral trading hub.
  <br>
  <br>
  The latest fighting has heightened an already dire humanitarian crisis in the region, causing food and water shortages and forcing half a million people from their homes this month, according to the United Nations.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the other side of the country, furious protesters in the capital Kinshasa on Tuesday attacked the embassies of various nations they accused of not stepping in to halt the chaos in the east.
  <br>
  <br>
  After protesters burnt tyres in the streets and looted supermarkets, the authorities banned all further protests in the capital, which remained calm on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The United States, which was among the nations whose embassy was targeted, ordered non-emergency staff and their families to leave the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  DR Congo's former colonial ruler Belgium also warned its citizens against travelling to the country, while Brussels Airlines scrapped flights to Kinshasa. (AFP)

 Wall Street stocks finished lower ahead of a deluge of earnings from tech heavyweights as markets digested a Federal Reserve decision to keep interest rates unmoved.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Fed, as expected, left its key lending rate unchanged, resisting pressure from President Donald Trump to continue with cuts in the first rate decision since his return to office.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stocks did not move significantly after the decision or during a news conference with Fed Chair Jerome Powell.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're looking at a major plethora of earnings data," Adam Sarhan of 50 Park Investments said of results later on Wednesday from Meta, Tesla, and others.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished down 0.3 percent at 44,713.
  <br>
  <br>
  The broad-based S&P 500 declined 0.5 percent to 6,039, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index dropped 0.5 percent to 19,632.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wednesday's session extended a choppy trend this week after revelations about Chinese artificial intelligence firm DeepSeek pummeled Nvidia and other US stocks on Monday before they rebounded on Tuesday. Nvidia fell four percent on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Markets also digested congressional testimony from Trump's commerce secretary nominee Howard Lutnick, who touted the virtues of tariffs, a lingering source of unease for investors.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The market knows tariffs are coming," Sarhan said. "We don't know what the effect will be."
  <br>
  <br>
  Among individual companies, Starbucks shot up 7.8 percent after reporting lower profits in results that still beat expectations. New CEO Brian Niccol expressed confidence about restoring growth at the coffee chain.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump Media & Technology Group gained 7.3 percent as it announced a venture with Charles Schwab, establishing a program to promote "American First investment vehicles." Schwab advanced 0.4 percent. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A pre-dawn stampede at the world's largest religious gathering killed at least 30 people in India on Wednesday, with many more injured after a surging crowd spilled out of a police cordon and trampled bystanders.
 <br>
  <br>
  Deadly crowd incidents are a frequent occurrence at Indian religious festivals, including the Kumbh Mela, which attracts tens of millions of devotees every 12 years to the northern city of Prayagraj.
  <br>
  <br>
  As pilgrims rushed to participate in a sacred day of ritual bathing, people sleeping and sitting on the ground near the rivers said they were trampled by huge swells of devotees coming towards them in the darkness.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The entire crowd fell on top of me, trampling me as it moved forward," pilgrim Renu Devi, 48, said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When the crowd surged, elderly people and women were crushed, and no one came forward to help."
  <br>
  <br>
  Rescue teams carrying victims from the accident site weaved through piles of clothes, shoes and other discarded belongings.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police were seen carrying stretchers bearing the bodies of victims draped with thick blankets.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Thirty devotees have unfortunately died," senior police officer Vaibhav Krishna told reporters during an evening news conference at the festival. "Ninety injured were taken to the hospital."
  <br>
  <br>
  Krishna's briefing came nearly 18 hours after the stampede and was the first official death toll given by authorities.

 The Lunar New Year parade took place in Tsim Sha Tsui on Wednesday, with Chief Executive John Lee opening the event.
 <br>
  <br>
  In his speech, the Chief Executive told the crowd that there was no better place to ring in the Chinese New Year than Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Only in Hong Kong, the world's East-meets-West centre for cultural exchange and day-and-night entertainment, all around town you'll be greeted by the magnificent spectacle of our festivities and the warm hospitality of the people of Hong Kong, as we share the joy of the year with all of you. I wish you all a happy, healthy, and eventful Year of the Snake."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee said this year's parade, themed "Unfold a Year of Good Fortune", featured 55 performing groups and floats, which showcased Hong Kong, as well as 14 countries and regions.
  <br>
  <br>
  They are "here in the world city of Hong Kong to dance, sing and perform, skip, juggle, cheerlead and otherwise amaze and delight you in this most auspicious of days," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The night parade started at the Hong Kong Cultural Centre Piazza at 8 pm, then headed down Canton Road, Haiphong Road, and Nathan Road, before ending at the Sheraton Hong Kong Hotel and Towers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier, organiser Hong Kong Tourism Board said it expected around 100,000 people to turn up for the event.
  <br>
  <br>
  As part of the Spring Festival celebrations, Lee added that the floats and some of Wednesday night's performances will move to Lam Tsuen for Thursday's Hong Kong Well-wishing Festival. The floats will be on display there until February 13.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other festivities include a 23-minute firework show on both sides of Victoria Harbour on the second day of the Lunar New Year, as well as horse racing at Sha Tin on the third day.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Brussels Airlines cancelled its Wednesday flights to and from Kinshasa amid violence in the Democratic Republic of Congo capital, as anger spilled over about the conflict raging in the east of the country.
 <br>
  <br>
  The airline runs a daily Brussels-Kinshasa return service. "The decision to resume operations will be made after a thorough and careful assessment of the security situation," the Belgian carrier said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Protesters in Kinshasa furious over international inaction on Tuesday targeted the embassies of Rwanda, Kenya, Uganda, France, Belgium and the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  Supermarkets were also looted and piles tyres burned during chaotic demonstrations in the Democratic Republic of Congo capital.
  <br>
  <br>
  France, the EU and Kenya condemned the embassy attacks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Protesters accused Rwanda and Uganda of actively supporting the armed group M23 which after a lightning offensive in North Kivu province with the support of Rwandan troops entered the regional capital Goma on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The main city in eastern DR Congo has become a battleground since fighters from the Tutsi-led M23 armed group backed by Rwandan forces entered central Goma on Sunday night after a weeks-long advance through the region.

 Crowds gathered in Tsim Sha Tsui on Wednesday for the Lunar New Year parade .
 <br>
  <br>
  Themed "Unfold a Year of Good Fortune", it features nine floats showcasing unique elements from the SAR, alongside 46 performing groups from around the globe.
  <br>
  <br>
  It will start at the Hong Kong Cultural Centre Piazza, then head down Canton Road, Haiphong Road, and Nathan Road, before ending at the Sheraton Hong Kong Hotel and Towers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Road closures and traffic diversions have been put in place.
  <br>
  <br>
  A woman surnamed Leung said she came to support her daughter, who will be performing in the parade.
  <br>
  <br>
  "My daughter will be dancing, so I must show my support. I have been here since around 3 pm, after sending her to the assembly venue. I am very excited about seeing her, and it is also my first time to see the parade in person," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  A tourist surnamed Jia from Northeast China said she had come to Hong Kong for the festive atmosphere.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think Hong Kong has a very strong Lunar New Year vibe and I love the culture around the Greater Bay Area. I know there will be a parade tonight and fireworks tomorrow, and I booked my hotel last November," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  A Shenzhen tourist surnamed Huang said this is her second time at the parade..
  <br>
  <br>
  "Last year, I did not pick a good spot. So this year, I learned from my past experience and arrived at 2.30 pm. The location I am in is the performance area, so the lighting will be nicer," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Huang said she found the float designs delicate and the performing groups from around the world very attractive.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Tourism Board expects around 100,000 people to turn up for the event.

    Air passengers numbers up this Lunar New Year

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Airport Authority’s acting chief executive Vivian Cheung on Wednesday said she expected passenger numbers to be about 30 percent higher this Lunar New Year holiday, when compared to last year.
 <br>
  <br>
  She said the airport had been operating smoothly and around 160,000 people had passed through on the first day of the Year of the Snake. That's about 20 percent fewer than on the peak days earlier in the week.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The last few days were a peak period and the airport saw around 200,000 people a day, which almost reached the level before the pandemic,” Cheung said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “For example, we have around 75 pairs of flights between Hong Kong and 13 Japanese cities every day, meaning there’s a flight every 15 minutes. It’s very convenient for Hongkongers to travel,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cheung also expected flight movements this year to return to the pre-pandemic level, with the airport seeing around 1,100 flights taking off and landing each day.

    At least seven die at Hindu festival stampede

<div class="itemFullText">
 At least seven people were killed and around 10 injured in a stampede at the Maha Kumbh Mela in northern India on Wednesday, said an official, as tens of millions gathered to take a holy dip on the most auspicious day of the six-week Hindu festival.
 <br>
  <br>
  The stampede occurred between 1 am and 2 am near the arena of the ascetics, where barricades had been put up to manage crowds during their holy dip, said Yogi Adityanath, chief minister of Uttar Pradesh state where the festival city of Prayagraj is located.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in a post on X, offered condolences to "devotees who have lost their loves ones", but did not specify the number of dead.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The local administration is engaged in helping the victims in every possible way", he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Adityanath added that the situation was under control but the crowd was still massive.
  <br>
  <br>
  A senior state official said "more than seven people have been killed in the stampede and around 10 others injured". The official did not want to be named as he was not authorised to speak to the media.
  <br>
  <br>
  Videos and photographs after the stampede showed bodies being taken away on stretchers and people sitting on the ground crying, while others stepped over clothes, shoes, backpacks and blankets left by those trying to escape the crush.
  <br>
  <br>
  A Reuters witness saw several dead bodies as he followed dozens of ambulances rushing towards the river bank where the incident occurred.
  <br>
  <br>
  Witnesses spoke of a huge push near the confluence of three holy rivers - where a dip is considered particularly sacred - that caused devotees to fall on each other. Chief Minister Adityanath urged people to avoid the area.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hindu festival is the world's largest congregation of humanity, attracting some 400 million over its six weeks compared with the Haj pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia which drew 1.8 million last year. By Tuesday nearly 200 million people have attended the 2025 festival since it started two weeks ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  Devout Hindus believe taking a dip at the confluence of three sacred rivers - the Ganga, the Yamuna, and the mythical, invisible Saraswati - absolves people of sins, and during the Kumbh, it also brings salvation from the cycle of life and death.
  <br>
  <br>
  A similar stampede broke out on the most auspicious day of the festival when it was last held in 2013, killing at least 36 pilgrims, mostly women.  (Reuters)

    South Korea investigates Air Busan plane fire

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Seven people sustained mostly minor injuries in Tuesday's airplane fire in South Korea, authorities said on Wednesday, with local media suggesting the blaze may have been caused by a portable battery stored in the overhead bin.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Air Busan plane, an Airbus A321, was set to fly to Hong Kong from Gimhae International Airport in southeastern Busan but caught fire in the rear section on Tuesday night, according to the country's transport ministry.
  <br>
  <br>
  A total of 169 passengers and seven flight attendants and staff were evacuated down inflatable slides, it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities initially reported three injuries but revised the number to seven on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  One of them is currently hospitalised, the ministry added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The accident left nearly half of the fuselage burnt but its wings and engines on both sides remain undamaged, it said, adding that the cause of the fire is currently under investigation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is unclear when we will be able to disclose the investigation findings on the cause of last night's fire," the ministry spokesperson told AFP.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dramatic images and footage from local media on Tuesday night showed the aircraft engulfed in flames, with thick smoke appearing to billow from the interior of the plane.
  <br>
  <br>
  Images from Wednesday morning revealed that the upper half of the fuselage was burned away, leaving a huge hole.
  <br>
  <br>
  While the ministry did not comment on the possible cause of the fire, Yonhap News Agency reported that the blaze began to spread after black smoke emerged from the overhead compartment in the back row.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It seems that a fire broke out when a passenger's portable battery, stored in the overhead bin as carry-on luggage, became compressed," local daily JoongAng Ilbo reported, citing an unnamed person affiliated with Air Busan.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As the smoke filled the cabin, a passenger seated near the emergency exit opened the door, and the flight attendant opened the opposite one, allowing others to start evacuating," a passenger recounted, as quoted by Yonhap.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was... chaotic and terrifying."
  <br>
  <br>
  South Korea suffered the worst aviation disaster on its soil last month when a Jeju Air Boeing 737-800, flying from Thailand to Muan on December 29, crash-landed and exploded into a fireball after slamming into a concrete barrier.
  <br>
  <br>
  That crash killed 179 of the 181 passengers and crew members on board.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the wake of the Jeju Air passenger aircraft tragedy, an additional aviation accident has taken place, and we feel deeply sorry for the passengers on board and the public," transport minister Park Sang-woo said in a statement Wednesday. (AFP)

    Lam Tsuen Wishing Tree draws New Year crowds

 People headed to the Lam Tsuen Wishing Tree in Taipo on Wednesday, a traditional event on the first day of Lunar New Year.
 <br>
  <br>
  It's believed that throwing a placard with one's wishes, and a mandarin, onto the tree will make the wish come true.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I wished everyone good fortune, good health and for wishes to come true. And for a better year. Everyone went through Covid over the past few years, I hope everyone's luck will improve every year. My grandson successfully threw the placard onto the tree on his first try. It's the first time, we got so lucky," said a man surnamed Pang, who arrived at around 9 am.
  <br>
  <br>
  A boy surnamed Pang said it took him four times to make his wish.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I threw the placard a few times before it landed on the tree. It's so difficult. The wind affects where it lands, and it falls off. I had to jump to make sure it hung on the tree," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I wished for better exam results because my scores are bad. I hope I get better grades in Maths, English and Chinese. I also wished to go to Japan because the place has a lot of food and things that I like," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sophie, who's originally from England, said she came early to avoid the crowds.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We thought it was going to be very busy. We made a wish on the tree, and we put a wish in the lotus pond as well. On my card, I said I wanted a year of adventure and fun. I've only lived in Hong Kong for four months, and I have lots to learn about this beautiful city," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tourism minister Rosanna Law was also at the venue. She wished for Hong Kong athletes to achieve good results in all competitions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to the press, she said she hoped tourists would enjoy a happy Lunar New Year in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have a float parade tonight, fireworks for tomorrow, horse racing on the third day, and the Lunar New Year Cup on the fourth day. There's also a lot of activities at temples, and today is also a great day for hiking. I believe everyone will spend a happy Spring Festival in Hong Kong," Law said.
  <br>
  <br>
  This year, the Lam Tsuen Well-wishing Bazaar has been scaled up, with a Tai Po district council member saying it will boost the festive atmosphere and local economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  The event, introduced last year, starts on Wednesday and runs until February 12.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a RTHK programme, Lo Hiu-fung said he expected an increase in footfall of at least 10 percent this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We saw a lot of nearby residents and tourists coming to the bazaar at night, last year. So this year, we decided to host the event again, and we made it bigger. The number of food stalls have doubled to more than 20," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the event would again feature floats this year.

    Space oil drug problem worsened alarmingly last year

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Security Chris Tang said the space oil drug problem in Hong Kong has got worse at a rapid rate over the past year.
 <br>
  <br>
  The government is planning to list etomidate, a main component of the substance, as a dangerous drug on February 14.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on RTHK’s Overview Policy programme, Tang said the number of cases related to space oil increased drastically last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Actually the situation has worsened rapidly over the past year. The number of cases in 2024 was seven times more than in 2023, and the number of those arrested increased 11 fold. The amount of space oil drug seized also increased at least four times," Tang said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We can see how serious the problem is and therefore, we need to handle it through legislation,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tang said the government will boost education related to the substance on social media and schools, and also equip teachers to help identify students who use the drug.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, Tang also spoke about the proposed legislation on protection of critical infrastructures. He said the legislation is to ensure the operations of key facilities such as water and electricity, if they come under cyber-attacks.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said large corporations will have the responsibility to protect their computer systems, and to report to the government if they face cyber-attacks, as well as having a contingency plan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tang said individuals and small businesses will not be affected by the proposed law.

    Citybus training focuses on elderly safety

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Citybus has said it is providing training for their drivers to help them better understand the needs of older passengers.
 <br>
  <br>
  More than 850 bus captains have attended Citybus' one-day training programme since it was rolled out last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  As part of the training, drivers put on special outfits and goggles to restrict their sight and movement, and carry canes to simulate what senior passengers experience when they take the bus.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some elderly residents were also invited to the training sessions to tell drivers what they can do to make their journeys safer and more comfortable.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Currently, Citybus is the only bus operator in Hong Kong to provide such training to our bus captains. We will continue to provide this kind of training. We forecast that by 2026, all of our 4,000 [drivers] will have attended such training to provide them knowledge on how to take care of our elderly passengers in Hong Kong,” Citybus General Manager Roger Wong said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong also revealed that there are about 100 bus captain spots vacant at Citybus, despite recording a net increase of more than 400 drivers last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the bus company would focus more on recruitment and come up with different campaigns to attract prospective drivers.
  <br>
  <br>
  In August of last year, Citybus rolled out a new recruitment campaign to look for drivers who want to work three days a week.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bus operator said it received more than 1,000 applications from the recruitment drive, and hired and trained 160 people.

    Macron pledges Louvre 'renaissance' after decay alarm

<img alt="Standing in front of the Mona Lisa, French President Emmanuel Macron said plans included a " for src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1789518_1_20250129023336.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 French President Emmanuel Macron said on Tuesday that the Louvre would be "redesigned, restored and enlarged" after the director of the world's most visited museum voiced alarm about dire conditions for visitors and its collections.
 <br>
  <br>
  Standing in front of the Mona Lisa, Macron said plans included a "special space" for Leonardo da Vinci's masterpiece that would be "independently accessible compared to the rest of the museum", with "its own access pass".
  <br>
  <br>
  The museum in central Paris would also have a "new grand entrance" to help ease congestion at its glass-and-metal pyramid entry point and be financed entirely using the institution's "own resources".
  <br>
  <br>
  As part of the so-called "New Renaissance" project, France would over the next few months launch an "international architecture competition" and select winners by the end of the year to transform its buildings by 2031 at the latest, Macron said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The seat of French kings until Louis XIV abandoned it for Versailles in the late 1600s, the Louvre is regularly listed as the world's most visited museum, and houses masterpieces including the Mona Lisa and the Greek marble sculpture of Venus de Milo.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the Paris landmark has become a subject of national concern after the revelation last week of a confidential memo written by its director Laurence des Cars to Culture Minister Rachida Dati warning about the "proliferation of damage in museum spaces".
  <br>
  <br>
  Some areas "are no longer watertight, while others experience significant temperature variations, endangering the preservation of artworks", she wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Louvre's popularity is causing also a "physical strain" on the historic building, she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Des Cars said the Louvre required an overhaul that was likely to be costly and technically complicated.
  <br>
  <br>
  A total of 8.7 million people visited its famed galleries last year, around twice the number it was designed for, and des Cars has expressed concern about the quality of the user experience.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Louvre management estimates the renovation work could cost hundreds of millions of euros.
  <br>
  <br>
  Macron said "a different, higher fee for foreign visitors from countries outside the European Union" starting next year would help cover the costs. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks regained some ground on Tuesday, with all three major indexes advancing and chip giant Nvidia partly recovering from a slump.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.3 percent to 44,850, while the broad-based S&P 500 rose 0.9 percent to 6,067.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tech-focused Nasdaq Composite Index surged 2 percent to 19,733.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite the gains, Patrick O'Hare of Briefing.com noted that this was not a broad market advance, even though there was some buying interest after AI stocks were hard-hit a day earlier.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that investors were likely eyeing upcoming financial reports from tech giants as well, as they look for a sense of confidence that Monday's slump was "an overreaction."
  <br>
  <br>
  On Monday, US chipmaker Nvidia led a rout in tech stocks after the emergence of a low-cost Chinese generative AI model.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nvidia, whose semiconductors power the AI industry, saw its shares drop nearly 17 percent, erasing almost US$600 billion of its market value.
  <br>
  <br>
  DeepSeek said it spent just US$5.6 million developing its model, a small amount compared with the billions US tech giants have poured into AI.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nvidia shares ended 8.9 percent up on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Looking ahead, investors will also be eyeing the outcome of the Federal Reserve's policy meeting, which concludes on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Policymakers are widely expected to hold interest rates steady at the end of their gathering. (AFP)

    Judge pauses Trump funding freeze order until Feb 3

<img alt="White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt delivers a press briefing in the Press Briefing Room at the White House in Washington, D.C. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1789525_1_20250129053213.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A federal judge on Tuesday paused until next week the implementation of a Trump administration order that would have frozen the issuance of federal grants and loans.
 <br>
  <br>
  Judge Loren AliKhan’s ruling during a hearing conducted on Zoom came just minutes before the freezing order was set to take effect at 5 p.m. ET.
  <br>
  <br>
  AliKhan said her administrative stay of the order would expire at 5 p.m. on Monday unless she decides to grant a temporary restraining order as requested by plaintiffs who filed a lawsuit Tuesday challenging the Trump administration’s action.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier, the healthcare system for millions of low-income Americans and rafts of other programs were thrown into disarray on Tuesday after President Donald Trump ordered a freeze on federal funding, a move opponents blasted as unconstitutional.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was Trump's latest step since he took office a week ago, vowing to force the US government and its employees to back his political goals or face retribution.
  <br>
  <br>
  Online portals used to access the Medicaid health insurance program for poor families and disabled individuals were quickly inaccessible.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is a blatant attempt to rip away health insurance from millions of Americans overnight and will get people killed," Oregon Senator Ron Wyden posted on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said the website would be fixed soon and that "no payments have been affected."
  <br>
  <br>
  She defended the drastic move as part of Trump's bid to make the government "good stewards of taxpayer dollars."
  <br>
  <br>
  The freeze is not a "blanket" stop on spending, but a tool to check that "every penny that is going out the door is not conflicting with the executive orders and actions that this president has taken," Leavitt said.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said the temporary pause would not impact individual Americans but would instead target programs to weed out anything "illegal."
  <br>
  <br>
  She listed as examples racial equality and climate change programs that Trump has vowed to eradicate, and did not answer a question about whether Medicaid recipients would be cut off.
  <br>
  <br>
  The extraordinary measure follows a similar freeze on most US foreign aid.
  <br>
  <br>
  The order, signed by acting director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Matthew Vaeth, did not make clear how such a pause on disbursements of funding will work or for how long.
  <br>
  <br>
  Several non-profit groups have filed suit in federal court seeking a temporary halt to the order until its legality is assessed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Federal spending included more than US$3 trillion in financial assistance like grants and loans in fiscal year 2024, all of which was approved by Congress.
  <br>
  <br>
  Democrats accused Trump of usurping Congress' constitutionally mandated control over budget spending as part of a broader attempt to force the government to bend to his personal will. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 An Airbus plane belonging to South Korean carrier Air Busan caught fire on Tuesday at Gimhae International Airport in the country's south while preparing for departure to Hong Kong, fire authorities said.
 <br>
  <br>
  All 169 passengers and seven crew members were evacuated, with three having minor injuries, fire authorities in Busan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The fire service was alerted to the fire which began inside the plane just before 10:30 p.m., it said. South Korea's Yonhap news agency said it began in the plane's tail.
  <br>
  <br>
  Footage aired by local broadcaster YTN shows evacuation slides deployed on both sides of the single-aisle plane, with emergency workers tackling smoke and flames from the jet.
  <br>
  <br>
  Footage from Yonhap news later showed burned out holes along the length of the fuselage roof.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is a month since the deadliest air disaster on South Korean soil when a Jeju Air plane coming from Bangkok crashed on Muan Airport's runway as it made an emergency belly landing, killing all but two of the 181 people and crew members on board.
  <br>
  <br>
  Budget airline Air Busan is part of South Korea's Asiana Airlines, which in December was acquired by Korean Air.
  <br>
  <br>
  Planemaker Airbus said it was aware of reports about the incident and was liaising with Air Busan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Air Busan and Asiana did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Korean Air directed inquiries to Air Busan. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) on Tuesday said three more children are in intensive care with severe flu.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, the centre said the first case involved a six-year-old boy with good past health. It said his household contacts so far have no symptoms and there was no flu outbreak at his school.
  <br>
  <br>
  The second involves a 12-year-old boy with an underlying illness. He lives in a school dormitory and seven other students from the same school recently had upper respiratory symptoms.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The above-mentioned two boys had no travel history during the incubation period. An initial investigation revealed that they did not receive 2024/25 SIV [seasonal influenza vaccine]," a spokesman for the CHP said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The third case is an eight-year-old boy with good past health. He was diagnosed with flu and another serious infection.
  <br>
  <br>
  The centre says this brings to eight the number of severe flu cases in children, since the flu season began this month. It said six of the children were unvaccinated against seasonal flu.

    'DeepSeek may not cause shift in flow of global funds'

<img alt="A local finance expert says the release of DeepSeek is a good thing for the development of artificial intelligence. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1789484_1_20250128184931.jpg&q=90">

<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial experts in Hong Kong on Tuesday said low-cost Chinese artificial intelligence model DeepSeek may not necessarily cause a shift in the flow of global funds.
 <br>
  <br>
  The release of the AI assistant led to a sell-off in Nvidia shares, which fell 17 percent on Monday, wiping nearly US$600 billion from the AI chip market leader’s market value – a record one-day loss for any company.
  <br>
  <br>
  The startup behind DeepSeek said it uses less data at a fraction of the cost of services currently available, a comment that has garnered attention worldwide, and sparked speculation that global investors will look for cheaper AI options.
  <br>
  <br>
  Andrew Sullivan, founder of Asian Market Sense, pointed out that intense competition is commonplace in the AI sector.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think what we have seen from DeepSeek is the fact that the Chinese have innovated using older chips and being able to use them by understanding the architecture better and linking them better together," Sullivan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's difficult to see how utilising old chips is really going to keep up with the modern advances that we're seeing in the current generation and the next reiteration of the Nvidia chips, so I think there's still going to be a lot of competition there," he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  Almagest Asset Management chief executive James Wong said DeepSeek’s emergence is a good thing for the development of AI, but he did not think it would cause a significant change in terms of global capital flow.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It doesn't come as a surprise for us that the cost of developing the model R1 is that much less than the cost that OpenAI is running," Wong said, using the name of DeepSeek’s open-source AI model.
  <br>
  <br>
  Their remarks came as the city's Hang Seng Index rose for the third straight session in a row, increasing 0.1 percent to close at 20,225, partially boosted by the optimism generated by DeepSeek. (Additional reporting by Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Four more South African soldiers have been killed in fighting against the M23 rebel group in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), the defence force said on Tuesday, after nine were killed last week.
 <br>
  <br>
  Three soldiers were killed in fighting near Goma airport on Monday and another died after being wounded in an earlier battle, the South African National Defence Force (SANDF) said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The M23 rebels launched... a mortar bomb in the direction of Goma Airport, which landed in the SANDF base, and this resulted in the SANDF losing three members.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Furthermore, the SANDF is also saddened to announce that one of our members who was injured during the battle with M23 rebels over the past three days later succumbed to injuries."
  <br>
  <br>
  The SANDF announced on Saturday that nine South African soldiers, including two from the UN peacekeeping force MONUSCO, were killed in clashes with M23 forces on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  South Africa has also deployed troops to a regional force sent by the Southern African Development Community.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fighting has raged in Goma despite calls from the international community for the Rwandan-backed M23 to halt its advance on the city which is in a mineral-rich part of the vast DRC and is home to more than a million people.
  <br>
  <br>
  There were conflicting accounts over how much of Goma remained under Congolese control after the M23 group and Rwandan soldiers entered the city centre on Sunday night.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The SANDF remains fully committed to its peacekeeping responsibilities under the United Nations Stabilisation Mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo (MONUSCO) and SADC Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (SAMIDRC)," its statement said. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday visited a Lunar New Year fair in Tuen Mun, before the fairs end early tomorrow morning on the first day of the Year of the Snake.
 <br>
  <br>
  He bought 10 gladiolus, or sword lilies, which symbolise perfectness and moving forward, along with a pinwheel for good deeds and good luck, and an ornament that represents connecting the community together.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to the press, Lee said he thinks business at the fair will improve later in the evening.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The popularity of stalls and products differ. Some are doing well, while some are still struggling. I believe when it gets darker, business at the fair will get better as we get closer to the New Year," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee gave citizens his best wishes and called for Hongkongers to shop at the fair.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It will be the Year of the Snake tomorrow. The snake is agile, which indicates that Hong Kong will seek and respond to changes. I wish everyone good luck, have a great time during the Lantern Festival and other activities, and also good health," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Financial Secretary Paul Chan went to a fair at Victoria Park, where he chatted with a few stall owners and took pictures with citizens.
  <br>
  <br>
  He spent around HK$1,000 to purchase a giant panda plush toy, a cushion, a pinwheel, and some orchids.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister said he hopes more citizens will visit Lunar New Year fairs across the city ahead of the festival.

 Vendors were on the fence on Tuesday about how much revenue they would generate as people flocked to wet markets to buy food for their family reunion dinners.
 <br>
  <br>
  Reunion dinner on Lunar New Year’s Eve is traditionally regarded as the most important meal of the year in Chinese culture.
  <br>
  <br>
  One man said he spent over HK$1,000 shopping at the wet market.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I picked up things like clams and shrimp. They are a little pricier this year, about 10 percent more than last year. But it’s New Year, so that’s expected,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  A vegetable seller at Kowloon City Market said business was pretty rough overall, noting that lettuce was the only top seller because it symbolises the generation of wealth in Chinese.
  <br>
  <br>
  But a poultry vendor at the same market was not worried about her sales.
  <br>
  <br>
  “People usually buy one or two chickens and don’t mind the price. They are willing to spend big as long as the chickens are fresh. Whether it’s HK$300, HK$400 or HK$500 it doesn’t matter,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “During New Year, everything is a bit pricier and that’s just part of the festive atmosphere. People don't even bother asking about the price.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Simon Wong, president of the Federation of Restaurants and Related Trades, said business activity for the catering sector was better than expected.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said that while many Hongkongers travel to the mainland during the holiday, those who stay in the city are more willing to dine out.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Overall, I believe business over the Lunar New Year holiday is more than 10 percent better than last year,” he said.

    Trump bans 'transgender ideology' from military

<img alt='US President Donald Trump has signed an executive order to get what his administration calls "transgender ideology" out of the military. Photo: Reuters' src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1789451_1_20250128160041.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump on Monday said he had signed an executive order ridding the military of what he called "transgender ideology," in a potentially major setback for LGBT rights.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a series of orders related to the military that Trump told reporters he had signed on Air Force One, he also called for the building of a US version of Israel's Iron Dome missile defence system.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Republican signed further orders reinstating service members dismissed for refusing to take the Covid vaccine, and extending a wider government crackdown on diversity programmes to the armed forces.
  <br>
  <br>
  "To ensure that we have the most lethal fighting force in the world, we will get transgender ideology the hell out of our military," Trump told a Republican Congressional retreat earlier in Miami.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has previously promised to bring back a ban on transgender troops and demonised any recognition of gender diversity.
  <br>
  <br>
  In his order, Trump claimed the armed forces "have been afflicted with radical gender ideology to appease activists" and that "many mental and physical health conditions are incompatible with active duty."
  <br>
  <br>
  The order said "adoption of a gender identity inconsistent with an individual's sex conflicts with a soldier's commitment to an honourable, truthful, and disciplined lifestyle, even in one's personal life."
  <br>
  <br>
  "A man's assertion that he is a woman, and his requirement that others honour this falsehood, is not consistent with the humility and selflessness required of a service member," it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The orders came at the start of Trump's second week back in the White House and on the day a welcome ceremony was held at the Pentagon for his new defence secretary, military veteran and Fox News personality Pete Hegseth.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Thank you for your leadership Mr President. We will execute!" Hegseth -- who was confirmed last week despite concerns over his inexperience, and alleged record of heavy drinking and domestic violence -- said on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  Transgender Americans have faced a roller coaster of changing policies on military service in recent years, with Democratic administrations seeking to permit them to serve openly while Trump has repeatedly sought to keep them out of the ranks.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US military lifted a ban on transgender troops serving in the armed forces in 2016, during Democrat Barack Obama's second term as president.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under that policy, trans troops already serving were permitted to do so openly, and transgender recruits were set to start being accepted by July 1, 2017.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the first Trump administration postponed that date to 2018 before deciding to reverse the policy entirely, sparking criticism from rights groups.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's Democratic successor Joe Biden moved to reverse the restrictions just days after he took office in 2021, saying all Americans qualified to serve should be able to do so.
  <br>
  <br>
  While the number of transgender troops in the US military is fairly small -- with estimates of around 15,000 out of more than two million uniformed service members -- their dismissal would reduce US forces at a time when the country is already facing difficulties recruiting new personnel.
  <br>
  <br>
  Biden's defence secretary Lloyd Austin appeared to criticise Trump's plans during a farewell address earlier this month, saying: "Any military that turns away qualified patriots who are eager to serve is just making itself smaller and weaker."
  <br>
  <br>
  Transgender issues have roiled US politics in recent years, as states controlled by Democrats and Republicans have moved in opposite directions on policies ranging from medical treatment to what books on the topic are allowed in public or school libraries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has meanwhile repeatedly promised to build a version of the Iron Dome system that Israel has used to shoot down missiles fired by Hamas from Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he ignored the fact that the system is designed for short-range threats, making it ill-suited to defending against intercontinental missiles that are the main danger to the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We need to immediately begin the construction of a state-of-the-art Iron Dome missile defense shield," Trump said in Miami, adding that it would be "made right here in the USA." (AFP)

 Chief Executive John Lee issued a Lunar New Year message on Tuesday, saying that Hong Kong would be agile and resilient in the Year of the Snake, and would continue to seek innovation and change.
 <br>
  <br>
  In the pre-recorded message, John Lee said the city has had a year full of cheer, including the gift of two giant pandas from Beijing and the birth of two panda cubs - which will greet the public in mid-February.
  <br>
  <br>
  The video also featured various snake and panda decorations, along with a variety of Lunar New Year specialities.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee also wished good health and good fortune to Hongkongers in the coming year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This year is the Year of the Snake - which is nimble and agile, and symbolises prosperity and wealth. This year, Hong Kong will again show off its agility, and resilience, with flexible thinking - to innovate, reform and develop," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "My wife and I wish Hong Kong's people good health in the Year of the Snake. May you have joy, prosperity and good fortune," he added.

 Cross border coach operators will increase their frequency of services by 20 percent over the Lunar New Year holiday, the Hong Kong Guangdong Boundary Crossing Bus Association said today.
 <br>
  <br>
  Vice chairman Freeman Cheung told an RTHK radio programme that he expects the city to see the highest number of Hongkongers heading north on Thursday and Friday, while the number of travellers returning from the mainland is expected to peak on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Usually, cross-border coaches are less than 50 percent full. But during the Lunar New Year holiday and other festivities, this can rise to 80 percent - or even 100 percent,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cheung welcomed the government's decision not to operate border checkpoints beyond the usual hours during the period, as he expects there will only be a slightly higher flow of tourists on the second day of the holiday due to the fireworks display.
  <br>
  <br>
  He believes by arranging more coaches at hotspots such as Wan Chai, West Kowloon and Prince Edward an hour after the fireworks show – which he expected to be the peak period of travellers heading home – they would be able to divert the flow of visitors.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also said the move would allow operators to allocate more resources for the rush hour during the daytime.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on the same programme, local florist Yeung Siu-lung pointed out that business had improved by 10 percent compared with the same period last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said he had not raised prices in recent years amid the poor economy and inflation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Apart from selling orchids at the Victoria Park flower market, he also grows and sells them in Yuen Long.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The people who buy more flowers tend to drive, and they get pots. Why do I say business is up by 10 percent this year? It's because the old customers have recommended the market to new customers. There are more unfamiliar faces,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeung also said that there was a need to boost sales to make customers happy on the final full day of the market, before it closes tomorrow morning.

 A Hong Kong resident who had been detained for illegal work in Myanmar returned to the SAR late Monday night.
 <br>
  <br>
  Accompanied by members of a government task force, the man arrived at the Hong Kong International Airport via a flight from Bangkok. He was subsequently taken to the airport police station.
  <br>
  <br>
  During a press briefing, Assistant Secretary for Security Paddy Yuen said the man is very happy to be back.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He was grateful to see us head to Thailand to follow up on his case, and very excited to be able to return to Hong Kong, and reunite with his family before the Lunar New Year," Yuen said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The official said he won’t disclose additional details of the case, including whether a ransom was paid, to avoid complicating the future course of action.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also thanked Chinese diplomats in Southeast Asia, as well as local authorities for assisting in the rescue operation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yuen added that work is still underway to bring the rest of the victims home.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We must also remember that there are still ten Hong Kong residents who have not been released," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The assistant security chief reminded Hongkongers to stay vigilant against job offers that promise high salaries without the need for professional skills, or require the person to transport goods between places.

    Neymar tipped to return to Santos after Al-Hilal exit

<img alt="Neymar was held to just seven games in two seasons for Al-Hilal due to injuries. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1789417_1_20250128094813.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Brazilian star Neymar has ended his injury-plagued 18-month stay in Saudi Arabia as his club, Al-Hilal said they had "agreed to terminate the player's contract by mutual consent".
 <br>
  <br>
  "The club expresses its thanks and appreciation to Neymar for what he has provided throughout his career with Al-Hilal, and wish the player success in his career," said a club statement posted on social media," the team said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 32-year-old former Barcelona and Paris Saint-Germain forward played just seven times since joining the club in August 2023, despite a reported salary of around US$104 million a year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Neymar, the subject of what is still the biggest transfer in football history when he joined Paris Saint-Germain from Barcelona in 2017 for a fee of US$230 million, joined Al-Hilal in August 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  He followed fellow superstars Cristiano Ronaldo and Karim Benzema to the lucrative Saudi league.
  <br>
  <br>
  But two months after his arrival in Riyadh, he ruptured a cruciate ligament in his left knee while playing for Brazil in a World Cup qualifier in October 2023, which kept him on the sidelines for a year.
  <br>
  <br>
  He returned for Al Hilal with two brief appearances in October and November but injured a hamstring and has not played since. He said he is targeting the World Cup.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He can no longer play at the level we are used to," the club's coach, Jorge Jesus, said recently. Things have become difficult for him, unfortunately."
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier in January, Neymar said he was aiming to play in the 2026 in the US, Canada and Mexico.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I know this will be my last World Cup, my last shot, my last chance and I will do everything I can to play in it," he told CNN.
  <br>
  <br>
  A return to Brazil would likely be the last chance for a player who is his country's all-time leading scorer with 79 goals in 127 matches. (AFP)

<img alt="The ongoing drama between the Miami Heat and Jimmy Butler may be coming to a head. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1789402_1_20250128071232.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Miami Heat indefinitely suspended Jimmy Butler after the disgruntled forward walked out of a practice session, reportedly when he was told he would be coming off the bench for the NBA team.
 <br>
  <br>
  "The Miami Heat are suspending Jimmy Butler without pay effective immediately for an indefinite period to last no fewer than five games," the Heat said in a statement posted on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The suspension is due to a continued pattern of disregard of team rules, engaging in conduct detrimental to the team and intentionally withholding services," it read. "This includes walking out of practice earlier today."
  <br>
  <br>
  It's the third time this month the Heat have suspended the 35-year-old Butler, who had been expected back on Monday from a two-game ban for missing a team flight.
  <br>
  <br>
  He had previously been suspended for seven games for "multiple instances of conduct detrimental to the team".
  <br>
  <br>
  Butler, in his 15th NBA campaign, sparked the Heat into the 2020 NBA Finals, where they lost to the Los Angeles Lakers, and the 2023 finals, where they lost to Denver.
  <br>
  <br>
  But even before his first suspension, Butler had indicated he wanted a trade. Initially resistant, the Heat have said the would "listen to offers" from other teams for the six-time All-Star.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minimum five-game suspension announced on Monday would run through the NBA's mid-season trade deadline on February 6.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Miami Herald reported that the Heat would determine whether the suspension would continue after that if Butler remains on their roster after the deadline.
  <br>
  <br>
  Miami's star guard Tyler Herro said the team is getting used to playing amid the uncertainty surrounding Butler.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It kind of feels normal now at this point," Herro said in comments reported by the Herald. "It's kind of just what it is. Nothing is guaranteed, so we just got to be ready to roll with whatever cards we're dealt with tonight."
  <br>
  <br>
  Just past the halfway point in the regular season, the Heat are eighth in the Eastern Conference with their playoff chances in the balance. (AFP)

    Spain coach De la Fuente extends contract
   </title>
   <link>
    https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1789401-20250128.htm

<img alt="De La Fuente's contract will run until 2028. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1789401_1_20250128071112.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Spain's Euro 2024 winning coach Luis de la Fuente has extended his contract until 2028, the Spanish football federation said in a statement.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 63-year-old has been in the post since 2022, guiding Spain to the Nations League title in 2023 and then to victory against England in last year's Euro final.
  <br>
  <br>
  His contract extension includes the 2026 World Cup in the United States, Canada and Mexico, and Euro 2028 in Britain and Ireland.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm the most self-critical and I'm not afraid to take the plunge if I'm convinced of something," De la Fuente told a press conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I will continue on the same path that has brought us here, trying to improve and grow," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  De la Fuente previously coached Spain age-group teams, winning both the European under-19 and under-21 championships.
  <br>
  <br>
  He took over the senior side from Luis Enrique following Spain's last-16 exit from the 2022 World Cup against Morocco.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I was convinced of where I wanted to be. I'm at home, with the RFEF, and very happy. We never thought of another option," De la Fuente said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I thank the RFEF for their effort," he continued. "I feel even happier than I was because I have been so well treated. We work from stability."
  <br>
  <br>
  Spain powered to a record-breaking fourth European Championship title last year, winning all seven of their matches in Germany.
  <br>
  <br>
  La Roja will start their 2026 World Cup qualifying campaign later this year, after the completion of the Nations League. In that competition, they face Netherlands in the quarter-finals in March.
  <br>
  <br>
  Spain will be one of the favourites for the 2026 World Cup, boasting a young squad including teenage star Lamine Yamal.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If I let myself be carried away by euphoria I could promise many things," said De la Fuente. "But I only promise enthusiasm, effort and work to achieve our goals. Give everything to achieve something. We have a lot of football potential, but so do our rivals."
  <br>
  <br>
  If De la Fuente sees out his extended contract, he will become Spain's longest-serving coach since Vicente del Bosque spent eight years in charge, during which they won the 2010 World Cup and Euro 2012. (AFP)

    Fuji Media bosses resign over sexual assault scandal

<img alt="Fuji Media has promised an independent investigation by a third-party committee, which will be made up of three lawyers. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1789378_1_20250128012750.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Japan's Fuji Media said on Monday its chairman and the head of its TV unit would step down immediately amidst a probe into alleged sexual misconduct by a celebrity TV host.
 <br>
  <br>
  The scandal, which has led to an exodus of advertisers and investor calls for a management shake-up, has also raised concerns about the exploitation of women in Japan's entertainment industry.
  <br>
  <br>
  In December, Japanese magazines accused Masahiro Nakai, a TV host and leader of the former boy band SMAP, of sexual misconduct. While Nakai has worked for many of Japan's TV networks, the dinner at which the incident occurred was reportedly arranged by one of the broadcaster's executives.
  <br>
  <br>
  One of the magazines, Shukan Bunshun, has also reported the same executive had in a separate event gathered female TV personalities at a hotel to act as entertainment for Nakai and other celebrities.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nakai, 52, has apologised for causing "trouble" and announced his retirement from show business. He acknowledged reaching a settlement with another party but has not addressed the allegations directly. Nakai did not respond to a request for comment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fuji Media said Chairman Shuji Kanoh and the head of its TV unit Koichi Minato would step down effective Monday. Another TV executive, Kenji Shimizu, will lead the TV unit.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to tabloid magazines Josei Seven and Shukan Bunshun, a woman was invited to a dinner in June 2023 with a Fuji TV executive that Nakai also attended. But the executive backed out at the last minute leaving her alone with Nakai and there was a sexual act against her will, they reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  "First of all, as a person, I would like to offer my sincere apologies to the woman involved to whom we were unable to show adequate care and awareness of human rights," Kanoh told a press conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  A Fuji Media spokesperson said the company became aware of the woman's complaint that June but did not widely investigate it or report it due to privacy concerns and settlement talks between the parties.
  <br>
  <br>
  The company also said on Monday that it had questioned an employee multiple times about the dinner and that the employee had denied knowing about or arranging the dinner.
  <br>
  <br>
  Outrage over the scandal grew after a January 17 news conference by Minato that was closed to most of the press with Minato answering few questions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dozens of big-name firms including Toyota and cosmetics giant Kao have suspended advertising with Fuji and most of its ads are currently public service announcements.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fuji Media has promised an independent investigation by a third-party committee. It will be made up of three lawyers and is scheduled to submit a report by the end of March. (Reuters)

    Low-cost Chinese AI startup shocks Wall Street

<img alt="The chatbot, developed in Hangzhou, reportedly matches the capacity of US AI pace-setters, sending shockwaves through US markets overnight.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Nasdaq posted its biggest one-day percentage drop since December 18 on Monday as a low-cost Chinese artificial intelligence model prompted a steep selloff in US chipmakers.
 <br>
  <br>
  AI leader Nvidia sank 17 percent, and about US$590 billion in stock market value, the deepest ever one-day loss for a company on Wall Street, according to LSEG data. It was more than double the previous one-day record loss, set by Nvidia last September.
  <br>
  <br>
  An index of semiconductor stocks dropped 9.2 percent in its biggest single-day percentage fall since March 2020.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chinese startup DeepSeek has rolled out a free assistant that it says uses lower-cost chips and less data, raising questions about investor expectations that AI will drive demand along a supply chain from chipmakers to data centers.
  <br>
  <br>
  DeepSeek's AI Assistant by Monday had overtaken US rival ChatGPT in downloads from Apple's App Store.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kim Forrest, chief investment officer at Bokeh Capital Partners in Pittsburgh, said there are still many questions about the DeepSeek model and its impact.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Today is a drubbing for these (AI leader) stocks, but I don't necessarily think whatever's going to happen in the short while here - the next couple of days - is where they are ultimately valued," she said. Optimism over AI and gains in Nvidia and other big technology-related shares helped to drive the stock market's sharp gains in 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 289.33 points, or 0.65 percent, to 44,713.58, the S&P 500 lost 88.96 points, or 1.46  percent, to 6,012.28 and the Nasdaq Composite lost 612.47 points, or 3.07 percent, to 19,341.83.
  <br>
  <br>
  The S&P 500 registered its biggest one-day percentage fall since January 10.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among other big tech-related companies, Microsoft shares fell 2.1 percent and Google-parent Alphabet dropped 4.2 percent, while AI server maker Dell Technologies declined 8.7 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Data centre operators also tanked, including Digital Realty, which fell 8.7 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Power companies, which are expected to see higher demand from energy-intensive data centres needed to develop AI technology, also fell. Vistra dropped 28.3 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tech stocks are likely to stay in focus this week, with some big technology names, including Microsoft, due to post-quarterly results.
  <br>
  <br>
  Investors are keen to hear from the Federal Reserve, which is widely expected to hold its lending rate steady in its first interest-rate decision of the year due on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Market watchers also were digesting news that the US and Colombia had pulled back from the brink of a trade war on Sunday after the White House said the South American nation had agreed to accept military aircraft carrying deported migrants. (Reuters)

 Hang Seng Bank has been fined HK$66.4 million for regulatory failures and overcharging clients.

  <br>
  The Securities and Futures Commission on Monday said it found significant regulatory breaches on the bank’s sale of collective investment scheme and derivative products between February 2014 and May 2023, during which clients were overcharged and inadequately informed about the financial benefits.
  <br>
  <br>
  It added that Hang Seng Bank received at least HK$22.4 million in excess fees from these transactions.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SFC concluded that the bank had failed to operate with due care and diligence, ensure adequate disclosure to clients, prevent conflicts of interest, and comply with regulatory requirements necessary to protect client interests.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bank, for its part, said it accepts the investigation findings, adding that it has already compensated the affected clients and taken remedial actions to rectify and strengthen its internal controls.

<img alt="The Official Receiver's Office says it was only notified of the incident a month after it happened. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1789361_1_20250127205747.jpg&q=80">

<div class="itemFullText">
 The government office responsible for providing insolvency services has issued an apology after magnetic tapes containing information of about 76,000 people went missing.
 <br>
  <br>
  However, it stressed chances of a data leak is "extremely low".
  <br>
  <br>
  The Official Receiver's Office revealed on Monday that seven magnetic backup tapes were lost while being delivered from Immigration Tower to Queensway Government Offices on December 23 last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the office only received a report about the incident last Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The [Official Receiver's Office] expresses sincere apologies for the loss and for the delay in reporting the incident," a spokesperson for the office said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tapes were stored in a locked protective case and information on them had been encrypted by a system "used extensively in government and military applications", according to the office.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The [Official Receiver's Office] considers that the risk of leakage of personal data from the tapes is extremely low. Based on the current investigation, there is no evidence that the data contained on the tapes has been read or compromised," the spokesperson said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The tapes contained personal data of about 76,000 individuals, including creditors of insolvency cases and serving staff of the [Official Receiver's Office]."
  <br>
  <br>
  The office said it has made changes to existing procedures and is conducting a thorough investigation, including on the delay in reporting the incident to senior management.
  <br>
  <br>
  Appropriate disciplinary actions will be taken, the office added.

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping on Monday said the country has made solid progress in advancing Chinese modernisation amid "complex and challenging" situations over the past twelve months.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a high-level reception ahead of the Lunar New Year, the President touched on the country’s achievements.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the Year of the Dragon, we demonstrated vitality and a can-do spirit. We endured storms and saw the rainbow," Xi said at the reception held by the CPC Central Committee and the State Council.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Faced with complex and challenging situations, China responded with composure and implemented a range of comprehensive measures, overcame difficulties and forged ahead with determination.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Going forward, the President expressed confidence that the country will continue to forge ahead.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will undoubtedly break new ground in reform and development as long as we strengthen our conviction and confidence, confront problems and obstacles directly, and tackle risks and challenges without hesitation."

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chinese firm DeepSeek's artificial intelligence chatbot has soared to the top of the Apple Store's download charts, stunning industry insiders and analysts with its ability to match its US competitors at a lower cost.
 <br>
  <br>
  The programme has shaken up the tech industry and hit US titans including Nvidia and Meta, which has spent vast sums of cash to get ahead in the fast-developing AI sector.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nasdaq futures slumped and technology shares slid in Japan on Monday as surging popularity of DeepSeek's product wobbled investors' faith in the profitability of AI and the sector's voracious demand for high-tech chips.
  <br>
  <br>
  DeepSeek has rolled out a free assistant it says uses lower-cost chips and less data, seemingly challenging a widespread bet in financial markets that AI will drive demand along a supply chain from chipmakers to data centres.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's a case of a crowded trade, and now DeepSeek is giving a reason for investors and traders to unwind," said Wong Kok Hoong, head of equity sales trading at Maybank.
  <br>
  <br>
  AI-focused startup investor SoftBank Group slid more than eight percent, on course for its biggest one-day fall since September 30.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last week it announced a US$19 billion commitment to fund Stargate, a data-centre joint venture with OpenAI. (Agencies)

    Exchange Fund investment income drops in 2024

<img alt="Eddie Yue, HKMA chief executive, says the global investment outlook remains challenging in 2025. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1789327_1_20250127181821.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) on Monday said income from the exchange fund fell by 3.1 percent in 2024 to HK$219 billion.
 <br>
  <br>
  For the whole year, income from bond investments dropped 6.3 percent year-on-year to HK$135.6 billion, while income from non-local equity investments declined 6.7 percent to HK$68.7 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  The foreign exchange valuation of non-Hong Kong dollar assets also fell by HK$35.6 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, income from local equity investments gained HK$21.8 billion, while returns on other investments stood at HK$28.5 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2023, the fund used to defend the Hong Kong dollar saw a HK$226 billion gain, its best ever result.
  <br>
  <br>
  HKMA chief executive Eddie Yue said the fourth-quarter loss last year was due to increased volatility in the global markets following geopolitical risks, as well as increasing concerns over inflation.
  <br>
  <br>
  The strong US dollar also weighed on other major currencies during the period.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yue said further challenges lie ahead.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The new US administration's policies on the economy, tax and trade could add uncertainties to the inflation path, and that, in turn, affects how much room the Fed has for adjusting monetary policy," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[And] any escalation in trade frictions among major economies or geopolitical situation could impact real economic activities, and may also trigger volatility in the financial markets."

<div class="itemFullText">
 Property developer China Vanke on Monday said its chairman Yu Liang and CEO Zhu Jiusheng had resigned, amid concerns over the company's liquidity as it faces several debt maturity deadlines this year.
 <br>
  <br>
  Vanke warned Monday that it incurred major losses in 2024, a filing at the Hong Kong Stock Exchange showed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vanke said it expected a net loss of approximately 45 billion yuan (US$6.2 billion) in 2024, citing reasons including "the continuous market downturn" and "sales and gross profit margins (that) turned out to be lower than investment expectations". (Agencies)

    Congolese rebels say they've captured city of Goma

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Rwanda-backed rebels claimed they captured eastern Congo’s largest city of Goma early on Monday, as the United Nations described a mass panic among its two million people and Congo’s government said the rebel advance was a “declaration of war."
 <br>
  <br>
  The M23 rebels announced the city's capture in a statement minutes before a 48-hour deadline expired that had been imposed by the group for the Congolese army to surrender their weapons.
  <br>
  <br>
  Early on Monday morning, gunfire was heard throughout the city, according to two aid workers sheltering there who were not authorised to speak to the media.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, the rebels urged residents of Goma to remain calm and for members of the Congolese military to assemble at the central stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  The M23 rebels’ offensive in the heart of the mineral-rich region threatens to dramatically worsen one of Africa’s longest wars and further displace civilians.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to a United Nations report, over a third of the population of North Kivu province where Goma is located are currently displaced and the capture of Goma will likely exacerbate the situation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Late Sunday night, UN peacekeepers began to process members of the military who had begun to surrender on the outskirts of the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  Congolese government spokesman Patrick Muyaya made a statement in a video posted on X calling for the protection of civilians and saying the country is “in a war situation where the news is changing.”
  <br>
  <br>
  French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot said the Rwanda-backed offensive "must stop", expressing his country's solidarity with the Democratic Republic of Congo.
  <br>
  <br>
  With international pressure mounting for an end to the battle for Goma, Kenya announced on Sunday that Congolese President Felix Tshisekedi and Rwandan President Paul Kagame had agreed to attend a summit in the next two days.
  <br>
  <br>
  M23 fighters and 3,000 to 4,000 Rwandan soldiers had been laying siege to Goma for several days, according to the United Nations and security sources. (Agencies)

Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1789329_1_20250127174138.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The world marked 80th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz on Monday, with some of the few remaining survivors attending ceremonies at the site of the Nazi death camp.
 <br>
  <br>
  Auschwitz was the largest of the extermination camps and has become a symbol of Nazi Germany's genocide of six million European Jews, one million of whom died at the site between 1940 and 1945, along with more than 100,000 non-Jews.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Monday morning, Polish President Andrzej Duda laid flowers at the site alongside survivors, some wearing scarves in the blue-and-white stripes of their death camp uniforms.
  <br>
  <br>
  Around 50 survivors were expected at the main commemoration outside the gates of Auschwitz II-Birkenau alongside dozens of world leaders.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This year we will focus on the survivors and their message," Auschwitz Museum spokesman Pawel Sawicki told AFP.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There will not be any speeches by politicians."
  <br>
  <br>
  Survivors around the world spoke about the need to preserve the memory of what happened when there will no longer be living witnesses.
  <br>
  <br>
  They also warned about rising hatred and anti-Semitism around the world and spoke of their fears about history repeating itself.
  <br>
  <br>
  Organisers said it could be the last major anniversary with such a large group of survivors.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We all know that in 10 years it will not be possible to have a large group for the 90th anniversary," Sawicki said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Auschwitz was created in 1940 using barracks in Oswiecim, southern Poland. Its name was Germanised into Auschwitz by the Nazis.
  <br>
  <br>
  The first 728 Polish political prisoners arrived on June 14 of that year.
  <br>
  <br>
  On January 17, 1945, as Soviet troops advanced, the SS forced 60,000 emaciated prisoners to walk west in what became known as the "Death March".
  <br>
  <br>
  From January 21-26, the Germans blew up the Birkenau gas chambers and crematoria and withdrew as Soviet troops approached.
  <br>
  <br>
  On January 27, Soviet troops arrived, finding 7,000 survivors.
  <br>
  <br>
  The day of its liberation has been designated by the United Nations as Holocaust Remembrance Day.
  <br>
  <br>
  Until the conflict with Ukraine in 2022, a Russian delegation had always attended the annual liberation ceremony but Moscow will be barred again this year. (AFP)

    Palestinians begin returning to northern Gaza

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Masses of displaced Palestinians began streaming towards the north of the war-battered Gaza Strip on Monday after Israel and Hamas said they had reached a deal for the release of another six hostages.
 <br>
  <br>
  The breakthrough preserves a fragile ceasefire and paves the way for more hostage-prisoner swaps under an agreement aimed at ending the more than 15-month conflict, which has devastated the Gaza Strip and displaced nearly all its residents.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel had been preventing Palestinians from returning to their homes in northern Gaza, accusing Hamas of violating the terms of the truce, but Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said late on Sunday they would be allowed to pass after the new deal was reached.
  <br>
  <br>
  Crowds began making their way north along a coastal road on foot Monday morning, carrying what belongings they could.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's a great feeling when you go back home, back to your family, relatives and loved ones, and inspect your house -- if it is still a house," displaced Gazan Ibrahim Abu Hassera told AFP.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamas called the return "a victory" for Palestinians that "signals the failure and defeat of the plans for occupation and displacement".
  <br>
  <br>
  Its ally Islamic Jihad, meanwhile, called it a "response to all those who dream of displacing our people".
  <br>
  <br>
  The comments came after US President Donald Trump floated an idea to "clean out" Gaza and resettle Palestinians in Jordan and Egypt, drawing condemnation from regional leaders.
  <br>
  <br>
  President Mahmud Abbas, whose Palestinian Authority is based in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, issued a "strong rejection and condemnation of any projects" aimed at displacing Palestinians from Gaza, his office said.
  <br>
  <br>
  For Palestinians, any attempt to move them from Gaza would evoke dark memories of what the Arab world calls the "Nakba", or catastrophe -- the mass displacement of Palestinians during Israel's creation in 1948.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We say to Trump and the whole world: we will not leave Palestine or Gaza, no matter what happens," said displaced Gaza resident Rashad al-Naji.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump had floated the idea to reporters Saturday aboard Air Force One: "You're talking about probably a million and half people, and we just clean out that whole thing."
  <br>
  <br>
  Moving Gaza's roughly 2.4 million inhabitants could be done "temporarily or could be long term", he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel's far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich -- who opposed the truce deal and has voiced support for re-establishing Israeli settlements in Gaza -- called Trump's suggestion of "a great idea".
  <br>
  <br>
  The Arab League rejected the idea, warning against "attempts to uproot the Palestinian people from their land", saying their forced displacement could "only be called ethnic cleansing".
  <br>
  <br>
  Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi said "our rejection of the displacement of Palestinians is firm and will not change. Jordan is for Jordanians and Palestine is for Palestinians."
  <br>
  <br>
  Egypt's foreign ministry said it rejected any infringement of Palestinians' "inalienable rights".
  <br>
  <br>
  The truce has brought a surge of food, fuel, medicines and other aid into rubble-strewn Gaza, but the UN says "the humanitarian situation remains dire".
  <br>
  <br>
  Of the 251 hostages seized during Hamas's October 7, 2023 attack that ignited the war, 87 remain in Gaza, including 34 the military says are dead.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hamas attack resulted in the deaths of 1,210 people, mostly civilians.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed at least 47,306 people in Gaza, the majority civilians, according to figures from the Hamas-run territory's health ministry that the United Nations considers reliable. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Director of Immigration on Monday said he is confident that Hong Kong’s border checkpoints have enough capacity to handle an influx of tourists during the Lunar New Year holiday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Border crossings won’t operate beyond the usual hours during the period.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a year-end press conference, Benson Kwok said he expects 7.3 million land border crossings during the eight-day holiday.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Our border capacity is enough to handle the large crowds of tourists. But of course we hope the travellers will arrive or depart Hong Kong out of the peak periods, so that they don’t waste too much time at the control points,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kwok also said there were a total of 298 million inbound and outbound trips last year, 40 percent up from 2023 and close to pre-pandemic levels.
  <br>
  <br>
  On 10 Hongkongers held prisoner in Southeast Asia and forced to take part in scams, Kwok said the department will continue to assist security officials in trying to get them released.
  <br>
  <br>
  “There are quite a lot of challenges but the Immigration Department is supporting the special team to provide assistance to the assistance seekers,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We sincerely hope that our special team can help them to come back to Hong Kong in the very very near future, and even to enjoy Chinese New Year with their family members.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, Kwok said children aged seven or above with an SAR passport and permanent Hong Kong identity card will soon be able to use e-channels at control points.
  <br>
  <br>
  The immigration chief said he expects around 200,000 children will benefit from the new measure.

<img alt="TWGH CROSS Centre’s clinical psychologist Christopher Sin, left, said a lack of understanding would cause more people to use the drug.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A survey by a drug counselling centre under the Tung Wah Group of Hospitals found that 30 percent of respondents were unaware of the harmful effects of the "space oil drug."
 <br>
  <br>
  The centre polled around 1,600 citizens aged between 15 and 56 from September to December last year. About half of them were under the age of 15, and almost 80 percent of them were students.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also found that more than 70 percent of those surveyed mistakenly believed nicotine and synthetic cannabinoids were the main ingredient of the drug.
  <br>
  <br>
  The hospital group's CROSS Centre’s clinical psychologist Christopher Sin on Monday said a lack of understanding would lead to more young people using the drug.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If their perception of space oil is [that] the ingredients are nicotine or cannabinoids, then they will easily be in contact with this kind of harmful substance under peer influence or via internet advertisements," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Speaking of the long term, if they don't have a [good] understanding of the ingredients, this will increase the chances of [them] depending on this substance to manage their life hassles or other life issues," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sin pointed out that respondents might also want to try the drug out of curiosity.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the centre said more than 10 percent of its current 526 substance abuse cases had taken the space oil drug. Among them, 55 percent were minors, with the youngest being 12.
  <br>
  <br>
  The charity called for more promotion of the harmful effects through various social media platforms.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also urged parents and schools to take action if they think youngsters have been taking the substance while being aware of some of the tell-tale side effects, such as losing control of one's emotions, loss of balance and convulsive movements.

 As the Year of the Snake approaches, various floats and international performing groups are putting the finishing touches on their preparations for the annual Chinese New Year night parade.
 <br>
  <br>
  Organised by the Hong Kong Tourism Board and sponsored by Cathay Pacific, the parade will kick off at the Hong Kong Cultural Centre Piazza, winding its way through Canton, Haiphong and Nathan roads, before reaching the Sheraton Hong Kong Hotel and Towers.
  <br>
  <br>
  This year’s festivities, under the theme "Unfold a Year of Good Fortune", will feature nine floats showcasing unique elements from the SAR, alongside 46 performing groups from around the globe, to highlight the city's reputation as an events capital.

    Jeju Air crash report confirms bird strike

<img alt="Bird feathers and bloodstains were found in both engines of the Jeju Air plane that crashed in December, according to a preliminary investigation released on Monday. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1789319_1_20250127163544.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The first report on last month’s Jeju Air crash in South Korea confirmed bird strikes in the plane's engines, though officials haven't determined the cause of the accident that killed all but two of the 181 people on board .
 <br>
  <br>
  The preliminary accident report released on Monday said feathers and bird blood stains were found in both engines.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The samples were sent to specialised organisations for DNA analysis, and a domestic organisation identified them as belonging to Baikal Teals,” the report said, referring to a migratory duck.
  <br>
  <br>
  The report also said the plane's black box stopped recording about four minutes before the crash.
  <br>
  <br>
  South Korea earlier announced it would remove a concrete structure at the end of the airport's runway that was involved in the crash.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some experts have said that Muan International Airport’s localiser — a set of antennas in a concrete structure that guide aircraft during landings — likely made the crash of the Jeju Air plane worse.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Boeing 737-800 skidded off the airport’s runaway on December 29 after its landing gear failed to deploy, slamming into the concrete structure and bursting into flames.
  <br>
  <br>
  Many observers said the structure should have been made with lighter materials that could break more easily upon impact.
  <br>
  <br>
  Investigators have said that air traffic controllers warned the pilot about possible bird strikes two minutes before the aircraft issued a distress signal confirming that a bird strike had occurred, after which the pilot attempted an emergency landing. (AP)

 Officials closed the Cheung Sha Wan Lunar New Year fair for several hours on Monday after some stalls were damaged by strong winds overnight.
 <br>
  <br>
  Goods were left scattered on the ground and scaffolding was damaged, with a similar scene at a fair in Tsz Wan Shan.
  <br>
  <br>
  A woman selling orchids at Cheung Sha Wan told RTHK she thinks she has lost tens of thousands of dollars due to the damage.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For the entire year, the two days before the Lunar New Year is the most important for business. This is really miserable for farmers," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Environment Secretary Tse Chin-wan inspected the scene in the morning.
  <br>
  <br>
  The fair reopened at around 3pm after damaged scaffolding was removed.

 Radio Television Hong Kong (RTHK) is launching a new season of the series "The Nitty Gritty of Law" with the Law Society next month to explore different legal issues with experts in the field.
 <br>
  <br>
  RTHK assistant director Vincent Lee told a launch ceremony on Monday that the inaugural season of the programme, which was solely in audio form, had been well-received.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the coming season will also be aired on television and online platforms, while introducing a radio drama to promote legal knowledge.
  <br>
  <br>
  Roden Tong, the president of the Law Society, said he hopes audiences can learn more about the law through the programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  The programme, which has 16 episodes, will be aired on Sundays with the first episode launching on February 2.
  <br>
  <br>
  The episodes will first be aired from 12.15pm to 1pm on RTHK Radio 1, before being broadcast on RTHK TV 31 on 7pm. They are also available on RTHK's website and mobile app.
  <br>
  <br>
  Legal experts, such as former secretary for justice Elsie Leung and a number of ex-Law Society heads, will be invited to the show to discuss various legal topics, such as family law, criminal law, and intellectual property.

 Monday marks the 28th day of the 12th lunar month.
 <br>
  <br>
  According to Chinese tradition, it is a day designated for "spring cleaning", when families deep-clean their homes in the run up to the Lunar New Year and put up new "fai chuns" -- red banners bearing auspicious phrases.
  <br>
  <br>
  While the market is flooded with mass produced, digitally-printed "fai chuns", many people still prefer the more traditional, handwritten ones that are becoming quite rare these days.
  <br>
  <br>
  RTHK visited an elderly calligraphy master in North Point, and asked him why it's so important to preserve this traditional craft.

<img alt="Rosanna Law says the government hopes to review the positioning of performance venues by the end of this year. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1789282_1_20250127121148.jpg&q=85">

<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism Rosanna Law said the government would conduct a strategic review of the use of the city's performance venues.
 <br>
  <br>
  Law expected this would be completed by the end of the year.
  <br>
  <br>
  In an interview with Ta Kung Pao published on Monday, Law said Hong Kong would have more venues to stage more kinds of performances and sports events.
  <br>
  <br>
  These include the Kai Tak Sports Park, and the WestK Performing Arts Centre that is set to be completed next year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Airport Authority also recently announced that it would build the second phase of the AsiaWorld-Expo to expand the total exhibition space to 100,000 square metres.
  <br>
  <br>
  The project is set for completion in 2028.
  <br>
  <br>
  “This venue has a favourable location, [it’s] near the airport, and [it’s also] convenient for Zhuhai and Macau travellers to head to. I have high hopes [for the venue],” Law said.
  <br>
  <br>
  With more venues, she said the SAR would be able to stage more events.
  <br>
  <br>
  “If there is a better allocation, world-class venues can carry out more world-class performances.”
  <br>
  <br>
  In another interview with Wen Wei Po, the minister stressed the city has to focus on both quality and quantity for tourism development.
