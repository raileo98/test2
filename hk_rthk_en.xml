<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Development Bernadette Linn on Saturday said one or two sizeable land parcels from the Northern Metropolis are expected to be put up for tender in the second half of this year.
 <br>
  <br>
  The government has received 22 submissions indicating their interest to develop the three pilot areas of large-scale land disposal located in Hung Shui Kiu Ha Tsuen, Fanling North, and San Tin Technopole.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a radio programme, Linn said the submissions were made by property developers, contractors, conglomerates and logistic companies. She said 60 percent were local companies, and the others were from the mainland.
  <br>
  <br>
  With the different opinions received, the minister said she was confident about the bidding, and that the government would be able to write the tender terms more accurately.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We expect to see some output in the next two years, including building or formation works. These can be rolled out gradually," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We normally give developers six to seven years in total, although there were opinions that the time was insufficient. We have to strike a balance because we want to speed up development."
  <br>
  <br>
  She said the land parcels are expected to be put up for tender this year, while the one in the San Tin Technopole may only be ready next year, after the government repossesses the land.
  <br>
  <br>
  Linn added that the government will not rule out the possibility of launching the tenders under a "two-envelope approach", which means non-premium factors will be considered.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the Development Bureau launched a two-year pilot scheme to relax the restrictions under land leases on public spaces of shopping malls, giving them more flexibility to host activities.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister said the scheme aims to boost the economy by encouraging shopping malls to make better use of their public spaces.

    Argentina ends foreign exchange restrictions

 Argentina dismantled key parts of its years-long currency controls and loosened its grip on the peso on Friday as it sealed a US$20 billion, 48-month Extended Fund Facility deal with the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
 <br>
  <br>
  The IMF deal lays out an immediate disbursement US$12 billion, and a first review is planned for June with an associated additional disbursement of some US$2 billion, the IMF said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The South American nation's central bank announced that it will undo a fixed currency peg from Monday, letting the peso freely fluctuate within a moving band between 1,000 and 1,400 pesos per dollar, versus 1,074 at the close on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Argentina will eliminate major parts of the so-called "cepo" capital controls that have restricted access to foreign currency, the central bank said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Companies from this year will also be able to repatriate profits out of the country, a key demand from businesses that could unlock more investment.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As of Monday, we will be able to put an end to the foreign exchange restrictions which were imposed in 2019 and which limit the normal functioning of the economy," Economy Ministry Luis Caputo said at a press conference.  (Reuters)

    South Carolina executes second convict by firing squad

<img alt="Mikal Mahdi (pictured) was executed for the 2004 murder of 56-year-old James Myers. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&w=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1800044_1_20250412094035.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A man facing the death penalty for committing two murders was executed by firing squad on Friday, the second such execution in the US state of South Carolina this year.
 <br>
  <br>
  Mikal Mahdi, 42, was executed for the 2004 murder of 56-year-old James Myers, an off-duty police officer, and the murder of a convenience store employee three days earlier.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to a statement from the prison, "the execution was performed by a three-person firing squad at 6:01 pm (2201 GMT)," with Mahdi pronounced dead four minutes later.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Tonight, the state of South Carolina executed him by firing squad -- a horrifying act that belongs in the darkest chapters of history, not in a civilized society," defence lawyer David Weiss said in a statement. "Mikal died in full view of a system that failed him at every turn -- from childhood to his final breath."
  <br>
  <br>
  Myers found Mahdi hiding in a garden shed at his home before Mahdi killed him and set the body on fire. Mahdi also pleaded guilty to murdering a convenience store clerk three days before he killed Myers.
  <br>
  <br>
  South Carolina gives its death row inmates a choice between lethal injection, the electric chair and the firing squad. Mahdi chose the firing squad.
  <br>
  <br>
  The first execution by firing squad in the United States in 15 years was carried out in South Carolina on March 7, when a man convicted of murdering his ex-girlfriend's parents was put to death.
  <br>
  <br>
  A three-person squad of Department of Corrections volunteers opens fire on the condemned man, who is restrained in a chair with a hood over his head 15 feet (five meters) away.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mahdi had requested clemency from Governor Henry McMaster but South Carolina's Republican chief executive did not grant it, or any previous clemency petitions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mahdi's lawyers had argued that he had suffered his entire life. He was four when his mother fled her abusive husband, leaving the boy to be raised by his volatile mentally ill father, they said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Between the ages of 14 and 21, Mikal spent over 80 percent of his life in prison and lived through 8,000 hours in solitary confinement," his lawyers said.
  <br>
  <br>
  They described Mahdi as "deeply remorseful and a dramatically different person from the confused, angry and abused youth who committed the capital crimes."
  <br>
  <br>
  Mahdi's execution was the 12th in the United States this year. There were 25 last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The vast majority of US executions since the Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty in 1976 have been performed using lethal injection.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alabama has carried out four executions using nitrogen gas, a method that has been denounced by United Nations experts as cruel and inhumane.
  <br>
  <br>
  The death penalty has been abolished in 23 of the 50 US states, while three others -- California, Oregon and Pennsylvania -- have moratoriums in place.
  <br>
  <br>
  President Donald Trump is a proponent of capital punishment and on his first day in office called for an expansion of its use "for the vilest crimes."
  <br>
  <br>
  Attorney General Pam Bondi announced last week that federal prosecutors would seek the death penalty for Luigi Mangione, charged with the high-profile December 4 murder in New York of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. (AFP)

    Head of Greenland base fired after Vance visit

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The head of the US military base in Greenland, a Danish territory coveted by US President Donald Trump, has been fired for criticising Washington's agenda for the Arctic island.
 <br>
  <br>
  Colonel Susannah Meyers, who had served as commander of the Pituffik Space Base since July, was removed after reports she distanced herself and the base from US Vice President JD Vance's criticism of Denmark and its oversight of the territory during his visit two weeks ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Commanders are expected to adhere to the highest standards of conduct, especially as it relates to remaining nonpartisan in the performance of their duties," the US Space Force said in a statement late Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The statement did not expand further, but US website Military.com said Meyers sent a March 31 email to all personnel at Pituffik "seemingly aimed at generating unity among the airmen and guardians, as well as the Canadians, Danes and Greenlanders who work there" following Vance's appearance."
  <br>
  <br>
  During his March 28 visit to the base, Vance told a press conference, "Our message to Denmark is very simple: You have not done a good job by the people of Greenland."
  <br>
  <br>
  Both Nuuk and Copenhagen viewed the visit as a provocation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Danish Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen said on social media, "We are open to criticisms, but let me be completely honest, we do not appreciate the tone in which it's being delivered."
  <br>
  <br>
  And Greenland's new prime minister, Jens-Frederik Nielsen, said in a Facebook post that "the United States will not get Greenland. We don't belong to anyone else. We decide our own future."
  <br>
  <br>
  In her email, relayed to Military.com, Meyers wrote, "I do not presume to understand current politics, but what I do know is the concerns of the US administration discussed by Vice President Vance on Friday are not reflective of Pituffik Space Base."
  <br>
  <br>
  On X, Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said, "Actions to undermine the chain of command or to subvert President Trump's agenda will not be tolerated at the Department of Defense."
  <br>
  <br>
  Meyers has been replaced by Colonel Shawn Lee, the US Space Force said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has insisted that Washington needs control of Greenland for national and international security and has refused to rule out the use of force to secure it, causing tensions to soar between the United States and Denmark.
  <br>
  <br>
  Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen traveled to Greenland last week, telling the United States that "you cannot annex another country."
  <br>
  <br>
  Polls show a vast majority of Greenland's 57,000 people want to become independent from Denmark but do not wish to become part of the United States. (AFP)

    Trump takes annual physical exam, says it went well

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 President Donald Trump, who in January became the oldest person to assume the US presidency, underwent his first physical exam of his second term on Friday and said it went well, with results set to be released Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump, who turns 79 in June and likes fast food so much he staged a photo op at a McDonald's during his campaign last year, spent several hours being poked and prodded by the doctors at Walter Reed Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It went, I think, well ... every test you can imagine, I was there for a long time, the yearly physical," Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One. "I think I did well. I think they're releasing the report on Sunday," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump also said he took a cognitive exam and got all the answers right.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Overall I felt I was in very good shape. A good heart, a good soul, a very good soul and I took — I wanted to be a little different than Biden. I took a cognitive test and I don't know what to tell you other than I got every answer right," Trump said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The physical could offer the first clear look at Trump's condition since his ear was grazed by a bullet in an assassination attempt during a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, last July.
  <br>
  <br>
  His campaign released a report by Ronny Jackson, Trump's former White House doctor and a Republican Congressman from Texas, saying the injuries were superficial.
  <br>
  <br>
  The White House typically determines what data will be released from a president's health exam and earlier in the day Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said results will be released as soon as possible.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump is not compelled to release any information, and there is no template for the presidential exam. Trump released only limited information about his health during his presidential campaigns.
  <br>
  <br>
  During the 2024 election, Trump drew sharp contrasts with his predecessor, Joe Biden, now 82, claiming he was younger and fitter.
  <br>
  <br>
  A White House doctor in 2018, when Trump was serving his first term, said the president was in overall excellent health but needed to shed weight and start a daily exercise routine.
  <br>
  <br>
  When asked on Friday if the medical team had suggested any changes to his habits, the president said that they had "a little bit", but did not elaborate further.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump included a cognitive exam, the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, as part of his physical during his first term, and his doctor later said he scored 30 out of 30.
  <br>
  <br>
  Biden released detailed summaries of his physical exams while in office, but several books published in recent months have raised questions about his mental acuity in his final months in the White House.
  <br>
  <br>
  The mental ability and age of both Biden and Trump were in focus during last year's election campaign, especially after Biden's disastrous performance in a debate with Trump in June, and Trump's increasingly rambling speeches at rallies. (Reuters)

    Justin Rose retains lead at the Masters after Round 2

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Justin Rose remained atop a star-studded leaderboard after the second round of the Masters on Friday , with defending champion Scottie Scheffler, Rory McIlroy and Bryson DeChambeau all within three shots of the lead.
 <br>
  <br>
  Rose followed his opening 65 with a 1-under 71 that left him 8 under for the tournament. He was one ahead of DeChambeau , the reigning US Open champion, whose rounds of 69-68 have him firmly in the mix for his first green jacket.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking of first green jackets, McIlroy is in good shape to finally get his own. He had the low round of the day, a 6-under 66 to get to 6 under for the tournament. McIlroy needs only the Masters to complete the career grand slam.
  <br>
  <br>
  Corey Conners also was at 6 under, and Scheffler was in a group another shot back that included Shane Lowry, Matt McCarty and Tyrrell Hatton. Scheffler dropped a shot at the par-4 finishing hole, which played the toughest on the course Friday. (AP)

<img alt="Investors are also turning attention to quarterly earnings season, which began on Friday. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&w=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1800024_1_20250412054829.jpg&q=80">

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks finished solidly higher on Friday, concluding a rollercoaster week on a positive note amid hopes that the market has absorbed the worst headlines about trade conflicts.
 <br>
  <br>
  US equities shrugged off early weakness after China announced 125 percent tariffs on US goods in the latest tit-for-tat move between the two superpowers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite that escalation, traders hope "that we're going to pivot from the phase of escalation to negotiation and hopefully further down the road to de-escalation," said Angelo Kourkafas of Edward Jones.
  <br>
  <br>
  Potentially "a lot of bad news is in the price already," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The broad-based S&P 500 finished at 5,353.36, up 1.8 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial average gained 1.6 percent to 40,212.71, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index jumped 2.1 percent to 16,724,46.
  <br>
  <br>
  US equities this week have gyrated as markets digest President Trump's shifting announcements on tariffs and the evolving stance of other parties, including the European Union, which unveiled and then paused countermeasures earlier in the week.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, economists point to a rising risk of a US recession amid worries about inflation. On Friday, a survey from the University of Michigan noted a sharp drop in consumer confidence, and flagged a worrying rise in both short-term and longer-term inflation expectations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Investors are also turning attention to quarterly earnings season, which began in earnest on Friday with large banks and financial players.
  <br>
  <br>
  JPMorgan Chase surged 4.0 percent following better than expected results, while BlackRock gained 2.3 percent and Morgan Stanley rose 1.4 percent. Wells Fargo lost 1.0 percent. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Development Bureau on Friday welcomed the High Court’s decision to dismiss a legal challenge against the environmental impact assessment of the San Tin Technopole project.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, the government said the ruling removes uncertainties surrounding the project, and that authorities will “press ahead with this flagship project of the Northern Metropolis”.
  <br>
  <br>
  The High Court’s decision came after the applicant withdrew his judicial review application.
  <br>
  <br>
  Justice Russell Coleman allowed social worker Eddie Tse to drop his case and rejected a request to have former Sai Kung district councillor Debby Chan take over the proceedings.
  <br>
  <br>
  Coleman shot down the request in a written judgement, saying Tse and Chan did not share sufficient common interests beyond a general concern for environmental protection.
  <br>
  <br>
  He ruled that Chan only expressed interest in the case "after she learnt from the applicant that he had decided to withdraw his own challenge".
  <br>
  <br>
  The hearing for the judicial review in June has been cancelled.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the Environmental Protection Department also welcomed the ruling, saying it will continue to strictly review all environmental impact assessment reports according to statutory requirements.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than HK$27 billion and nearly 300 hectares of land have been earmarked for the innovation and technology hub in San Tin.

    Women, children killed in Israeli strikes: UN

<div class="itemFullText">
 Dozens of Israeli air strikes on Gaza have killed "only women and children" after a ceasefire collapsed, the UN said, as an Israeli attack in the territory's south on Friday left a family of 10 dead.
 <br>
  <br>
  A UN rights office report also warned that expanding Israeli evacuation orders were resulting in the "forcible transfer" of people into ever-shrinking areas, raising "real concern as to the future viability of Palestinians as a group in Gaza".
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel's military said it was looking into the attack that killed members of the same family in Khan Yunis, southern Gaza, adding separately that it had struck about 40 "terror targets" across the territory over the past day.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel resumed its Gaza strikes on March 18, ending a two-month ceasefire with Hamas.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since then, more than 1,500 people have been killed, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory to which Israel cut off aid more than a month ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Ten people, including seven children, were brought to the hospital as martyrs following an Israeli air strike that targeted the Farra family home in central Khan Yunis," civil defence spokesperson Mahmud Bassal said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan denounced Israel, saying: "If this is not barbarism, I ask you, what is it?"
  <br>
  <br>
  And the UN decried the impact of the ongoing Israeli strikes, finding that "a large percentage of fatalities are children and women". (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Australian non-permanent judge Robert French has stepped down from the Court of Final Appeal, with the government on Friday expressing regret over his resignation.
 <br>
  <br>
  The administration also extended its gratitude to the departing judge and issued assurances that the SAR's judicial work would not be affected.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The presence or absence of individual judges will not undermine the integrity of the system, nor impair the [Hong Kong SAR] government's determination in upholding the rule of law," a spokesperson said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The [Hong Kong SAR] government fully supports the judiciary in its continuous efforts to appoint and retain foreign non-permanent judges in the future, and will endeavour to capitalise on the [Hong Kong SAR's] common law system, upholding the rule of law in Hong Kong."
  <br>
  <br>
  Confirming French's departure, the judiciary said he had "affirmed his continued respect for the independence and integrity" of all judges at Hong Kong's top court.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The judiciary is grateful to Mr Justice French for his valuable contributions to the work of the [Court of Final Appeal] and his support for the rule of law in Hong Kong during his tenure," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  French, who previously served as the Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia, joined the top court as a non-permanent judge in 2017.
  <br>
  <br>
  Following his exit, there are nine non-permanent judges sitting on the Court of Final Appeal. Five of them are from the United Kingdom and Australia.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In light of its steady caseload, the operation of the [Court of Final Appeal] will not be affected by the recent change in membership of the court," the judiciary said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The judiciary will continue to identify suitable local and overseas candidates for appointment as non-permanent judges."
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the Bar Association has expressed regret over French’s resignation, adding that it is grateful for his contributions to the development of jurisprudence and the rule of law in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also noted his departure will not affect the court's judicial functions, and said that it has “every confidence in the independence of the [Court of Final Appeal]”.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A subway tunnel under construction near Seoul collapsed on Friday, likely leaving two workers trapped at the site, officials said.
 <br>
  <br>
  The National Fire Agency said authorities were mobilising 55 rescue workers and 18 vehicles to rescue possible victims.
  <br>
  <br>
  The collapse happened at Gwangmyeong, a city just south of Seoul.
  <br>
  <br>
  The city's officials said authorities earlier withdrew workers from the construction site and stopped traffic around the area after receiving reports that a ventilation shaft at the site was at a risk of collapse.
  <br>
  <br>
  The officials said it wasn't immediately known whether any workers re-entered the site. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Top EU officials and Chinese leaders are due to hold their next summit marking 50 years of ties in China in July, a spokesperson for the European Council said on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The European Union had announced plans for a summit in January, before US President Donald Trump took office and unleashed swingeing tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are coordinating with China to set a date for the meeting, which is expected to take place in China in the second half of July," said the official at the council, the body representing the EU's 27 countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bloc faces a delicate balancing act, seeking to negotiate with an unpredictable ally in Washington to avoid tariffs and the need to diversify trading partners, with its bid to hold the line on its own trade concerns regarding China.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier on Friday, President Xi Jinping urged the EU to join hands with Beijing in resisting "unilateral bullying", referring to sweeping tariffs imposed by Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  The heads of the EU's two main institutions – the council and the European Commission – have held regular summits with China's leadership. (AFP)

    Govt pledges to review RTHK operations

<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development Algernon Yau said on Friday the government will further review operations at RTHK after lawmakers expressed concern over the broadcaster's expenditure.
 <br>
  <br>
  At a special finance committee meeting on the budget in the legislature, lawmakers raised questions over the station's headcount and spending.
  <br>
  <br>
  Junius Ho noted that the broadcaster's forecast budget for this financial year had been set at HK$1.5 billion, around 50 percent more than that of five years ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the station cannot keep asking for more public money when the government is under financial stress.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will go back to review once again the overall operations of RTHK, its production and manpower arrangements," Yau said in response.
  <br>
  <br>
  RTHK is under the purview of the Commerce and Economic Development Bureau.
  <br>
  <br>
  New People's Party lawmaker Regina Ip noted the broadcaster is cutting four positions from its 750-strong workforce this financial year, and questioned if it could cut more jobs at the programme officer level in the TV section, since three of its five TV channels are relays of state television or broadcast acquired programmes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Director of Broadcasting Angelina Kwan said the streamlining will continue, and proposals will be submitted to the bureau later.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kwan added that RTHK has been purchasing outside programmes to provide more diverse content.

    Salah driven to keep delivering after signing new deal

<img alt="Mohamed Salah says the prospect of winning before a full Enfield is what drives him crazy every day. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&w=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1799966_1_20250411175726.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Mohamed Salah said he is driven every day to deliver Premier League glory to Liverpool this season after signing a new two-year contract on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Salah, 32, has defied the distraction of months of speculation over his future by scoring 27 goals and providing 17 assists in the 31 league appearances to help open up an 11-point lead at the top of the table with seven games to go.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Egyptian was part of the Liverpool side that delivered the club's first league title for 30 years in the 2019/20 season.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Covid restrictions meant that the Reds lifted the trophy in front of an empty Anfield and there was no parade through the city's streets.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think I said in the beginning of the season, I just want to win the Premier League more than anything else," Salah told Liverpool's website.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I want it so bad.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think we owe that to the fans.
  <br>
  <br>
  They deserve it, they deserve to enjoy it after that long time, with celebrating at Anfield and in the street and just enjoying ourselves winning the Premier League."
  <br>
  <br>
  On the prospect of winning the title in front of a full Anfield, Salah said "that's something that drives me crazy every day – to come to work and push myself and push the other players also, because we are closer than ever now that we can win it in a special way."
  <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool manager Arne Slot has also had to deal with persistent questioning over the futures of captain Virgil van Dijk and right-back Trent Alexander-Arnold, who are also out of contract at the end of the campaign, during his first season in charge.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dutchman said news of Salah's new deal may have come as a "pleasant surprise" for supporters but praised the club's sporting director Richard Hughes for ensuring the Egyptian remains at Anfield.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I don't think it's a surprise to you that I knew a bit better how his contract situation went over the course of the whole season," said Slot.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Maybe for the fans it was a pleasant surprise. I knew it a bit longer, of course, that things were heading in the right direction.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think it's also a big compliment for Richard that he achieved to extend Mo Salah, who is such a great player as a free agent, that he can go probably to every club in the world wherever he wants to.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But he stayed at our club and that's also a compliment for Richard." (AFP)

    Yoon in emotional exit from official residence

<div class="itemFullText">
 Former South Korean president Yoon Suk-yeol returned to his private home on Friday from the official residence after his removal from office, with crowds of supporters turning out to greet his motorcade.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Constitutional Court upheld Yoon's impeachment last Friday, capping four months of unprecedented constitutional turmoil after his short-lived attempt to impose martial law in December sent shockwaves through Asia's fourth-largest economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  South Korea will now hold a snap election on June 3, and questions remain over whether Yoon might still play a role given how his impeachment appears to have deepened polarisation in society and stirred up his conservative supporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hundreds had gathered outside the gates of the official residence, where Yoon briefly stopped to hug and shake hands with supporters, some of whom were crying.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ousted president has not been seen in public since he was released from prison on March 8 when a court cancelled his detention warrant in the criminal case against him. He did not attend the impeachment ruling by the Constitutional Court on April 4.
  <br>
  <br>
  But a number of his ruling party members and supporters have been seen visiting the official residence where Yoon reportedly discussed the upcoming election.
  <br>
  <br>
  As he left the official residence, Yoon donned a red baseball cap saying "Make Korea Great Again" given to him by a supporter, video footage showed.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Now I will go back to being one of the people... and find a new way for the country and the people," Yoon said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He and his wife were driven in a motorcade from the official presidential residence to their private apartment in a 37-storey building in Seoul. The pet-loving couple will also take back more than 10 dogs and cats they own.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some 280 police were deployed around his private home on Friday ahead of the move, and Yoon is to be accompanied by a security detail of about 50 people, media reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  The former president still faces trial on a criminal charge of leading an insurrection, which is punishable by death or a life sentence if he is convicted.
  <br>
  <br>
  The race to replace Yoon kicked off this week with nearly 20 hopefuls expected to contest for the candidacy of the conservative People Power Party that is in a fight to retain the presidency against a populist liberal who leads in the polls. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Friday announced a pilot scheme to install flood-warning systems at five flood-prone areas to prevent vehicles from being stranded during severe rainstorms.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Wading Line System will be set up at Chai Wan Road, Lung Cheung Road in Wong Tai Sin, Tsui Ping Road in Kwun Tong, Chatham Road North in Ho Man Tin and Nam Wan Road in Tai Po Market.
  <br>
  <br>
  These five low-lying road sections were heavily flooded during what were described as "once-in-500-years" deluges in September 2023, officials said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The system comes with red wavy lines painted on roads, water level markers and real-time monitoring equipment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Drainage officials will also install flood-monitoring devices at the lowest points of the road sections to collect real-time water level data.
  <br>
  <br>
  When the water level reaches 0.1 metres, staff from the Drainage Services and Highways departments will be deployed to clear blocked drains.
  <br>
  <br>
  Traffic will be diverted on site when the water level reaches 0.3 metres.
  <br>
  <br>
  If water rises above this level, it can seriously damage vehicles.
  <br>
  <br>
  When officials get a flood warning, they will send teams to the site within 15 to 30 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  With installation work starting in late April and expected to be completed by mid-May, the five pilot projects cost around HK$700,000, a government spokesperson said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials will examine the scheme's effectiveness before deciding on the next step.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The US dollar tumbled along with most stocks while gold hit a fresh record high as panic gripped markets again on Friday, while China retaliated against Donald Trump's latest tariff blitz against the world's number two economy.
 <br>
  <br>
  Beijing raised the tariffs on US imports to 125 percent near the end of trading in stocks in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  The benchmark Hang Seng Index ended up 1.13 percent to close at 20,914.69.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index rose 1.74 percent to end at 7,801.51 while the Hang Seng Tech Index climbed 1.8 percent to end at 4,900.43.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US president's decision to delay crippling duties for 90 days sparked a frenzied scramble for equities that had been beaten down since his "Liberation Day" announcement unleashed a global panic.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the realisation that nothing had been resolved, coupled with Trump's decision to double down on his battle with economic superpower China, fuelled another bout of selling of US assets.
  <br>
  <br>
  The greenback tanked against the yen, euro, pound and Swiss franc – investors dropping what is usually considered a key safe haven currency as they look to unload US risk assets.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gold-standard Treasuries were also under pressure amid speculation that China was offloading some of its vast holdings in retaliation for Trump's measures.
  <br>
  <br>
  The weaker dollar and the rush for safety has also sent bullion to a fresh record high above US$3,220.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ahead of Beijing's latest tariffs move made in response to Trump, President Xi Jinping urged the European Union to join Beijing in resisting "unilateral bullying" by Washington, state media said as he met Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shortly after, Beijing said it would ramp up levies against the United States to 125 percent, compared with the 145 percent China faces.
  <br>
  <br>
  It added that Washington's moves defied "basic economic laws and common sense" and "seriously violates international trade rules" but said it would "ignore" future US hikes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Markets across the region were back deep in negative territory at the end of a highly volatile week.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tokyo shed 3 percent – a day after surging more than 9 percent – while Sydney, Seoul, Singapore, Wellington and Bangkok were also in the red.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, Hong Kong and Shanghai rose as traders focused on possible Chinese stimulus measures.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing said earlier in the day that it would implement a moderately loose monetary policy in a bid to reassure investors. (AFP/Xinhua)

    Xi urges EU to join in opposing 'unilateral bullying'

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping urged the European Union on Friday to join hands with China in resisting "unilateral bullying", in reference to tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump.
 <br>
  <br>
  As he met Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez on Friday, Xi stressed the need for cooperation between the bloc and Beijing in weathering Trump's continual escalations in the trade war.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China and Europe should fulfil their international responsibilities... and jointly resist unilateral bullying practices," Xi said.
  <br>
  <br>
  This, he stressed, would not only "safeguard their own legitimate rights and interests, but also... safeguard international fairness and justice."
  <br>
  <br>
  The president added there is no winner in a tariff war, and going against the world will only result in self-isolation.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said for more than 70 years, China has achieved development through self-reliance and does not fear unreasonable suppression.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi added that no matter how the external world changes, China will remain confident and focused on running its own affairs well.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sanchez, in turn, said following the meeting in Beijing that tensions over trade should not impede cooperation between China and the EU.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Both Spain and Europe have a significant trade deficit with China that we must work to rectify," he admitted.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Sanchez also said "we must not let trade tensions stand in the way of the potential growth of the relationship between China and Spain and between China and the EU".
  <br>
  <br>
  Spain buys about 45 billion euros of goods every year from China, its fourth-largest trading partner, but sells around 7.4 billion euros' worth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sanchez's trip comes as the EU rethinks its global trading relationships in the face of turmoil caused by the US import duties announced last week that have sent world markets into a tailspin.

<div class="itemFullText">
 China blasted US President Donald Trump's tariffs on Friday as a "numbers game" that "will become a joke", as Beijing raised levies on US imports to 125 percent and said it would go no further.
 <br>
  <br>
  The announcement followed the US move to raise the "reciprocal tariffs" on Chinese imports to 125 percent, bringing the total to 145 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The State Council's Customs Tariff Commission said the US imposition of excessively high tariffs on China seriously violates international economic and trade rules, goes against basic economic laws and common sense, and is nothing but unilateral bullying and coercion.
  <br>
  <br>
  The commission said even if Washington is to raise tariffs further, it would no longer make economic sense and ultimately go down as a joke in world economic history.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Given that it's already impossible for the Chinese market to accept US imports at the current tariff level, if the United States imposes further tariffs on Chinese products, China will ignore it," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Washington's duties on Chinese products have "become a numbers game with no practical significance in economics", a spokesperson for the Commerce Ministry said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 125 percent tariffs on US goods are up from 84 percent, and will take effect from Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Commerce Ministry also said China has filed a lawsuit against the US with the World Trade Organization's dispute settlement mechanism following the latest American tariff hikes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The countermeasure by Beijing came after US President Donald Trump's latest escalation in a tit-for-tat trade war that he started by singling China out even as he hit a pause on additional tariffs for other countries. (Xinhua/AP)

 Police said on Friday 139 people have been arrested on suspicion of money laundering and obtaining property by deception, with losses to victims amounting to more than HK$130 million.
 <br>
  <br>
  Officers said the suspects, aged between 19 and 73, provided syndicates with stooge accounts.
  <br>
  <br>
  The suspects were said to be involved in phone, investment and online scams.
  <br>
  <br>
  Senior inspector Wong Yuen-yan said the Kowloon West saw about 1,700 scams in the first quarter, 10 percent more than in the same period of last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said the police will continue to crack down on syndicates and stooge account holders.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Office of the Ombudsman said on Friday it’s launching an investigation into how the Highways Department handles damage to roads, such as uneven surfaces and potholes.
 <br>
  <br>
  The watchdog added that it has also received public complaints about the department’s ineffective monitoring of contractors and delays to repair work.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ombudsman Jack Chan said it’s essential for the department to ensure roads are safe and convenient for public use.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Moreover, as sudden and exceptionally severe rainstorms brought about by extreme weather have happened from time to time in recent years, road closures due to subsidence and serious flooding also take place now and then,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “In this light, I have decided to launch a direct investigation operation to examine the Highways Department 's work on the repair and maintenance of public roads.”
  <br>
  <br>
  People are being invited to put forward any views they have on the matter by May 11.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Transport and Logistics Mable Chan said the government has come up with strategies to tackle an expected drop in Hong Kong's global trading volume as a result of the tariff war initiated by US President Donald Trump.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chan told Ming Pao newspaper that the trade war has brought continued uncertainty to the logistics, maritime and aviation sectors in Hong Kong, and the government will take a leading role by offering them more concrete guidance.
  <br>
  <br>
  One of the strategies is to help the maritime sector look for new growth areas and set up new markets outside Europe and the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan also said the bureau will be more proactive in attracting shipments to the SAR by stepping up collaboration with ports in the Greater Bay Area.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another focus, the transport minister said, is to deepen exchanges and cooperation with international ports and shippers in an attempt to expand the SAR's maritime network, and in that regard an office will be set up in the Middle East in the second half to get more ships to be registered here.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said the government is also considering streamlining customs procedures to boost transshipments.
  <br>
  <br>
  As for the aviation industry, Chan highlighted the need for the sector to upgrade and transform itself by offering diversified services.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Tickets for next month’s friendly between Manchester United and Team Hong Kong, China, went on sale at noon on Friday, with the cheapest tickets snapped up within half an hour.
 <br>
  <br>
  Priced from HK$390 to HK$2,990, tickets for the fixture were sold exclusively via the Cityline platform.
  <br>
  <br>
  By 3.20pm, the most affordable seats – which cost HK$390, HK$690 and HK$990 each – were sold out, leaving the more expensive tickets as the only options.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pre-sale tickets for the match began earlier this week exclusively for United’s supporters club.
  <br>
  <br>
  Event organisers ProEvents didn’t disclose the percentage of tickets reserved for public sale.
  <br>
  <br>
  The exhibition match, set for May 30 at Hong Kong Stadium, will see the Red Devils’ return to the SAR after 12 years.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong is continuing to see fallout from the trade war started by US President Donald Trump who raised the duty on small goods parcels from the SAR to 120 percent from the 90 percent that he had set just a day before that, and the 30 percent in his opening salvo on April 2.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump made the amendment in an executive order that went public on Thursday Hong Kong time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tariffs on parcels will go up from US$75 to US$100 from May 2 and from US$150 to US$200 from June 1.
  <br>
  <br>
  The jump in tariffs closes a trade exemption rule known de minimis that has allowed low-value packages from mainland China, Hong Kong and Macau to enter the United States free of duties.
  <br>
  <br>
  It means people wanting to send small parcels worth up to US$800, which are currently exempt from any duties, to the US from the mainland, Hong Kong or Macau will now have to pay US$100 per item posted between May 2 and before June 1 and US$200 for goods sent after June 1.
  <br>
  <br>
  The skyrocketing increase in duties comes as the number of shipments entering the US through the duty-free route has exploded in recent years, reaching nearly 1.4 billion packages last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 90 percent of these packages now enter under the de minimis rule, and of those, about 60 percent come from China, led by direct-to-consumer retailers such as Temu and Shein.
  <br>
  <br>
  The jump in duties on small goods parcels has been framed by Trump as a solution to the national emergency arising from the US trade deficits and in his starting a tit-for-tat trade war that has seen him levy a punitive 145 percent tariff on Chinese imports.
  <br>
  <br>
  China has said no one wins in a trade war and described the tariffs as protectionist.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Commerce minister Algernon Yau on Friday said the chief executive would head to the Middle East next month with representatives from mainland enterprises to seek more business opportunities.
 <br>
  <br>
  Yau made the announcement during the legislature's special finance committee meeting on the budget.
  <br>
  <br>
  The DAB's Starry Lee, who's also Hong Kong's sole delegate to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, asked how the SAR government planned to reduce its reliance on the US market amid the trade war.
  <br>
  <br>
  She pointed to the fact that Beijing had tasked Hong Kong with strengthening its global connections.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yau replied that officials like himself have been to different countries seeking new partnerships, and John Lee would also do so next month.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In May, the CE will visit the Middle East together with [those from] mainland enterprises. So amid the geo-political tensions, we seek to further development in new markets in the Middle East as well as Asean," the minister said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Among the 10 Asean countries, I've been to seven of them. Mr Lee has also led delegations to Laos, Vietnam and Cambodia. You can see the SAR government has been working proactively to connect with the world."
  <br>
  <br>
  Import and export sector lawmaker, Kennedy Wong from the DAB, asked whether the government plans to move some of its Economic and Trade Offices from Europe and the United States to new markets.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yau said in response that his bureau had been making plans to move some of the offices around, and it would submit its proposals later.
  <br>
  <br>
  Business and Professionals Alliance and industrial sector lawmaker, Jimmy Ng, meanwhile, asked for a direct communication channel with officials due to the trade war, saying the sector had been caught off-guard by the ever-changing developments.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister said in response that his bureau had held two recent meetings with the trade, saying the financial secretary could take the lead to liaise with the business sector if needed.

    HK to launch locally developed chatbot in second half

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Commissioner for Digital Policy Tony Wong said Hong Kong aims to launch a locally developed chatbot in the second half and that it may be available for use free of charge in the initial stage.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong Generative AI Research and Development Center is developing local large language models, and its generative AI document processing application HKPilot has been used by government departments since last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  In an exclusive interview with RTHK, Wong said he hopes the application can improve work efficiency and, in the long run, replace traditional jobs that require a lot of manpower.
  <br>
  <br>
  He expects HKChat's launch in the second half to bring great convenience to the people of Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For instance, Hong Kong residents may want to apply for some government services and they may not know where to find the services or what the procedures are," he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Because the chatbot is trained with data from Hong Kong and we provided it with a lot of information, it will answer you in detail the things you have to prepare and the procedures when applying for the services."
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong was speaking ahead of the annual World Internet Conference's Asia-Pacific summit at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre on Monday and Tuesday, the first time it is being hosted in the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  He expects the summit to attract more than 1,000 officials and business representatives from around the world, like the Six Little Dragons from Hangzhou which include DeepSeek and Unitree Robotics.
  <br>
  <br>
  He hopes Hong Kong can make use of its advantage of being connected with both the mainland and the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We hope we can demonstrate our strength in innovation and technology to the outside world through Hong Kong and seek more room for its development," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The World Internet Conference uses Asia-Pacific summit as its theme, hoping to connect different countries in the Asia-Pacific region and paying special attention to the development of emerging markets in the Global South."
  <br>
  <br>
  The commissioner said the authorities will go all out in making a success of the summit and hope it can be hosted in Hong Kong again next year.

<img alt="Paul Chan says the SAR government has formulated various response plans to help fend off financial risks. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&w=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1799904_1_20250411111509.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Friday said Hong Kong is building a comprehensive financial protection network with systematic response plans and monitoring mechanisms to safeguard what he called the "southern gate" of the nation.
 <br>
  <br>
  The remarks came as trade tensions intensified further between China and the United States, with Washington confirming overnight that levies on Chinese goods now total 145 percent while Chinese duties on American products stand at 84 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  In an interview with the Wen Wei Po newspaper, Chan said the SAR has prepared response plans for different scenarios to ensure that all financial risks will be handled in a timely and effective manner.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SAR government, he added, is in close cooperation with relevant Chinese financial regulatory authorities and ministries, to fully communicate on the response plans and build a "solid barrier" to fend off systemic risks.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Under current geopolitics, if foreign forces attack Hong Kong from the financial aspect, they can be very powerful, therefore there must be strong support from the country for Hong Kong," Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The finance chief stressed the SAR must firmly safeguard financial security at the nation's "southern gate".
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan also said the authorities will take the opportunity of the 10th National Security Education Day next Tuesday to further promote national security and raise awareness, through exhibits and outreach activities in schools and the community at large.
  <br>
  <br>
  He called on financial firms and businesses to take national security into their consideration when making any decisions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan added that he noted a 10 percent increase in the number of foreign firms setting up shop here last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The entry of these foreign companies is based on the high recognition of Hong Kong's business environment, further demonstrating the SAR's attractiveness as a financial centre," he said.

<img alt="Lawmaker Kennedy Wong says having a diversified set of trading partners will be increasingly important for Hong Kong firms. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&w=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1799911_1_20250411115034.jpg&q=70">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lawmaker Kennedy Wong on Friday said the world had entered a new period of uncertainty and disruption because of the US tariffs.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on
  <a href="https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/news-programmes/this-episode.htm?cmsid=77" target="_blank">
   <u>
    <b>
     RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme
    </b>
   </u>
  </a>
  , Wong, who represents the import and export functional constituency, said diversifying trade links to other regions and countries would be important for local trading firms looking to survive and thrive in this new environment.
  <br>
  <br>
  "What I've learned in the past few days from a lot of our members, exporters, is basically they just need to diversify or continue to diversify... a lot of Hong Kong exporters have implemented the so-called 'China+N' strategy."
  <br>
  <br>
  "So actually, apart from mainland China manufacturers, they have, for example, another few suppliers in the Asean countries," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong said the new round of US tariffs would accelerate trade trends that had been quietly taking place over the last few years, including reaching out to new markets in Southeast Asia, the Middle East and Africa.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I've seen more and more of our members going to Asean, Southeast Asian countries, and they are establishing footholds in the Middle East, like Dubai, and the more adventurous ones are even going to Africa."

    Lazio freeze as Bodo/Glimt take 2-0 first leg win

<img alt="Ulrik Saltnes celebrates after breaking the deadlock against Lazio. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&w=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1799883_2_20250411110636.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Two goals from Ulrik Saltnes spurred Bodo/Glimt to a 2-0 home victory over Lazio in the first leg of their Europa League quarter-final, with the one-sided encounter played out in freezing conditions.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lazio arrived on Thursday in a windy Bodo to find snow had blanketed the pitch in the early hours.
  <br>
  <br>
  Although the artificial turf was cleared in time for kick-off, the Italians struggled to adapt to the challenging zero-degree conditions in northern Norway, spending much of the match pinned back and on the defensive.
  <br>
  <br>
  Aiming to become the first Norwegian team ever to reach a European Cup semi-final, Bodo/Glimt neutralised Lazio's defence, attacking the box time and again.
  <br>
  <br>
  In contrast, Lazio registered just a single shot on target throughout the match.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I am incredibly pleased with a lot but I do not think we should get carried away," Bodo/Glimt coach Kjetil Knutsen told Viaplay.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have a clear identity and an incredible strength within us. We should be happy with that."
  <br>
  <br>
  The hosts seized early control, with Jens Petter Hauge firing a clever, short shot in the opening minutes that Lazio keeper Christos Mandas had to stretch to push out of danger.
  <br>
  <br>
  Just after the half-hour mark, Bodo/Glimt came close again when Ole Didrik Blomberg received the ball inside the box but it slid off his foot as he prepared his shot and the effort went well wide.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bodo/Glimt made the breakthrough just two minutes after the restart when Saltnes finished at close range following a precise short pass from Ole Didrik Blomberg to give the hosts the lead.
  <br>
  <br>
  As the hosts looked to double their advantage, their sharp, quick passing continued to trouble the Lazio defence but several promising opportunities were squandered as they struggled to convert their finishing touches.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bodo/Glimt scored their second goal in the 69th minute when Saltnes was played through and he lofted the ball over Mandas. Although Alessio Romagnoli managed to clear it, the ball had already crossed the line.
  <br>
  <br>
  Saltnes came close to scoring a hat-trick in the final minutes but Mandas made a crucial save.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Lazio back-up keeper made another save in the last seconds from Odin Bjortuft's attempt.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They had speed in their exchanges because of the artificial pitch," Lazio manager Marco Baroni told Sky Sport Italia.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I believe that the second leg will be a different game and qualification is still open."
  <br>
  <br>
  The return leg will be next Thursday at the Stadio Olimpico in Rome. (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Rangers held Athletic Bilbao to a nail-biting goalless draw at home in the first leg of their Europa League quarter-final, despite being reduced to 10 men early on.
 <br>
  <br>
  Bilbao failed to capitalise on their numerical advantage on Thursday after Rangers defender Robin Propper was sent off in the 13th minute for a foul on Inaki Williams.
  <br>
  <br>
  The visitors, appearing in the last 16 of a major European competition for the first time since 2015-16, had a couple of clear-cut opportunities in the first half, with both Nico Williams and Oihan Sancet coming close.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, goalkeeper Liam Kelly produced a series of fine saves to keep them at bay as the Scottish Premiership side defended strongly and even threatened when Cyriel Dessers fired wide from long range.
  <br>
  <br>
  The game was delayed for seven minutes in the second half due to an injury to 18-year-old Bailey Rice, who was carried off on a stretcher after taking a knock on the head.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bilbao, who finished second in the league phase, thought they had broken the deadlock when substitute Alex Berenguer scored in the 76th minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  The winger, however, was flagged offside after a VAR review but a penalty was awarded as the ball had bounced off the hand of defender James Tavernier before the goal.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The sending-off seemed pretty clear to me. I didn't see the penalty well though, but it seemed a bit strange," Bilbao coach Ernesto Valverde said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Yet at the last moment we lacked clarity and didn't manage to convert the spot kick.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The draw is not what we wanted considering they played with 10 men and we had chances," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Goalkeeper Kelly again emerged as the hero with a crucial save from Berenguer to keep the result scoreless as Bilbao failed to score in a European game for the first time in their last 19 matches.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That was a proper Rangers performance," Rangers boss Barry Ferguson told TNT sports.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That's the exact reaction I wanted.
  <br>
  <br>
  That's what I spoke about on Monday and the players tonight showed a performance full of heart, grit and determination."
  <br>
  <br>
  The return leg will be played on Thursday at the San Mames stadium in Bilbao and the winners will face either Lyon or Manchester United, who drew 2-2 in the first leg, for a place in the final in Bilbao. (Reuters)

 Hong Kong stocks fell on Friday, hurt by growing concerns about the US trade war and the potential for a global recession.
 <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index lost 124 points, or 0.6 percent, to open at 20,557 points, while the tech sub-index was 0.5 percent weaker.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the blue-chip CSI 300 Index on the mainland and the Shanghai Composite Index were flat, losing just 0.1 percent at the open.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere, Japan’s Nikkei 225 share index was down 5.6 percent in early trading, while shares also fell in South Korea and Australia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Losses of US stocks accelerated after the White House clarified that the United States will tax Chinese imports at 145 percent, not the 125 percent rate that Trump had written about in his posting on Truth Social Wednesday. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong, China squash player Simmi Chan secured a historic silver medal at the inaugural Under-23 World Squash Championships in Pakistan.
 <br>
  <br>
  The fourth-seeded Chan launched a fierce battle in the women’s title decider against Egypt’s top seed Fayrouz Abouelkheir, stretching the opening game to a tense tie-break before narrowly conceding it 10-12 after 28 minutes of relentless rallies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Though the SAR athlete fought hard, Abouelkheir capitalised on her momentum to claim the subsequent games 11-9 and 11-6, sealing the championship victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite the defeat, Chan’s performance marked a milestone for Hong Kong, as she became the city’s first female athlete to secure a silver medal at the tournament.
  <br>
  <br>
  Her path to the final included a first-round bye followed by dominant victories over opponents from South Africa, Japan, and a hard-fought semifinal triumph against Malaysia’s Yee Xin-ying.

 Recovery efforts wrapped up in the capital of the Dominican Republic after a roof collapse at a nightclub during a concert killed at least 221 people, authorities said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  As families continue to mourn their loved ones, the cause of the catastrophe and the exact number of people who attended the fateful event have not yet been determined by authorities.
  <br>
  <br>
  The sudden collapse at the Jet Set club in Santo Domingo after midnight on Tuesday marred a concert by merengue singer Rubby Perez where politicians, athletes and other prominent local figures had gathered.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Today the search, rescue and recovery of victims ended," presidential spokesperson Homero Figueroa said in a video the government posted on social media. "Now it is time to move on to another phase, that of understanding and explaining what happened."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dominican government has approved creating a team of national and international experts to clarify the causes of the roof collapse at the popular venue, Figueroa said in the video.
  <br>
  <br>
  Emergency teams, that were on site until Thursday morning, pulled nearly 200 survivors from the building in the hours following the disaster.
  <br>
  <br>
  Juan Manuel Mendez, head of the country's emergency operations center (COE), said, "This is the hardest task I've had in my 20 years of leading the COE," breaking down in tears.
  <br>
  <br>
  After recovery efforts ended, the families of those missing left the area surrounding the nightclub, where they had stood for days embracing each other.
  <br>
  <br>
  Perez, the singer, was among those killed in the crush.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dominican President Luis Abinader attended his funeral on Thursday, with a public memorial service for him set to follow later in the day. (Reuters)

<img alt="A display in Tokyo shows stock market declines in the wake of US President Donald Trump's tariff announcements. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&w=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1799881_1_20250411090527.jpg&q=35">

<div class="itemFullText">
 Continuing jitters about US tariffs hit Asian stocks in early trade on Friday, with Japan's Nikkei tumbling more than five percent and gold hitting another record high.
 <br>
  <br>
  US President Donald Trump, meanwhile, acknowledged a "cost" to his surging trade offensive against superpower rival China. Levies on Chinese imports are now at a total of 145 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  China has retaliated with levies of 84 percent on US imports
  <br>
  <br>
  In early trade, the Nikkei 225 was off 5.4 percent, having soared 9.1 percent on Thursday after Trump paused many tariffs for 90 days.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other markets also handed back many of their gains of the previous day, with the Kospi in Seoul off 1.64 percent and Sydney down more than two percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Oil and the US dollar also slid on fears of a global slowdown in economic activity, while gold hit a new record.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fellow safe-haven asset the yen also gained 0.9 percent against the dollar on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump maintained a 10 percent blanket tariff on most countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he paused plans for tariffs of 20 percent on the European Union and even higher levies on multiple other trade partners, including 24 percent on Japan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said on Thursday that the EU was "very smart" to back off from imposing retaliatory tariffs because of his tough stance on China even as the bloc's chief warned it could tax US Big Tech.
  <br>
  <br>
  "(The EU) were ready to announce retaliation. And then they heard about what we did with respect to China... and they said, you know, 'We're going to hold back a little bit,'" Trump said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He acknowledged "a transition cost and transition problems," but dismissed global market turmoil.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the end it's going to be a beautiful thing." (AFP)

<img alt="Britain's Defence Secretary John Healey and France's Defence Minister Sebastien Lecornu attend a meeting of the Coalition of the Willing, hosted by the United Kingdom and France at Nato headquarters in Brussels.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Britain's defence minister on Thursday urged his counterparts from around 30 countries to press ahead with plans to deploy troops to Ukraine to police any future peace agreement with Russia, as questions remained over whether the United States would provide backup.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chairing the first defence ministers' meeting of the Coalition of the Willing, UK Defence Secretary John Healey said its members must ensure "that we’re fully prepared for the moment a peace agreement is reached.”
  <br>
  <br>
  “We must be ready for when that peace comes. That’s why the work of this coalition is so vital," Healey said at Nato headquarters in Brussels. He added that 200 military planners have been developing plans to deepen European involvement in Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a post on social media, Ukrainian Defence Minister Rustem Umerov said that “Ukraine is ready for peace - one that is just and backed by strength.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Ukrainian government officials and military analysts have said that Russian forces are preparing to launch a fresh military offensive in Ukraine in the coming weeks to maximise pressure on Kyiv and strengthen the Kremlin’s negotiating position in ceasefire talks.
  <br>
  <br>
  As usual with coalition gatherings, the United States did not take part. The success of the coalition’s operation hinges on US backup with airpower or other military assistance, but the Trump administration has made no public commitment to provide support.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Netherlands, Sweden and Finland underlined the “crucial” role of the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Friday, representatives from around 50 nations will gather at Nato to drum up military support for Ukraine. That meeting will be chaired by Britain and Germany. US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth is expected to join the meeting via video from Washington. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chinese property developer Country Garden said on Friday it had reached an agreement with creditors holding nearly 30 percent of its existing offshore bond debt and was close to finalising terms with another group of bank creditors.
 <br>
  <br>
  The proposed restructuring covers aggregate outstanding principal amount of US$14.07 billion of its existing debt, Country Garden said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The company had proposed the plan to cut its offshore debt by US$11.6 billion in January. Creditors holding 29.9 percent of US$10.3 billion in bonds had agreed to the plan, it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was also close to finalising a deal with a lender group made up of seven banks who hold three syndicated loans with an outstanding principal amount of US$3.6 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  The real estate firm has offered five restructuring options to its bondholders including extending the maturity by as much as 11.5 years alongside choosing mandatory convertible bonds and new debt instruments. (Reuters)

    Trump claims victory over EU in tariff battle

<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump claimed victory over Europe in the US tariffs war but acknowledged a "cost" to his surging trade offensive against superpower rival China as markets plunged again on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump sought a victory lap at a White House cabinet meeting, saying the European Union had backed off from imposing retaliatory tariffs because of his tough stance on China.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They were very smart. They were ready to announce retaliation. And then they heard about what we did with respect to China... and they said, you know, 'We're going to hold back a little bit,'" he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump acknowledged "a transition cost and transition problems," but dismissed global market turmoil. "In the end it's going to be a beautiful thing."
  <br>
  <br>
  Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent was upbeat, telling reporters that "I don't see anything unusual today," as he touted better than expected US inflation numbers and other economic indicators.
  <br>
  <br>
  But major indices spent the entire day in the red, with the broad-based S&P 500 finishing down 3.5 percent after soaring 9.5 percent on Wednesday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 2.5 percent, while the tech-rich Nasdaq slumped 4.3 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The dialling back of the planned global trade war left most of the focus on China, the world's number two economy after the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  The White House on Thursday clarified that levies on Chinese imports are now at a staggering total of 145 percent - not the previously reported 125 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  This was because the latest tariff hike comes on top of a 20 percent tariff already imposed earlier. China has retaliated with levies of 84 percent on US imports.
  <br>
  <br>
  The European Union welcomed the US president's partial row-back on his original threat to impose 20 percent tariffs against the bloc.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 27-nation grouping responded with its own olive branch, suspending for 90 days tariffs on 20 billion euros' worth of US goods that had been greenlit in retaliation to duties on steel and aluminium.
  <br>
  <br>
  In its latest measure, the Commerce Ministry in Beijing announced it would reduce the number of Hollywood films imported, but said it remained ready for dialogue. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Six people, including three children, were killed after a sightseeing helicopter crashed into the Hudson River in New York on Thursday, sparking a major water rescue operation, authorities said.
 <br>
  <br>
  The crash killed all those onboard the aircraft: the pilot and a family from Spain.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two of the victims were initially taken to a hospital, but later succumbed to their injuries.
  <br>
  <br>
  "At this time, all six victims have been removed from the water. And sadly, all six victims have been pronounced deceased," Mayor Eric Adams told a briefing, after earlier calling it a "heartbreaking and tragic crash."
  <br>
  <br>
  The chopper's landing skids were seen protruding from the river beside a tunnel vent as several boats clustered around the impact site.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police from both New York and New Jersey, which is on the opposite side of the river from Manhattan, responded to the scene along with fire department vessels.
  <br>
  <br>
  The NBC4 channel reported that its own helicopter was unable to take off because of weather conditions, with the weather in New York on Thursday gusty under thick cloud cover.
  <br>
  <br>
  Witnesses told the outlet that a rotor blade had come loose from the aircraft, while footage on social media showed pieces of the aircraft breaking off and the helicopter plunging into the waterway.

  "A Bell 206 helicopter crashed and is submerged in the Hudson River in New York City," the Federal Aviation Administration said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The FAA and the National Transportation Safety Board will investigate."
  <br>
  <br>
  New York City Police commissioner Jessica Tisch said the helicopter took off around 3 pm, flying south before heading up the Manhattan shoreline to the George Washington Bridge turning back towards the downtown Manhattan heliport, losing control and hitting the water near a Hoboken pier.
  <br>
  <br>
  The police commissioner said the aircraft was operated by New York Helicopter which did not respond to a request for comment but lists the Bell 206 among its fleet. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks suffered another battering on Thursday, giving back a sizeable portion of the prior session's gains as investors grappled with lingering uncertainty about US President Donald Trump's trade and economic policies.
 <br>
  <br>
  Major US indices spent the entire day in the red, disappointing traders who had been hoping to extend Wednesday's rally following Trump's pivot on tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  The broad-based S&P 500 finished down 3.5 percent at 5,268. The index had soared 9.5 percent on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 2.5 percent to 39,593, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index slumped 4.3 percent to 16,387.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wednesday's historic rally followed Trump's decision to pause for 90 days many of his most onerous tariffs on trading partners, while doubling down on levies on China.
  <br>
  <br>
  US stocks wiped out trillions of dollars in value in the sessions after President Trump's "Liberation Day" tariff announcement before the president's reversal on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  But by Thursday, investors realized that Trump's tariff pause "is not enough to get people back in this market," said Peter Tuchman, senior floor trader at TradeMas Securities.
  <br>
  <br>
  Data showed that US consumer inflation contracted 0.1 percent from a month earlier in a reading that was lower than analyst expectations.
  <br>
  <br>
  But traders have been unnerved by the massive reversals in Trump's policies, resulting in uncertainty that economists warn can paralyse consumers and businesses.
  <br>
  <br>
  Energy was the biggest loser among the 11 S&P 500 sectors, where 10 groups finished in the red. Only consumer staples mustered a small gain. (AFP)

    HK exporters to receive extra support amid tariffs

<img alt="Algernon Yau (third left) met with representatives of industries which are more affected by the tariffs, such as jewellery, textiles and garment, food and aluminium.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong authorities have offered further support to insure local small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) against pre-shipment risks amid sweeping tariffs, while announcing measures to help them tap into new markets.
 <br>
  <br>
  Taking immediate effect, the three measures introduced by the Hong Kong Export Credit Insurance Corporation came as US President Donald Trump decided to ramp up duties on Chinese goods to 125 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development Algernon Yau met on Thursday representatives of industries which were more affected by the tariffs to hear their views.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yau also hit out at Washington for "repeatedly changing its policies" and increasing tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is totally illogical and ungrounded, once again showing the US's bullying act for suppressing its competitors," Yau said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I call upon the business community to unite and face the challenges together with a view to jointly counteracting the unreasonable coercion of the US."
  <br>
  <br>
  Among the measures is the extension of free pre-shipment risk protection to "Small Business Policy" holders to June 30, 2026.
  <br>
  <br>
  The insurance policy is tailor-made for exporters with an annual turnover of less than HK$50 million, covering contracts of sale and service they have with overseas buyers and clients.
  <br>
  <br>
  Exporters not covered by the "Small Business Policy" will also receive a 50 percent discount on pre-shipment cover premiums, while the premium rates for new markets have been slashed to align with those for traditional major markets to help them tap into Asean nations.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Commerce and Economic Development Bureau pledged to maintain close liaison with the business trade to "jointly respond to the unreasonable coercion of the US" and support SMEs in financing, enhancing competitiveness and expanding into more diversified markets.

<img alt="Donald Trump is said to have posted a few minutes after Wall Street opened that 'IT'S TIME TO BUY', hours before he announced a 90-day suspension of additional tariffs.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Several American senators have called for an investigation into whether US President Donald Trump engaged in insider trading or market manipulation by encouraging people to buy stocks just before his dramatic reversal on global tariffs.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Who in the administration knew about Trump's latest tariff flip flop ahead of time? Did anyone buy or sell stocks, and profit at the public's expense?" California Democratic Senator Adam Schiff posted on X on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm writing to the White House – the public has a right to know," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Democratic members of the House Financial Services Committee wrote on X that "the President of the United States is literally engaging in the world's biggest market manipulation scheme."
  <br>
  <br>
  The accusations came as Trump posted a few minutes after Wall Street opened that "IT'S TIME TO BUY".
  <br>
  <br>
  A few hours later, he announced a 90-day suspension of additional tariffs against dozens of countries, with the exception of China, triggering a historic stock market rebound.
  <br>
  <br>
  After several days of collapse, the Dow Jones index ended Wednesday up 7.87 percent, its biggest gain since 2008, and the Nasdaq up 12.16 percent, the most since 2001.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump also signed his post on Truth Social with the letters "DJT" – both his initials and the stock market abbreviation for his media company, Trump Media & Technology Group. The company's shares closed the day up 21.67 percent. (AFP)

<img alt="Elena Rybakina, right, and Yulia Putintseva connect with fans following their win over Australia at the Patrick Rafter Tennis Centre in Brisbane.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Billie Jean King Cup finals in Shenzhen have been brought forward from November to September, organisers announced on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The event had already been reduced from 12 teams to eight, aligning with the men's Davis Cup Finals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Qualifiers for the finals started on Thursday, with teams fighting for six tickets to China to join the hosts and defending champions Italy.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This rescheduling from November to September aligns the event with the start of the WTA tournaments in Asia, supporting player calendar flow," the organisers said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The finals will get under way on September 16, with the final to be played on September 21.
  <br>
  <br>
  Italy won their fifth title in the women's team event last year by defeating Slovakia in the final in Malaga.
  <br>
  <br>
  The announcement came as world number 10 Elena Rybakina earlier in the day showed all her battling qualities to beat Kimberly Birrell 6-3 7-6(4) and give Kazakhstan an unassailable 2-0 lead over seven-times champions Australia in their Billie Jean King Cup qualifier in Brisbane.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rybakina, the 2022 Wimbledon champion, went down an early break in the Group D tie but cranked up her powerful forehand and drew level after six games before claiming the opening set on serve with a big ace at the end.
  <br>
  <br>
  Birrell raced to a 5-1 lead in the next but squandered a set point and Rybakina clawed her way back with some ferocious shot-making to clinch victory via the tiebreak.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was such a difficult match," said Rybakina, who secured her eighth victory in 10 singles matches since her debut in the competition in 2021.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm super happy to bring the win for the team ... it's always nice to be back in Australia."
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier, Yulia Putintseva defeated debutant Maya Joint 6-2 6-1 at Pat Rafter Arena to give Kazakhstan the early lead in the best-of-three matches contest. (AFP/Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Manchester United on Thursday assured SAR fans that a “full team” including captain Bruno Fernandes will be featured in a friendly against Hong Kong, China next month.
 <br>
  <br>
  The match – set for May 30 at Hong Kong Stadium – is part of the Red Devils’ post-season Asia tour, which kicks off with a stop in Kuala Lumpur.
  <br>
  <br>
  It marks the Premier League side’s return to the SAR after 12 years. They last visited the city in 2013, when they defeated local club Kitchee 5-2.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a press event held a day before tickets went on sale, Manchester United’s Director of Tour and Friendlies Christoffer Komen said the lineup is still being finalised, but promised the team will put on a show.
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted key players are not required for international duty until June and that a “full team” should be coming to the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  “You can be confident to see our stars, of course led by our team captain Bruno, we’ve also got all the players lined up currently to join us on a plane,” Komen said.
  <br>
  <br>
  There was backlash last year over Lionel Messi’s no-show at an exhibition match in the SAR, which left local supporters frustrated.
  <br>
  <br>
  At the press event, Eric Fok, chairman of the Football Association of Hong Kong, China welcomed the Red Devils’ return, calling it an opportunity to attract football enthusiasts across Asia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Also attending the event was Ashley Westwood, head coach of the SAR football team, who said the squad would treat the friendly as preparation for their Asian Cup qualifier against India in June.
  <br>
  <br>
  ProEvents, organiser of the friendly, said there are contractual agreements in place to ensure the appearance of United's key players.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You just heard from Manchester United's executive saying that they will be coming with the full team." said its chairman, Paul Kam.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I have also seen the list and they are coming, with obviously the first one being Bruno Fernandes, the captain. Together with [Alejandro Garnacho] and other players, they're all in there."
  <br>
  <br>
  Tickets for the friendly fixture will go on sale at noon on Friday via ticketing platform Cityline. They will be priced between HK$390 to HK$2,990.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Stocks rocketed on Thursday as a relief rally spread through markets after Donald Trump paused crippling tariffs on US partners, with Chinese investors even brushing off his decision to ramp up duties on Beijing to 125 percent.
 <br>
  <br>
  In Hong Kong, the benchmark Hang Seng Index ended up 2.06 percent at 20,681.78.
  <br>
  <br>
  That marks a third day of gains after it collapsed more than 13 percent on Monday in its worst day since 1997 during the Asian financial crisis.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index rose 1.76 percent to end at 7,668.38, and the Hang Seng Tech Index climbed 2.66 percent to end at 4,813.74.
  <br>
  <br>
  The across-the-board gains by markets tracked a blistering performance on Wall Street as the US president said he would delay for 90 days measures announced last week that set off a firestorm on trading floors and sparked global recession fears.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said he would keep in place a basic levy of 10 percent on dozens of countries but upped the ante in his brutal trade war with superpower rival China by hitting it even harder after it retaliated.
  <br>
  <br>
  China's own 84 percent retaliatory measures kicked in on Thursday, later saying that the United States "goes against the whole world" with the measures.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tokyo's Nikkei surged more than 9 percent, while Taipei's 9.3 percent gain was its best rise on record – after Monday's 9.7 percent drop represented its worst fall.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shanghai gained more than one percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong and Shanghai markets have been given extra support by optimism that China will unveil fresh stimulus to support its economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Seoul, Singapore, Jakarta, Sydney, Saigon and Bangkok climbed between four and 6.6 percent. Manila and Wellington were also well in the positive territory.
  <br>
  <br>
  In early trade, Paris and Frankfurt cruised more than six percent higher and London rallied more than four percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tech firms were the standout performers, with Sony, Sharp, Panasonic and SoftBank chalking up double-digit gains, while airlines, car makers and casinos also enjoyed strong buying. (AFP/Xinhua)

 Authorities have said they will make it easier for people to cook freshly caught fish on boats, as part of a push to promote island hopping tourism.
 <br>
  <br>
  Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism Rosanna Law said in an interview with Wen Wei Po published on Thursday that the easing of fishing regulations is part of the administration's medium-term plan in boosting tourism.
  <br>
  <br>
  She pointed out that in the short run, the government will also consider increasing the number of docking spaces for yachts in Victoria Harbour, revealing that there will be docking and landing step facilities available within the year in Lei Yue Mun.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister also noted that there is interest from the business sector in Hong Kong's plan to develop island and coastline tourism, and that the government plans to play a facilitating role.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, Law told the newspaper that the director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office Xia Baolong had told her in a meeting in Beijing last week that the SAR can be innovative, especially in utilising its coastlines.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Postal Savings Bank of China has announced a commitment to provide no less than 10 trillion yuan in financing to private businesses over the next five years, reinforcing its dedication to supporting the country's private sector amid economic headwinds.
 <br>
  <br>
  The lender said it is expected to earmark at least three trillion yuan specifically for technology innovators and over three trillion yuan targeting agricultural sector development, as part of efforts to help more than 5,000 companies in the private sector enhance their governance capabilities.
  <br>
  <br>
  The major state-owned commercial bank, in partnership with the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, recently introduced an action plan aimed at empowering private enterprises, targeting operational growth, technological innovation and digital transformation, among other critical areas.
  <br>
  <br>
  Key programs under the plan include a tailored financing pipeline for private companies, tech R&D support packages, and digital upgrades for small businesses.
  <br>
  <br>
  By the end of 2024, the bank's outstanding loans to private enterprises had reached 2.44 trillion yuan – which served over 3.4 million businesses. (Xinhua)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Commerce Ministry on Thursday said China will continue taking countermeasures to safeguard the country's sovereignty, security and development interests, emphasising that protectionism is a one-way road.
 <br>
  <br>
  At a news conference, ministry spokesperson He Yongqian pointed out that China’s foreign trade resiliency has not diminished, despite facing increasingly significant challenges.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said authorities are confident about its ability in dealing with various trade risks and challenges, and that the nation will hedge against uncertainty coming from the external environment.
  <br>
  <br>
  China will "follow through to the end" if the US insists on its own way, He said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ministry also warned that the US tariffs severely impact global economic stability, warning that there is no winner in a trade war.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The US has recently... announced the imposition of indiscriminate tariffs on all its trading partners, including China, which seriously infringe upon the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese companies and severely impact the stability of the global economic order," He said.
  <br>
  <br>
  She added that while the door is always open, using pressure, threats and blackmail is not the way to deal with China.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dialogue must be on the basis of mutual respect and equality, she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a regular Foreign Ministry briefing, spokesman Lin Jian said China does not want to fight trade and tariff wars, but will not flinch when it comes.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that the US tariffs go "against the whole world" and seriously undermine the rules-based multilateral trading system as well as the stability of the global economic order. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Chinese Manufacturers' Association on Thursday urged the SAR administration to roll out support measures to help enterprises with stabilising their working capital amid the global trade war.
 <br>
  <br>
  The association said manufacturers, exporters and importers globally tend to hold off on plans and suspend orders due to the present fast-changing developments.
  <br>
  <br>
  The group's president, Wingco Lo, said Hong Kong firms should be prepared for a protracted trade war and urged the government to introduce targeted measures to help them.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said firms should take the opportunity to expand their markets given the turmoil caused by the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The policies are unstable," Lo said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They are always changing very fast, so we have to be cautious.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think we will be taking the strategy of waiting to see how these things develop.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are looking for new markets, emerging markets especially, to [be] less dependent on the US market."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lo also urged the government to actively explore potential markets and expand economic and trade cooperation with countries in the Middle East and Africa.

    US tariffs fundamentally wrong, finance chief says

<img alt="Financial Secretary Paul Chan says that the US reciprocal tariffs are both politically and historically wrong. Photo: Information Services Department" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&w=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1799756_1_20250410134156.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Thursday slammed the latest US "reciprocal tariffs", which had earlier been imposed before being paused, as "fundamentally wrong" politically, economically and historically.
 <br>
  <br>
  This came after US President Donald Trump, in a stunning move, delayed the "reciprocal tariffs" against its major trading partners just hours after those tariffs took effect.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the latest reversal still leaves its trading partners facing 10 percent baseline tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  "These sweeping tariffs are disrupting global supply chains, inflating costs for both businesses and consumers, and creating significant uncertainty for cross-border investments," Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "While 'economic nuclear winter' may be an extreme term, we are certainly witnessing challenges to the global trading system unseen in a century," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Noting that the US tariffs will end with grassroot Americans bearing the brunt of increased costs for groceries and daily necessities, Chan also forecasts that three major regional trading blocs will emerge later on, with one being Asia Pacific, the second grouping India, the Middle East and Europe, and the third being the Americas.
  <br>
  <br>
  He indicated that China, as a major economy, could roll out stimulus measures to mitigate the tariffs' impact as the nation still has ample policy room and tools to cope.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our country has made its stance clear: we are open to resolving trade conflicts through dialogue based on mutual respect, not intimidation," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan again reiterated that the SAR's financial market remains resilient despite surging volatility as trading activity is robust while the local currency remains strong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "All margin calls were met on time, with no signs of stress," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "No systemic irregularities have been detected.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will remain vigilant and agile and ready to take appropriate measures, if needed."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan added that the city's de facto central bank, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, has set aside more than HK$50 billion to provide liquidity support for small and medium-sized enterprises.
  <br>
  <br>
  The city, he noted, will also continue to attract strategic enterprises to set up shop in the SAR, after helping more than 80 such firms to invest around US$60 billion here and provide some 20,000 jobs.

    Trump wants to 'make showers great again'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump has signed an executive order lifting water-pressure restrictions on showerheads, a move the White House said would "make America's showers great again".
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump has long complained about inadequate water pressure in American bathrooms, which he blames on federal water-conservation regulations.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In my case I like to take a nice shower, to take care of my beautiful hair," Trump said as he signed the order in the Oval Office on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I have to stand under the shower for 15 minutes till it gets wet.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It comes out drip, drip, drip. It's ridiculous."
  <br>
  <br>
  The order directs the Energy Department to roll back "radical green" regulations limiting the flow of showerheads to 9.5 litres of water per minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  The White House said the order "frees Americans from excessive regulations that turned a basic household item into a bureaucratic nightmare" and ends the "Obama-Biden war on showers".
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has targeted water-pressure standards for showerheads, toilets, dishwashers and other household appliances, since his first term.
  <br>
  <br>
  "My hair, I don't know about you, but it has to be perfect, perfect," he said outside the White House in 2020.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I take a shower, I want that beautiful head of hair to be just lathered," Trump said in Detroit in June.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I get this best stuff you can buy and I dump it all over.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And then I turn on the water and the damn water drips out.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I can't get the stuff out of my hair. It's a horrible thing."
  <br>
  <br>
  But according to the Appliance Standards Awareness Project, "shower head standards save consumers money on their water and energy bills and help the environment".
  <br>
  <br>
  "Testing has repeatedly shown that today's models can provide an excellent shower," the NGO said in a 2024 report. (AFP)

    Authorities doing more to tackle scams, mule accounts

<img alt="" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&w=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1799754_1_20250410132043.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Authorities on Thursday said they are stepping up efforts to tackle scam syndicates and their use of mule accounts to launder funds.
 <br>
  <br>
  This came after the number of scam cases rose by 12 percent, to almost 45,000 last year, involving more than HK$9 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some 8,600 people were arrested on suspicion of lending their bank accounts for money laundering in 2024, a jump of 44 percent from the previous year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among the new measures, police will be sharing with banks the account and phone numbers, as well as e-mails associated with suspicious bank accounts on its Scameter database.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) said banks could flag suspicious accounts, and when money goes into them, they can consider reminding clients of risks, conduct further vetting, or ask police for help.
  <br>
  <br>
  Subject to Legco's passage of a new law, local retail banks will also seek to step up data sharing of suspicious accounts and transactions by the end of the year.
  <br>
  <br>
  An executive director of the HKMA, Raymond Chan, said authorities and the sector will take steps to protect the privacy of clients.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Banks will only be sharing client information in specific situations such as scams and money laundering. The information can only be used for detecting and preventing banned activities," Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The sharing can only take place on a designated platform. One of the platforms is the Financial Intelligence Evaluation Sharing Tool (Finest) set up by the police."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said the HKMA and the force will closely monitor the information sharing system, and it will be issuing guidelines to banks on its use.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, a police chief superintendent, Kelly Cheng, said officers had taken steps to tackle cross-border scam cases.
  <br>
  <br>
  She noted that in a joint operation spanning several months last year, mainland authorities arrested 251 people in connection with more than 500 scam cases.
  <br>
  <br>
  The arrestees – most of them from the mainland – were suspected of coming to Hong Kong to open bank accounts before going back across the border.

    AI to turbocharge fintech growth in Asia: Paul Chan

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan said on Thursday the integration of artificial intelligence technology into the fintech industry could help turbocharge financial development across Asia.
 <br>
  <br>
  His remarks came as the government-owned investment body, Hong Kong Investment Corporation (HKIC), launched a strategic partnership with locally-based virtual bank, WeLab Bank, to further enrich the city's fintech ecosystem.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a ceremony marking the partnership, Chan noted that the city's fintech industry, with firms numbering some 1,100, has seen rapid growth over the past year, rising by five places to rank fourth on the Global Financial Centres Index in terms of fintech evaluations.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that it's essential for the industry to incorporate the latest AI technology into its services so as to transform the finance and banking systems.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For instance, AI technologies can uncover correlations between seemingly unrelated factors, enabling the identification of credit worthiness in individuals who might otherwise be regarded as unqualified for lending," Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is exactly what WeLab is achieving for its innovative technologies.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm confident that through this partnership HKIC and WeLab can assist more local and regional enterprises to leverage AI and fintech, thereby unlocking the potential of finance, to support economic development across Asia."
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters after the event, HKIC chief executive Clara Chan hoped the strategic partnership can help more SAR firms tap into overseas markets.
  <br>
  <br>
  "WeLab has already established a foundation in southeast Asia, their contacts, experience, and ability there can help these companies to accelerate their expansion into the overseas markets there," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Launched in 2019, WeLab Bank said it has been ramping up its adoption of AI in recent years and has integrated DeepSeek's AI models into its local system.
  <br>
  <br>
  The virtual lender has just reported its first monthly profit in December as it speeds up expansion into the southeast Asian market, including Indonesia and Thailand.
  <br>
  <br>
  HKIC, meanwhile, has also struck a strategic partnership deal with chipmaker, StarFive, to speed up the adoption of the popular RISC-V chips, an open-source architecture used to design less-sophisticated semiconductors, in the SAR.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Electricity consumption by data centres will more than double by 2030, driven by artificial intelligence applications that will create new challenges for energy security and CO2 emission goals, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  At the same time, AI can unlock opportunities to produce and consume electricity more efficiently, the agency said in its first report on the energy implications of AI.
  <br>
  <br>
  Data centres represented about 1.5 percent of global electricity consumption in 2024, but that has increased by 12 percent annually over the past five years. Generative AI requires colossal computing power to process information accumulated in gigantic databases.
  <br>
  <br>
  Together, the United States, Europe, and China currently account for about 85 percent of data centre consumption.
  <br>
  <br>
  Big tech companies increasingly recognise their growing need for power. Google last year signed a deal to get electricity from small nuclear reactors to help power its part in the artificial intelligence race.
  <br>
  <br>
  At the current rate, data centres will consume about three percent of global energy by 2030, the report said.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to the IEA, data centre electricity consumption will reach about 945 terawatt hours by 2030.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is slightly more than Japan's total electricity consumption today. AI is the most important driver of this growth, alongside growing demand for other digital services," said the report.
  <br>
  <br>
  One 100 megawatt data centre can use as much power as 100,000 households, the report said.
  <br>
  <br>
  But it highlighted that new data centres, already under construction, could use as much as two million households. (AFP)

    S Korean opposition leader opens presidential bid

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korean opposition leader Lee Jae-myung, widely seen as the frontrunner in a presidential by-election triggered by the removal of President Yoon Suk Yeol last week, officially announced a presidential bid on Thursday, vowing to heal a starkly divided nation through economic growth.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lee, who narrowly lost the 2022 election to Yoon, led the liberal Democratic Party’s campaign to oust the former president over his December declaration of martial law.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee recently stepped down as the party’s chairman to focus on campaigning for the June 3 election. He is considered the clear frontrunner in party's primary. Kim Dong-yeon, the Democratic governor of Gyeonggi province and a longtime financial policymaker, also told reporters on Wednesday that he intends to run for president.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon’s downfall has left the conservative People Power Party in disarray, with roughly 10 politicians expected to seek the nomination, reflecting a split between Yoon loyalists, who still control the party’s leadership, and reformists calling for a fresh start.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a video message, Lee said that Yoon’s martial law saga exposed the country’s deep divisions and social conflicts, and argued that the root cause was a widening rich-poor gap. He promised aggressive government spending to jolt economic growth and ease income polarisation.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We have more than we did in the past, but wealth is too concentrated in certain areas,” Lee said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “With economic growth rates declining worldwide, it has become difficult to maintain and develop an economy solely on the strength of the private sector. However, with government-led talent development and extensive investments in technological research and development, we can revive the economy.”
  <br>
  <br>
  He also said it was crucial to maintain a robust alliance with the United States and to pursue three-way cooperation with Japan, but he stressed that South Korea’s national interest should come first in “every decision”.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee, who has served as a lawmaker, provincial governor and city mayor, is adored by supporters for his outspoken style and has long positioned himself as an anti-elitist.
  <br>
  <br>
  His critics view him as a populist who stokes division and demonises conservative opponents, while failing to offer realistic funding plans to achieve his ambitious goals. (AP)

    'Hefty US tariffs on China are very irrational'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An industry veteran on Thursday described US President Donald Trump's decision to further raise the levy on Chinese goods to 125 percent as “very irrational”, with experts saying Hong Kong firms should rely less on the US market.
 <br>
  <br>
  The chairman of the Federation of Hong Kong Industries, Steve Chuang, told an RTHK radio programme that many federation members are adopting a wait-and-see approach, as the situation is changing every day.
  <br>
  <br>
  His remarks came less than a day after Beijing announced it would further raise tariffs on US goods to 84 percent, starting at noon on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chuang pointed out that the amount of tariffs imposed by the US does not matter anymore, as levies have already made it impossible for businesses in the SAR to trade with the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The main challenge to businesses in Hong Kong is that if they continue to manufacture the goods in China, should they go ahead with shipping?"
  <br>
  <br>
  "Would American buyers cancel the order? All of them cannot react at the moment, including US buyers, many of them don't know what to do now,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chuang revealed that some trading partners in the US have decided to either put their orders on hold or cancel them.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Billy Mak from the Hong Kong Baptist University said he believes the US wants to cut ties with China by imposing the hefty tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  The professor from the Department of Accountancy, Economics and Finance added that unless talks are held between the world's two largest economies, companies should rely less on US markets and seek to boost trade with Asean or countries along the Belt and Road.
  <br>
  <br>
  And Gary Lau, chairman of the Hong Kong Association of Freight Forwarding and Logistics told the same show that Trump's decision to triple small parcel tariffs from the mainland and SAR will hit local exports the most, as e-commerce platforms accounted for most shipments.
  <br>
  <br>
  He revealed that many platforms are trying to ship out their orders before the measure takes effect next month.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Dominican Republic rescue workers ended the search for survivors of a nightclub roof collapse as the death toll surpassed 180 in the Caribbean nation's worst disaster in decades.
 <br>
  <br>
  Emergency personnel late on Wednesday reported 60 more deaths compared to the morning's count, with the total confirmed tally reaching 184.
  <br>
  <br>
  An official statement had earlier said that "all reasonable possibilities of finding more survivors" had been exhausted, and the focus of the operation will turn to recovering bodies.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Today we will complete the rescue effort," said Jose Luis Frometa Herasme, head of the fire service in the Dominican capital Santo Domingo, where the tragedy ocurred at the Jet Set nightclub in the early hours of Tuesday, sending shockwaves through the nation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Relatives of missing people were still waiting desperately for news on Wednesday of their loved ones outside the ruined club, at hospitals and at the local morgue.
  <br>
  <br>
  Over 300 rescue workers, aided by sniffer dogs, had spent two days combing through mounds of fallen bricks, steel bars and tin sheets, supported by firefighters from Puerto Rico and Israel.
  <br>
  <br>
  Aerial images of the site showed a scene resembling the aftermath of an earthquake, with a gaping hole where the roof of the club – a fixture of Santo Domingo's nightlife for half a century – had been.
  <br>
  <br>
  Over 500 people were also injured when the roof caved in while renowned merengue singer Rubby Perez was performing for a crowd of hundreds.
  <br>
  <br>
  Perez and two former Major League Baseball players were among the dead.
  <br>

    Alejandro Tabilo stuns Djokovic in Monte Carlo

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Novak Djokovic rued a "horrible" performance as he crashed out of the Monte-Carlo Masters in his opening match.
 <br>
  <br>
  The fifth-ranked Djokovic struggled to find his rhythm in a 6-3, 6-4 loss to Chilean Alejandro Tabilo in the second round  on Wednesday, making an inauspicious start to his clay season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Djokovic, 37, went into the tournament hampered by an eye infection that has been troubling him since the semi-finals in Miami at the end of March and admitting that he did not have "very high" expectations for Monte Carlo.
  <br>
  <br>
  As it transpired a sluggish performance meant that Tabilo, who also beat Djokovic on clay in last year's Italian Open in Rome, faced few difficulties in claiming a rare 2-0 head-to-head record against the 24-time Grand Slam winner.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was actually more like the worst day [at the office]," said Djokovic.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I was hoping it was not going to happen, but it was quite a high probability I'm going to play this way.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Just horrible. Horrible feeling to play this way, and just sorry for all the people that have to witness this."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Serb, who is chasing his 100th ATP title, has not won a tournament since taking gold at last year's Paris Olympics.
  <br>
  <br>
  Djokovic brushed off any fitness concerns and said his main focus for the clay season was the French Open.
  <br>
  <br>
  He is set to play in Madrid later this month for the first time since 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I expected myself at least to have put a decent performance. Not like this. It was horrible," said Djokovic, who has only once reached the semi-finals in Monte Carlo since the last of his two titles in the principality in 2015.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I did not have high expectations, really. I knew I'm gonna have a tough opponent and I knew I'm gonna probably play pretty bad.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But this bad, I didn't expect."
  <br>
  <br>
  Tabilo, ranked 32 in the world, will face Bulgarian Grigor Dimitrov in the last 16.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It has been a tough year, so a little bit of the nerves were there," said Tabilo, who earned consecutive tour-level wins for the first time since August.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was an unreal match." (AFP)

<img alt="Mark Carney and his wife Diana Fox are targeted because of a photograph showing them with Jeffrey Epstein's convicted accomplice, Ghislaine Maxwell. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&w=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1799735_1_20250410115043.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney is leaning into his banking background as his country fights a trade war with the United States, but his financial ties have also made him a target for conspiracy theories.
 <br>
  <br>
  Incorporating tropes familiar to followers of the far-right QAnon movement, conspiratorial social media posts about the Liberal leader have surged ahead of the country's April 28 election.
  <br>
  <br>
  Posts range from false claims he recited a "satanic chant" at a campaign event to AI-generated images of him in a pool with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He's the ideal person to be targeted here, for sure, due to his background, as well as his financial work," said Ahmed Al-Rawi, an associate professor of communications at Canada's Simon Fraser University.
  <br>
  <br>
  Before serving as governor of both the Bank of Canada and the Bank of England, Carney had a lucrative career as an investment banker at Goldman Sachs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mentioning a candidate's affiliation with the global financial elite, and particularly the World Economic Forum, has become a dog whistle for the right.
  <br>
  <br>
  Canada's Conservatives have leapt to highlight Carney's connections to the annual gathering in Davos, with party leader Pierre Poilievre in January describing him as "the voice for the billionaire globalist elite that have been impoverishing the working class around the world."
  <br>
  <br>
  Anti-establishment sentiment is present on the left, but Al-Rawi noted people trying to associate Carney with a supposed circle of nefarious elites were "mostly far-right players and provocateurs."
  <br>
  <br>
  Many posts have zeroed in on a picture from a festival in Britain showing Carney and his wife standing next to Epstein's convicted accomplice, Ghislaine Maxwell.
  <br>
  <br>
  This 2013 photo is authentic, but it precipitated the spread of several AI-generated images shared to emphasize a supposed link between Carney and Epstein.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Canadian Digital Media Research Network found a small number of bot accounts pushed the association by replying to posts from Canadian political figures. Once larger accounts began to engage with the claims, millions of views rolled in.
  <br>
  <br>
  Al-Rawi said for conspiracy theorists, a grain of truth mixed with fabricated evidence is enough for a claim to truly take hold.
  <br>
  <br>
  A spokesman with the Carney campaign said the claims being spread were "false and disinformation" and said any insinuated connection with Maxwell was incorrect.
  <br>
  <br>
  "She went to high school with Mark Carney's wife's sister," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Although they may have bumped into each other in public settings, they are not friends."
  <br>
  <br>
  Experts said engagement with the claims appears to be somewhat contained to groups already critical of Carney's Liberal Party.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carmen Celestini, an assistant professor in religious studies at the University of Waterloo, said the push appears to be building on attacks that were successful in hitting Carney's predecessor, Justin Trudeau.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It just sort of makes sense to move those conspiracy theories towards Carney," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Polls indicate that Carney's replacement of Trudeau coincided with a surge in Liberal support. (AFP)
