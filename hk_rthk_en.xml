<img alt="Bernadette Linn ruled out wage cuts as part of the solution to high construction costs. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795404_1_20250312134220.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Development secretary Bernadette Linn said reviewing construction standards and centralising procurement of materials are among concrete measures that the government will take to lower costs.
 <br>
  <br>
  Her bureau had conducted research last year on why construction costs are high by comparing projects here with those in other major cities around the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on RTHK's Overview Policy programme on Wednesday, Linn said it's been quite some time since officials had taken a look at local construction standards, such as those on design and use of materials.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the past, our standards tended to be closer to those in the UK or the European Union. But  construction industries in many places in the world now have their own development," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We can take reference from more places, including the mainland of course, and the advantage of this is that we can then turn them into our own standards and possibly open up more markets and sources [of materials] for ourselves."
  <br>
  <br>
  Linn stressed that suppressing local wages is not a way to lower costs, describing it as a hot potato social issue.
  <br>
  <br>
  But she added that by this year, officials will start on the central procurement of certain construction materials, as well as cutting red tape for project approvals.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The government uses a similar bunch of construction materials for a project, or a series of projects, such as steel. So we can centralise the procurement and buy in bulk at cheaper prices," Linn said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As for streamlining the project approval process, we don't give empty promises, we'll look to come up with concrete measures to streamline the administrative process in the coming months."
  <br>
  <br>
  She said the time-saving move for administrative procedures comes after legal changes in 2023 to compress the statutory time needed for project approvals.

    Social workers board 'to review applications by law'

<img alt="Chris Sun says he's confident the Social Workers Registration Board will fulfill its duties when reviewing renewal applications. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795387_1_20250312120912.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Labour and Welfare Chris Sun said on Wednesday he believes the Social Workers Registration Board will review any renewal application as required by law.
 <br>
  <br>
  Sun was speaking a day after social worker Jackie Chen was convicted of rioting during the 2019 protests.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to the board’s website, Chen’s registration as a social worker expired last month and that her renewal application is being considered.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The Social Workers Registration Ordinance states clearly that if certain designated offences are committed, the Social Workers Registration Board will fulfill its duties. I firmly believe the board will handle renewal applications in accordance with the law and the regulations, including Chen’s request,” Sun said after attending a radio programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ordinance states that the board may refuse to register people who committed a crime that “may bring the profession of social worker into disrepute and is punishable with imprisonment” as a social worker.
  <br>
  <br>
  Social workers who commit more serious offences, including murder, rape, as well as any offence endangering national security will be permanently removed from the registration list.

    Trump's 25 pct tariffs on steel and aluminium in force

<img alt="A new wave of US tariffs sees levies of 25 percent on steel and aluminium imports. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795389_1_20250312121525.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump's increased tariffs on steel and aluminum imports took effect on Wednesday as prior exemptions, duty free quotas and product exclusions expired.
 <br>
  <br>
  His administration says the move is to reorder global trade norms in favour of America and its citizens.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's action to bulk up protections for American steel and aluminum producers restores effective global tariffs of 25 percent on all imports of the metals and extends the duties to hundreds of downstream products made from the metals, from nuts and bolts to bulldozer blades and soda cans.
  <br>
  <br>
  The runup to the tariff deadline came with some drama on Tuesday as Trump threatened Canada with doubling the duty to 50 percent on its steel and aluminum exports to America.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Trump backed off those plans after Ontario Premier Doug Ford agreed to suspend his province's decision to impose a 25 percent surcharge on electricity exports to the states of Minnesota, Michigan and New York until earlier US tariffs were removed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ford said he would fly to Washington on Thursday with Canadian Finance Minister Dominic LeBlanc for talks with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and other Trump officials to discuss revising the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement on trade.
  <br>
  <br>
  The incident whip-sawed US financial markets already jittery over Trump's broad tariff offensive, but left unchanged Trump's original plans to strengthen the Section 232 national security tariffs on steel and aluminum imposed in 2018 during his first term.
  <br>
  <br>
  A White House spokesperson described the US pressure on Canada as a "win" for the American people.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US Customs and Border Protection agency cut off imports qualifying for duty-free entry under quota arrangements well before the midnight deadline, saying in a bulletin to shippers that quota paperwork needed to be processed by 4.30pm local time on Tuesday at US ports of entry or the full tariffs would be charged.
  <br>
  <br>
  The move was welcomed by US steel producers as restoring Trump's original 2018 metals tariffs that had been weakened by numerous country exclusions and quotas and thousands of product-specific exclusions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "By closing loopholes in the tariff that have been exploited for years, President Trump will again supercharge a steel industry that stands ready to rebuild America," Steel Manufacturers Association President Philip Bell said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The countries most affected by the tariffs are Canada, the biggest foreign supplier of steel and aluminum to the US, Brazil, Mexico and South Korea, which all have enjoyed some level of exemptions or quotas. (Reuters)

    Cavs beat Nets for second 15-game win streak of season

<img alt="Darius Garland scored 18 of his 30 points in the fourth quarter. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795390_1_20250312121604.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Darius Garland scored 30 points as the Cleveland Cavaliers staged a double-digit comeback to bag their 15th straight victory with a 109-104 defeat of the Brooklyn Nets.
 <br>
  <br>
  Cleveland looked to be heading for a shock loss after lowly Brooklyn raced into an 18-point lead in the third quarter against a Cavs line-up missing the rested Donovan Mitchell.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Garland produced an explosive late burst of scoring to haul Cleveland back into the contest and extend the Cavaliers' lead at the top of the Eastern Conference to 55-10.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eighteen of Garland's points came in the fourth quarter after the Cavs had cut the Nets lead to eight points at the end of the third thanks to a remarkable 49-foot three-pointer from Craig Porter Jr.
  <br>
  <br>
  Porter's buzzer-beating heave from half-court left Cleveland trailing 86-78, and Garland then took over with a dazzling fourth-quarter display to see the Cavs home to the delight of the Rocket Arena crowd.
  <br>
  <br>
  The victory was the fifth time this season Cleveland have overturned a deficit of 15 points or more to win.
  <br>
  <br>
  A weary Garland admitted though he would have preferred an easier path to victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm sick and tired of comebacks," Garland joked after the win. "But we play hard for 48 minutes. We weren't shooting the ball the best so our defense took a stand."
  <br>
  <br>
  "This team is a really good unit – we stick together through the good times and the bad times," he added. "We were all locked in through the fourth quarter – that's when we put our hard hats on and go to work."
  <br>
  <br>
  Cleveland coach Kenny Atkinson saluted Garland's game-winning late charge.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He's the clutch player of the year," Atkinson said. "He just does it for us in the fourth quarter – he's done it for us all year."
  <br>
  <br>
  Garland received scoring support from Jarrett Allen, who had 13 rebounds and three blocks as well as scoring 23 points, and Evan Mobley who added 21 points.
  <br>
  <br>
  The loss was hard on Brooklyn, who went into the game fresh from Monday's upset win over the Los Angeles Lakers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cam Thomas led Brooklyn's scoring with 27 points while Cameron Johnson added 17 as the Nets fell to 22-43 for the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm proud of the guys because the first half was impressive," Nets coach Jordi Fernandez said. "I just wish we would have been rewarded with a win." (AFP)

    US Education Department to cut half its staff
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<div>
<img alt="The US Department of Education said affected employees will be placed on administrative leave from March 21. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795376_1_20250312104000.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The US Department of Education said on Tuesday it would lay off nearly half its staff, a possible precursor to closing altogether, as government agencies scrambled to meet US President Donald Trump's deadline to submit plans for a second round of mass layoffs.
 <br>
  <br>
  The terminations are part of the department's "final mission," it said in a press release, alluding to Trump's vow to eliminate the department, which oversees US$1.6 trillion in college loans, enforces civil rights laws in schools and provides federal funding for needy districts.
  <br>
  <br>
  The layoffs would leave the department with 2,183 workers, down from 4,133 when Trump took office in January.
  <br>
  <br>
  It's the latest step in Trump's sweeping effort to downsize the government, led by the world's richest person Elon Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).
  <br>
  <br>
  DOGE has cut more than 100,000 jobs across the 2.3 million-member federal civilian bureaucracy, frozen most foreign aid and cancelled thousands of programmes and contracts, despite dozens of lawsuits challenging the legality of those moves.
  <br>
  <br>
  All US government agencies have been ordered to come up with large-scale layoff plans by Thursday, setting up the next phase of Trump's cost-cutting campaign.
  <br>
  <br>
  Several agencies have offered employees payments to retire early to fulfill Trump's demand.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Education Department said affected employees will be placed on administrative leave starting on March 21.
  <br>
  <br>
  The union representing more than 2,800 department workers said it would fight the "draconian cuts".
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, NASA announced on Tuesday the dismissal of its chief scientist and others, marking the latest in a series of administrative actions undermining climate change research.
  <br>
  <br>
  While the move affects only 23 people, a spokeswoman indicated more cuts are coming.
  <br>
  <br>
  The first round notably eliminates the Office of the Chief Scientist, led by Katherine Calvin, a renowned climatologist who contributed to key UN climate reports. She and other US delegates were also barred from attending a major climate science meeting in China last month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Also eliminated are the Office of Technology, Policy, and Strategy, and the Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility Branch of the Office of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion.
  <br>
  <br>
  NASA has so far avoided the deep cuts affecting other agencies, reportedly due to last-minute intervention by Jared Isaacman, Trump's nominee for NASA chief.
  <br>
  <br>
  Isaacman, an e-payments billionaire and SpaceX customer, is seen as close to Elon Musk.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump, who has called climate change a "scam" and expressed disdain for the UN and climate science, has already pulled the US out of the Paris Agreement for a second time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, his administration has dismissed hundreds of employees at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the nation's other key climate agency, with more cuts expected. (Agencies)

    Maradona's medical team on trial over his death

<img alt="Fans of Argentine soccer legend Diego Maradona hold a banner that reads ''Justice for God'' in Buenos Aires. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795364_1_20250312091631.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Seven Argentines went on trial on Tuesday accused of homicide for their alleged role in what prosecutors called the "horror theatre" of football legend Diego Maradona's death four years ago.
 <br>
  <br>
  Maradona died on November 25, 2020, aged 60, while recovering at home from brain surgery for a blood clot, after decades battling cocaine and alcohol addictions.
  <br>
  <br>
  On trial are a neurosurgeon, a psychiatrist, a psychologist, a medical coordinator, a nursing coordinator, a doctor and a night nurse accused of being criminally negligent in the care they provided to the footballer in his final days.
  <br>
  <br>
  In an opening statement, the prosecution said it intended to submit "solid" evidence that no member of the medical team "did what they were supposed to do" in the "horror theatre" that was Maradona's deathbed.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Look, that's how Maradona died!" prosecutor Patricio Ferrari exclaimed in the courtroom, holding up a posthumous photo of Maradona, lying on his back in bed, his body grotesquely swollen.
  <br>
  <br>
  The gruesome picture brought Maradona's three daughters, Jana, Dalma and Gianinna, who attended the start of the trial, to the verge of tears.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They [the accused] are lying to you when they say they did not take part in murder," Ferrari charged.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fernando Burlando, lawyer for Dalma and Gianinna, described Maradona's medical team as "diabolical."
  <br>
  <br>
  The defendants face prison terms of between eight and 25 years if convicted on charges of "homicide with possible intent" - pursuing a course of action despite knowing it can cause death.
  <br>
  <br>
  Outside the court, dozens of fans waved banners calling for "justice."
  <br>
  <br>
  Veronica Ojeda, Maradona's former partner and mother of one of his sons, 12-year-old Dieguito, tearfully thanked them for their support before entering the courthouse.
  <br>
  <br>
  Maradona was found dead two weeks after going under the knife, in a rented house in an exclusive Buenos Aires neighbourhood where he was brought after being discharged from hospital.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was determined he died of heart failure and acute pulmonary edema, a condition where fluid accumulates in the lungs.
  <br>
  <br>
  The passing of the 1986 World Cup star plunged Argentina, and football fans worldwide, into mourning in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nearly 120 witnesses, including members of Maradona's family and doctors who previously tended to him, are expected to testify in the long-delayed trial in the Buenos Aires suburb of San Isidro.
  <br>
  <br>
  The hearings, adjourned until Thursday, are expected to run until July.
  <br>
  <br>
  A day nurse who found Maradona dead is to be tried separately, by jury.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prosecutors accuse his medical team of pushing for Maradona to receive home care, which proved "reckless" and "totally deficient."
  <br>
  <br>
  They allege the footballer was abandoned to his fate for a "prolonged, agonising period" before his death. (AFP)

 An economist at a leading investment bank on Wednesday said the main takeaways from the recently concluded Two Sessions was that China was prepared to handle the new round of US tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump.

  <br>
  During the annual meeting of the National People's Congress (NPC), Premier Li Qiang set a five percent growth target and vowed more support for private enterprises.

  , Alicia García-Herrero, chief economist for Asia-Pacific at Natixis, told Carol Musgrave that the NPC's emphasis on artificial intelligence development was also significant.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China has really rebuffed the US pressure, Trump's pressure, on China by maintaining the [growth] target by saying 'tariffs won't hurt me', and also by announcing amazing plans in terms of supporting AI development," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  García-Herrero acknowledged that tariffs from the US and other countries would create headwinds for China and could dampen the demand for Chinese exports, but added that Beijing had other policies in its toolbox to meet its economic targets.
  <br>
  <br>
  "What Premier Li Qiang announced to make this [growth] target credible was to do more stimulus, whether its fiscal, with a larger fiscal deficit from three percent to four percent, but also cutting interest rates."

 The Hang Seng Index rose 77.09 points, or 0.32 percent, to open at 23,859.23 points on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  On the mainland, the two main indices also opened higher. The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index rose 0.17 percent to 3,385.69 points, while the Shenzhen Component Index rose 0.33 percent to 10,897.42.

    Australia says US steel tariffs 'entirely unjustified'

<div class="itemFullText">
 Washington's looming tariffs on steel and aluminium are "entirely unjustified", Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said on Wednesday after failing to secure a last-minute exemption.
 <br>
  <br>
  "This is not a friendly act," Albanese told reporters, after the White House dashed hopes that Australia would be excluded from blanket 25 percent levies on steel and aluminium.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Quite clearly it is not a positive step in our relationship. It is as simple as that."
  <br>
  <br>
  US President Donald Trump's decision to slug close ally Australia was "entirely unjustified", Albanese said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is against the spirit of our two nations' enduring friendship. Friends need to act in a way that reinforces, to our respective populations, the fact that we are friends."
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite the setback, Albanese said Australia would not retaliate.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Tariffs and escalating trade tensions are a form of economic self-harm and a recipe for slower growth and higher inflation", he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Albanese hinted that Australia may be one of the few nations to secure an exemption following a phone call with Trump in February.
  <br>
  <br>
  White House officials told Australian media overnight that the exemption was no longer on the table.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He considered it, and considered against it," spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt told national broadcaster ABC.
  <br>
  <br>
  Australia is a minor global player in steel export markets but is a dominant source of iron ore, a key raw ingredient in the alloy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Australian steel producer BlueScope said it employed around 4,000 staff in the United States. (AFP)

    HA to cut medication dispensed to patients

<img alt="The Hospital Authority's chief pharmacist William Chui said around one-fifth of patients do not finish their medication. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795358_1_20250312090613.jpg&q=45">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hospital Authority said on Wednesday it was working on reducing the amount of medicine distributed to patients to reduce wastage.
 <br>
  <br>
  It said this applied in particular to long-term medications or those taken only when necessary.
  <br>
  <br>
  The authority's chief pharmacist William Chui said such measures were needed as around one-fifth of patients did not finish their medication.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Most of the non-adherence of patients is due to the forgetfulness. The second reason is because they are afraid of the side effect of the medication, and the third reason is because their symptoms improved, so they stop it by themselves," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under the first phase of its new arrangement from March 24, patients will be dispensed a maximum of 24 weeks drug supply each time. For medications exceeding that limit, patients will have to pick up their prescription in person at another time.
  <br>
  <br>
  For drugs prescribed when needed, such as painkillers, patients will receive no more than 25 percent of the total amount if the prescription is longer than 28 days.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the second phase of the arrangement - set to be implemented by the fourth quarter of this year - some 'use only when needed' drugs will be dispensed for up to eight weeks.
  <br>
  <br>
  The authority predicted that such measures could help reduce medical expenses and allow pharmacists to follow-up on a patient's drug usage.
  <br>
  <br>
  The authority added that there was room for price adjustments, namely the HK$15 paid for 16 weeks' worth of medicine.
  <br>
  <br>
  "At present, [the fee] is highly subsidised by the governmen," Chui said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Any savings from the medication or any savings from the fees and charges will be converted to the listing of new drugs, and also subsidise serious disease drug treatment," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The authority said it's in discussions with officials regarding fee adjustments. It said it would submit a proposal to the government after completing a review.

<img alt="Smoke rises from the MV Solong cargo ship in the North Sea, off the coast of England. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795360_1_20250312090215.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 British police on Tuesday arrested on suspicion of manslaughter the captain of a ship that crashed into a tanker in the North Sea, sparking a massive blaze and leaving one crew member missing, presumed dead.
 <br>
  <br>
  Investigations have already started into what led the cargo ship to strike the tanker carrying jet fuel on Monday, as fears remained of possible harm to the area's marine and wildlife.
  <br>
  <br>
  The UK Coastguard, which led the operation, rescued 36 people on Monday, including all of the 23 crew on the US-flagged Stena Immaculate tanker, which had been chartered by the US military.
  <br>
  <br>
  But a missing member of the Solong cargo vessel crew was "likely deceased", UK under-secretary for transport Mike Kane told parliament.
  <br>
  <br>
  Humberside Police in northern England said they had arrested a 59-year-old man on suspicion of gross negligence manslaughter in connection with the collision.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ernst Russ, owner of the cargo ship, then issued a statement saying that it "can confirm that the master of the... Solong has been detained by Humberside police in the UK".
  <br>
  <br>
  "The master and our entire team are actively assisting with the investigations," it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kane said the fire on the Stena Immaculate "appears to be extinguished" but this was not immediately confirmed by the Coastguard.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Solong is still alight and the fire on board the Stena Immaculate has greatly diminished," the UK Coastguard said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Coastguard was closely monitoring the Solong, which had broken free of the tanker overnight and was limping southwards, accompanied by four tugboats, including one which had a line attached to the stricken vessel.
  <br>
  <br>
  AFP photos taken during a helicopter fly-over showed smoke still pouring from the Solong, while a large hole could be seen in the side of the Stena Immaculate.
  <br>
  <br>
  The accident occurred at around 9:48 am local time on Monday when the Portuguese-flagged cargo ship ploughed into the tanker, anchored off the port of Hull.
  <br>
  <br>
  The German owners of the Solong on Tuesday said that the container ship was not carrying sodium cyanide, as had been reported the previous day. (AFP)

    Greenland votes in election eyed by Trump

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Greenland voted on Tuesday in legislative elections that could yield a timeline for independence for the Danish self-governing territory coveted by US President Donald Trump.
 <br>
  <br>
  Possibly signalling a Trump effect, turnout was higher than usual in the sole polling station in the capital Nuuk, according to election officials who extended voting - which had been due to end at 8:00 pm - by half an hour to allow long lines of voters to cast their ballots.
  <br>
  <br>
  First results were expected several hours later.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump, who has said he is determined to get his hands on the vast Arctic island "one way or the other", tried until the last minute to influence the vote, sparking astonishment, rejection, and, to a small degree, enthusiasm among the 57,000 Greenlanders, most of whom favour independence.
  <br>
  <br>
  After waiting in a long line with other voters, Greenland's outgoing Prime Minister Mute Egede - who celebrated his 38th birthday on Tuesday - cast his ballot shortly after polling statinos opened.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our country is in the eye of the storm," he said in a video posted to Facebook just hours before the vote.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The international community is watching us closely, and we have recently seen how much they are trying to influence our country," said Egede, leader of the left-green party Inuit Ataqatigiit (IA).
  <br>
  <br>
  The lead-up of the election to choose the 31-seat parliament, the Inatsisartut, was mostly marked by debates on healthcare, education, and future ties with Denmark, which still controls foreign, defence and monetary policy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Greenland's inhabitants - almost 90 percent of whom are Inuits - say they are tired of being treated like second-class citizens by their former colonial power, which they accuse of having historically suppressed their culture, carried out forced sterilisations and removed children from their families.
  <br>
  <br>
  All of Greenland's main political parties back independence but disagree on the timeframe. (AFP)

    Woods' major season in doubt after surgery

<img alt="Woods says he expects to make a full recovery after undergoing surgery. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795356_1_20250312082550.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Tiger Woods revealed he had undergone surgery to repair a ruptured left Achilles tendon, derailing the veteran golf superstar's comeback plans in the latest injury setback to rock the twilight of his glittering career.
 <br>
  <br>
  "As I began to ramp up my own training and practice at home, I felt a sharp pain in my left Achilles, which was deemed to be ruptured," Woods said in a post on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This morning, Dr. Charlton Stucken of Hospital for Special Surgery in West Palm Beach, Florida performed a minimally-invasive Achilles tendon repair for a ruptured tendon."
  <br>
  <br>
  Woods added a comment from Stucken, who said the surgery "went smoothly and we expect a full recovery".
  <br>
  <br>
  "I am back home now and plan to focus on my recovery and rehab, thank you for all the support," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Woods gave no timetable for his possible return from his latest debilitating injury.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the recovery time from an Achilles rupture can often last several months – which would almost certainly rule Woods out from playing in any of this season's majors if his latest injury follows the same timeframe.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 15-time major champion hasn't teed it up in a tournament since the Open Championship last July.
  <br>
  <br>
  After another back surgery in September he did play alongside 15-year-old son Charlie in the PNC Championship family event in Florida in December.
  <br>
  <br>
  He has also played in the TGL indoor simulator league he launched with Northern Ireland star Rory McIlroy this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the 49-year-old, still hampered by serious leg injuries he suffered in a 2021 car crash, hasn't played a regular PGA Tour event since the Genesis Invitational in 2024 -- when he withdrew early because of illness.
  <br>
  <br>
  Woods had committed to play in this year's Genesis Invitational but withdrew because he was "just not ready" days after the death of his mother, Kultida.
  <br>
  <br>
  Woods's latest injury setback comes less than a month before the first major of the year, the Masters at Augusta National. He finished 60th at the Masters last year and missed the cut in the year's other three majors.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite the litany of injury problems that have dogged him in recent years, Woods has repeatedly spoken of his desire to continue playing golf at the highest level, albeit with a scaled back tournament schedule.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'll play as long as I can play and I feel like I can still win the event," he said ahead of last year's British Open at Royal Troon.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking in December following his back surgery in September, Woods maintained that the "fire still burns to compete."
  <br>
  <br>
  "The difference is the recovery of the body to do it is not what it used to be," he admitted. "That's part of age and part of an athlete's journey."
  <br>
  <br>
  However, he acknowledged that he was uncertain about how much he would be able to play in 2025.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Whether my commitment going forward is once a month, yeah, I could say that all over again, but I truly don't know," he said. "I'm just trying to rehab and still get stronger and better and feel better, really give myself the best chance I can going into next year." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Paris Saint-Germain produced a historic turnaround to progress to the Champions League quarter-finals at Liverpool's expense as they triumphed 4-1 on penalties after a 1-0 second leg win at Anfield.
 <br>
  <br>
  Never in Liverpool's history had they lost a European tie after winning the first leg away from home but Ousmane Dembele's early strike brought the French champions level at 1-1 on aggregate.
  <br>
  <br>
  PSG were then perfect with their four spot-kicks, while Gianluigi Donnarumma saved from Darwin Nunez and Curtis Jones.
  <br>
  <br>
  Luis Enrique said before the game that the winners would progress to the final and PSG will be supremely confident of reaching the semi-finals at least as they will face Aston Villa or Club Brugge in the last eight.
  <br>
  <br>
  A famous victory for the Parisians was deserved over the tie after they dominated the first leg only to be denied by the brilliance of Alisson Becker in the Liverpool goal before Harvey Elliott snatched a late winner.
  <br>
  <br>
  The roles were reversed early on and Liverpool were made to rue not making more of their chances.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brilliant play by Alexis Mac Allister should have created the opener on four minutes when the Argentine's cross picked out Mohamed Salah, whose goalbound effort was deflected over by Nuno Mendes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Salah sliced wide another good chance on one of the few occasions he got the better of the determined Mendes.
  <br>
  <br>
  PSG took 10 minutes to ride out the storm from the home side before finding their feet.
  <br>
  <br>
  The visitors took the lead on 12 minutes when Ibrahima Konate could only turn Bradley Barcola's cross beyond Alisson to leave Dembele with a simple finish.
  <br>
  <br>
  The French international has now scored 23 goals in his last 17 games and could have had more before the end of the night.
  <br>
  <br>
  Konate nearly made amends immediately when his low shot was turned behind by Donnarumma.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, it was PSG who had the better openings to extend their advantage before half-time. Twice Alisson had to be at his sharpest to race off his line and save one-on-ones against Barcola and Dembele.
  <br>
  <br>
  PSG beat Liverpool to the signing of Khvicha Kvaratskhelia in January and the Georgian proved a constant menace to the Reds' defence.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kvaratskhelia's shot from Dembele's cross was arrowing towards the top corner until a deflection from Ryan Gravenberch took it just over the crossbar.
  <br>
  <br>
  Improved second-half performances have been a common theme of Arne Slot's first season at Liverpool and the hosts came roaring out of the traps after the break.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dominik Szoboszlai had a goal ruled out for offside against Luis Diaz earlier in the move.
  <br>
  <br>
  Szoboszlai then had a goalbound effort blocked by Willian Pacho before Donnarumma made a vital stop from Diaz from the resulting corner.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool's momentum could have been halted by the loss of Trent Alexander-Arnold to a knee injury after the right-back landed awkwardly.
  <br>
  <br>
  But his replacement, Jarell Quansah, was inches away from winning the tie when his header came back off the inside of the post.
  <br>
  <br>
  PSG barely threatened during the second half of the 90 minutes but Liverpool were left hanging on for penalties in extra time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lucas Beraldo's header and Desire Doue's shot flew just wide before more Alisson heroics kept PSG at bay with a stunning stop to turn Dembele's curling effort round the post.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, Alisson could not save them in the shootout as it was the other goalkeeper who was the hero.
  <br>
  <br>
  Donnarumma produced great saves to deny Nunez and Jones, either side of four confident strikes from Vitinha, Goncalo Ramos, Dembele and Doue to send PSG into the last eight.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the day's other results, Inter Milan are set to face Bayern Munich in the quarter-finals after seeing off Feyenoord 2-1 to complete a comfortable 4-1 aggregate victory. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lamine Yamal and Raphinha dazzled as Barcelona thumped Benfica 3-1, reaching the Champions League quarter-finals 4-1 on aggregate.
 <br>
  <br>
  Raphinha netted either side of a stunning Yamal strike as the Catalans dominated in the first half, building on their 1-0 last 16, first leg win in Lisbon.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nicolas Otamendi had quickly levelled Raphinha's opener but the visitors were blown away at the Olympic Stadium as Barcelona progressed comfortably from the tie and produced some moments of brilliant attacking football.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hansi Flick's side will face Borussia Dortmund or Lille in the quarter-finals as they aim to win the competition for the first time since 2015 and the era of Lionel Messi, Neymar and Luis Suárez.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are candidates to win everything," Raphinha said, with the club in the hunt for a potential treble.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For me the most important thing is what we did as a team and I am very happy with this victory," he continued, before praising teenager Yamal. "His goal was spectacular, it shows what Lamine is – he's a spectacular player with tremendous quality."
  <br>
  <br>
  Flick said Barca would play for late club doctor Carles Minarro, who died suddenly on Saturday ahead of the team's match against Osasuna, which was postponed, and the players observed a silence in his honour before kick-off.
  <br>
  <br>
  "What happened made us arrive at this game even more determined to win," added Raphinha.
  <br>
  <br>
  Five-time Champions League winners Barca took the lead after 11 minutes when Spain international Yamal burst into the area, chopped his way past Florentino and then mishit the ball across to Raphinha for a simple finish.
  <br>
  <br>
  Benfica levelled within two minutes when Otamendi escaped Ronald Araujo to head home from a corner.
  <br>
  <br>
  Barcelona goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny excelled in the first leg as the Catalans claimed an impressive win with 10 men after Pau Cubarsi's red card, but might have done more to keep out Otamendi's effort.
  <br>
  <br>
  However Barcelona, and particularly their wingers Yamal and Raphinha, were in sensational form and they quickly reclaimed their lead. (AFP)

<img alt="Days of back-and-forth on tariff hikes against some of the United States' closest trading partners have worn heavily on markets. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795347_1_20250312061323.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks finished lower on Tuesday on uncertainty surrounding President Donald Trump's tariff threats, just one day after taking a dramatic plunge on the back of recession fears.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump reported late in the afternoon that he would "probably" reconsider doubling planned tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminium, just hours after announcing a sharp hike.
  <br>
  <br>
  Days of back-and-forth on tariff hikes against some of the United States' closest trading partners have worn heavily on markets, while Trump's weekend refusal to rule out the possibility of a recession sent Wall Street tumbling Monday, with the Nasdaq marking its largest one-day loss since 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The volatility is nothing new to us over the course of the last three weeks," Art Hogan of B. Riley Wealth Management told AFP, adding that it's "largely driven by the uncertainty around things like tariffs."
  <br>
  <br>
  "The difference today is, for the first time in three weeks, it appears as though we might be getting a little bit of good news, it appears as though there might be a window cracked open in the negotiations with Canada on tariffs," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by 1.1 percent, bringing it to 41,433.48.
  <br>
  <br>
  The broad-based S&P 500 slid 0.8 percent to 5,572.07, while the tech-rich Nasdaq composite Index retreated 0.2 percent to 17,436.10.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since taking office in January, Trump has imposed sweeping tariffs on imports from Canada, Mexico and China -- even as he backed off some of the levies on his country's immediate neighbors.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Certainly the longer this uncertainty persists, the more investors are willing to take money off the table and de-risk their portfolios," Hogan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite its small drop, the tech-centric Nasdaq was bolstered by megacaps such as Tesla and Nvidia, which began to claw their way back following drastic plunges on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The electric car maker bounced 3.8 percent after Trump announced he was buying one of its vehicles.
  <br>
  <br>
  And AI chipmaker Nvidia was in positive territory Tuesday, climbing 1.7 percent after tumbling one day prior. (AFP)

    Ukraine backs ceasefire as US ends aid freeze

<img alt="US Secretary of State Marco Rubio speaks with the media following meetings with a Ukrainian delegation in Jeddah. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795341_1_20250312052757.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ukraine endorsed an American proposal for a 30-day ceasefire and agreed to immediate negotiations with Russia in crunch talks in Jeddah on Tuesday after three years of grinding military conflict.
 <br>
  <br>
  The positive response from Ukraine prompted President Donald Trump's administration to lift a freeze on military aid and to predict the beginning to an end to three years of war.
  <br>
  <br>
  With Trump stunning allies by applying intense pressure on Kyiv and reaching out to Moscow, Ukrainian officials came to talks in Saudi Arabia eager to make up and had proposed a partial truce on air and sea attacks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's advisers pressed for more and said Ukraine agreed to their proposal for a full month-long ceasefire in a war that has claimed tens of thousands of lives.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Today we made an offer that the Ukrainians have accepted, which is to enter into a ceasefire and into immediate negotiations," US Secretary of State Marco Rubio told reporters after around nine hours of talks in an ornate hotel in Jeddah.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We'll take this offer now to the Russians and we hope they'll say yes to peace. The ball is now in their court.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If they say no then we'll, unfortunately, know what the impediment is to peace here," Rubio said of Russia, which launched a full-scale invasion of its smaller neighbour in February 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rubio said the United States would immediately resume military assistance and intelligence sharing it had cut off to pressure its wartime partner following a disastrous February 28 meeting between Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Washington, Trump said he was ready to welcome Zelensky back to the White House and may speak to President Vladimir Putin this week.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked by a reporter about the prospects of a comprehensive ceasefire in Ukraine, Trump answered: "Well, I hope it will be over the next few days, I'd like to see.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I know we have a big meeting with Russia tomorrow and some great conversations hopefully will ensue."
  <br>
  <br>
  In a joint statement, Ukraine and the United States said they would conclude "as soon as possible" a deal securing US access to Ukraine's mineral wealth, which Trump demanded as compensation for billions of dollars in US weapons under his predecessor Joe Biden.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zelensky was supposed to sign the deal at the White House before the dramatic on-camera showdown, in which Trump and Vice President JD Vance dressed down the wartime leader and accused him of ingratitude.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zelensky quickly thanked Trump over the "positive" ceasefire proposal made in Jeddah and said the United States must now work to persuade Russia.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The American side understands our arguments, perceives our proposals, and I want to thank President Trump for the constructive conversation between our teams," Zelensky said in his evening address.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since the US cutoff of aid and intelligence sharing, Russia has stepped up attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure and seized back land in Russia's Kursk region which Ukrainian forces had infiltrated as they seek leverage.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hours before the Jeddah talks, Ukraine staged a major direct attack on Moscow, with hundreds of drones slamming into the capital and other areas, leaving three people dead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Top Zelensky aide Andriy Yermak said in Jeddah that Ukraine had made clear that its desire is peace.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Russia needs to say, very clearly, they want peace or not, they want to end this war, which they started, or no," Yermak told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's abrupt shift on Ukraine following Biden's strong support has rattled European allies, with France and Germany increasingly speaking of developing common European defence if the United States no longer offers its security guarantees through Nato.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Mike Waltz, Trump's national security advisor, countered that the brash president has "literally moved the entire global conversation" in support of peace.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We've gone from if the war is going to end to how the war is going to end," Waltz told reporters alongside Rubio.
  <br>
  <br>
  Waltz, who said he would speak in the coming days with his Russian counterpart, credited the Ukrainians with agreeing on the need to "end the killing, to end the tragic meat-grinder of people and national treasure".
  <br>
  <br>
  Rubio will head Wednesday to Canada -- another country with which Trump is feuding -- to meet fellow foreign ministers of the Group of Seven industrial democracies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rubio has said he will push the G7 to avoid "antagonistic" language about Russia for fear of scuttling diplomacy.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Poland, a top supporter of Ukraine and where historical memories of Russia run deep, Prime Minister Donald Tusk praised the "important step towards peace" by the United States and Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  Even if Russia agrees to a ceasefire, much remains uncertain in negotiations. Ukraine has pressed for security guarantees, but Trump, in another shift from Biden, has ruled out Nato membership.
  <br>
  <br>
  Waltz said that the talks in Jeddah discussed "substantive details on how this war is going to permanently end" including "what type of guarantees they're going to have for their long term security and prosperity".
  <br>
  <br>
  French President Emmanuel Macron, who has mulled European forces in Ukraine as part of any deal, said Tuesday that Kyiv needs "credible" security guarantees in any ceasefire. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A plane carrying former Filipino president Rodrigo Duterte left the Philippine capital bound for The Hague on Tuesday following his arrest on an International Criminal Court (ICC) warrant stemming from his deadly crackdown on drugs, Manila said.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 79-year-old faces a charge of "the crime against humanity of murder", according to the ICC, for a crackdown that rights groups estimate killed tens of thousands of mostly poor men, often without proof they were linked to drugs.
  <br>
  <br>
  President Ferdinand Marcos Junior told a press briefing that the plane carrying his predecessor had departed at 11:03 pm (1503 GMT).
  <br>
  <br>
  "The plane is en route to The Hague in the Netherlands allowing the former president to face charges of crimes against humanity in relation to his bloody war on drugs," said Marcos.
  <br>
  <br>
  Duterte was arrested at Manila's international airport Tuesday after "Interpol Manila received the official copy of the warrant of the arrest from the ICC", the presidential palace said.
  <br>
  <br>
  His daughter, current Vice President Sara Duterte, said he was being "forcibly taken to The Hague".
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is not justice – this is oppression and persecution," she said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Duterte had earlier taken to social media to say he believed the Philippine Supreme Court would step in and prevent his transfer.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Supreme Court will not agree to that. We do not have an extradition treaty," he said on Instagram live after his lawyers filed a petition.
  <br>
  <br>
  An ICC spokesman confirmed the arrest warrant on Tuesday and said an initial appearance hearing would be scheduled when Duterte was in court custody. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Pakistani insurgents attacked a passenger train in a tunnel and claimed to have taken over 100 hostages on Tuesday, as authorities struggled to reach the remote area. The fate of the estimated 500 people aboard was not immediately clear.
 <br>
  <br>
  Officials said the attackers blew up the railroad track in restive southwestern Balochistan province and exchanged fire with security guards aboard the train.
  <br>
  <br>
  The train was travelling from the provincial capital of Quetta to the northern city of Peshawar when it came under attack in Bolan district, government spokesman Shahid Rind said, calling it “an act of terrorism."
  <br>
  <br>
  Ambulances were dispatched, but access was not easy due to the rugged, mountainous terrain, Rind said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The separatist Baloch Liberation Army, which has waged a years-long insurgency, claimed responsibility for the attack and said it took over 100 hostages, including security forces who were on board.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials at Pakistan Railways said the Jafar Express train was carrying an estimated 500 passengers, including women and children.
  <br>
  <br>
  Three security officials said the BLA, which Pakistan and the United States have designated a terrorist organisation, ambushed the train inside a tunnel and used women and children as human shields. They said troops have launched an operation to rescue the hostages.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trains in Balochistan typically have security personnel on board. Separatists have previously carried out deadly attacks on trains in the region. In November, a separatist group carried out a suicide bombing at a train station in Quetta that killed 26 people.
  <br>
  <br>
  Oil- and mineral-rich Balochistan is Pakistan’s largest and least populated province. It is a hub for the country’s ethnic Baloch minority, whose members say they face discrimination and exploitation by the central government. (AP)

 US President Donald Trump on Tuesday said that he would double incoming steel and aluminium tariffs on Canadian imports from 25 percent to 50 percent, adding that these would take effect "tomorrow morning".
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump – in the statement which comes after the Canadian province of Ontario imposed an electricity surcharge on three US states – also threatened to "substantially increase" tariffs on cars coming into the United States on April 2.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the further tariffs would "permanently shut down the automobile manufacturing business in Canada".
  <br>
  <br>
  He also revived threats that the country would become "our cherished Fifty First State". (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Ukraine said talks with the United States in Saudi Arabia began "very constructively" on Tuesday, with a partial ceasefire with Russia on the table hours after Kyiv conducted its largest drone attack on Moscow in three years of war.
 <br>
  <br>
  US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Ukraine's Foreign Minister Andriy Sybiga attended the meeting in Jeddah – which Russia was not participating in – as President Donald Trump ramped up pressure on Ukraine to end the war that began with Russia's 2022 assault.
  <br>
  <br>
  The talks come just days after President Volodymyr Zelensky's public dressing-down at the White House, after which the United States cut off military aid, intelligence sharing and access to satellite imagery.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ukraine is hoping the offer of a partial ceasefire in the sky and at sea will persuade Washington to restore the assistance.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are ready to do everything to achieve peace," Ukrainian presidency chief of staff Andriy Yermak told reporters as he entered Tuesday's meeting at a luxury hotel.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kyiv officials said the "largest drone attack in history," in which hundreds of drones slammed into Moscow and other areas overnight, was intended to push Russian President Vladimir Putin to agree to the aerial and naval ceasefire.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is an additional signal to Putin that he should also be interested in a ceasefire in the air," said Andriy Kovalenko, a national security council official responsible for countering disinformation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Three people were killed in the attack, which both sides said was the biggest so far on Moscow. Russia's army said it intercepted 337 drones around the country. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) on Tuesday said it is investigating a cluster of gastroenteritis involving 52 teachers and students who participated in exchange tours to Shaoguan in Guangdong province earlier this month.
 <br>
  <br>
  They developed symptoms from March 3 to 10. Sixteen of them sought medical attention though none required hospitalisation.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CHP said the teachers and students – from three secondary schools – had dined at the same restaurants.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said some of them may have been infected by eating contaminated food, while others may have contracted gastroenteritis through person-to-person transmission or a contaminated environment.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CHP has notified authorities in Guangdong of the restaurants involved.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A bus overturned in an area of Johannesburg near South Africa's main airport early on Tuesday, killing at least 16 people, city officials said, with dozens more injured.
 <br>
  <br>
  The bus was carrying more than 50 people to work when it crashed on a busy road near Johannesburg's OR Tambo International Airport, officials said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Road Traffic Management Corporation (RTMC) said the crash "has so far claimed 16 lives." Twelve died at the scene and four more in hospital.
  <br>
  <br>
  The cause of the accident, which forced the closure of the highway leading to the airport, was not immediately known. Images from the scene showed the bus on its side.
  <br>
  <br>
  Preliminary investigations showed that the vehicle swerved, rolled and landed facing the direction from which it came, RTMC spokesman Simon Zwane said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials had earlier put the tally of people hurt at 45.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are lost for words. This is a disaster," Ekurhuleni city transport official Andile Mngwevu said.
  <br>
  <br>
  A survivor of the accident told Newzroom Afrika television that the bus appeared to be speeding.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 11,800 lives were lost on South African roads in 2023, most of them pedestrians, according to the latest data from RTMC. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Manchester United on Tuesday announced plans to build a new 100,000-capacity stadium that co-owner Jim Ratcliffe said would be the "world's greatest" football ground.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Premier League club have been examining whether to redevelop their historic Old Trafford home or build a new stadium in the same area.
  <br>
  <br>
  United have now confirmed their "intention to pursue a new 100,000-seater stadium as the centrepiece of the regeneration of the Old Trafford area" as they throw their "support behind the government's growth agenda."
  <br>
  <br>
  Scaled models and conceptual images for how the new Old Trafford and surrounding area could look like were revealed on Tuesday at the London headquarters of architects Foster + Partners, appointed in September to design the stadium district.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Today marks the start of an incredibly exciting journey to the delivery of what will be the world's greatest football stadium, at the centre of a regenerated Old Trafford," Ratcliffe said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our current stadium has served us brilliantly for the past 115 years, but it has fallen behind the best arenas in world sport." (AFP)

<img alt="Lau Siu-kai says Hong Kong should help Beijing build connections beyond Western countries. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795279_1_20250311172739.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A senior member of a leading national think tank on Tuesday said the annual "Two Sessions" which just wrapped up in Beijing showed China's emphasis on the economy and innovation amid Sino-US tensions.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lau Siu-kai, a consultant to the Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macau Studies, said Beijing has shifted its focus from export and infrastructure to consumption and innovation technology.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Basically the emphasis is still on the economy, particularly at a time when the world economy is in a poor state and that China is under containment by the United States. That's why China is very desperate to change the course of economic development," he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  In his annual work report, Premier Li Qiang called on Hong Kong to "deepen international exchanges and cooperation" while safeguarding the constitutional order.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lau highlighted the SAR's role in helping Beijing develop connections beyond Western countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Both China and Hong Kong today, in order to shake off the constraints imposed on us by the United States and its Western allies, we have to explore new opportunities for development from the non-Western world," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That's why China wants Hong Kong as an international city with widespread international linkages to help both Hong Kong itself and China to develop more connections with other places apart from the Western world."
  <br>
  <br>
  Looking ahead to the 15th Five-Year Plan that begins next year, Lau stressed the need for the city to align its development plan with the nation's strategy.
  <br>
  <br>
  During the weeklong "Two Sessions", the National People's Congress Standing Committee released a work report stating that Beijing will formulate the private economy promotion law to strengthen legal protection and policy support for private enterprises.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lau said he believes Beijing is stepping up support for and giving a bigger role to private companies, to put them on an equal footing with state enterprises.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Most importantly, Beijing will allow the private enterprises to have a much larger market within China, and to help them explore the opportunities abroad," he said.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The judiciary said on Tuesday it will start webcasting some proceedings at Hong Kong's top court from April 1, as part of a pilot scheme.
 <br>
  <br>
  It said certain types of Court of Final Appeal hearings will not be part of the two-year scheme.
  <br>
  <br>
  These include cases involving national security, commercial confidentiality, children or the mentally disabled, as well as those deemed to be "highly politically charged" or "high-profile public order cases".
  <br>
  <br>
  "Open justice is a key to maintaining public confidence in the judicial system and upholding the rule of law," the judiciary said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Live broadcasting of judicial proceedings beyond court premises will enhance the transparency of court procedures and strengthen public confidence in the judicial process."
  <br>
  <br>
  People will be able to watch the livestreams on the top court's website, but they are not allowed to record them or use the footage for any purpose, it said, adding that the media is no exception to this rule.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hearings will be kept online for a month.
  <br>
  <br>
  The upcoming pilot scheme comes after the top court conducted four webcast test runs last year.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Social worker Jackie Chen was on Tuesday convicted of rioting in Wan Chai during the 2019 protests, following a retrial.
 <br>
  <br>
  She will be sentenced next month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chen was accused of taking part in a riot on August 31, 2019, when protestors set up roadblocks with debris in Wan Chai and clashed with police. In 2020, a District Court judge ruled that she had no case to answer. The Department of Justice then lodged an appeal, leading to the retrial.
  <br>
  <br>
  In her ruling, Deputy District Judge May Chung said Chen chose not to leave the scene even though she clearly knew that it had turned into a dangerous riot.
  <br>
  <br>
  The judge said the defendant kept shouting false accusations against the police while they were dispersing protesters, prompting others to stick around and continue confronting officers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chung said the only reasonable explanation is that Chen intended to participate in the riot and encourage other people to engage in actions that undermined social order.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chen had pleaded not guilty and said she was trying to mediate.
  <br>
  <br>
  She did not testify in the latest trial.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 48-year-old is now on remand, and the court has been adjourned until April 3 for mitigation and April 9 for sentencing.

    'No plans for a comprehensive tax-regime review'

<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Tuesday said the government does not plan to conduct a comprehensive review on the SAR's tax regime in the near term, despite calls to introduce new sources of revenue to tackle the city’s deficit.
 <br>
  <br>
  He was responding to questions at a luncheon held by the Hong Kong Coalition of Professional Services in Wan Chai, where he also elaborated on his budget proposals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said the government is very cautious in its approach to adjusting the tax system, as competition remains intense with neighbouring regions to woo global talent and investments.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We believe that at this point, the most important [task] for the society is to concentrate our energy on developing the economy, to fend off external risks, so we do not want to distract our minds at this time, to ignite other controversies due to discussions over the tax regime," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, the finance minister said he expects the government to make extra cash in the coming financial year if Hong Kong's stock market continues to climb in the coming months.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SAR’s stock market has experienced a revival since the start of the year, with the average daily turnover for the first two months of 2025 at about HK$220 billion, an increase of 138 percent compared with HK$93 billion for the same period last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When I was calculating for the budget… I was assuming that the daily average stock turnover will be about HK$110 billion, but now we are talking about HK$200 billion," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Every HK$100 billion of turnover brings me about HK$130 million of stock stamp duty, so that's about 10 percent of the total. And if the daily average turnover is about HK$200 billion, that means we'll get an extra HK$130 million of revenue each day, and there are 250 [trading] days in a year, which will be a lot of money," he added.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The third annual session of the 14th National People’s Congress (NPC) concluded in Beijing on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  President Xi Jinping and other leaders attended the closing at the Great Hall of the People.
  <br>
  <br>
  But there was one notable absence: Zhao Leji, the NPC Standing Committee chairman, suffered a respiratory infection.
  <br>
  <br>
  His deputy, vice-chairman Li Hongzhong, took his place and presided over the ceremony.
  <br>
  <br>
  In his closing speech, Li declared the week-long session a success.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The meeting fully demonstrated democracy, and all work was conducted in strict accordance with the law. We identified our goals and tasks and also conveyed confidence and strength. It is a meeting about delivering real results through solid work, as well as forging unity,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Let us rally around the leadership of the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at the core, forge ahead with perseverance and diligence, and further contribute to the country’s modernisation with Chinese characteristics.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Nearly 2,900 NPC delegates in attendance passed seven draft resolutions, including one endorsing the annual government work report delivered by Premier Li Qiang last week.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong's sole delegate to the top legislature, Starry Lee, says it's a "responsible decision" for Zhao to skip the closing.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SAR deputy revealed the top official was also absent from two NPC presidium meetings.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We all understand that sickness is really difficult to control ... We noticed that he (Zhao) had been absent for two times already," she said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 China said on Tuesday it hoped a "just and lasting solution" can be found to the three-year war between Ukraine and Russia, ahead of talks that will involve Ukrainian and US officials in Saudi Arabia.
 <br>
  <br>
  "China supports all efforts that contribute to a peaceful resolution of the crisis," said Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning when asked about the talks at a regular news conference in Beijing.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We expect and hope that parties can reach a just and lasting solution that is acceptable to all sides," said Mao.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China is also willing to continue to work with the international community to play a constructive role for a political resolution of the crisis," she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The talks in Saudi Arabia will be the most senior since a disastrous White House visit last month when US President Donald Trump berated Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky for purported ingratitude.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zelensky has met with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman ahead of the talks between Ukrainian and US officials.
  <br>
  <br>
  During the meeting in Jeddah, the crown prince underscored the kingdom's support for international efforts to resolve Ukraine's crisis and achieving peace, the Saudi state news agency SPA reported early on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The United States, once Ukraine's main ally, has upended its policy on the conflict in its stated pursuit of a rapid end to the fighting, engaging directly with Moscow while stopping military assistance and intelligence sharing for Ukraine.

    Arab nations condemn Israel's Gaza electricity cut

<img alt="The Southern Gaza Desalination plant has stopped working after Israel cut off electricity supply to the Gaza Strip. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795253_1_20250311152458.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Jordan on Tuesday condemned Israel's decision to cut electricity supply to the war-battered Gaza Strip, calling in separate statements for the international community to take action.
 <br>
  <br>
  Israel announced on Sunday it was disconnecting the only power line to a water desalination plant in Gaza, in an effort to pressure Palestinian militant group Hamas into releasing hostages amid an apparent impasse in truce talks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Saudi Arabia's foreign ministry expressed "condemnation in the strongest terms of the Israeli occupation authorities' use of collective punishment against Palestinians in the Gaza Strip by cutting off electricity to the area".
  <br>
  <br>
  A Qatari foreign ministry statement said the Gulf state "strongly condemns the Israeli occupation's act of cutting electricity to the Gaza Strip, considering it a blatant violation of international humanitarian law".
  <br>
  <br>
  Jordanian foreign ministry spokesman Sufyan Qudah called the electricity cut "a clear continuation of the policy of starvation and siege imposed by Israel", about a week after Israeli authorities blocked the entry of aid into Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  The United Nations has warned of "dire consequences" for Gaza's population, while Britain said it was "deeply concerned" by the Israeli move.
  <br>
  <br>
  Saudi Arabia called on the international community to "take urgent actions immediately", while Qatar also urged "immediate action to provide the necessary protection for the Palestinian people".
  <br>
  <br>
  Jordan's Qudah called on the world "to assume its legal and moral responsibilities, and oblige Israel to continue with the ceasefire agreement... restore electricity to Gaza" and reopen border crossings for aid deliveries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israeli negotiators were expected to hold talks with mediators in Qatar, part of efforts to extend a fragile truce since January that has largely halted the war in Gaza, triggered by Hamas's attack on Israel on October 7, 2023. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A mainland man was jailed for three months on Tuesday, after pleading guilty to using fake academic qualifications to gain a spot in a Chinese University (CUHK) postgraduate programme.
 <br>
  <br>
  Bao Junyang, 30, admitted to obtaining services by deception at Shatin Court.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prosecutors dropped a separate charge of using a false statement to obtain an entry permit against the defendant.
  <br>
  <br>
  The court heard that Bao claimed to have graduated from New York University, and managed to gain admission to CUHK's Master of Business Administration programme around two years ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  Acting principal magistrate Cheang Kei-hong rejected the defence's plea for a community service order, saying it would be unrealistic.
  <br>
  <br>
  The magistrate gave one third of a discount for the jail sentence due to the guilty plea.

    'President Xi gave reassurance to private enterprises'

<div class="itemFullText">
 An entrepreneur who founded China's largest seed supplier Shandong Denghai Seeds said President Xi Jinping's speech at a symposium last month provided much-needed reassurance to the nation's private enterprises.
 <br>
  <br>
  Li Denghai, known as "the father of hybrid corn", attended the symposium on February 17 – which also included tech giants Alibaba, Huawei and Tencent, as well as emerging tech company DeepSeek – at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was the first meeting between Xi and private entrepreneurs in six years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Li quoted the president as saying China will unwaveringly encourage, support and guide the development of the non-public sector economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This has made us more confident and determined in developing private enterprises. It felt like a reassurance," he told RTHK in an exclusive interview on the sidelines of the "Two Sessions" in Beijing.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We learned that capable private companies can work on important national projects, and have a platform or opportunity to serve the country and show what we're capable of doing. We're excited that we can play a part in the country's development."
  <br>
  <br>
  When asked about challenges, the National People's Congress deputy said growing his seed business isn't easy because of strict rules for land use.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In terms of the overall development process, we need to have land and build facilities, which require government approval. This is still quite challenging, right? Currently, land control is quite strict," Li said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said manpower is another issue because fewer young people want to work in agriculture these days.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing will formulate the private economy promotion law to strengthen legal protections and policy support for private enterprises, as stated in the work report released by the National People's Congress Standing Committee.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chairman of Muyuan Foodstuff Qin Yinglin, who also attended the symposium last month, said the new law showed the country's determination to create a fairer business environment.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a written reply to RTHK, Qin said he hopes the government will continue to improve the legal environment, so private enterprises can dedicate themselves to developing their business.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wei Gejun, an adviser to the People's Bank of China, said the central bank is working with commercial banks to support private enterprises, such as making it easier for companies to get loans.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wei said private companies will continue to get loans at low interest rates for the next few years and have better access to different types of funding.

    Ex-Philippine president Duterte arrested in Manila

<img alt="Former Philippine president Rodrigo Duterte was arrested after landing in Manila from Hong Kong. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795225_1_20250311113948.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Former Philippine president Rodrigo Duterte was arrested by police at Manila's international airport on Tuesday on the order of the International Criminal Court (ICC) in connection with a case of crime against humanity filed against him, the Philippine government said.
 <br>
  <br>
  The office of the Philippine president said Duterte was arrested after arriving from Hong Kong and police took him into custody on orders of the ICC, which has been investigating the mass killings that happened under the former president's deadly crackdown against illegal drugs.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ICC launched an investigation into drug killings under Duterte from November 1, 2011, when he was still mayor of Davao, to March 16, 2019, as possible crimes against humanity.
  <br>
  <br>
  Duterte withdrew the Philippines in 2019 from the Rome Statute in a move human rights activists say was aimed at escaping accountability over the killings.
  <br>
  <br>
  His administration moved to suspend the global court’s investigation in late 2021 by arguing that Philippine authorities were already looking into the same allegations, arguing the ICC – a court of last resort – did not have jurisdiction.
  <br>
  <br>
  Appeals judges at the ICC ruled in July 2023 the investigation could resume and rejected the Duterte administration’s objections.
  <br>
  <br>
  Based in The Hague, the Netherlands, the ICC can step in when countries are unwilling or unable to prosecute suspects in the most heinous international crimes, including genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity.
  <br>
  <br>
  President Ferdinand Marcos Jr, who succeeded Duterte in 2022 and became entangled in a bitter political dispute with the former president, has decided not to rejoin the global court.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the Marcos administration has said it would cooperate if the ICC asks international police to take Duterte into custody through a so-called Red Notice.
  <br>
  <br>
  China on Tuesday warned the ICC against "politicisation" and "double standards", after Duterte’s arrest.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China has noted the relevant information and is closely monitoring the development of the situation," Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning told a briefing in Beijing when asked about the arrest. (Agencies)

    'Restaurants may need to pay more to delivery firms'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A catering sector representative on Tuesday said he was concerned restaurants would need to pay higher fees for using delivery platforms in future.
 <br>
  <br>
  This came a day after online food delivery platform Deliveroo announced it would shut down its Hong Kong operations next month, leaving Foodpanda and mainland-based Keeta in the sector.
  <br>
  <br>
  Simon Wong, president of the Hong Kong Federation of Restaurants and Related Trades, said eateries might still get away with paying less for the moment, but that would probably not continue.
  <br>
  <br>
  “In the short term, I believe there will be intense competition between the two companies, Foodpanda and Keeta. But in the end when they find a balance where neither can defeat the other, then restaurants may have to accept that there will be fewer discounts,” he told an RTHK radio programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, a marketing professor from Hang Seng University said the delivery market in Hong Kong is saturated and the city could only accommodate two to three delivery platforms at most.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kenneth Kwong told the same programme that delivery platforms need to think of other forms of business opportunities.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The delivery platform operators should come up with new ideas, for example working more closely with restaurants, as well as expanding their business. Can they also deliver household items as well? I think this will open up more space for development in the market,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The scholar thinks Deliveroo made the decision to exit Hong Kong market purely on commercial considerations.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the operating costs for delivery platforms are quite high as they need to update their software and hardware on a regular basis.

 A local deputy to the National People's Congress has stressed that Hong Kong is ready to co-host its first National Games in November, despite a recent hiccup at a major snooker tournament in Kai Tak.
 <br>
  <br>
  Herman Hu, a former vice-president of the Sports Federation and Olympic Committee of Hong Kong, China, told RTHK in an exclusive interview in Beijing that the organisers had "learned a lesson" after spectators were booted before the end of a match.

  <br>
  The newly-opened Kai Tak Sports Park - the venue from where fans enjoying the World Snooker Grand Prix were ejected - is set to host a number of National Games competitions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm quite sure that [the Kai Tak Sports Park] is already ready," said Hu.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on the sidelines of the "Two Sessions" in the capital, he said organisers could learn from what happened during the snooker tournament.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That is not a big problem. I’m sure all the people concerned have ways to tackle that," Hu said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Over 13 days later this year, Hong Kong will host the nation's top athletes in cycling, fencing, rugby sevens, beach volleyball, golf, triathlon, men's handball and men's under-22 basketball.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hu urged officials to better promote these sports and educate the public on "how to appreciate" the competitions, such as organising district tournaments.
  <br>
  <br>
  Additionally, the SAR will help organise cross-border events, including a marathon and road cycling competition.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to Hu, there was room for further collaboration with counterparts across the border.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I personally had a conversation with the Guangdong province's sports bureau and they welcome us to go there anytime. And especially they have a lot more facilities and high-quality coaches, world-class athletes, that can work with our youngsters," Hu said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zhaoqing, one of nine municipalities which make up the Greater Bay Area along with Hong Kong and Macau, will kick-start test events in May.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a written response to RTHK, Zhaoqing mayor Xu Xiaoxiong said the authorities were fully pushing forward preparatory work "in a state similar to a 100-metre sprint".
  <br>
  <br>
  Xu also said the Games could attract 150,000 spectators and tourists to the city, bringing in hundreds of millions of yuan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities from Shantou, a coastal city in eastern Guangdong which will also get a piece of the action, saw the Games as an "important opportunity" to promote regional cooperation and enhance its influence.

    Carney vows 'quick' transition to new government

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Canada's incoming prime minister Mark Carney has promised a "smooth" and "quick" transition from Justin Trudeau after his convincing win in the ruling Liberal Party's leadership race.
 <br>
  <br>
  But speaking on,
  <a href="https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/news-programmes/this-episode.htm?cmsid=77" target="_blank">
   <u>
    <b>
     RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme
    </b>
   </u>
  </a>
  , Professor Al Reyes of the University of Hong Kong told Carol Musgrave that Carney's tough position on President Donald Trump meant that relations between the US and Canada would continue to be fraught.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He made very clear that the retaliatory tariffs that he imposed would remain until there is stability or at least some resolution to the current tariff war, so one can expect 'Trumpy times'... they've been already fraught under [Justin] Trudeau and these waning days, I think they will continue to be once [Mark] Carney takes over," Reyes said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The upcoming general election will be a major test for Carney, a former governor of the Bank of Canada and Bank of England, who has never served in parliament nor held any elected public office.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He does not have a seat in parliament. That's one reason why it would be more likely that a general election would be called very soon, because he has to get a seat in parliament... I think the key challenges for him, not just trying to figure out how to deal with the United States, but also what are the alternatives in terms of trade and investment if relations with the United States are so difficult."
  <br>
  <br>
  Reyes added that domestically, the cost of housing, eliminating the carbon tax and immigration would be key issues for Carney going forward.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The New Orleans Pelicans will become the first NBA team to play in Australia when they tip off in two pre-season games in October, organisers said.
 <br>
  <br>
  Both matches, against Melbourne United and Melbourne Phoenix, will be played at Melbourne Park, best known for hosting the Australian Open tennis Grand Slam.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The significance of this announcement for basketball in Australia and the NBL can't be overstated," Larry Kestelman, owner and director of Australia's National Basketball League, said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hosting an NBA team in Australia has been a long-held dream for everyone at the NBL and to see this initiative finally come to fruition after a 15-year journey shows that much can be accomplished when you 'dream big'."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Pelicans, who feature two-time NBA All-Star Zion Williamson and top point guard Dejounte Murray, will be in action on October 3 and 5.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is an exciting moment for our organisation and a testament to the growing global impact of the NBA," said Pelicans president Dennis Lauscha.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Bringing the Pelicans and NBA to Australia for the first time is a proud milestone, and we are thrilled to be part of this unique opportunity to engage with fans in Melbourne," he added. (AFP)

    Arrest of pro-Palestinian student sparks outrage

<img alt="A demonstrator is detained by police officers during a protest following the arrest by US immigration agents of Palestinian student protester Mahmoud Khalil, in New York City. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795219_1_20250311105218.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Protesters in New York and rights groups expressed outrage on Monday over the arrest of a leader of pro-Palestinian demonstrations at Columbia University, as President Donald Trump vowed further crackdowns.
 <br>
  <br>
  Mahmoud Khalil, a recent graduate and one of the most prominent faces of the university's high-profile protests, was arrested by US immigration officials over the weekend despite holding a permanent residency green card.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Department of Homeland Security, confirming Khalil's arrest on Sunday, claimed he had "led activities aligned to Hamas" and that the DHS action was taken "in coordination with the Department of State."
  <br>
  <br>
  "We know there are more students at Columbia and other Universities across the Country who have engaged in pro-terrorist, anti-Semitic, anti-American activity, and the Trump Administration will not tolerate it," the president wrote on Monday on his Truth Social platform.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is the first arrest of many to come," he pledged.
  <br>
  <br>
  The protests at Columbia, launched last year in opposition to Israel's devastating war in Gaza, brought widespread media attention as tensions mounted on campus and spread to other universities around the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump and other Republicans have broadly accused the protesters of supporting Hamas.
  <br>
  <br>
  While the Trump administration moves to quickly deport Khalil, who has reportedly been moved to the southern state of Louisiana, a federal judge on Monday ordered authorities to halt proceedings.
  <br>
  <br>
  The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) condemned Khalil's arrest, calling it "unprecedented, illegal, and un-American."
  <br>
  <br>
  "The government's actions are obviously intended to intimidate and chill speech on one side of a public debate," said Ben Wizner, director of the ACLU's Speech, Privacy and Technology Project, in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Monday afternoon, over 1,000 protesters gathered in New York to express their outrage at Khalil's arrest.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This was essentially a kidnapping," said 42-year-old Tobi, who declined to give her last name for fear of retaliation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It seems like a clear targeting of activists, which is a really, really dangerous precedent," she said. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index fell 508.63 points, or 2.14 percent, to open at 23,274.86 points on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The sell-off followed a sharp fall in US stocks overnight, with investors concerned that US President Donald Trump's tariff policy could tip the world's biggest economy into recession. The three main US indices lost between two and four percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tokyo's Nikkei-225 and Seoul's Kospi Index also fell by over two percent in early trading.

<img alt="Footage shows flames and smoke rising from a collision between an oil tanker and a cargo ship off the northeastern coast of England. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795210_1_20250311093602.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The UK coastguard ended the search for a missing crew member after a cargo ship ran into a US-military charted tanker carrying jet fuel in the North Sea on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  HM Coastguard rescued 36 crew members from the Stena Immaculate tanker and Solong container vessel, with one taken to hospital.
  <br>
  <br>
  "One crew member of the Solong remains unaccounted for. After an extensive search for the missing crew member sadly they have not been found and the search has ended," said Matthew Atkinson, Divisional Commander for HM Coastguard.
  <br>
  <br>
  Images showed a huge plume of thick, black smoke and flames rising from the scene about 16 kilometres off the east England coast, sparking concerns of "multiple toxic hazards".
  <br>
  <br>
  The Stena Immaculate tanker was "anchored off the North Sea coast near Hull...
  <br>
  [and] was struck by the container ship Solong", the Stena's US-based operators Crowley said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Stena was on a short-term US military charter with Military Sealift Command, according to Jillian Morris, the spokesperson for the command that operates civilian-crewed ships providing ocean transport for the US Defense Department.
  <br>
  <br>
  Crowley said the impact of the collision "ruptured" the tanker "containing A1-jet fuel" and triggered a fire, with fuel "reported released".
  <br>
  <br>
  It was carrying around 220,000 barrels of jet fuel while the Solong was carrying 15 containers of sodium cyanide, according to the Lloyd's List information service, but it is not known if any of the flammable compound had leaked.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two vessels were still on fire 12 hours after the collision, said the coastguard.
  <br>
  <br>
  A spokesperson for UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer called the situation "extremely concerning".
  <br>
  <br>
  All crew members aboard the Stena Immaculate were confirmed to be alive, a spokeswoman for the tanker's Swedish owner, Stena Bulk, told AFP.
  <br>
  <br>
  The alarm about the crash near the port city of Hull in East Yorkshire was raised at 0948 GMT.
  <br>
  <br>
  A coastguard helicopter, a plane, lifeboats from four towns and other nearby vessels were part of the large rescue operation, UK Coastguard said. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Japan's economy expanded in the October-December quarter at a slower pace than initially reported, government data showed on Tuesday, weighed by weaker consumption but still likely supporting the case for further interest rate hikes.
 <br>
  <br>
  Gross domestic product expanded an annualised 2.2 percent in the three months to December, the Cabinet Office's revised data showed, slower than the 2.8 percent growth in the initial estimate and economists' median forecast.
  <br>
  <br>
  The revised numbers translate into a quarter-on-quarter expansion of 0.6 percent in price-adjusted terms, compared with a 0.7 percent growth issued on February 17.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Bank of Japan raised short-term interest rates in January to their highest in 17 years, and growth momentum in the world's fourth-largest economy will be among key factors determining how fast it continues to tighten policy.
  <br>
  <br>
  The capital expenditure component of GDP, a barometer of private demand-led strength, rose 0.6 percent in the fourth quarter, revised up from a 0.5 percent expansion in the initial estimate.
  <br>
  <br>
  Private consumption, which accounts for more than half of economic activity, was unchanged versus the preliminary reading of 0.1 percent uptick.
  <br>
  <br>
  External demand, or exports minus imports, contributed 0.7 of a percentage point to growth, unchanged from the preliminary reading. Domestic demand shaved 0.2 of a percentage point off.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separate data from the internal affairs ministry showed household spending rose 0.8 percent in January year-on-year.
  <br>
  <br>
  On a seasonally adjusted, month-on-month basis, spending dropped 4.5 percent, bigger than an estimated 1.9 percent decline. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 At least 25 people were killed in two separate bus crashes in Mexico on Monday, authorities said.
 <br>
  <br>
  In the country's north, 14 people died in a fiery collision between a tractor-trailer and a bus carrying passengers from the US state of Texas, civil protection authorities in Durango state said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Of the 24 people travelling in the bus, only 10 managed to get out alive, it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  In southern Mexico, a bus turned over along a highway in Oaxaca state, killing 11 people, authorities said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Twelve others were taken to the hospital with injuries, two of them in critical condition, the Oaxaca state government said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I extend my heartfelt condolences to the victims' families, to whom we will provide the necessary support and assistance during this difficult time," Oaxaca Governor Salomon Jara said on social media.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a interview on local radio on Monday afternoon, the state's interior minister, Jesus Romero, said the bus was carrying more than 40 people and was en route to the Isthmus of Tehuantepec in Mexico's south.
  <br>
  <br>
  Romero said it seemed that the passengers were heading home after attending a rally held on Sunday by President Claudia Sheinbaum in the capital Mexico City.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities will launch an investigation into the cause of the accident, which happened near the community of Santo Domingo Narro, it said. (Agencies)

 Elon Musk said his social media platform, X, has been targeted in a “massive cyberattack", hours after a series of outages on Monday left it unavailable to thousands of users.
 <br>
  <br>
  “We get attacked every day, but this was done with a lot of resources," Musk claimed in a post. "Either a large, coordinated group and/or a country is involved. Tracing..."
  <br>
  <br>
  Later on Monday, Musk said on Fox Business Network’s Kudlow that the attackers had “IP addresses originating in the Ukraine area" without going into detail on what this might mean.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cybersecurity experts quickly pointed out, however, that this doesn't necessarily mean that an attack originated in Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  Security researcher Kevin Beaumont said on Bluesky that Musk's claim is “missing a key fact - it was actually IPs from worldwide, not just Ukraine.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Specifically, he said it was a Mirai variant botnet, which is made of compromised cameras. He said while he is not sure who is behind the attack, it “Smells of APTs - advanced persistent teenagers.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Allan Liska of the cybersecurity firm Recorded Future, meanwhile, pointed out that even if “every IP address that hit Twitter today originated from Ukraine (doubtful), they were most likely compromised machines controlled by a botnet run by a third party that could be located anywhere in the world.”
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 40,000 users reported having no access to the platform, according to the tracking website Downdetector.com. By Monday afternoon, the reports had dropped to the low thousands.
  <br>
  <br>
  A sustained outage that lasted at least an hour began at noon, with the heaviest disruptions occurring along the US coasts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Downdetector.com said that 56 percent of problems were reported for the X app, while 33 percent were reported for the website.
  <br>
  <br>
  Musk bought the former Twitter in 2022 and also serves as the CEO of Tesla. (AP)

<img alt="Bruno Guimarães put Newcastle in front early in the second half. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795186_1_20250311070727.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Newcastle reignited their bid to qualify for the Champions League as Bruno Guimarães sealed a controversial 1-0 win at West Ham.
 <br>
  <br>
  Brazil midfielder Guimarães struck in the second half as West Ham's claims for a foul in the build-up were ignored.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eddie Howe's side are up to sixth place in the Premier League, level on points with fifth-placed Manchester City and two points behind fourth-placed Chelsea.
  <br>
  <br>
  A top four berth will guarantee Newcastle return to the Champions League after missing out this season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Even finishing fifth could be enough to ensure qualification for Europe's elite club competition depending on the results of the remaining English clubs in continental action.
  <br>
  <br>
  After losing three of their last four matches, the Magpies' restorative victory was perfectly timed ahead of their second League Cup final appearance in three seasons.
  <br>
  <br>
  Newcastle, beaten by Manchester United in the League Cup showpiece in 2023, face Premier League leaders Liverpool in the final at Wembley on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Tyneside club are aiming to win their first major trophy since the 1969 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup and their first domestic prize since the 1955 FA Cup.
  <br>
  <br>
  "One of our best wins of the season, not in terms of performance but desire and heart," Howe said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I felt we were in need of a win to go into the final with a real boost. It will do us the world of good," he added. "Also for our league table position today was vital."
  <br>
  <br>
  West Ham boss Graham Potter added: "We didn't do enough to win the game but we could have got something out of it."
  <br>
  <br>
  "The goal was disappointing, we felt there was a push on Kilman," he said. "It's two hands on the back. You can see from Isak's non celebration he thinks it's a push. Clear for us, but I'm not VAR." (AFP)

 Police have arrested the driver of a private car, who allegedly fled following a three-vehicle pile-up in the Shing Mun Tunnel on Monday morning.
 <br>
  <br>
  Officers arrested the 34-year-old man in Tsuen Wan on Monday afternoon on suspicion of dangerous driving causing grievous bodily harm and other charges linked to leaving the scene of an accident and not reporting it.

    Wall Street sells off on US recession fears

<img alt="The main three US indices fell between 2 percent and 4 percent. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795182_1_20250311061228.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks fell sharply on Monday as investors fretted that uncertainty over President Donald Trump's tariff policy could tip the world's biggest economy into a recession.
 <br>
  <br>
  The moves came after Trump refused to rule out the possibility of a 2025 recession, saying there would be "a period of transition, because what we're doing is very big -- we're bringing wealth back to America."
  <br>
  <br>
  Tech stocks led the slump, with the tech-focused Nasdaq Composite Index marking its largest one-day loss since 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Nasdaq plunged by 4.0 percent, bringing it to 17,468.32.
  <br>
  <br>
  The broad-based S&P 500 Index retreated 2.7 percent to 5,614.56 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average slid 2.1 percent to 41,911.71.
  <br>
  <br>
  Major tech names saw sharp losses, with Tesla shares diving 15.4 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Others among the so-called Magnificent Seven stocks -- which include Google parent Alphabet, Amazon, Meta and Nvidia -- also sank.
  <br>
  <br>
  While markets were previously bolstered by hopes of tax cuts and lighter regulation, Steve Sosnick of Interactive Brokers noted that sentiment has been bogged down by more immediate worries over tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since taking office in January, Trump has imposed sweeping tariffs on imports from Canada, Mexico and China -- even as he backed off some of the levies on his country's immediate neighbors.
  <br>
  <br>
  A new wave of tariffs threatens to hit this week, with steep levies of 25 percent on steel and aluminum due to take effect Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Ongoing confusion about tariffs and concerns that maybe the Doge cuts are excessive led to a drop in consumer sentiment, and are now leading to fears of a slowdown or higher inflation or both," Sosnick said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was referring to sweeping cuts to the federal government overseen by Trump's billionaire advisor Elon Musk and his so-called Department of Government Efficiency (Doge). (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China hopes that the incoming government in Canada will adopt a positive and pragmatic approach towards Beijing, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said on Monday after Mark Carney's victory in the leadership race for Canada's ruling party, paving the way for him to succeed Justin Trudeau as prime minister.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a regular press conference, Mao congratulated the former central banker on his win, while urging Canada to work with China to promote improvement and development of relations.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We expect Canada to adhere to an objective and rational understanding of China and pursue a positive and pragmatic policy towards China," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mao also said the two countries should develop relations based on mutual respect, equality and mutual benefit.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carney's victory came after Beijing announced tariffs on over US$2.6 billion worth of Canadian agricultural and food products on Saturday, in retaliation against levies Ottawa introduced in October.
  <br>
  <br>
  The levies, scheduled to take effect on March 20, match the 100 percent and 25 percent import duties Canada imposed on China-made electric vehicles and steel and aluminium products. (Xinhua/Reuters)

    EU says US not engaging to make deal to avoid tariffs

<div class="itemFullText">
 The United States does not appear to want to make a deal with Brussels to avoid hefty tariffs against the EU, the bloc's trade chief said on Monday, days before US steel and aluminium levies kick in.
 <br>
  <br>
  "The US administration does not seem to be engaging to make a deal," said Maros Sefcovic, who travelled to Washington last month in the hopes of reaching an agreement to avert a trade war.
  <br>
  <br>
  President Donald Trump has taken aim squarely at the European Union, charging last month that the bloc was formed "to screw" the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Wednesday, Trump's 25-percent tariffs across steel and aluminium imports are due to take effect, affecting the EU as well as Canada, Mexico, Brazil, South Korea and other trading partners.
  <br>
  <br>
  The EU has said it will respond firmly if the levies come into force.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As the US is watching over their interest, so is the European Union. Therefore, we will always protect European businesses, workers and consumers from unjustified tariffs because we know that they expect no less from us," Sefcovic told reporters in Brussels.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the trade commissioner stressed that the EU remained open to dialogue.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We want to have a constructive and positive relationship with the United States of America. And therefore, I would highlight once again that our doors are open for constructive engagement," Sefcovic said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also insisted the "overall picture" showed EU-US trade relations were balanced and mutually beneficial.
  <br>
  <br>
  The United States is Europe's largest investor, and vice versa, with US$5.7 trillion worth of investment in each others' markets based on 2022 data, according to EU figures. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Israel is due to send a delegation to Qatar on Monday for a fresh round of talks on extending a fragile ceasefire in Gaza, after cutting off the electricity supply to the besieged enclave.
 <br>
  <br>
  The first phase of the deal expired at the beginning of March with no agreement on subsequent stages that should secure a lasting end to Israel's war in Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamas accused Israel of reneging on the ceasefire deal, saying in a statement on Monday Israel "refuses to commence the second phase, exposing its intentions of evasion and stalling".
  <br>
  <br>
  Media reports said a top official from the domestic security agency Shin Bet will lead Israel's delegation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel has halted aid deliveries to Gaza amid the deadlock, and on Sunday announced it was cutting off the territory's electricity supply.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will use all the tools at our disposal to bring back the hostages and ensure that Hamas is no longer in Gaza the day after" the war, Energy Minister Eli Cohen said as he ordered the power cut.
  <br>
  <br>
  The move echoed the early days of the war when Israel announced a "complete siege" on the Palestinian territory, severing the electricity supply which was only restored in mid-2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamas spokesman Abdul Latif al-Qanoua said Israel's move will impact its hostages still held in Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The decision to cut electricity is a failed option and poses a threat to its (Israeli) prisoners, who will only be freed through negotiations," Qanoua said in a statement on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Germany criticised Israel on Monday for its latest decisions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Foreign ministry spokeswoman Kathrin Deschauer said Gaza was "again threatened with a food shortage" and that cutting off electricity was "unacceptable and not compatible with (Israel's) obligations under international law". (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Russia said on Monday it was expelling two British "diplomats" on suspicion of carrying out espionage activities.
 <br>
  <br>
  Russia's FSB security service said "counterintelligence work had revealed an undeclared British intelligence presence under the cover of the national embassy".
  <br>
  <br>
  It said it was expelling the embassy's second secretary, whom it named as Alkesh Odedra, and the husband of the first secretary of the embassy's political department, identified as Michael Skinner.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both had "deliberately provided false information when obtaining a permit to enter our country, thus violating Russian legislation", the FSB said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Russian foreign ministry has revoked their accreditations and ordered them to leave Russia within two weeks, the FSB said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The UK blasted the move as unfounded.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is not the first time that Russia has made malicious and baseless accusations against our staff," a UK foreign ministry spokesperson said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Russia's foreign ministry also summoned an embassy representative in connection with the allegations, it said in a post on Telegram.
  <br>
  <br>
  Relations between Moscow and London have been strained by intelligence scandals throughout Russian President Vladimir Putin years in power. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A deputy director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office on Monday said he does not believe the SAR's fiscal deficit is a major concern, citing the size of the city's economy.
 <br>
  <br>
  Wang Linggui, who's also a member of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), felt Hong Kong remains in a strong position despite an estimated deficit of HK$87.2 billion in the fiscal year ending March 31.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong's economic situation is not weak among developed economies in the world. Its economic growth exceeded two percent last year," he told reporters in Beijing.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A deficit of [around] HK$100 billion shouldn't be a big deal for an economy of Hong Kong's size."
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang noted the central government rolled out preferential policies for Hong Kong last year, adding more will come in the future.
  <br>
  <br>
  For instance, he said a multi-entry visa scheme will continue to expand to make it easier for mainland residents to visit the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he urged Hong Kong residents to be prepared for a rise in arrivals, including the need to draw up crowd control measures.

    Deliveroo to exit HK, sack 200 staff

<div class="itemFullText">
 Online food delivery firm Deliveroo said on Monday it is exiting Hong Kong for financial reasons, after operating in the SAR for nine years.
 <br>
  <br>
  Its UK-based parent company said its service platform will run until April 7, and it will close Deliveroo's operations by selling some assets to rival foodpanda, and closing other assets.
  <br>
  <br>
  About 200 staff members will be laid off.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There are several dynamics specific to the Hong Kong market which led the Board to consider strategic options," Deliveroo said in a statement, without explaining what the dynamics were.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Given the Group's commitment to disciplined capital allocation, [we] determine that it would not serve shareholders' best interests to continue to operate in Hong Kong."
  <br>
  <br>
  The company's chief operating officer, Eric French, said the firm wants to thank all of its staff, consumers, riders and restaurant and grocery partners in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  Deliveroo said in its 2024 interim results that Hong Kong "was a laggard amongst our major markets", citing "a more difficult market and competitive environment".
  <br>
  <br>
  Its Hong Kong market share fell after the entry of mainland-based Keeta, a subsidiary of Meituan, in late 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  The company said on Monday that Hong Kong represented five percent of the group's gross transaction value in 2024, and had a five percentage point negative impact on international gross transaction value growth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, foodpanda's parent, Delivery Hero, announced it reached an agreement with Deliveroo, saying that some of the outgoing food courier's customers and riders will be directed to foodpanda.
  <br>
  <br>
  Delivery Hero had said in a trading update last month that it saw "strong customer growth" in the SAR in December. (Additional reporting by Reuters)

 Hong Kong will improve as long as everyone works together to tackle the fiscal deficit, a former deputy director of Beijing's liaison office in the SAR said on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Qiu Hong, who is also a member of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), said unity is important when it comes to improving the economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think the deficit is a challenge Hong Kong faces in its development progress. As long as everyone works together and makes a joint effort for Hong Kong's future, I believe the situation will definitely keep improving," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Qiu also expressed optimism about the city's future, noting that residents are actively taking part in national development and Hong Kong's growth.

    Govt welcomes HK$200m donation to support AI

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's finance and technology ministers on Monday welcomed a HK$200 million donation by property developers to support the city’s generative artificial intelligence development.
 <br>
  <br>
  The fund will be used to support the Hong Kong Generative AI Research and Development Centre (HKGAI), and to develop an app for the recently launched HKGAI V1, the SAR's first locally developed generative AI tool.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a press event during which the donation provided by the Ng Teng Fong Charitable Foundation and Sino Group was announced, Financial Secretary Paul Chan said Hong Kong must grasp opportunities brought by AI.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The donation will support the establishment of a service platform for the InnoHK Research Clusters to provide services for residents based on the locally-produced large [AI] model, HKGAI," he told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I look forward to the further development of the model, to extend the platform to cover more application scenarios, so that the services will be more diversified and benefit more local residents," Chan added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong launched the HKGAI V1 large model about two weeks ago. It powers a chatbot called HKChat which is capable of answering users' questions on topics ranging from the SAR's government structure to cinema schedules.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at the same event, the Secretary for Innovation, Technology and Industry, Sun Dong, added that the funds will help make the service platform more market-driven, and help the centre hire more staff.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When you try to run a service system to the general public, you must have enough resources to support this platform, including human power as well as computing power, I think this is the main purpose of this donation," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I also hope the new version, or the mobile version of the large language model of HKGAI will be able to serve Hong Kong people as soon as possible, hopefully in the next several months."
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, Sun dismissed concerns that the latest reduction in government spending announced in last month’s budget will affect research and innovation in technology.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said authorities will support those developments in a more targeted way.

<div class="itemFullText">
 North Korea fired "multiple unidentified ballistic missiles" on Monday, South Korea's military said, the same day Seoul and Washington began a major annual joint military drill known as Freedom Shield.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Our military has detected at around 4.50am GMT multiple unidentified ballistic missiles fired from Hwanghae province," the Joint Chiefs of Staff said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our military will bolster surveillance and maintain a full readiness posture under close cooperation with the United States," the JCS added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The United States stations tens of thousands of US soldiers in South Korea, and the allies regularly stage joint drills, which they describe as defensive in nature.
  <br>
  <br>
  But such exercises infuriate Pyongyang, which regards them as rehearsals for invasion and routinely responds with weapons tests of its own.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier on Monday, the nuclear-armed North slammed the drills as a "provocative act", warning of the danger of sparking war with "an accidental single shot".
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is a dangerous provocative act of leading the acute situation on the Korean peninsula, which may spark off a physical conflict between the two sides by means of an accidental single shot," said Pyongyang's foreign ministry, according to the Korean Central News Agency.
  <br>
  <br>
  The joint US-South Korea "Freedom Shield 2025" exercise kicked off on Monday, and will involve "live, virtual, and field-based training", according to a US statement. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Businessman Irons Sze on Monday said Hong Kong's position as an international financial centre is attributed to China's reform and opening up and reinforced by the "One Country, Two Systems" principle.
 <br>
  <br>
  Sze, a Standing Committee member of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), said the SAR plays a vital role in the country's development.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As of the end of 2024, 1,478 mainland enterprises were listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, accounting for more than 80 percent of the total market value and 90 percent of daily transactions," he told reporters in Beijing.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the shipping front, Sze said Hong Kong's ports handled 13 million standard containers in 2024, with 40 percent of cargo coming from the mainland and 60 percent destined for the mainland.
  <br>
  <br>
  He concluded by saying that Hong Kong's future lies in its integration with the mainland, and the city would continue to contribute to the nation's development with its unique advantages.
