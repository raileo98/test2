<div class="itemFullText">
The United States added fewer jobs than expected in January; although hiring remained healthy, government data showed on Friday, marking resilience in the labour market heading into President Donald Trump's new term.
<br>
<br/>
Total employment rose by 143,000 jobs last month, according to the Labor Department, significantly lower than the revised 307,000 figure in December.
<br/>
<br/>
The January number was also below an analyst consensus estimate of 155,000, according to Briefing.com.
<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, the jobless rate edged down to 4.0 percent from 4.1 percent, beating analyst expectations.
<br/>
<br/>
Wage growth was better than analysts expected, accelerating to 0.5 percent, the report showed.
<br/>
<br/>
The data added to signs that the US economy remained in excellent shape heading into Trump's second term, which began on January 20, analysts noted.
<br/>
<br/>
Kevin Hassett, director of the White House National Economic Council, took aim at downward revisions to last year's figures in the latest update, telling media that the Trump administration has "a lot of work to do."
<br/>
<br/>
"Taken together, December and January payroll figures paint a strong picture of the economy," added Carl Weinberg and Mary Chen of High Frequency Economics.
<br/>
<br/>
They said they expect that with these figures, the US central bank would not be in a rush to cut interest rates.
<br/>
<br/>
Sectors like health care, retail trade, and social assistance saw job gains, the Labour Department said, while employment declined in industries like mining, alongside oil and gas.
<br/>
<br/>
Economists warned that businesses may reconsider further hiring due to heightened tariff risks and Trump's plans to slow immigration. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
US President Donald Trump paused his administration's repeal of duty-free treatment of low-cost packages from China on Friday, giving the Commerce Department time to make the order workable, after the rapid change created disruptions for customs inspectors, postal and delivery services and online retailers.
<br>
<br/>
The eventual cancellation of de minimis means the more than 1 billion small-value e-commerce packages arriving annually in the United States with goods coming directly from China must switch to an entry process that requires additional information and duties, adding time and cost.
<br/>
<br/>
The stop and restart of the United States Postal Service acceptance of those packages this week set off a swarm of disruptions that backed up Customs clearance for packages, even those that had paid duties, at New York City's John F Kennedy International Airport.
<br/>
<br/>
"Well that was a fun Tuesday through Friday, if you work in global e-commerce," said Derek Lossing, CEO of e-commerce and global supply chain firm Cirrus Global Advisors.
<br/>
<br/>
The initial change, implemented with just over 48 hours' notice, caused the USPS to temporarily stop accepting packages from China earlier this week.
<br/>
<br/>
Popular online retailers including Shein, Temu and Amazon.com's new Haul service send packages directly from Chinese factories to US shoppers and use de minimis to keep prices low.
<br/>
<br/>
The Trump administration's revision to the order was signed on Wednesday and published on Friday, a White House spokesperson said.
<br/>
<br/>
De minimis, a legal term referring to matters of little importance, refers to the US waiver of standard customs procedures and tariffs on items worth less than US$800 that are shipped to individuals from foreign countries.
<br/>
<br/>
Temu and Shein combined ship around 9,000 metric tons of cargo worldwide every day, or approximately 88 full Boeing 777 freighters, said Niall van de Wouw, chief air freight officer at freight pricing platform Xeneta.
<br/>
<br/>
"You cannot suddenly put up the shutters to this volume of air freight, so it is no surprise there has been a delay to the executive order on de minimis." (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
China's consumer price index (CPI), a main gauge of inflation, accelerated to its fastest in five months, government data showed on Sunday.
<br>
<br/>
According to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), the CPI was up 0.5 percent year on year last month, up from the 0.1 percent increase in December.
<br/>
<br/>
NBS statistician Dong Lijuan said the increase in January was due largely to the influence of the Spring Festival holiday.
<br/>
<br/>
The core CPI, which excludes food and energy prices, rose 0.6 percent from a year ago in January, up from the 0.4 percent increase in December.
<br/>
<br/>
On a monthly basis, the CPI expanded 0.7 percent in January.
<br/>
<br/>
Analysts said consumer spending over the holiday was mixed. While people flocked to movie theatres and spent more on shopping, catering and domestic travel, per capita spending during the holiday grew by only 1.2 percent from a year earlier, versus a 9.4 percent rise in 2024, analysts at ANZ estimated.
<br/>
<br/>
The NBS data also showed the country's producer price index (PPI), which measures costs for goods at the factory gate, went down 2.3 percent year on year in January, matching the drop the month before.
<br/>
<br/>
On a month-on-month basis, the PPI dropped 0.2 percent. (Xinhua/Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
US President Donald Trump said on Sunday he will introduce new 25-percent tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports into the United States, on top of existing metals duties, in another major escalation of his trade policy overhaul.
<br>
<br/>
Trump, speaking to reporters on Air Force One on his way to the NFL Super Bowl in New Orleans, said he will announce the new metals tariffs on Monday.
<br/>
<br/>
He also said he will announce reciprocal tariffs on Tuesday or Wednesday, to take effect almost immediately, applying them to all countries and matching the tariff rates levied by each country.
<br/>
<br/>
"And very simply, it's, if they charge us, we charge them," Trump said of the reciprocal tariff plan.
<br/>
<br/>
The largest sources of US steel imports are Canada, Brazil and Mexico, followed by South Korea and Vietnam, according to government and American Iron and Steel Institute data.
<br/>
<br/>
Trump also said that while the US government would allow Japan's Nippon Steel to invest in US Steel, it would not allow this to become a majority stake.
<br/>
<br/>
"Tariffs are going to make it very successful again, and I think it has good management," Trump said of US Steel.
<br/>
<br/>
Trump, during his first term, imposed tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminium, but later granted several trading partners duty-free exemptions, including Canada, Mexico and Brazil.
<br/>
<br/>
Former president Joe Biden later negotiated duty-free quota arrangements with Britain, the European Union and Japan. It was not immediately clear from Trump's announcement what would happen to those exemptions and quota arrangements.
<br/>
<br/>
Steel mill capacity usage jumped to levels above 80 percent in 2019 after Trump's initial tariffs, but has fallen since then as China's global dominance of the sector has pushed down steel prices.
<br/>
<br/>
Shares of steelmakers in Asia mostly fell on Monday, save for those with operations in the United States. The US dollar rose and US Treasury yields ticked higher. (Agencies)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
Traders in China's export manufacturing hub of Yiwu shrugged off US President Donald Trump's tariffs and moves against China on Sunday, with some saying they made preparations to soften the blow.
<br>
<br/>
Yiwu city in eastern Zhejiang province is the world's largest wholesale hub for small manufactured items, exporting products ranging from Christmas trees to costume jewellery globally, including to the United States.
<br/>
<br/>
"We predicted that he would assume power," Cheng Haodong, chairman of Beisi Group, a business which sells clothes to water bottles, told Reuters from their office in the city.
<br/>
<br/>
"After he assumed power, ok, how do we want to adjust? Actually it was prepared for in advance," he said.
<br/>
<br/>
They monitored information on overseas social media sites, he added, which led to them establishing a new factory for producing liquid laundry detergent in the US state of Tennessee in April.
<br/>
<br/>
Trump's campaign promised 60 percent tariffs on Chinese imports before he was elected. However, he revised that to 10 percent after taking office, which took effect on Tuesday. He also plans to cancel duty-free treatment of low-cost packages from China.
<br/>
<br/>
“This time actually the shock won't be too big for us,” said Cheng, who declined to provide detailed figures on sales.
<br/>
<br/>
Beisi exports to other businesses abroad, but also sells some of its products directly to US consumers through online platforms such as Temu and Shein, low-priced shopping sites that analysts expect will be hard hit by Trump's repeal of the 'de minimis' rule - a trade loophole that allowed low-value imports to enter the country duty-free.
<br/>
<br/>
Similar sentiments were shared by traders and buyers in the sprawling market in the city, where many were just returning to work after the end of the eight-day Lunar New Year break.
<br/>
<br/>
"(Even if) you increase (the tariff) to 50 percent it won't have any effect on us," said Zeng Hao, owner of Jinqi Wanju which sells toys such as brightly-coloured dinosaur figurines.
<br/>
<br/>
That was because the products are highly profitable and his firm could absorb some of the tariff burden, he said. Companies down the supply chain also have reason to increase their own prices, he added.
<br/>
<br/>
Abby Jin, who buys products in Yiwu on behalf of other customers in markets such as the US, Australia and the Middle East, said vendors in the city were not short of orders.
<br/>
<br/>
"We can respond by slighting reducing our profit margins or adjusting costs. In the end, the additional costs will be passed on to the end consumers in their country, meaning they will ultimately bear the consequences of their own economic policies,” she said.
<br/>
<br/>
“For the US, whether they can find a suitable country to replace us (as a trade partner) is a question they need to consider themselves." (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
US President Donald Trump substantially raised tariffs on steel and aluminium imports on Monday to a flat 25 percent "without exceptions or exemptions", although he agreed to consider an exemption on Australia.
<br>
<br/>
In a telephone call with Australia’s prime minister on Tuesday that took place before the tariff rise, Trump said the US trade surplus with Australia was one of the reasons he was considering an exemption.
<br/>
<br/>
“We actually have a surplus," Trump told reporters in the Oval Office about trade with Australia. “It’s one of the only countries which we do. And I told (Albanese) that that’s something that we’ll give great consideration to.”
<br/>
<br/>
Australia had an exemption from such tariffs during Trump’s first administration.
<br/>
<br/>
Trump signed proclamations raising the US tariff rate on aluminium to 25 percent from his previous 10 percent rate and eliminating country exceptions and quota deals as well as hundreds of thousands of product-specific tariff exclusions for both metals.
<br/>
<br/>
Trump also will impose a new North American standard requiring steel imports to be "melted and poured" and aluminium to be "smelted and cast" within the region to curb US imports of minimally-processed metals.
<br/>
<br/>
As he signed the order at the White House, Trump said he would follow Monday's action with announcements about reciprocal tariffs on all countries that impose duties on US goods over the next two days, and said he was also looking at tariffs on cars, semiconductor chips and pharmaceuticals.
<br/>
<br/>
Asked about threats of retaliation by other countries against his new tariffs, Trump said: "I don't mind."
<br/>
<br/>
Monday's tariffs almost immediately drew criticism from Canada, the largest source of steel imports.
<br/>
<br/>
Candace Laing, president and CEO of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, called Trump a destabilising force in the global economy.
<br/>
<br/>
Before the proclamations, shares in US steel and aluminium makers jumped, while shares in European and Asian steelmakers fell. The largest sources of US steel imports are Canada, Brazil and Mexico, followed by South Korea and Vietnam, according to government and industry data. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
Hong Kong should provide more tax concessions to individuals and businesses in the coming fiscal year, according to the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce (HKGCC).
<br>
<br/>
It made suggestions across nine categories about the Budget, which is set to be released later this month, including suggestions on expenditure control and attracting foreign investment.
<br/>
<br/>
Last December, officials said the deficit would be near HK$100 billion, more than double the original estimate of HK$48 billion.
<br/>
<br/>
The chamber’s chairwoman, Agnes Chan, said the public should not worry though, as the city's economy is gradually recovering from the pandemic.
<br/>
<br/>
“The budget deficit at that time was caused by two major factors -- we have the employment subsidy, the e-consumption voucher. Both took the government [to] over a hundred billion [dollars in deficit]. So that contributed to that year's substantial budget deficit. Then the second year, 2023-24, and the border reopened in February, but we are recovering and the government had adopted a loose monetary policy," she said.
<br/>
<br/>
"This year, the financial secretary is already saying it's going to be a smaller deficit because we are in a fiscal consolidation year. The measures include raising taxes on the high income earners, and having the double-tier property tax," she added.
<br/>
<br/>
The HKGCC proposed a one-time exemption on salaries tax, personal assessment tax and corporate tax, with an upper limit of HK$3,000.
<br/>
<br/>
For small and medium sized enterprises, or SMEs, it suggested the government provide a long-term fixed-rate mortgage.
<br/>
<br/>
Chan said both measures could reduce the burden towards taxpayers and stabilise the operation costs of SMEs.
<br/>
<br/>
In terms of managing expenditure, she said a review of the government's structure would be needed, such as merging organisations with overlapping duties to cut costs.
<br/>
<br/>
She said an example would be the Office for Attracting Strategic Enterprises (Oases) and InvestHK, in which both offices aim to attract foreign investment.
<br/>
<br/>
The chamber also said the government could consider setting up a digital services tax, in which foreign telecommunication companies providing entertainment or consumption services in the city would have to pay up to five percent in tax per year.
<br/>
<br/>
As for foreign investment, it said a three-year tax exemption period could be granted to companies that relocate their headquarters back to Hong Kong.

<div class="itemFullText">
An analyst on Tuesday said while United States president Donald Trump's steel and aluminium tariffs are expected to have a limited direct impact on China, countries such as the US' neighbours of Canada and Mexico will feel the pinch.
<br>
<br/>
The comment came after Trump on Monday announced a 25-percent import tax on all steel and aluminium entering the US "with no exception". The measures take effect on March 4.
<br/>
<br/>
Vivian Yang, senior analyst at Chinese steel data provider, MySteel, told RTHK that the move will have limited impact on China's steel sector, as Beijing has already shifted away from the US market.
<br/>
<br/>
She said the volume of China's steel and aluminium exports are much lower when compared to 2018 when Trump announced an earlier round of steel tariffs. Only some 891,000 tonnes of steel were exported to the US from China last year, accounting for 0.8 percent of the nation's total steel exports in 2024, according to MySteel.
<br/>
<br/>
Yang said nations including Canada, Mexico and Brazil will be hit the hardest as they are currently the US’ top suppliers of the two metals.
<br/>
<br/>
"Canada may face greater economic recursion as the tariffs could lead to increased production costs and potential job losses in the Canadian steel and aluminium sectors," she said.
<br/>
<br/>
However, the Shanghai-based analyst warned that the new tariffs will still have an impact on China's "indirect" steel exports, such as automobiles, ships, and machinery.
<br/>
<br/>
"The White House had already imposed a 10 percent additional on all Chinese goods imports. And if Trump's targeted tariffs of up to 60 percent on all Chinese imports he claimed earlier is to be realised, the impact on Chinese manufactured goods would be huge, because almost all Chinese exported products would lose their price advantage and have no export profit," she said.
<br/>
<br/>
"Although China is exporting very little steel to the US directly nowadays, some Chinese steel products do make their way into the US by other channels, for example, some are purchased by foreign countries and re-shipped to the US, [so] these transshipment practices will be impacted," she added.
<br/>
<br/>
Mainland steel-related shares declined following the latest tariff announcements, with iron and steel manufacturing conglomerates Hesteel Group and Angang Steel's stocks falling over two percent.

Wall Street stocks finished mixed on Tuesday following a choppy session as markets weighed the latest White House tariff actions and Federal Reserve commentary.
<br>
<br/>
US trading partners expressed dismay and vowed retaliation to President Donald Trump's latest move – a plan to enact 25 percent tariffs on imported aluminium and steel from March 12.
<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, Fed Chair Jerome Powell reiterated in congressional testimony that the US central bank was in no hurry to adjust monetary policy, leaving a cloudy outlook for additional interest rate cuts.
<br/>
<br/>
All three of the major US indices had opened lower, but the Dow Jones finished up 0.3 percent at 44,593.
<br/>
<br/>
The S&amp;P 500 was essentially flat at 6,068, while the Nasdaq declined 0.4 percent to 19,643.
<br/>
<br/>
LBBW's Karl Haeling said the market's ability to avoid a major selloff amid the tariff uncertainty reflected "underlying optimism" about economic conditions.
<br/>
<br/>
Among individual companies, Coca-Cola jumped 4.7 percent after reporting an 11 percent increase in profits to US$2.2 billion in results that topped estimates.
<br/>
<br/>
Apple gained 2.2 percent following a report that it partnered with Alibaba on artificial intelligence in China. Alibaba rose 1.3 percent.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
Wall Street stocks mostly fell on Wednesday following US inflation data that further clouded the prospects for additional Federal Reserve interest rate cuts.
<br>
<br/>
The consumer price index rose to 3.0 percent in January from a year ago, above the 2.8 percent projected by economists, raising questions about whether the Fed's progress on bringing down prices was reversing.
<br/>
<br/>
Fed Chair Jerome Powell told a congressional panel that the figures reinforced the central bank's recent cautious approach to interest rate cuts.
<br/>
<br/>
The Dow Jones finished down 0.5 percent at 44,368, while the S&amp;P 500 lost 0.3 percent at 6,051.
<br/>
<br/>
But the Nasdaq, which fell in the morning, finished with a modest gain at 19,649.
<br/>
<br/>
"Equities were a lot more resilient than I would have expected given the news we had this morning," said Jack Ablin of Cresset Capital.
<br/>
<br/>
Besides inflation, markets have also been on edge over President Trump's tariff plans.
<br/>
<br/>
Among individual companies, CVS Health shot up 15 percent following better-than-expected earnings. The pharmacy chain company projected higher profits in 2025 compared with last year.
<br/>
<br/>
Gilead Sciences jumped 7.5 percent after reporting results that beat expectations as it signaled it could launch its latest HIV prevention drug in the summer of 2025.
<br/>
<br/>
But Chevron fell 1.6 percent after announcing it will cut 15 to 20 percent of its workforce as part of a reorganisation to save money and to position the oil giant for the long term. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
Japanese auto giants Honda and Nissan on Thursday confirmed they had scrapped merger talks announced in December, bringing an end to a tie-up that would have created the world's third-largest automaker.
<br>
<br/>
The firms said in a joint statement that they "agreed to terminate the MOU (memorandum of understanding) signed on December 23 last year for consideration of a business integration between the two companies".
<br/>
<br/>
The firms' intention to join forces had been seen as a bid to catch up with US titan Tesla and Chinese firms in the electric vehicle market.
<br/>
<br/>
Honda's CEO insisted in December that it was not a bailout for Nissan, which last year announced thousands of job cuts after reporting a 93 percent plunge in first-half net profit.
<br/>
<br/>
Local media reports have said the discussions unravelled after Honda proposed to make its struggling rival a subsidiary instead of the plan, announced in December, to integrate under a new holding company.
<br/>
<br/>
In the joint statement, the automakers confirmed Honda "proposed changing the structure from establishing a joint holding company... to a structure where Honda would be the parent company and Nissan the subsidiary through a share exchange".
<br/>
<br/>
"As a result of these discussions, both companies concluded that, to prioritise speed of decision-making and execution of management measures in an increasingly volatile market environment heading into the era of electrification, it would be most appropriate to cease discussions and terminate the MOU," the statement said.
<br/>
<br/>
They will, however, continue to "collaborate within the framework of a strategic partnership aimed at the era of intelligence and electrified vehicles, striving to create new value and maximise the corporate value of both companies," it added. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
A group representing China's steel industry has warned that a new 25 percent tariff on imports of the product into the United States would have an "adverse impact" on the sector, state media reported on Thursday.
<br>
<br/>
"The US move is essentially an act of trade protectionism," the China Iron and Steel Association (CISA) said in a statement published by state broadcaster CCTV.
<br/>
<br/>
"In the short term, the impact on (China's) steel exports is limited," the CISA said in the report.
<br/>
<br/>
"But in the long term, the US move could lead other countries to follow suit, thereby reducing (China's) steel export competitiveness," it added.
<br/>
<br/>
Despite being the world's top producer of steel, China last year accounted for only a small proportion of US steel imports.
<br/>
<br/>
But with demand slumping in the domestic construction sector, Chinese steel exports have surged, spurring concerns in Washington about overcapacity in foreign markets with harmful effects on US producers.
<br/>
<br/>
US President Donald Trump signed executive orders on Monday slapping new 25 percent tariffs on steel and aluminium, due to come into effect on March 12.
<br/>
<br/>
"From a medium- and long-term perspective, the (US) increase in tariffs will have an adverse impact on industrial and supply chains in the global steel industry, including the Chinese steel industry," CISA deputy secretary-general Zhang Longqiang said, according to CCTV. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
US markets ended higher on Thursday, powered by gains in tech related stocks, with the S&amp;P 500 leading the charge.
<br>
<br/>
Nvidia, Apple and Tesla all rose after President Trump unveiled a roadmap for charging reciprocal tariffs on US trading partners.
<br/>
<br/>
A White House official said the tariffs would match the higher duties charged by other countries and could be imposed within weeks as Trump's trade and economic team studies bilateral tariff and trade relationships.
<br/>
<br/>
Stocks also gained after data showed US producer prices increased in January, while key elements in the core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index, a measure closely tracked by the US Federal Reserve, were benign or lower.
<br/>
<br/>
The S&amp;P 500 climbed 1.04 percent to end at 6,115.07. It was the S&amp;P 500's largest one-day gain since January 15.
<br/>
<br/>
The Nasdaq gained 1.50 percent to 19,945.64, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.77 percent to 44,711.43.
<br/>
<br/>
Tesla jumped 5.9 percent, Nvidia climbed 3.2 percent and Apple rose 2 percent, lifting the S&amp;P 500 to just short of its record high close on January 23.
<br/>
<br/>
"Equity investors are taking cues from the bond market," said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Cresset Capital. "Investors were also preparing for kind of an alarmingly high inflation number, based on tariffs." (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
Search engine giant Baidu said on Friday it would make its next-generation artificial intelligence model Ernie open-source from June 30, a major shift in strategy as competition heats up.
<br>
<br/>
Baidu CEO Robin Li had long advocated for closed-source models as the only viable path for AI development, but the advent of DeepSeek has upended the sector. The startup offers open-source AI services that it claims are comparable in performance to US pioneer OpenAI's advanced systems but come with a lower operational cost.
<br/>
<br/>
Keen to increase market share, Baidu also announced on Thursday that it would make its AI chatbot Ernie Bot free starting April 1, about a year and a half after introducing premium versions.
<br/>
<br/>
Baidu was among the first big Chinese companies to invest heavily in AI following the 2022 debut of OpenAI's ChatGPT. However, its Ernie large language model has struggled to gain widespread adoption. Baidu has said its current version, Ernie 4.0, matches OpenAI's GPT-4 capabilities.
<br/>
<br/>
ByteDance's Doubao chatbot has the most active monthly users on the mainland with 78.6 million, DeepSeek has 33.7 million while Ernie Bot has 13 million, according to January data from AI product tracker Aicpb.com.
<br/>
<br/>
"We will gradually launch the Ernie 4.5 series in the coming months and officially open-source it from June 30," Baidu said in a WeChat post.
<br/>
<br/>
Li appeared to have changed tack on open-source development, telling attendees at an event in Dubai this week that it could accelerate AI adoption.
<br/>
<br/>
"If you open things up, a lot of people will be curious enough to try it. This will help spread the technology much faster," he said.
<br/>
<br/>
Baidu also plans to launch a new next-generation model, Ernie 5, in the second half of 2025, a person familiar with the matter has said. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
Gains in tech stocks boosted the Nasdaq Composite on Friday, but other major indices were either down or barely changed as investors digested President Trump's latest tariff announcement, economic data and earnings.
<br>
<br/>
The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended down 0.4 percent at 44,546.08, the S&amp;P 500 was flat, finishing at 6,114.63 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.4 percent to 20,026.77.
<br/>
<br/>
The latest official figures showed that US retail sales fell by a more-than-expected 0.9 percent in January from December, but analysts noted that this partly reflected an upward revision to the December figure.
<br/>
<br/>
The drop was also partly due to bad weather that depressed demand, and could also show "a little consumer fatigue," said Briefing.com analyst Patrick O'Hare.
<br/>
<br/>
Investors largely shrugged off data earlier this week showing an increase in consumer price inflation and higher-than-expected wholesale price inflation.
<br/>
<br/>
"The stock market continues to maintain this resilient disposition," said O'Hare, who pointed to strong corporate earnings as an offset to concerns about tariffs and an uptick in inflation.
<br/>
<br/>
But a rebound in inflation, or persistent inflation at a high level, would make it difficult for the Federal Reserve to cut rates further.
<br/>
<br/>
Markets also continued to follow the latest trade developments.
<br/>
<br/>
The European Union on Friday vowed to respond "firmly and immediately" to trade barriers after Trump unveiled tariffs that could hit US allies and competitors.
<br/>
<br/>
Trump on Thursday said he had decided to impose reciprocal duties, in a dramatic escalation of an international trade war he has unleashed since taking office in January, but the measures will not go into effect until a study is completed.
<br/>
<br/>
Despite rising trade tensions, investor sentiment has largely held up in the hope that many of the tariffs can be rowed back with negotiations, while Trump's announcement of plans to hold Ukraine peace talks with Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin has added some optimism.
<br/>
<br/>
"Tariff ambiguity still reigns but markets are currently drawing some comfort from the news" of the delay, said National Australia Bank's head of currencies research and markets, Ray Attrill. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
OpenAI's board chairman on Friday said it has unanimously rejected an Elon Musk-led offer to buy the hot artificial intelligence company for US$97.4 billion.
<br>
<br/>
"OpenAI is not for sale, and the board has unanimously rejected Mr. Musk's latest attempt to disrupt his competition," chairman of the board Bret Taylor said in a statement posted by the company on Musk-owned X, formerly Twitter.
<br/>
<br/>
"Any potential reorganization of OpenAI will strengthen our nonprofit and its mission to ensure AGI (artificial general intelligence) benefits all of humanity," the statement continued.
<br/>
<br/>
Musk filed court documents on Wednesday saying that he would withdraw the offer to buy OpenAI if its board returns the artificial intelligence pioneer to a non-profit "charity" model.
<br/>
<br/>
OpenAI currently operates a hybrid structure, as a non-profit with a money-making subsidiary.
<br/>
<br/>
The change to a for-profit model, one that Altman considers crucial for the company's development, had exacerbated ongoing tensions with Musk.
<br/>
<br/>
Musk and Altman were among the 11-person team that founded OpenAI in 2015, with the former providing initial funding of US$45 million.
<br/>
<br/>
Three years later, Musk departed the company, with OpenAI citing "a potential future conflict for Elon... as Tesla continues to become more focused on AI."
<br/>
<br/>
Musk established his own artificial intelligence company called xAI early in 2023 after OpenAI ignited global fervor over the technology.
<br/>
<br/>
The massive costs of designing, training, and deploying AI models have compelled OpenAI to seek a new corporate structure that would give investors equity and provide more stable governance.
<br/>
<br/>
The transition to a traditional for-profit company requires approval from California and Delaware authorities, who will scrutinize how the non-profit arm of OpenAI is valued when it becomes a shareholder in the new company.
<br/>
<br/>
Current investors prefer a lower valuation to maximize their share of the new company.
<br/>
<br/>
Critics say Musk's bid, valuing the OpenAI non-profit at US$97.4 billion - approximately US$30 billion above the level in current negotiations, according to The Information - appears designed to disrupt the company's fundraising efforts.
<br/>
<br/>
OpenAI's Chief Global Affairs Officer Chris Lehane has said Musk's offer came from a competitor "who has struggled to keep up with the technology and compete with us in the marketplace". (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
President Xi Jinping on Monday called for efforts to promote the healthy and high-quality development of China's private sector.
<br>
<br/>
He made the remarks when attending a symposium on private enterprises.
<br/>
<br/>
President Xi said the private sector enjoys broad prospects and great potential on the new journey in the new era, and it is a prime time for private enterprises and entrepreneurs to give full play to their capabilities.
<br/>
<br/>
He also called for efforts to reach consensus and firming up confidence, to promote the healthy and high-quality development of the private sector.
<br/>
<br/>
"We hope that all private enterprises and private entrepreneurs will have the ambition to serve the country, strive for development, operate in accordance with the law and promote common prosperity, so as to make new and greater contributions to promoting Chinese-style modernisation," Xi said.
<br/>
<br/>
He added that policies regarding the private sector would not change.
<br/>
<br/>
The president delivered the speech after listening to representatives of private companies at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing.
<br/>
<br/>
Premier Li Qiang and Vice Premier Ding Xuexiang were among those attending the symposium, which was presided over by Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference chairman Wang Huning.
<br/>
<br/>
Reuters reported on Friday, citing sources, that Xi planned to chair a symposium to boost private sector sentiment, a meeting which would be attended by the country's business leaders, including Alibaba co-founder Jack Ma.
<br/>
<br/>
The symposium would be aimed at boosting private-sector sentiment, and Xi was expected to encourage company chiefs to expand their businesses domestically and internationally.
<br/>
<br/>
Xi first chaired a high-profile symposium for the private sector in 2018. At the time, he pledged tax cuts and a level playing field while reaffirming that private firms would have access to financial backing.
<br/>
<br/>
The symposium also comes as DeepSeek's AI platform has triggered investor speculation about its potential to buoy China's broader tech sector, leading to calls for an upward repricing of Chinese assets. (Xinhua &amp; agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
Chinese AI app DeepSeek will not be available to download in South Korea pending a review of its handling of user data, authorities in Seoul said Monday.
<br>
<br/>
DeepSeek's R1 chatbot stunned investors and industry insiders with its ability to match the functions of its Western competitors at a fraction of the cost.
<br/>
<br/>
But a number of countries have questioned DeepSeek's storage of user data.
<br/>
<br/>
Seoul's Personal Information Protection Commission said DeepSeek would no longer be available for download until a review of its personal data collection practices was carried out.
<br/>
<br/>
DeepSeek has "acknowledged that considerations for domestic privacy laws were somewhat lacking", the data protection agency said.
<br/>
<br/>
It assessed that bringing the app into line with local privacy laws "would inevitably take a significant amount of time", the agency added.
<br/>
<br/>
"To prevent further concerns from spreading, the commission recommended that DeepSeek temporarily suspend its service while making the necessary improvements," it said.
<br/>
<br/>
DeepSeek has "accepted" that proposal, it added.
<br/>
<br/>
Industry experts have said the Hangzhou-based firm has embraced a more accessible, opensource approach towards AI development, fostering collaboration and experimentation that could lead to faster breakthroughs.
<br/>
<br/>
They also said the firm has unveiled large language models challenging the dominate tools developing by its US rivals, but at a lower cost. (AFP &amp; agencies)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
Argentine President Javier Milei on Monday denied promoting a cryptocurrency that crashed last week, losing investors billions of dollars and prompting a flood of complaints, as prosecutors reportedly prepare an investigation into the scandal.
<br>
<br/>
"I did not promote it, I spread it," Milei told broadcaster TN, adding that it "is a problem between private parties because the State does not play a role here."
<br/>
<br/>
"I acted in good faith," he said.
<br/>
<br/>
Argentina's federal prosecutor's office will examine whether Milei engaged in fraud or criminal association or was in breach of his duties when he praised the $LIBRA cryptocurrency on social media Friday evening, according to news reports.
<br/>
<br/>
The currency's value soared then crashed, and Milei deleted his blessing hours later, saying he had made a mistake.
<br/>
<br/>
Argentine economists, crypto specialists and opposition political figures criticised the self-declared "anarcho-capitalist" president, an economist by training, and said the digital asset could be a fraud or a Ponzi scheme.
<br/>
<br/>
Industry observers said the operation was likely a "rug pull" -- a scam where developers unveil a crypto token, attract investors, then quickly cash out.
<br/>
<br/>
Rights NGO Observatory for the Right to the City, one of several complainants, alleges Milei formed part of a "criminal organisation that organised a fraud with the $LIBRA cryptocurrency that simultaneously affected more than 40,000 people with losses of more than US$4 billion."
<br/>
<br/>
The Kobeissi Letter, a publication that provides analysis on global capital markets, said on X Friday that within minutes of its launch, "multiple large holders began liquidating MILLIONS of USD worth of $LIBRA."
<br/>
<br/>
"This included gains of +US$4 million or more as $LIBRA rose to US$4.6 billion in market (capitalisation)," it reported.
<br/>
<br/>
On Monday, Milei said he had "nothing to hide" from an investigation.
<br/>
<br/>
He said that those who carried out the transactions, including "a lot of bots," were people who "knew very well what the risk was."
<br/>
<br/>
Nevertheless, former president and opposition figure Cristina Kirchner called Milei a "crypto-scammer" and opposition parliamentarians announced they would institute impeachment proceedings against him.
<br/>
<br/>
Any such proceedings would be highly unlikely to succeed, however, as they would require a two-thirds majority in the lower house.
<br/>
<br/>
Other parties are seeking the creation of a special parliamentary commission to question Milei. (AFP)

Australia's central bank cut interest rates on Tuesday for the first time since the depths of the 2020 pandemic, saying progress had been made on inflation though it was still cautious about the outlook.
<br>
<br/>
Wrapping up its February policy meeting, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) cut its cash rate by 25 basis points to 4.10 percent, ending more than a year of steady policy.
<br/>
<br/>
It offered little guidance on whether it would ease again at the next board meeting in April.
<br/>
<br/>
Markets had wagered heavily on a quarter-point cut after core inflation surprised on the downside in the fourth quarter at 3.2 percent and looked certain to re-enter the RBA's 2-3 percent target band this quarter. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
Hong Kong's unemployment rate remained at 3.1 percent in the November-January period, unchanged from the previous three-month figure.
<br>
<br/>
The Census and Statistics Department said 3,716,600 were in work in the latest period, a fall of 2,300 from October-December.
<br/>
<br/>
The labour force, meanwhile, decreased by around 5,700 to 3,826,700.
<br/>
<br/>
Around 110,100 people were looking for a job, down about 3,500 from the previous three-month period.
<br/>
<br/>
The underemployment rate also remained unchanged in the three months from November, at 1.1 percent.
<br/>
<br/>
Secretary for Labour and Welfare Chris Sun said Hong Kong's jobless rate remains low.
<br/>
<br/>
He added in a statement that "the labour market should remain largely stable in the near term, though uncertainties in the global economy would continue to pose challenges to some businesses."

<div class="itemFullText">
The sweeping tariffs threatened or imposed by US President Donald Trump risk triggering inflation, market distortions, and even a global recession, China said on Tuesday at the World Trade Organization.
<br>
<br/>
After returning to office on January 20, Trump slapped China, the world's second-biggest economy, with an additional 10 percent levy on products entering the United States.
<br/>
<br/>
And Trump signed executive orders last week imposing new 25 percent tariffs on steel and aluminium, due to come into effect on March 12.
<br/>
<br/>
"The world faces a series of tariff shocks," said Li Chenggang, China's ambassador to the WTO, at the first meeting of the year of the global trade body's decision-making General Council.
<br/>
<br/>
"The US has imposed or threatened tariffs on its trading partners, including China, unilaterally and arbitrarily, blatantly violating WTO rules. China firmly opposes such measures.
<br/>
<br/>
"These tariff shocks heighten economic uncertainty, disrupt global trade, and risk domestic inflation, market distortion, or even global recession."
<br/>
<br/>
Li went on to say that US unilateralism threatened to upend the rules-based multilateral trading system.
<br/>
<br/>
"The stakes are high for all members, big or small," said Li.
<br/>
<br/>
Imposing punitive tariffs on countries with high trade surpluses with the United States has been at the heart of Trump's economic policy.
<br/>
<br/>
He paused 25 percent levies against Canada and Mexico for a month after both countries vowed to step up measures to counter flows of the drug fentanyl and the crossing of undocumented migrants into the United States.
<br/>
<br/>
But Trump went ahead with tariffs on China, which imposed retaliatory tariffs targeting US coal and liquified natural gas.
<br/>
<br/>
A Geneva-based trade official said Washington in return voiced concerns that China was operating a non-market economic system and habitually breached WTO rules.
<br/>
<br/>
"The US highlighted the issues stemming from China's lack of transparency and its disregard for WTO oversight," the official said.
<br/>
<br/>
"The US also pointed out that the WTO's current inability to address China's market-distorting policies, such as unfair subsidies, significantly diminishes the organisation's effectiveness." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
HSBC posted an annual profit on Wednesday that beat estimates, helped by increased revenue in its wealth and markets businesses.
<br>
<br/>
It reported profit before tax for 2024 of US$32.3 billion, a rise of around six percent, as income withstood the impact of falling interest rates.
<br/>
<br/>
That compared with US$30.3 billion a year earlier and the US$31.7 billion average of analyst estimates compiled by the bank.
<br/>
<br/>
The Asia-focused lender also announced a new US$2 billion share buyback which it plans to complete before next earnings.
<br/>
<br/>
The figures come against the backdrop of CEO Georges Elhedery embarking on costly restructuring just as the business outlook is muddied by divergence in central bank interest rate policies, with the euro zone having room to cut rates, the US holding steady and Japan expected to raise.
<br/>
<br/>
Elhedery, who took the helm in September last year, has been taking steps to boost returns and tighten the London-headquartered bank's focus on Asia, where it earns the bulk of its profit.
<br/>
<br/>
The bank said it aimed to generate about US$300 million of cost reductions in 2025, with a commitment to an annualised reduction of US$1.5 billion in cost base expected by the end of 2026.
<br/>
<br/>
"We have renewed vigour in finding the efficiencies that will optimise our resource allocation, be that geographical, business line or balance sheet," Elhedery said in the bank's earnings statement.
<br/>
<br/>
"This will enhance the way we actively and dynamically manage costs and capital, and target investments." (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
Banking giant HSBC on Wednesday revealed that Hong Kong employees whose roles are related to its mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A) as well as equity capital market (ECM) businesses could be affected, as it kicks off a fresh round of job cuts worldwide as part of measures to slash costs by US$1.5 billion by the end of 2026.
<br>
<br/>
Its new chief executive, George Elhedery, said the group is looking at cutting its global personnel expenses by eight percent over 2025 and 2026, as it withdraws from mergers and acquisitions banking activity in the UK, Europe, and the US.
<br/>
<br/>
Speaking at an online press conference, Elhedery refused to say how many jobs will go.
<br/>
<br/>
"Some of them definitely relate to M&amp;A and the ECM in UK, Europe, and the US. All those supporting this activity will be possibly impacted, but also in these areas of the bank, in particular investment banking, there will be continuous adjustment of the workforce, both to clients, to activities, and to proposition," he said.
<br/>
<br/>
"I would say that partly would be a normal course of business, and partly is related to the investment banking decisions," he added.
<br/>
<br/>
Separately, Pam Kaur, the HSBC's chief financial officer, said that risks related to its Hong Kong property business book has been very low and that the group is expecting a positive outlook for the SAR's real estate industry going forward, following reduced interest rates.
<br/>
<br/>
"The sector has been challenged because of rental prices and interest rates and vacancy levels. However, this year we have seen some positive momentum, both in terms of the volume and the price of property transactions in Hong Kong is increasing," she noted.
<br/>
<br/>
HSBC added that businesses on the mainland remain resilient.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
The S&amp;P 500 added to its record as US stock indexes drifted through a quiet Wednesday on Wall Street.
<br>
<br/>
The S&amp;P 500 rose 0.2 percent after setting an all-time high the day before. The Dow Jones Industrial Average picked up 71 points, or 0.2 percent, while the Nasdaq composite inched up by 0.1 percent.
<br/>
<br/>
Microsoft was the strongest force pushing the S&amp;P 500 upward. It rose 1.3 percent after saying it had developed what it calls the world’s first “quantum processing unit,” which could lead to the development of much more powerful computers. While the gain was relatively modest, Microsoft's gargantuan size gives its stock's movements huge sway on the S&amp;P 500 and other indexes.
<br/>
<br/>
A 9.7 percent rally for Analog Devices also helped push the market higher. The semiconductor company reported stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected, despite what CEO Vincent Roche called a “challenging macro and geopolitical backdrop.”
<br/>
<br/>
Elon Musk’s Tesla rose 1.8 percent. It climbed after another electric-vehicle company, Nikola, plunged 39.1 percent following its filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The electric truck maker said it would try to sell off its assets and wind down its business.
<br/>
<br/>
The yield on the 10-year Treasury eased a bit on Wednesday and edged down to 4.53 percent from 4.55 percent late on Tuesday. It was below 3.70 percent as recently as September and approaching 4.80 percent within the past few weeks.
<br/>
<br/>
Both the bond and the stock markets have increasingly been taking US President Donald Trump’s tariffs in stride, after earlier showing much more trepidation. The hope on Wall Street is that Trump is using such threats merely as a tool to drive negotiations, and the ultimate effects won’t be as bad as they initially appeared.
<br/>
<br/>
Minutes released for the Fed’s last policy meeting in January showed officials discussed how Trump’s proposed tariffs and mass deportations of migrants, as well as strong consumer spending, could push inflation higher this year
<br/>
<br/>
In stock markets abroad, London’s FTSE 100 fell 0.6 percent after a report showed UK inflation accelerated to a 10-month high. That could put pressure on the Bank of England, which had been cutting interest rates to invigorate its tepid economy. (AP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
The World Trade Organization (WTO) said on Wednesday that discussions on trade tensions were "constructive", after China accused the US of imposing "tariff shocks" that could upend the global trading system.
<br>
<br/>
China condemned tariffs launched or threatened by US President Donald Trump at a World Trade Organization meeting on Tuesday. Washington dismissed China's comments as hypocritical.
<br/>
<br/>
Trump has announced sweeping 10 percent tariffs on all Chinese imports, prompting Beijing to respond with retaliatory tariffs and to file a WTO dispute against Washington in what could be an early test of Trump's stance towards the institution.
<br/>
<br/>
The majority of the six countries that participated in the talks on trade turbulence, put on the agenda by China, raised concern about mounting tensions, but also called for restraint, said WTO spokesperson Ismaila Dieng in a press conference in Geneva on Wednesday.
<br/>
<br/>
The United States, Nicaragua, Namibia, Malaysia, Trinidad and Tobago and Russia took part in the discussions, which were part of broader talks on trade.
<br/>
<br/>
The large majority "stressed the importance of upholding WTO principles and values and called for action to preserve the stability and effectiveness of the global trading system", Dieng added.
<br/>
<br/>
It is the first time that mounting trade frictions have been formally addressed on the agenda of the watchdog's top decision-making body, the General Council.
<br/>
<br/>
Separately, Commerce Minister Wang Wentao expressed strong dissatisfaction with US tariffs on Chinese goods in a letter addressed to the newly confirmed US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick.
<br/>
<br/>
"The move by the US to unilaterally impose tariffs undermined normal economic and trade cooperation between China and the US", Wang said in the letter.
<br/>
<br/>
Wang also said Beijing was willing to work with Washington to "strengthen dialogue, manage differences, promote cooperation" and hoped to create a "fair and predictable policy environment" for the two countries' business communities to cooperate. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
The Bank of East Asia (BEA) on Thursday said it has been closely monitoring risks related to its exposure to the Hong Kong property sector as there was a slight uptick in so-called "bad loans" last year.
<br>
<br/>
At a press conference reviewing the bank's annual financial results, co-chief executive Adrian Li said about 6 percent of BEA's HK$61.4 billion Hong Kong property loans were non-performing in 2024, up from about 3 percent the year before.
<br/>
<br/>
Much of these loans were in the commercial real estate sector, he said, adding that credit ratings for some of the bank's local clients were downgraded which in turn prompted the bank to significantly increase provision for its local property loans to over HK$1.2 billion, up from HK$380 million.
<br/>
<br/>
The proportion of local property loans to the group's total loans, meanwhile, dropped to 11.5 percent at the end of last year, from 13.7 percent at the end of 2023, as the bank gradually reduced its exposure to Hong Kong property due to "relatively high risks" on the commercial side.
<br/>
<br/>
However, Li struck a more optimistic tone when it comes to the mainland, saying the risk of bad loans there is stable.
<br/>
<br/>
"The unwinding of the interest rate cycle should ease pressure on the Chinese real estate sector in the medium term, provided that rates continue their downward trajectory. With the impact of stimulus packages beginning to manifest, confidence is gradually returning improving investors, sentiment and activities," he said.
<br/>
<br/>
Li's remarks came as the bank delivered a 12 percent increase in its overall net profits in the past financial year, rising to HK$4.6 billion from the HK$4.2 billion in 2023 on the back of US interest rate reductions as well as stimulus measures from Beijing and the SAR government.
<br/>
<br/>
The bank declared a second interim dividend of HK$0.38 per share, more than double that of the year before, bringing the total annual dividend to HK$0.69 per share, up over 27 percent year-on-year.
<br/>
<br/>
Separately, Brian Li, the bank's co-chief executive, said the lender has seen a significant increase in demand from mainland customers for wealth management services in the SAR, with the number of mainland clients jumping 60 percent year-on-year.
<br/>
<br/>
That, he said, helped boost revenue from relevant investment products by 28 percent year-on-year.

Wall Street stocks dropped on Thursday following disappointing results from Walmart as banking shares fell in a move analysts attributed to profit taking.
<br>
<br/>
Walmart reported quarterly results that met expectations, but shares slid 6.5 percent after its forecast missed expectations.
<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, shares of Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase fell three percent or more, dragging on major indices.
<br/>
<br/>
The S&amp;P 500, which finished at a record the last two days, dropped 0.4 percent to 6,117.
<br/>
<br/>
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.0 percent to 44,176, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index declined 0.5 percent to 19,962.
<br/>
<br/>
The drop in banking shares hit stocks that were "very overbought," said Adam Sarhan from 50 Park Investments, who noted that major US indices finished above their session lows in spite of significant geopolitical uncertainty.
<br/>
<br/>
"Whenever there's been trouble in the market, buyers have showed up," said Sarhan, who views the dynamic as an indication of underlying bullishness.

Among individual companies, Boeing slumped 2.8 percent after President Donald Trump said he was looking at "alternatives" to the company's Air Force One operation because of delivery delays.
<br/>
<br/>
But Hasbro surged 13 percent after reporting better than expected profits. The toymaker expects 2025 revenues to be "up slightly," it said. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
Premier Li Qiang has emphasised boosting consumption and improving people's livelihoods through stronger and more targeted measures, in a bid to strengthen the fundamental role of consumption in driving economic development.
<br>
<br/>
In a session held by the State Council, CCTV cited Li saying that, "Boosting consumption is not only an important way to expand domestic demand and stabilise growth, but also a major measure to transform the development model in the mid-to-long term."
<br/>
<br/>
More efforts should be made to facilitate service consumption, improve the supply of education, medical care, culture, sports, tourism, elderly care and household services, and accelerate the application of artificial intelligence to unlock consumption potential of AI terminal products, he said.
<br/>
<br/>
Li also emphasised the need to relax market access in relevant industries, and boost high-quality product supply to meet emerging consumer demands.
<br/>
<br/>
Top policymakers have pledged to try to bolster household incomes and consumption this year. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
Shares in Alibaba soared more than 14 percent on Friday, extending a blistering rally in Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index, after forecast-topping earnings added to a growing sense of optimism over Chinese tech firms.
<br>
<br/>
The e-commerce titan announced on Thursday that sales rose eight percent to 280 billion yuan in the three months through December, exceeding the 277 billion yuan estimated by a Bloomberg pool of analysts.
<br/>
<br/>
The news sent its share prices rocketing 14.6 percent in Hong Kong, building on a rally that has seen it bounce nearly 70 percent higher since the turn of the year, and is now at a three-year high.
<br/>
<br/>
The Hang Seng Index finished up 3.99 percent, or 900.94 points, to 23,477.92.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
Wall Street stocks tumbled on Friday, concluding the week on a sour note as a big drop in Treasury yields underscored worries about an economic slowdown.
<br>
<br/>
Analysts said recent data points, including lackluster US retail sales data and a tepid forecast from Walmart, raised questions about the outlook of the US economy as President Donald Trump presses on with tariffs and government job cuts that could boost unemployment.
<br/>
<br/>
"You are starting to see some disappointment in the economic data," said Tom Cahill of Ventura Wealth Management, who tied Friday's big drop in the 10-year US Treasury note yield to economic worries.
<br/>
<br/>
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished at 43,428, down 1.7 percent to around 750 points.
<br/>
<br/>
The broad-based S&amp;P 500 also dropped 1.7 percent to 6,013, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index fell 2.2 percent to 19,524.
<br/>
<br/>
On Friday, an S&amp;P Global reading on US services industry activity fell to a 25-month low, while a University of Michigan survey of consumer sentiment tumbled nearly 10 percent from January.
<br/>
<br/>
LBBW's Karl Haeling said both are considered "secondary" economic reports, but they corroborate other major data points on employment and retail sales that have also pointed to weakness.
<br/>
<br/>
"Investors ever since the election have been very bullish," he said, pointing to "all the uncertainty coming from Trump."
<br/>
<br/>
Of the 11 sectors in the S&amp;P 500, only consumer staples finished in positive territory, while technology, industrials, energy and consumer discretionary lost about two percent or more.
<br/>
<br/>
A particularly big loser was UnitedHealth Group, which dropped 7.3 percent after the Wall Street Journal reported that the Justice Department is investigating allegations the company directed doctors to make patient diagnoses that would trigger higher government payments under the US Medicare Advantage program.

Financial Secretary Paul Chan has said Wednesday's budget will detail the government's fiscal consolidation strategies, while revealing the colour of choice for his upcoming blueprint.
<br>
<br/>
On his official blog, the finance chief said on Sunday the administration would strictly control its spending, increase revenue appropriately, and make use of public resources and market forces to further boost development.
<br/>
<br/>
He noted the aqua-coloured cover of the budget reflected the unlimited opportunities presented in future developments.
<br/>
<br/>
"There is infinite vitality in a beautiful lake. Despite the occasional storms, we have firm confidence and positive expectations for the future given the solid backing of the country and the joint efforts of all sectors in Hong Kong," Chan wrote.
<br/>
<br/>
The finance minister also expressed gratitude to those who gave their suggestions during the budget consultation.
<br/>
<br/>
Chan will announce his latest budget on February 26, amid an estimated deficit of HK$100 billion for the financial year ending March 31.

<div class="itemFullText">
Chinese tech giant Alibaba said on Monday it will invest more than 380 billion yuan (US$52.4 billion) on artificial intelligence and cloud computing over the next three years.
<br>
<br/>
Investors have piled into Chinese technology stocks since the start of the year, with Alibaba – which runs some of the country's biggest online shopping platforms – seeing its shares soar to three-year highs.
<br/>
<br/>
The gains have been boosted since the Hangzhou-based firm announced robust sales growth last week.
<br/>
<br/>
Alibaba plans to "invest at least 380 billion yuan over the next three years to advance its cloud computing and AI infrastructure", a company statement said.
<br/>
<br/>
The firm said its strategy was aimed at "reinforcing (Alibaba's) commitment to long-term technological innovation... (and) underscores the company's focus on AI-driven growth".
<br/>
<br/>
The statement did not detail how the company would allocate the funds or what specific projects would be supported.
<br/>
<br/>
It did add that the investment would exceed its total AI and cloud spending over the past decade.
<br/>
<br/>
Alibaba last week reported an 8 percent bump in revenue for the three months through December, beating estimates to reach 280 billion yuan and triggering a 14 percent surge in its Hong Kong shares on Friday.
<br/>
<br/>
CEO Eddie Wu said last week that the quarterly results "demonstrated substantial progress in (Alibaba's) 'user-first, AI-driven' strategies and the re-accelerated growth of our core businesses". (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
CLP Holdings on Monday said its annual profit increased by about 75 percent to HK$11.7 billion last year, thanks partly to notable improvements in its business in Australia.
<br>
<br/>
The power giant made a profit of around HK$6.6 billion in 2023.
<br/>
<br/>
It has declared a fourth interim dividend payment of HK$1.26 per share, bringing the total dividend last year to HK$3.15, up from HK$3.10 in 2023.
<br/>
<br/>
The company's CEO Chiang Tung-keung said one of CLP's goals is to phase out its remaining coal-fired electricity assets and look into opportunities to use different technologies in the future.
<br/>
<br/>
"We'll start looking at some emerging technologies, including hydrogen, virtual power plants or carbon capture. Those are technologies that we will be interested in," he said.
<br/>
<br/>
"If we want to achieve net zero by 2050, apart from doing renewable energy, we expect these kinds of technologies will take a very important part, in particular towards the latter part of the coming decade, when we are closer to 2050."
<br/>
<br/>
Chiang added that CLP supports the government in pushing forward innovation and technology development, especially in the Northern Metropolis.
<br/>
<br/>
He said his company has reserved sufficient power system capacity to meet the demand for electricity for artificial intelligence and supercomputing centres.

US stocks drifted lower on Monday to compound their sharp losses from last week .
<br>
<br/>
The S&amp;P 500 dipped 0.5 percent to 5,983 after flipping between small gains and losses several times through the day. The relatively modest moves followed its 1.7 percent tumble on Friday, which came after several weaker-than-expected reports on the US economy.
<br/>
<br/>
The Dow added 0.1 percent to 43.461, while the Nasdaq composite fell 1.2 percent to 19,286.
<br/>
<br/>
Berkshire Hathaway climbed 4.1 percent for one of the market’s bigger gains after Warren Buffett’s company reported a jumped in operating profits for the latest quarter.
<br/>
<br/>
Starbucks rose 1.3 percent after saying it would cut 1,100 corporate jobs and leave several hundred more positions unfilled as new CEO Brian Niccol tries to make it a leaner operation.
<br/>
<br/>
Big US companies have broadly been reporting better profits for the last three months of 2024 than analysts expected, which is one of the main reasons the S&amp;P 500 set a record before sliding at the end of last week. The pace of reports will slow this week, but several potentially market-moving updates are still on deck.
<br/>
<br/>
Chief among them is Nvidia, the company that’s become one of Wall Street’s most influential stocks because of what had been nearly insatiable demand for its chips.
<br/>
<br/>
Wednesday will be the company’s first profit report since a Chinese upstart, DeepSeek, upended the artificial-intelligence industry by saying it developed a large language model that can compete with big US rivals without having to use the top-flight, most expensive chips. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
US President Donald Trump said on Monday that his tariffs on Canada and Mexico are starting next month, ending a month-long suspension on the planned import taxes that could potentially hurt economic growth and worsen inflation.
<br>
<br/>
“We’re on time with the tariffs, and it seems like that’s moving along very rapidly,” he said at a White House news conference with French President Emmanuel Macron.
<br/>
<br/>
While Trump was answering a specific question about the taxes to be charged on America's two largest trading partners, the US president also stressed more broadly that his intended “reciprocal” tariffs were on schedule to begin as soon as April.
<br/>
<br/>
“The tariffs are going forward on time, on schedule,” Trump said.
<br/>
<br/>
Trump has claimed that other countries charge unfair import taxes that have come at the expense of domestic manufacturing and jobs.
<br/>
<br/>
His near constant threats of tariffs have already raised concerns among businesses and consumers about an economic slowdown and accelerating inflation.
<br/>
<br/>
But Trump claims that the import taxes would ultimately generate revenues to reduce the federal budget deficit and new jobs for workers.
<br/>
<br/>
Still, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum appeared confident on Monday that her administration would reach agreements with the US government before the deadline set by Trump.
<br/>
<br/>
“We would need to be reaching important agreements this Friday,” Sheinbaum told reporters before Trump's remarks.
<br/>
<br/>
In high-level discussions between both governments, Mexico has insisted that the US also take a hard look at the drug distribution and consumption in its own country rather than pointing only at production in Mexico, Sheinbaum said. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index was down 2.6 percent at the open on Tuesday, at 22,716 points.
<br>
<br/>
It comes as world markets are at a delicate juncture, as rising global trade tensions and geopolitical uncertainty cloud the investment landscape.
<br/>
<br/>
Elsewhere, South Korean shares fell on Tuesday, as the country's central bank lowered its forecast for this year's economic growth.
<br/>
<br/>
The Bank of Korea (BOK) lowered interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point, as expected, cutting rates for a third time in the current easing cycle as growth concerns take centre stage.
<br/>
<br/>
The BOK downgraded its forecast for this year's economic growth to 1.5 percent, from 1.9 percent seen in November. It was even weaker than the governor's earlier warning in January that the projection would be lowered to 1.6 percent or 1.7 percent. (Agencies)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
Hong Kong's exports growth slowed significantly last month, while imports picked up, according to official figures.
<br>
<br/>
Data released by the Census and Statistics Department on Tuesday showed that the value of the city's total exports of goods rose just 0.1 percent year-on-year to HK$389.1 billion.
<br/>
<br/>
That compares with a 5.1 percent annual rise in December and 2.1 percent increase in November, and was the slowest pace of growth in almost a year.
<br/>
<br/>
The value of total imports, however, rose 0.5 percent year-on-year last month to stand at HK$387.1 billion, following a 1.1 percent contraction in December and growth of 5.7 percent in November.
<br/>
<br/>
A government spokesperson partly attributed January's moderate growth to the timing of Lunar New Year, and said it is more appropriate to analyse the trade data for the January-February period combined.
<br/>
<br/>
"Looking ahead, while uncertainties in the external environment, in particular escalating trade protectionism, would continue to weigh on Hong Kong's export performance, steady global economic growth, together with the Central Government's various measures to boost the mainland economy, would provide support," the spokesperson said.

<div class="itemFullText">
Some of Wall Street’s brightest stars lost more of their shine on Tuesday after another report said US households are getting more pessimistic about the economy.
<br>
<br/>
The S&amp;P 500 fell 0.5 percent to 5,995 – it's fourth straight drop after setting an all-time high last week.
<br/>
<br/>
The Nasdaq composite sank 1.4 percent to 19,026 as several influential Big Tech companies lost momentum and screeched lower.
<br/>
<br/>
But the majority of stocks nevertheless rose, which helped the Dow Jones Industrial Average add 159 points, or 0.4 percent to 43,621.
<br/>
<br/>
The US stock market has been generally struggling since the middle of last week after several weaker-than-expected reports on the economy thudded onto Wall Street.
<br/>
<br/>
On Tuesday, the latest said confidence among US consumers is falling by more than economists expected.
<br/>
<br/>
The pessimism hit high-momentum areas of the market in particular, those that had seen waves of euphoric investors pile in during recent years.
<br/>
<br/>
Nvidia fell 2.8 percent, for example, while Tesla tumbled 8.4 percent. They were the two heaviest weights on the S&amp;P 500.
<br/>
<br/>
Bitcoin likewise sank, falling back toward US$88,000, which dragged down stocks of companies in the crypto industry.
<br/>
<br/>
MicroStrategy, the company that’s raised money in order to buy more bitcoin and now goes by the name Strategy, fell 11.4 percent.
<br/>
<br/>
Zoom Communications dropped 8.5 percent even though it reported stronger results for the latest quarter than expected.
<br/>
<br/>
They helped offset a 2.8 percent rise for Home Depot, which delivered a stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. Along with Home Depot, the majority of stocks within the S&amp;P 500 rose.
<br/>
<br/>
The pace of profit reports is slowing, but the potentially most anticipated report is still to come on Wednesday. That’s Nvidia, which has grown to become one of Wall Street’s most influential stocks because of nearly insatiable demand for its chips.
<br/>
<br/>
Wednesday will provide the first earnings report for the company and its CEO, Jensen Huang, since a Chinese upstart, DeepSeek, upended the artificial-intelligence industry by saying it developed a large language model that can compete with big US rivals without having to use the most expensive chips.

<div class="itemFullText">
A hospitality expert on Wednesday said Hong Kong Disneylands’s performance is welcome news, after the amusement park reported records in profit and attendance.
<br>
<br/>
Hong Kong Disneyland reported a net profit of more than HK$830 million, and its highest-ever attendance figure of 7.7 million.
<br/>
<br/>
The park also said its revenue grew by more than 50 percent year-on-year to HK$8.8 billion.
<br/>
<br/>
“This is truly good news and it seems that Disney has been performing quite well in maintaining their uniqueness as an attraction among all the international visitors in Hong Kong," the Vocational Training Council’s Dennis Wong told RTHK’s Hong Kong Today programme.
<br/>
<br/>
While Wong noted Disney has successfully maintained a strong local and mainland customer core, he said they should keep innovating to attract new visitors.
<br/>
<br/>
“Certainly, they have to maintain the freshness of their product. That’s not only maintaining the physical rides, but they have to make sure they will continue rolling out a lot of events and campaigns.”
<br/>
<br/>
The park will be marking its 20th anniversary from June onward, with its managing director saying the celebrations could be a major draw for Hong Kong arrivals.

Data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics on Wednesday showed the monthly consumer price index (CPI) fell 0.2 percent in January from December, when it rose 0.8 percent. The annual pace held at 2.5 percent, matching market forecasts. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Wednesday delivered his 2025-26 budget to the Legislative Council.
<br>
<br/>
Chan started the speech for his financial blueprint – which aims to tackle an estimated HK$100 billion deficit – by saying that Hong Kong needs to reform, innovate and relentlessly improve.
<br/>
<br/>
He pointed out that though counter-cyclical measures launched in the past few years to counter the pandemic have stabilised the economy and eased people’s burden, it has resulted in a fiscal deficit.
<br/>
<br/>
“In this budget, I propose a reinforced version of the fiscal consolidation programme, including a cumulative reduction of government recurrent expenditure by seven percent from now through 2027-28," he told lawmakers at Legco.
<br/>
<br/>
“Strictly containing public expenditure is a must, but we should proceed in a steady and prudent manner, and be careful to find a balance among the various impacts that may arise in the process.”
<br/>
<br/>
The finance minister also said the “approach represents our all-out effort to minimise the impact on public services and people's livelihood”, adding that "it gives us a clear pathway towards the goal of restoring fiscal balance”.
<br/>
<br/>
On the SAR's economic growth, Chan said authorities forecast that Hong Kong's gross domestic product will continue to grow moderately this year, rising two to three percent in real terms.
<br/>
<br/>
The economy grew by 2.5 percent in 2024.
<br/>
<br/>
He also forecast that the economy will grow, on average, by 2.9 percent a year in real terms from 2026 to 2029, with underlying inflation expected to be at an average of 2.5 percent a year.

<div class="itemFullText">
The government’s move to pause the sale of commercial land in the upcoming fiscal year has drawn mixed views from analysts – some say it will ease a supply glut of office space while others felt it will have limited impact to the market.
<br>
<br/>
The vacancy rate of Grade-A offices reached a record 17 percent in January, according to commercial real estate agency Colliers.
<br/>
<br/>
That translates to 14 million square feet of empty floor space, while another 5.5 million square feet will be rolled out this year and 2026.
<br/>
<br/>
Kathy Lee, head of research and retail consultancy at Colliers, said rental value of prime office space plunged 40 percent over the past three years.
<br/>
<br/>
"I think the government is very wise to stop selling any commercial land, [so as] to let the market to have some time to digest and absorb the existing available stocks," she told RTHK.
<br/>
<br/>
Lee added the decision to halt the sale of commercial land was not out of the blue, citing the example of the Queensway Plaza redevelopment which was put on ice amid a market downturn.
<br/>
<br/>
But Hannah Jeong, head of valuation and advisory services at CBRE, warned the current supply glut will take as long as 10 years to be fully absorbed.
<br/>
<br/>
On a separate note, the government also extended the $100 concessionary stamp duty to all properties priced at HK$4 million or below, up from HK$3 million.
<br/>
<br/>
Lee from Colliers welcomed the adjustment, saying it will ease the burden for homebuyers.
<br/>
<br/>
"The interest rates remain at a high level, so a lot of homebuyers might still find it difficult to meet their mortgage duties. I think this will help boost demand for smaller-sized units," she explained.
<br/>
<br/>
However, JLL Hong Kong chairman Joseph Tsang was less optimistic.
<br/>
<br/>
"The Budget doesn't focus much on the property market. And this measure has no stimulating effect on the housing market but will instead affect government revenue," he said in a statement.
<br/>
<br/>
"With the high inventory of residential properties, housing prices are likely to continue falling."
