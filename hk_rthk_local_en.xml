<div class="itemFullText">
 A pioneering initiative, one of the beneficiaries of this year's Operation Santa Claus (OSC), is hoping to improve access to mental health therapies, with practitioners providing free, short-term, and remote support to local citizens.
 <br>
  <br>
  Improving Access to Community Therapies (iACT) was designed and developed by Mind HK - a mental health charity set up in 2017 by Dr Lucy Lord to ensure no one faces a mental health problem alone in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last year, a report by the Chinese University of Hong Kong showed that 1 in 4 students suffered from mental health problems, pointing to the importance of early intervention to prevent student mental health further deteriorating.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dr Candice Powell, CEO of Mind HK, says their goal is to receive funding in order to serve at least 300 students to receive one-on-one psychological support based on the iACT model.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We believe that therapies shouldn't just be in the hospital but actually can happen in the community, so that's why we are launching this programme in secondary schools," said Dr Powell.
  <br>
  <br>
  Project coordinator Coco says she herself also benefited from the iACT short-term emotional support service after graduating from university and feeling anxious about her future.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The well-being practitioner used iACT as the therapy to how we live with our negative emotion and help me to find my life value. We can use another way to live with some negative emotion. We don't always need to fight them or eliminate those negative emotion," Coco said.
  <br>
  <br>
  As part of its pilot phase from 2021 to 2024, Mind HK trained over 100 well-being practitioners to work with youth and adults.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jointly organised by RTHK and South China Morning Post, OSC funds charitable projects that focus on children and youth, the elderly, the community, those with physical and mental disabilities, medical projects, and those concerning the environment.

    HK rejects latest US congressional report

<img alt="The government said it strongly disapproved of and firmly rejected groundless attacks, slanders and smears in the USCC report. Photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1780004_1_20241120081642.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government said on Wednesday it strongly disapproves of and firmly rejects a US congressional report that criticised the SAR and central governments and the city's national security law.
 <br>
  <br>
  It said the US-China Economic and Security Review Commission (USCC) had used politics to prevail over law-based administration.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The HKSAR Government strongly disapproves of and firmly rejects USCC's wanton manoeuvre with politics prevailing over law-based administration and interference in the affairs of the HKSAR in the so-called report,” the government statement wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US report said changes in the SAR raised questions about Hong Kong’s ability to maintain its position as the financial connector between mainland China and the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  In response, the SAR government said the accusations are groundless attacks, slanders and smears against various aspects of Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The HKSAR Government strongly urges again individual United States politicians to discern facts from fallacies, respect the international law and basic norms governing international relations, and immediately stop interfering in Hong Kong matters, which are purely China's internal affairs," the government said.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said since the implementation of a national security law in 2020, the US had continued to turn a blind eye to the large-scale and incessant rioting which occurred in 2019 that devastated Hong Kong's society, livelihoods and the economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said the US also deliberately neglected the fact that the implementation of the law enabled livelihoods and economic activities to return to normal.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government said Hong Kong's rise in world competitiveness rankings to be among the world's top economies was testament to the fact that high-level security protection underpins high-quality development.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said the US enjoyed economic benefits in Hong Kong, with a trade surplus of some US$270 billion with the SAR over the past 10 years, and there were more than 1,200 US companies operating businesses in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government said all these demonstrated the close and long-standing economic ties between the two places, so a stable and prosperous Hong Kong was of mutual benefit to the US.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Observatory cancelled all typhoon signals at 10.10pm on Tuesday as Man-yi continues to weaken and moves away from Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  The T1 signal was issued on Monday morning and had been in force for well over 30 hours.
  <br>
  <br>
  The forecaster also noted that water level is expected to rise on Tuesday night and warned that minor flooding may occur in low-lying coastal areas.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Under the combined effect of spring tide, the northeast monsoon and Man-yi, the water level of the coast of Hong Kong will rise higher than normal tonight," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "From around 10pm tonight to midnight, a high water level of near 3 metres above Chart Datum is expected in Victoria Harbour, and a high water level of about 3.1 metres above Chart Datum is expected at Tai O."
  <br>
  <br>
  People are advised to stay away from the shoreline and remain on the alert.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday warned that anyone who intends to endanger national security will be punished in accordance with the law, after 45 opposition figures were sentenced to up to 10 years in prison for conspiracy to commit subversion.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, Lee said the court decision reflects the severity of the case.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The sentence shows the court confirmed that the offence of the defendants was extremely serious and they should be severely punished,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CE stressed Hong Kong is a society underpinned by the rule of law, and offenders must be held accountable.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Those involved acted under the guise of democracy and freedom to subvert the political regime of the HKSAR… This case shows that anyone who intends to subvert state power and endanger national security will ultimately be punished in accordance with the law.”
  <br>
  <br>
  A government spokesman, meanwhile, called on foreign governments to stop interfering in SAR affairs.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The HKSAR government has noticed that the United States and some Western countries, anti-China organisations, anti-China politicians and foreign media have recently made malicious attacks and smears on various cases,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The HKSAR government has stated on many occasions that like all cases, this case was handled strictly on the basis of evidence and in accordance with the law.”

    Power tariffs to climb by almost one percent in 2025

<img alt="Secretary for Environment Tse Chin-wan says the city's two power firms will raise their electricity tariffs by less than one percent on average next year. Photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1779930_1_20241119185403.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Electricity will cost slightly more for Hongkongers next year, with tariffs rising by 0.9 percent on Hong Kong Island and 0.98 percent in Kowloon and the New Territories.
 <br>
  <br>
  The city's two power firms, CLP and HK Electric, said even though fuel costs stabilised this year, ongoing geopolitical tensions meant they had to take on a more cautious approach.
  <br>
  <br>
  HK Electric noted that it also needs to pump in extra resources to further boost service reliability.
  <br>
  <br>
  "To handle more frequent extreme weather conditions, we need to improve our infrastructure so that we can still deliver reliable electricity to our customers even during bad weather. Also, we need to update our old and outdated facilities. All these investments will put pressure on electricity prices," its managing director Francis Cheng said.
  <br>
  <br>
  CLP's managing director, Joseph Law, pointed out that the company is dealing with challenges like inflation, rising material costs, and a tense labour force -- all of which are driving up its operational expenses.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But we understand that people are concerned about electricity prices, and we will keep working to improve our operating efficiency by managing our finances wisely and controlling expenses," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "While international fuel prices have stabilised somewhat over the past year, geopolitical risks remain, and global fuel costs are still relatively high, so the outlook isn’t too bright. We’ll continue to take a careful approach in managing our expenses."
  <br>
  <br>
  A climate economist said while the increases this time around are in line with estimations, he expects the tariff hikes to exacerbate in the years to come.
  <br>
  <br>
  "From the international perspective, I would say there is still uncertainty about the fuel cost, especially the fluctuation in oil prices that might affect the future natural gas price. I think we should pay more attention," William Yu, CEO of World Green Organisation, told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  Several lawmakers also raised concerns about the SAR's reliance on imported fuels, and urged the administration to speed up plans to find alternative energy supply sources.
  <br>
  <br>
  Environment secretary Tse Chin-wan said in response that the government has been negotiating with mainland officials about boosting its zero-carbon energy supply.
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted that there's land set aside in Tseung Kwan O for receiving nuclear power and the project is scheduled for completion by 2035.

    '50 percent more tourists to join mega events in 2025'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Tuesday said it expects mega events in the first half of next year to attract 840,000 tourists, a 50 percent rise when compared with the same period this year.
 <br>
  <br>
  At a press conference, officials said there will be more than 90 mega events in the first half of 2025, including festivals, conventions and sports events.
  <br>
  <br>
  They said the events are expected to generate total spending of HK$3.3 billion, which would be a 40 percent increase compared to the first half of 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked about the cancellation of events due to poor weather conditions, Deputy Financial Secretary Michael Wong said the government will have better arrangements by learning from the mainland and creating back-up plans for events like drone shows.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For example for some of the shows, the original plan was to have 2,000 drones in a show, and they lowered the density to around 400. This allowed the show to continue to be carried out," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I will learn from them, so for some of the shows in the future, that will be one of the alternative options that we will prepare for."
  <br>
  <br>
  Culture and tourism minister Kevin Yeung, meanwhile, said it is inevitable that outdoor events such as the cross-harbour swim run the risk of being affected by the weather.
  <br>
  <br>
  He admitted that tourists might feel disappointed with the cancellation of events, but dismissed worries that Hong Kong's reputation as a mega events hub could be damaged.

    Subversion case sentencing shows severity: Chris Tang

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Security Chris Tang said the sentences handed down on Tuesday in the city's largest national security case to date reflected the severity of the offence.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking after the High Court court sentenced 45 people for conspiracy to commit subversion, Tang also told reporters that the government will look into individual cases before deciding whether to appeal.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think different people may have different judgements about whether the sentencing is appropriate. But I think the important point is the rule of law," Tang said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, eight others, including former lawmakers James To and Roy Kwong, are currently on bail after they were arrested three years ago for participating in the unsanctioned Legco primary aimed at bringing down the government. They have yet to be charged.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For every case, if we have sufficient evidence, we will arrest and we will prosecute," Tang said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Barrister and Executive Councillor Ronny Tong told RTHK that the sentencing reflected the application of common law principles.
  <br>
  <br>
  "One can see that the sentencing may not be as severe as a lot of people originally think, but it has its basis by reason of the fact that the court is effectively sentencing these defendants according to common law principles," Tong said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "One must still remember that we are talking about serious crimes... A conspiracy crime may simply involve a situation where the crime has yet to be committed. Nevertheless from the sentencing, one can see that the court will treat it seriously and I think people should be aware of this."

<div class="itemFullText">
 Transport Secretary Lam Sai-hung on Tuesday said the government will carefully review fare increase requests from bus operators before making any decisions.
 <br>
  <br>
  KMB and New Lantao Bus are asking for 6.5 percent increases, while Citybus wants to put fares up by 9.5 percent.

  <br>
  "We’ll consider several factors, starting with how the public feels about it and the bus companies’ financial figures. We’ll also look at the services the bus operators offer. We will strictly play our gatekeeping role," Lam told reporters after attending a transport event.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lam added that officials will gather opinions from legislators and the general public as well as the Transport Advisory Committee, based on the existing mechanism.
  <br>
  <br>
  Legco's panel on transport is set to begin discussions on the matter on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Lam also said implementing time-varying tolls for the Tai Lam Tunnel would be one of the many viable options when the government takes control of the infrastructure in May.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said he hopes to present Legco the amendments to the tunnel's regulations by the end of this year and promised that the tunnel's tolls will be much lower than they are now.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Three of the defendants in Hong Kong's largest national security trial to date received the heaviest sentences among those considered "active participants" in the scheme aimed at bringing down the government.
 <br>
  <br>
  Former activist Owen Chow was given a jail term of seven years and nine months, Gordon Ng was jailed for seven years and three months, and former journalist Gwyneth Ho got seven years.
  <br>
  <br>
  National security judges Andrew Chan, Alex Lee and Johnny Chan pointed out that Chow, 27, was one of the initiators of a pledge relating to the scheme, which "certainly pointed to the fact that [Chow] was putting every effort in binding the participants to ensure its success”.
  <br>
  <br>
  He had pleaded not guilty.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chow was already jailed over a riot case, and Tuesday's sentence will be served consecutively because the judges ruled that they were "separate and distinct incidents".
  <br>
  <br>
  As for Ng, who had also pleaded not guilty, the judges said the 46-year-old "willingly and intentionally" facilitated the scheme.
  <br>
  <br>
  “This was exemplified by the fact that he placed a full-page advertisement in Apple Daily on 3 July 2020 urging candidates who lost in the Primary Election not to participate in the LegCo election and asking people not to vote for anyone who had not participated in the Primary Election,” the judgement said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho, meanwhile, was the only defendant who did not submit mitigation.
  <br>
  <br>
  She had pleaded not guilty as well.

 A stress test will be conducted at the Kai Tak Youth Sports Ground on Saturday, with the police saying the aim is to test communication and trust levels between various departments through scenario-based exercises.
 <br>
  <br>
  Five hundred members of the public will take part, along with 4,500 civil servants.
  <br>
  <br>
  Acting Senior Superintendent Ng Tsz-fai said tests will cover ticket inspections, security checks, designated seating arrangements, emergency response, crowd control and MTR passenger flow management.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The drill team will... test the security inspection procedures and simulate emergencies to evaluate the collaboration capabilities between various departments. This is the first time that there will be five thousand people and designated seating, so we can test the time required for entry and the clarity of instructions," Ng said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that the first exit test will begin at 5pm, with participants divided into groups of 1,000 and walking from the stadium to Sung Wong Toi Station. A second test will follow shortly afterwards, with participants walking to Kai Tak Station.
  <br>
  <br>
  MTR's Chief of Operating and Metro Segment Cheris Lee said trains will operate as usual, but there will be one-way only walking arrangements at the two stations during certain times.

    Sentences based both on NSL and common law, court says

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The High Court says the prison sentences it handed out on Tuesday in Hong Kong’s largest national security case so far were based not only on the 2020 National Security Law (NSL), but also on common law principles.
 <br>
  <br>
  Forty-five people were given prison terms ranging from four year and two months to ten years for conspiracy to commit subversion, in relation to their involvement in unauthorised primary polls that were found to be part of a wider plot to seize control of the legislature and ultimately to overthrow the SAR government.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, questions were raised as to whether the defendants should be sentenced according to the penalties laid out under Article 22 of the NSL, which makes no mention of the offence of conspiracy.
  <br>
  <br>
  The article mandates prison sentences of between 10 years to life in prison for those deemed “principal offenders”, three to 10 years for “active” participants, and lesser penalties for “other participants”.
  <br>
  <br>
  The court decided that while the penalty banding is of “reference value, [it] should not be strictly applicable.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The judges said they also made reference to the common law offence of conspiracy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ultimately, the starting points of the custodial sentences the court meted out to all defendants ended up being in line with the penalties mandated under Article 22 of the NSL.
  <br>
  <br>
  “When the court assessed the seriousness of the circumstances of the case, the prime focus was on the offender’s acts, as well as the actual consequences, potential risks and possible influence entailed”, the judges wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  They stressed that the defendants were not sentenced for any acts prior to the enactment of the NSL in 2020, and no mainland sentences were used as a reference.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bench also rejected arguments that the scheme was doomed to fail and the defendants should be given lighter sentences.
  <br>
  <br>
  “In order to succeed, the organisers and participants might have hurdles to overcome, that however was expected in every subversion case where efforts were made to overthrow or paralyse a government,” they wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  “In this case, candidates for the primary election were essential [characters] of the scheme, without them, the scheme simply could not get off the ground. They lent their support to and actively participated in the scheme.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The bench added: “Had the scheme been carried out to the very end, the adverse consequences would be far reaching and no less serious than overthrowing the government of the [Hong Kong SAR].”
  <br>
  <br>
  Besides the four “principal offenders”, 41 other defendants were deemed "active participants” by the court.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among them, jailed activist Owen Chow was jailed for seven years and nine months, Gordon Ng received a jail term of seven years and three months, and former journalist Gwyneth Ho was imprisoned for seven years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Former lawmakers Lam Cheuk-ting and Leung Kwok-hung, as well as ex-hospital worker Winnie Yu, were each sentenced to six years and nine months behind bars.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another defendant, former student activist Joshua Wong, was slapped with a jail term of four years and eight months.
  <br>
  <br>
  The court reduced his sentence by one-third for his guilty plea, but said it “did not consider him to be a person of good character” given his criminal records.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It should be noted that [Wong] committed the present offence while he was on court bail," the court said. “We did not think we should give further reduction because [Wong] could not have all the offences sentenced in the same proceedings. The sentence we passed on [Wong] also would not have a crushing effect on him.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Among those who were given the lightest sentences of four years and two months are former lawmakers Jeremy Tam and Claudia Mo.
  <br>
  <br>
  Regarding Mo, the judges said they were “sympathetic to the ailing health” of her husband, Philip Bowring.
  <br>
  <br>
  “However, the health condition of [Mo’s] husband is not a matter that can militate against the sentence to be passed on [Mo],” the judges said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some defendants were given sentence reductions after saying they didn’t know they were breaking the law when taking part in the scheme.
  <br>
  <br>
  “As to those who pleaded ‘ignorance of the law’ as mitigation, we were satisfied that they might have been misled by [Benny Tai] into thinking that the scheme was not unlawful”, the judges said.

    HK face Mauritius, set sights on third straight win

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong will be looking to record their third straight victory under newly-appointed head coach Ashley Westwood as they take on Mauritius on Tuesday in an international football friendly at Mong Kok Stadium.
 <br>
  <br>
  A win over Mauritius could see the 48-year-old Englishman become the first Hong Kong manager since Kim Pan-gon in 2016 to win three consecutive matches, following a pair of convincing showings over Cambodia and the Philippines.
  <br>
  <br>
  RTHK's Asia football correspondent, Chris KL Lau, says Westwood will look to experiment with his line-up.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he also acknowledged the challenges of facing a competitive, 178th-ranked Mauritius side.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong will want to extend their momentum fresh off their win over the Philippines," Lau noted.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Westwood may use this game to experiment with his line-up, though fans can expect another entertaining, forward-thinking, and attacking Hong Kong team."
  <br>
  <br>
  Mauritius, meanwhile, enter the match-up having recorded away defeats to Syria and India in September.
  <br>
  <br>
  Avoiding defeat also guarantees Hong Kong a place in pot two for December's AFC Asian Cup qualifying draw, following Singapore's loss to Chinese Taipei.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 In handing down sentences for subversion to 45 opposition figures on Tuesday, the High Court named four of them as "principal offenders", with former legal academic Benny Tai deemed as the initiator of an unofficial legislative primary election in 2020 aimed at overthrowing the government.
 <br>
  <br>
  Tai received the heaviest jail term of 10 years among all defendants.
  <br>
  <br>
  The three presiding national security judges – Andrew Chan, Alex Lee and Johnny Chan – considered a starting point of 15 years behind bars for Tai, and reduced that by one-third after he pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit subversion.
  <br>
  <br>
  “​​In short, [Tai] was not only the initiator of the scheme, but also an organiser of the primary election… He was the mastermind behind, hence could well be placed in the ‘[principal] offender’ category,” the judges wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  “[Tai] might not be the one standing in the primary election or the actual Legco election, he however provided the necessary platform for those who intended to exercise the vetoing power under the scheme.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Three others – former lawmaker Au Nok-hin and former district councillors Andrew Chiu and Ben Chung – were also named “principal offenders”.
  <br>
  <br>
  They had pleaded guilty and become prosecution witnesses in the trial.
  <br>
  <br>
  The trio received jail sentences of six years and one month to seven years each.
  <br>
  <br>
  With starting points of 12 to 15 years in jail, the judges said the three had their sentences reduced for assisting the prosecution in the trial, as well as other mitigation factors.
  <br>
  <br>
  The court heard that the conspiracy in this case was aimed at undermining or overthrowing the political system and structure of the Hong Kong SAR.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Vice Premier He Lifeng says Hong Kong must enhance its status as an international financial centre to fast-track the country's development as a financial powerhouse.
 <br>
  <br>
  Delivering a speech at the Global Financial Leaders' Investment Summit on Tuesday, he said Hong Kong has a pivotal role to play, with its robust financial system, growing appeal to investors and sound capital markets.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will support more quality enterprises to list and issue bonds in Hong Kong. We will continue to expand mutual market access between the mainland and Hong Kong in areas such as stocks, bonds, financial management and interest rate swaps," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will improve the mechanism for the regular issuance of treasury bonds, steadily upscale the issuance in Hong Kong and support Hong Kong in consolidating its position as a global offshore renminbi business hub."
  <br>
  <br>
  He also said the central authorities will continue to support Chinese financial institutions in Hong Kong, enabling them to expand and enhance the city's financial development.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will continue to deepen financial cooperation in the Greater Bay Area, and take forward the interfacing of rules and mechanisms between mainland cities in the GBA, Hong Kong and Macau in order to create more room for financial development in Hong Kong," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The general principle is that so long as it is conducive to the plan of the central authorities, to the financial reform and development of our country and to the development of Hong Kong as an international financial centre, we will explore and implement it."
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that he hopes Hong Kong will continue to leverage its unique advantages, being backed by the motherland while connecting to the world, and will seize opportunities from the country's deepening reforms and Chinese modernisation while dovetailing with the national development strategy.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said this will help Hong Kong contribute to high-quality national development, exemplifying the One Country, Two Systems principle on its journey.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Forty-five people on Tuesday were sentenced from four years and two months to 10 years in prison for conspiracy to commit subversion in the city's largest national security trial to date.
 <br>
  <br>
  Thirty-one of them pleaded guilty and 14 others were convicted in May for taking part in a plot to overthrow the government by securing a majority in the Legislative Council and indiscriminately voting down the administration's budget and spending initiatives to cause a constitutional crisis.
  <br>
  <br>
  The High Court sentenced former legal academic Benny Tai, who it said “advocated for a revolution” and masterminded the scheme, to 10 years in prison as a principal offender under Article 22 of the National Security Law (NSL).
  <br>
  <br>
  Three others who were also deemed to be principal offenders for their roles in organising an unsanctioned Legco primary poll related to the conspiracy – former lawmaker Au Nok-hin, along with ex-district councillors Andrew Chiu and Ben Chung – were given jail terms ranging from six years and one month to seven years each.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 41 others were all ruled to have been "active participants" in the plot, with the heaviest sentences meted out to Owen Chow – who was jailed for seven years and nine months – and Gordon Ng, who got seven years and three months. The lightest sentence given was four years and two months.
  <br>
  <br>
  In handing down the sentences, national security judges Andrew Chan, Alex Lee and Johnny Chan stressed that "had the scheme been carried out to the very end, the adverse consequences would be far reaching and no less serious than overthrowing the Government of the HKSAR."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Whether the scheme would ultimately succeed, it was not for this Court to speculate," they added. "What we were sure was that all the participants had put in every endeavour to make it a success."
  <br>
  <br>
  They also stressed that while the court looked into things that happened before the NSL was enacted on July 1, 2020 to assess the seriousness and extensiveness of the conspiracy, none of the defendants were actually sentenced for any acts they committed during this time.
  <br>
  <br>
  “However, they remained willing parties to that agreement and continued their participation in the scheme after it had been rendered criminal by the NSL”, they noted.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two of the 47 defendants were acquitted earlier.

 The Observatory on Tuesday said the T1 signal will remain in force until at least 10pm.
 <br>
  <br>
  It said Severe Tropical Storm Man-yi had continued to weaken, and was closest to the SAR, skirting within about 400 kilometres of the city. It issued the T1 on Monday morning.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Observatory warned that under the combined effect of spring tide, the northeast monsoon and Man-yi, coastal water levels would will be higher than normal between 10 pm and midnight on Tuesday, and warned of possible minor flooding in some low-lying coastal areas, and urged the public to take care.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There will be swells," it added. "Members of the public should stay away from the shoreline and not engage in water sports."

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government said three franchised bus operators have asked for fare hikes of between 6.5 and 9.5 percent.
 <br>
  <br>
  In documents submitted to the legislature, the Transport and Logistics Bureau said KMB and New Lantao Bus are seeking hikes of 6.5 percent, while Citybus wants a 9.5 percent increase.
  <br>
  <br>
  The companies made the applications for higher fares earlier in the year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials said the bus operators have averaged around 3.7 million passenger trips a day in the first half of this year, about 90 to 95 percent of what they were before the pandemic.
  <br>
  <br>
  They said the government has been helping the firms boost income and cut costs.
  <br>
  <br>
  "However, with rising salary expenses and volatile fuel costs, as well as continued competition for passengers with other transport modes, the financial situation of franchised bus operators has not been satisfactory," the bureau said in the document.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government said it will strike a balance between the public's affordability and financial sustainability of the operators when considering the applications.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lawmakers are due to discuss the matter on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last year, the bus firms raised fares from between a little less than 4 percent and 7 percent.

    Tai Lam Tunnel to charge time-varying tolls: sources

<img alt="Sources said the authorities plan to charge time-varying tolls for Tai Lam Tunnel from May next year. File photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1779732_1_20241118184742.jpg&q=65">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Sources said on Monday that the government plans to charge cheaper, time-varying tolls for the Tai Lam Tunnel when it takes control of the infrastructure in May.
 <br>
  <br>
  The tolling system would be similar to the ones for the three cross-harbour tunnels brought in last year, with three levels of charges for peak, general and non-peak hours.
  <br>
  <br>
  Currently, private car drivers need to pay HK$58 for using the tunnel connecting Ting Kau with Yuen Long.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sources said in future, it will be HK$45 for peak, HK$30 for general and HK$18 for non-peak hours.
  <br>
  <br>
  An across-the-board charge of HK$28 is being mooted for taxis, down from HK$58 at the moment.
  <br>
  <br>
  And commercial vehicles will pay HK$43, which would be cheaper than current toll levels.
  <br>
  <br>
  DAB lawmaker Ben Chan, who chairs the Legco transport panel, said he finds HK$45 for private cars during peak hours to be on the high side.
  <br>
  <br>
  As for taxis, he said the toll could be set at HK$25, the same as that for the three cross-harbour tunnels.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Compared with the current situation, perhaps some truck drivers using Tuen Mun Road may turn to Tai Lam Tunnel (during peak hours in future), causing further congestion," he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So I believe if the government charges the time-varying tolls, that can allow the spread of traffic in an orderly manner. I think that's a good thing."
  <br>
  <br>
  The tunnel's 30-year franchise began in 1995 and is currently fully-owned by a subsidiary of Sun Hung Kai Properties.

    'Improve grazing practices to save giant wild pandas'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An associate professor of environmental science on Monday said sustainable grazing practices backed by regulations and community involvement are vital for protecting giant wild panda habitats.
 <br>
  <br>
  Binbin Li from Duke Kunshan University led a research project from July 2018 to May 2024 in China, quantifying the damage caused by livestock grazing on bamboo ecosystems and other vital vegetation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The problem is fragmentation. We have agriculture, cropland, linear infrastructure and also residency area, so that makes their habitat fragmented, and then a lot of the populations are so small, and we're worried about the local extinction of some of the small populations," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The key right now is how we can reconnect some of the habitat and also reduce degradation for example from livestock grazing or the other types of natural resource uses."
  <br>
  <br>
  Li said that by assessing the impact of grazing on pandas, the study was able to identify suitable grazing areas and patterns, adding that these findings lay the groundwork for developing effective grazing management policies to safeguard panda habitats.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There is a livestock ban in certain areas but we also provide composition from the government and to the local communities but not just composite them to sell their livestock but also provide some long-time subsidy for example give like job opportunities to hire them as rangers so then they can receive long-term incentives not to have livestock again," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is key for a lot of conservation actions. How you can provide a long-term mechanism to incentivise local communities and to do conservation."
  <br>
  <br>
  Li was speaking to reporters after the kick-off ceremony for the 29th Ocean Park Conservation Day under the theme "Safeguarding Wild Giant Pandas and Their Habitats".
  <br>
  <br>
  In regards to the six pandas living in Hong Kong, she said pandas in captivity need to be given a lot of space and care, adding that she hopes the SAR's enthusiasm for the animals will drive conservation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You need to pay attention to the welfare of pandas in captivity and enough space, and then the air conditioning is good, especially during summer, because they love cool temperatures. I think captive pandas are very important as a window to understand what is going on with the wild pandas. So the key thing for captivity or zoos is to do education," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "These six pandas, maybe they can attract more attention from the public and to conserve pandas in the wild because there are a lot more out there and they are facing more threats than the captive pandas."

    'China to build more Belt and Road transport networks'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Vice Minister of Transport Fu Xuyin said on Monday that the nation will keep building transport networks with Belt and Road countries, while continuing its internal reform of logistics and transport to lower costs.
 <br>
  <br>
  He made the comment while giving a speech at the Asian Logistics, Maritime and Aviation Conference in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  The official said international supply chains are under duress amid global uncertainties, in part arising from geopolitics and trade protectionism.
  <br>
  <br>
  And Hong Kong, Fu said, will continue to play a key role in stabilising global supply chains through its logistics, maritime and aviation developments.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will continue to strengthen the shipping cooperation between the mainland and Hong Kong, consolidating and enhancing the SAR's status as an international shipping centre," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will facilitate Hong Kong's deeper integration into the country's overall development, and better utilise its advantages of having the motherland's backing and its connectivity to the world, so as to contribute globally in trading and shipping."
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at the same event, Acting Chief Executive Eric Chan said the airport's third-runway system to be launched later this month will be a game-changer because it'll bring extra capacity.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that the government envisages Hong Kong rising as a green and smart port, as it outlined in its plans to develop the SAR into a green maritime fuel bunkering centre.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The observatory on Monday said the chances of it issuing a T3 over Severe Tropical Storm Man-yi are not high, because winds across the city are not expected to get so strong.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Unless Man-yi adopts a more northerly track or edges closer to the coast of Guangdong with a higher intensity, the chance of issuing Strong Wind Signal No 3 is relatively low," said the observatory.
  <br>
  <br>
  It added that the T1 issued in the morning will remain in place until at least 10am on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Although Hong Kong is expected to be spared the worst of the storm, showers are likely to become more frequent on Tuesday and some minor flooding is possible in low-lying areas over the next two days, forecasters said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Man-yi is expected to skirt around 400 kilometres to the south of the SAR on Tuesday morning.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's first electric ferry will arrive in the city this week and will be put into service after tests are completed, the Environmental Protection Department (EPD) said on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The government earlier earmarked HK$350 million for a pilot scheme subsidising operators to introduce a total of four electric ferries.
  <br>
  <br>
  The first of these, operated by Sun Ferry, will conduct its final tests in Hong Kong waters by the end of this year, before it starts running between North Point and Hung Hom.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vanessa Au, an assistant director of the EPD, said the use of electric ferries will improve air quality around Victoria Harbour, and they are also more cost-effective.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We hope that the operating expenses for ferries can be reduced, but we have to test how much the actual reduction can be," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Through this pilot scheme, we hope within 24 months we can compare the electricity consumption and the traditional fuel consumption. Because it's using the motor technology, we hope to cut the maintenance cost as well."
  <br>
  <br>
  Au said charging an electric ferry for about eight hours overnight is enough for a full day's operation.
  <br>
  <br>
  She added that solar panels will be installed on the deck of the ferries to support part of the lighting system.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zheng Cheng-qi, deputy general manager of Sun Ferry, said he hopes to see more electric ferries in Hong Kong, but the industry needs further assistance from the government.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Charging facilities may be an obstacle. If supporting facilities can be refined, ferry services can have a better prospect in Hong Kong," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The EPD said charging facilities have already been installed at North Point, Hung Hom and Kwun Tong ferry piers.

    Hiring all year round boosts civil service recruitment

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Civil Service Secretary Ingrid Yeung on Monday said a year-round recruitment drive is proving effective in tackling a manpower crunch across various departments.
 <br>
  <br>
  The government has been continuously recruiting for some roles since October last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a Legislative Council panel meeting, Yeung said this allows job offers to be made more quickly compared to the previous system of only receiving applications once every one or two years.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We have shortened the time required for approval from 10 months to four months, so there has been a tangible surge in the number of acceptances,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Because in the past, the period was too long, so successful candidates accepted other job offers. With the year-round recruitment process which has been put in place for some 13 months, we do see an increase in recruitment numbers.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeung also told lawmakers that 3,000 civil servants resigned in the 2023/24 period, a rate of 1.8 percent. She said this was a fall from previous years and was “a really low percentage” compared to the private sector.
  <br>
  <br>
  “In the private sector, according to statistics, the resignation rate stands at double-digit figures in most cases. So 1.8 percent is a really low figure. Forty percent of those resigning from the service have done so before the end of their probationary period,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “You could say that perhaps the candidate chosen hasn’t been the right one, and it’s a process for the candidates as well. For the new recruit, early on, if they know that their aspirations and expectations are not met, or if they find themselves unsuited for this post, then they should leave early instead of dragging on.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Election Committee lawmaker So Cheung-wing said that out of hundreds of thousands of applicants, only around 10,000 people had been recruited, questioning whether it was a matter of quality or whether the bureau is trying to control spending.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeung said it was because many of the applicants weren't up to scratch, adding that money is available to plug the gaps in manpower.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A non-governmental organisation says having a hearing impairment should not be an impediment to seeking mental health support.
 <br>
  <br>
  That is why Silence Limited, one of 11 Operation Santa Claus beneficiaries this year, has launched a project titled "Finding a Way to My Heart."
  <br>
  <br>
  The NGO's Operations Director, Ken Ng, said Silence Limited would provide sign language interpretation services via the project for people with hearing loss during their consultations at public hospitals.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Mental health issues [are] not easy to diagnose by equipment or machines. Basically, the psychiatrist or the doctors have to talk or communicate with the patients to find out what the real issue is," he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But many of our clients report that it is not easy to get an in-house sign language interpreter to attend the consultation," said Ng.
  <br>
  <br>
  Established in 2008, Silence Limited aims to bring people with hearing impairments together, promote social inclusion, and foster equal development.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our projects mainly focus on trying to fill up the gaps of existing services, how to improve the mental health situation of our clients. So we will provide or acquire sign language interpreters to participate in the medical consultation sections as well as the workshops or even the activities of our programme," Ng said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jointly organised by RTHK and South China Morning Post, OSC funds charitable projects that focus on children and youth, the elderly, the community, those with physical and mental disabilities, medical projects, and those concerning the environment.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Observatory issued a T1 at 6.40am on Monday as Tropical Cyclone Man-yi moved towards the SAR, and warned that it might issue a higher signal later in the day or early on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  "The Standby Signal, No. 1 will remain in force at least until 6pm," said the weather forecaster in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The storm is forecast to come within 800 kilometres of the city around midnight on Monday, but is expected to weaken.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Observatory said the approach of Man-yi and the northeast monsoon would bring windy conditions on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Depending on the distance between Man-yi and the Pearl River Estuary, its degree of weakening and the change in local wind conditions, the Observatory will assess the need of issuing the Strong Wind Signal, No. 3 tonight to early tomorrow," the Observatory added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Observatory warned that some low-lying areas may see minor flooding in some areas because of the combined effect of the spring tide, the northeast monsoon and Man-yi, and urged the public to take care.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The 31st edition of the Apec Economic Leaders’ Week has wrapped up with host nation Peru saying it has furthered three objectives, including fostering inclusive and sustainable economic growth.
 <br>
  <br>
  The leaders also issued a joint declaration, calling for a concerted effort in tackling issues such as climate change.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to local and international press at the end of the week-long Apec meeting, Peruvian President Dina Boluarte said she was honoured to have hosted the leaders of the bloc’s 20 other economies.
  <br>
  <br>
  She also praised the professional work of her colleagues for the past year, saying it has reaped immense rewards.
  <br>
  <br>
  Those included the signing of a free trade agreement with Hong Kong, and updating the existing one with China, its biggest trading partner.
  <br>
  <br>
  Boluarte also reiterated three thematic priorities - trade and investment for inclusive and interconnected growth; innovation and digitalisation to promote transition to a formal economy; and sustainable growth for resilient development.
  <br>
  <br>
  Just before making her concluding remarks, the Peruvian leader and her counterparts got together one final time for the family photo, a longstanding tradition for the Apec summit.
  <br>
  <br>
  The session offers a chance for the host nation to showcase their traditional attire, but Peru decided to use the occasion to promote their textile products made of alpaca fibre.
  <br>
  <br>
  Each leader was given a vicuna wool scarf from a local luxury brand. The price tag? US$1,415.
  <br>
  <br>
  A few hours after the summit concluded, the customary Leaders’ Declaration was released.
  <br>
  <br>
  The goals were similar to those in past years, including tackling climate change, reforming the World Trade Organisation, and achieving food and energy security.

  "There will be a spring tide in the next couple of days. The sea level will be particularly high during the high tide overnight. Under the combined effect of the northeast monsoon and Man-yi, the sea level will generally be about a further 0.3 metres above the spring tide at night on Monday and Tuesday. Minor flooding may occur in individual low-lying areas. Members of the public please take appropriate precautions," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The observatory added that depending on the storm's intensity and distance from the city, it may issue a higher warning signal on Monday night or early Tuesday.

    'Carer hotline should have emergency response team'

<img alt="SoCo urges the government to set up a team offering emergency services under its 24-hour hotline for carers. Photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1779566_1_20241117152725.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A hotline offering assistance to caregivers is failing to address the urgent needs of some callers and a special team is needed to provide emergency support, a community group says.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 182 183 hotline launched last year is staffed 24 hours a day and the government says it offers strong support to callers with a range of enquiries, including those who want counselling or details of community services.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the Society for Community Organisation (SoCo) on Sunday said a joint study with Lingnan University's Asia-Pacific Institute of Ageing Studies (APIAS) has shed light on the difficult situation many carers find themselves in.
  <br>
  <br>
  A survey carried out between March and June this year found that on average, those being looked after suffered from two chronic illnesses – as did the carers themselves.
  <br>
  <br>
  Professor Dickson Chan, the director of APIAS, said the hotline isn't enough to address the needs of some carers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They [hotline staff] may give them another phone number and ask them to call another organisation. This means that actually they cannot receive concrete and immediate support through the hotline," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our proposal is maybe the government can consider setting up a special team and the special team is attached to the hotline. So when the older people are in urgent need... the hotline can maybe pass the needs to a special team and after a brief assessment, the team can offer immediate support services for the older people."
  <br>
  <br>
  SoCo meanwhile called for the government to relax eligibility requirements so more people can get financial support under the Scheme on Living Allowance for Carers of Elderly Persons from Low-income Families.

 Plumbers, electricians and specialised construction workers will be among those first invited to Hong Kong under the SAR's next scheme to bring in employees from elsewhere, the government said on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Officials say Hong Kong faces a shortfall of around 180,000 workers by 2028, but plans are already afoot to bring in 30,000 skilled technicians over three years under a new scheme starting in 2025.
  <br>
  <br>
  Labour Secretary Chris Sun told TVB that the administration will first focus on finding new blood for sectors facing the worst manpower crunches.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said their visas will tie them to the occupation they are in when they first move to the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There will surely be special arrangements for these visas, meaning that before they become Hongkongers, they will be required to stay in the job where we had a shortage. This is very clear," the minister said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But after seven years when they obtain permanent residency, you can't have so many requirements. We surely cannot lock workers down to a particular job forever."
  <br>
  <br>
  The labour chief said he believes the workers concerned will mostly choose to stay in their profession after becoming a permanent resident.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also stressed that the government remains committed to encouraging locals into work, adding that subsidies for those re-joining the workforce will remain in place.

 Some 12,000 people on Sunday took part in special races on the airport's third runway to celebrate its opening later this month.
 <br>
  <br>
  The other two runways at Chek Lap Kok remained in use as the 10-kilometre events took place, with Hong Kong long-distance runner Virginia Lo among those on the tarmac as planes went up and down nearby.
  <br>
  <br>
  The elite athlete sponsored by the Sports Institute was the first to the finish line among local runners and she said the time was her personal best.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's quite extraordinary. Because when I was running, there was really an aeroplane next to me. Of course it wasn't very close, but when you run, when you see a plane nearby you feel very excited," Lo said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I don't think the weather affected the race much. Luckily the sun wasn't shining, this is good for runners. Also when we started, the rain had stopped. So I find the weather quite acceptable."
  <br>
  <br>
  World-renowned actor Chow Yun-fat also took part in one of the races, and he was happy with the experience.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's very....very special. You can see planes on both sides, taking off and landing, taking off and landing," he told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I was concerned I couldn't run. If it was raining heavily, I wouldn't have taken part. But when I arrived, it stopped. And when we were actually running, the wind was quite good."

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan said on Sunday that a cross-border investment programme linking Shanghai, Shenzhen and Hong Kong has boosted the SAR's attractiveness in global markets.
 <br>
  <br>
  Writing on his weekly blog, Chan said the number of eligible stocks now stands at more than 3,300 – up from about 800 when Stock Connect was launched 10 years ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said daily transactions by mainland investors buying local stocks average about HK$38 billion, or almost 17 percent of total turnover.
  <br>
  <br>
  For overseas investors buying and selling mainland stocks through Hong Kong, the average daily amount is 123 billion renminbi, or 6.7 percent of turnover.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the local stock market has a total market value of HK$35 trillion, which is a 40 percent increase from 10 years ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Chan said the government is fostering links with the Global South and aims to attract high quality companies to list in the city and roll out cross-border investment products.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said this will allow Hong Kong to better make use of its function as a testing ground for the internationalisation of the renminbi.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that the third Global Financial Leaders' Investment Summit to be held this week will involve a few hundred senior members of staff from international financial institutions, and will allow participants to get an accurate understanding of the mainland's economic development and the financial opportunities it offers.

    Peru trade pact set to take effect in six months: CE

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee says Hong Kong's new free trade agreement with Peru will take effect in about six months or so, as he urged SAR businesses to “understand and appreciate” the pact and join the government’s efforts to explore opportunities in emerging markets.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to the media at the conclusion of his trip to Lima, Lee said that as well as attending the Apec summit, the Hong Kong delegation achieved three key results, the first of which was demonstrating the city’s commitment to promoting regional economic and trade cooperation.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Second, we explored new growth areas for Hong Kong and explored market opportunities in South America,” he continued, citing the pact with Peru.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the agreement will open new doors for businesses, adding that he is confident Hong Kong people can get around the language barrier.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Hong Kong people have been doing business with different parts of the world, including the Middle East, including countries such as Korea and Japan. So obviously, language is an issue, but it's not a barrier,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I believe in the businessmen’s versatility and adaptability.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee said the government will lead promotional efforts so that the city’s businesses can better understand the Peruvian market.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another way to fast-track exchanges between the two sides, Lee said, is to establish chambers of commerce and he has already made this pitch to Peruvian officials.
  <br>
  <br>
  The third and final achievement in Lima, the chief executive went on to say, was enhancing relations with members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean).
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted that he held bilateral meetings with leaders of Malaysia, Vietnam and Singapore, and said there are plans to increase direct flights between Hong Kong and several Asean destinations.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CE had two informal exchanges in Lima with Xi Jinping and Lee expressed gratitude to the president for his "care and guidance"
  <br>
  <br>
  “President Xi has always been caring about Hong Kong. I have reported to him Hong Kong's situation regarding the economy and development. He is well-versed of our development and has given me encouragement,” Lee said.

    Kai Tak hosts rugby match as dummy run for new venue

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Kai Tak Sports Park on Saturday hosted an international rugby match in gloomy weather as another trial event to test the site's smaller outdoor venue, with more signage and faster security checks.
 <br>
  <br>
  The match between Hong Kong and Brazil kicked off at around 4 pm at the Kai Tak Youth Sports Ground.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was the second test event at the 5,000-seat venue, which hosted a local football league game last month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Around 2,500 people turned up to the sports ground in the end, according to the government, fewer than the previous estimate of 3,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  The rugby match, which ended in pouring rain, saw the SAR team claim a 38-17 victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials including sports minister Kevin Yeung and security chief Chris Tang were spotted at the stadium, with the latter saying authorities have made improvements since the previous trial event.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have doubled the number of security screening counters, and set up fast lanes for those who did not bring any bags," Tang told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeung said after the match that the event went more smoothly than the first trial, and that the government would continue to put the sports ground to the test.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will continue to hold a series of trial events and drills until the venue's official opening in the first quarter of next year... Next Saturday, we will conduct a stress test with 5,000 people," Yeung said, adding that more details would be unveiled in the coming week.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chris Brooke, chairman of Hong Kong, China Rugby, hailed the test run's success.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's been a great opportunity for our team to come to operate an event here, in advance of the Hong Kong Sevens next March. As we build up towards the Sevens, it's been a great experience and a very good opportunity for our rugby community to come to the venue to experience the Kai Tak Sports Park, and to see what a great venue it is," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Spectators must purchase their tickets online prior to the event, and they were not allowed to bring in long umbrellas or any food and drink.
  <br>
  <br>
  But a spectator surnamed Mak said the rule was too strict.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A drawback is that we are not allowed to bring our water bottles into the venue. I wish they could be more lenient and let us bring our own water," she told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  For rugby-lover Derek, the cloudy weather posed a bit of a problem.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's quite convenient to get from the MTR station to the venue, but it's troublesome to have to carry an umbrella on rainy days," he said. "I would suggest adding some covers for walkways... My feet were completely soaked."
  <br>
  <br>
  The sports park's indoor stadium is to host a basketball match on December 7, while the first trial run at the main stadium is scheduled for January next year.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee had his most hectic day yet in his week-long visit of Peru, signing a free trade agreement with the nation and meeting with the leaders of Malaysia, Vietnam and Singapore on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) summit.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lee also attended an informal dialogue on Friday, Lima time, briefing regional leaders on the SAR’s strengths as well as its role in China’s Belt and Road initiative and Apec development.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong leader then met Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim for the first time since July last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  He thanked Anwar for supporting the SAR’s plan to establish an Economic and Trade Office in Kuala Lumpur, the fourth in the region known as the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or Asean.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee also congratulated Malaysia for taking the chairmanship of Asean next year, and hoped the nation will continue to support Hong Kong's early accession to the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, or Rcep.
  <br>
  <br>
  After attending another Apec dialogue where he exchanged views Chilean President Gabriel Boric, Lee had two more bilateral meeting with Vietnamese President Luong Cuong and Singaporean Prime Minister Lawrence Wong.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both countries are key trading partners of Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SAR leader’s day culminated in the signing of the FTA between Hong Kong and Peru, and he got to relax by watching cultural performances at an Apec gala dinner.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Saturday, Lima time, Lee will attend the Apec Economic Leaders' meeting retreat and meet with Peruvian business sector representatives.

 Education minister Christine Choi on Saturday said the authorities have stepped up screening after 20 people used forged DSE certificates to apply for the Macau University of Science and Technology.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a radio programme, she said the university suspected that the documents were bogus and had contacted the Hong Kong Examinations and Assessment Authority (HKEAA).
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is outrageous. There were 20 fake DSE certificates. For anyone who has doubts about the DSE results, we can help. The HKEAA keeps a record of the DSE results and can help verify them," Choi said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister said the authorities have reported the cases to the police.
  <br>
  <br>
  Choi added that some people had used fake academic qualifications to gain admission to universities in Hong Kong, but she said applications are now being checked more closely.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, she said a task group on setting up the SAR's third medical school will hold its second meeting later this month.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Based on the expected requirements, the universities which are interested can make changes to their proposals and examine their own qualifications... So this is not a race to see who hands in their proposals fastest," she said.

    HK port will outshine its neighbours: minister

 Transport Secretary Lam Sai-hung said on Saturday that he's confident that the shipping industry will prefer Hong Kong's bunkering facilities to those of nearby cities.
 <br>
  <br>
  He was speaking a day after the authorities unveiled plans to develop the SAR into a high-quality green maritime fuel bunkering centre.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government on Friday announced an action plan on green maritime fuel bunkering, including an aim to switch 55 percent of diesel-fuelled vessels to green maritime fuels by 2026.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on an RTHK radio programme, Lam said the demand for green maritime fuel will gradually increase in line with the target of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, and he expects Hong Kong to outperform.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In terms of traditional fuels, Hong Kong ranked seventh among global fuel bunkering ports. The other two in the GBA were not within the top ten, so we have an advantage," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Green maritime fuel bunkering is like adding a new type of fuel to a gas station, and green maritime fuel will be more widely used as vessels have to reduce their carbon footprint... This will boost business at our port."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lam said the government will look into using 11 hectares of land in Tsing Yi to store green methanol.
  <br>
  <br>
  The director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, Xia Baolong, met Hong Kong government officials together with SAR representatives of the business sector in Shenzhen last week.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister said Xia had urged Hong Kong to develop its ports in land, air and sea, and the authorities would consider tax reduction measures to attract more maritime service enterprises to expand their business in the city, strengthening the SAR's status as an international maritime hub.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The free-trade agreement between Hong Kong and Peru will put the SAR in the global spotlight and fast-track regional trade, according to the city’s delegate to a key working group of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, or Apec.
 <br>
  <br>
  Peruvian exporters and shippers also welcomed the pact and expressed interest in expanding their businesses in Hong Kong, citing the city’s strategic location in Asia and connections with the mainland.
  <br>
  <br>
  Marjorie Yang, a Hong Kong, China, representative on the Apec Business Advisory Council, said one of the biggest features of a free-trade agreement is lowering, or abolishing, tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  But that wasn’t the case here.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Right now, this trade agreement eliminates tariffs on the Peruvian side, but Hong Kong doesn't have any tariffs to eliminate. So Peruvian business have always been welcome to come and do business in Hong Kong,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yang, who's also the head of Esquel Group, one of the world's biggest textile and apparel manufacturers, explained what the Hong Kong-Peruvian FTA is really about.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Bilateral agreements are always good because if you can't get (something) like CPTPP (Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership) going, you can get bilateral agreements and gradually push.”
  <br>
  <br>
  “So this agreement … the terms are such that if there are better terms reached in other bilaterals, we would also benefit.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Edgar Vasquez, a former minister of foreign trade and tourism in Peru, stressed that free trade deals have many facets.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The main focus of the free trade agreement is to have the possibility to cooperate with each other in many other aspects with regards to goods, because we have sanitary and phytosanitary measures, technical barriers to trade, intellectual property,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Now representing the Peruvian Association of Exporters, Vasquez believes the agreement boosts exposure of Hong Kong in Peru and vice versa.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I’m sure that with the free trade agreement, as with our experience with the United States, our exports exploded. With China also, our exports increased a lot. We signed with Thailand, with Australia, our exports are growing.”
  <br>
  <br>
  For Liverita, a Peruvian freight forwarder and consultancy firm, Hong Kong was already on its radar years ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  It set up an office in the SAR in 2020 and followed up with another outlet in Shanghai later that year.
  <br>
  <br>
  General manager Carolina Hurtado said she was extremely grateful for the assistance from InvestHK, the SAR government arm tasked to lure direct foreign Investment.
  <br>
  <br>
  “[That’s] because you really don't have an idea of how many ports or how many locals or chamber of commerce I have visited and asked for information. I mean, what do I need? What info, what documents, what is the process, how much I need to invest?” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We are pretty (good) friends right now with them (InvestHK).”
  <br>
  <br>
  Hurtado added that Hong Kong’s advanced infrastructure and robust financial sector makes it an ideal destination for investors.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I know that the financial companies in Hong Kong are pretty big, more than 100 banks, right? In Peru we don't have more than 20. They don't have a lot of bank investors or bank information for international products.”
  <br>
  <br>
  “But I know Hong Kong (has) got that.”

    HK-Peru FTA to boost more than 150 sectors

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong has signed a free trade agreement with Peru, concluding two years of negotiations with the South American nation.
 <br>
  <br>
  While Chief Executive John Lee and Peruvian President Dina Boluarte looked on, Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development Algernon Yau and his Peruvian counterpart, Ursula Desliu Leon, inked the much-anticipated deal.
  <br>
  <br>
  The FTA will take effect after both sides have completed their respective internal procedures.
  <br>
  <br>
  This represents Hong Kong’s ninth free-trade agreement, and the 21st economy that the SAR has struck a pact with.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to the SAR government, over 150 services sectors will benefit from commitments made by Peru.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some examples include professional, transport, financial, recreational and cultural services.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee had earlier pledged to provide a transparent and favourable platform for Hong Kong investors wishing to set up shop in Peru.
  <br>
  <br>
  Peru is Hong Kong’s fifth largest trading partner in Latin America with bilateral trade reaching HK$5.2 billion last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Peruvian exports to Hong Kong accounted for only one third of that total, and producers here are keen to bump up shipments of popular products such as fruits and vegetables, as well as fish meal.

    Govt revises full-year GDP growth forecast to 2.5pc

<img alt="The government has revised its full-year GDP growth forecast to 2.5 percent, down from the previous range of 2.5 to 3.5 percent. File photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1779367_1_20241115191619.jpg&q=1">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government announced on Friday that it has revised its full-year economic growth forecast to 2.5 percent, compared with the previous estimated range of 2.5 to 3.5 percent.
 <br>
  <br>
  Real GDP in the third quarter grew by 1.8 percent year-on-year, slower than the 3.2 percent growth in the previous quarter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Government economist Adolph Leung said at a press conference that economic growth has been hindered by challenges in the external environment.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Increased global economic uncertainties and escalation of trade conflicts would affect the performance of our goods exports," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Leung expressed confidence that the economy will pick up steam, thanks to measures announced by the central and SAR governments to boost market sentiment.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For the outlook, while the external environment has turned more challenging recently, the Hong Kong economy is expected to maintain its growth momentum for the remainder of the year," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked about US President-elect Donald Trump's plan to slap up to 60 percent of tariffs on goods imported from China, Leung said that will have a "detrimental impact".
  <br>
  <br>
  "It will affect China's exports to the US and also Hong Kong's exports of mainland origin to the US. And I think more than that is that coming along with this kind of trade and economic policy in the US, it will also affect the interest rates outlook."

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Authorities on Friday announced an action plan on green maritime fuel bunkering, which aims to reduce carbon emissions from the cargo industry and expand the use of green maritime fuels among government fleets and ships registered in the city.
 <br>
  <br>
  The government wants to switch 55 percent of the diesel-fuelled vessels to green maritime fuels by 2026, and cut carbon emissions at the Kwai Tsing Container Terminals by 30 percent in 2030 compared with 2021.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a press conference, transport minister Lam Sai-hung said Hong Kong is currently ranked seventh as a global bunkering hub, offering strategic advantages for international ships.
  <br>
  <br>
  "At the present moment, we do not have any forecast on the economic benefits. But one of the side benefits of attracting ships to use our bunkering services is that... there will be opportunities for them to use our cargo handling," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There are also opportunities for them to use the Hong Kong maritime services. So this would be added values for Hong Kong to ensure that we maintain [our role] as the international maritime centre."
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked about difficulties in transitioning to green fuels, Director of Marine Wong Sai-fat said existing engines are tailor-made for specific fuel types and can't easily switch to alternatives like LNG or methanol.
  <br>
  <br>
  "By large, the government vessels are using the diesel engine and the petrol engine. For the use of the petrol engine, it's using the petroleum, and that is not easy or straightforward that you can use other alternative fuel to replace the petrol engine," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Wong added that diesel engines are more adaptable and can mix with biofuel, which is already being used in several government vessels.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government also said it will provide training to nurture talent in the field of green maritime fuel, with 50 people expected to be trained by 2026.

    Legco passes motion of thanks for Policy Address

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lawmakers on Friday passed a motion of thanks for Chief Executive John Lee's Policy Address this year.
 <br>
  <br>
  In the third and final day of the discussion at Legco, retail sector lawmaker Peter Shiu brought up the need to transform the local economy as mentioned by the CE.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shiu said his sector – amid recent struggles – faces similar challenges.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Now there's a shift in the consumption pattern of these mainland visitors. E-commerce is all the rage these days, and local residents are glad to head north for dining and shopping," Shiu, who also chairs the Liberal Party, said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That's why I said, let's recognise the new situation, let's use technology so that our goods are sold not just locally... let's use the online platform and promote our products elsewhere."
  <br>
  <br>
  Shiu also called on entrepreneurs to take a major part in the development of the Northern Metropolis, saying they should be confident about the country and the SAR and that the project would produce great returns.
  <br>
  <br>
  Election Committee sector lawmaker Doreen Kong, for her part, noted that some tenants living in sub-divided units (SDUs) said rents are rising as the government plans to regulate these homes and turn them into "basic housing units".
  <br>
  <br>
  The official leading a task force on the matter, Deputy Financial Secretary Michael Wong, said the government has confidence tackling the issue now because there are more flats in the pipeline to accommodate SDU tenants.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will stick to this people-centric and orderly approach," Wong said in the chamber.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If we can continue to boost the quantity and speed in building public housing, more SDU residents can move into public flats and demand for SDUs will gradually fall."
  <br>
  <br>
  He said officials will give a report on the matter to the legislature at the start of next month, which will be followed by a two-month public consultation exercise.

 Runners and organisers of the Hong Kong Oxfam Trailwalker on Friday braced for a rainy start and a mischievous troop of monkeys.
 <br>
  <br>
  An online video showed that dozens of monkeys were raiding a supply station set up along the route, ransacking for food and delving into a torn blue-and-white striped nylon bag.
  <br>
  <br>
  Michael Wong, Oxfam Hong Kong’s director of fundraising and communications, said it is hard to prevent the animals from enjoying what he called a "once-a-year, all-you-can-eat buffet" at the checkpoint.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong said volunteers could only replenish food and supplies at the station.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Oxfam Trailwalker is one of the city's largest fundraising events.
  <br>
  <br>
  Participants are given 48 hours to complete the 100-kilometre run, kicking off at Pak Tam Chung in Sai Kung and finishing at Harrow International School Hong Kong in Tuen Mun.
  <br>
  <br>
  There is also a shorter 40-kilometre race.

    'Some fan heaters not energy efficient'

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Consumer Council said on Friday bladeless fans with heating functions may not be as energy efficient as some other products on the market.
 <br>
  <br>
  The watchdog found 11 models it tested took longer to heat up the room than traditional fan heaters it tested previously.
  <br>
  <br>
  The models were also found to have different airflow rates.
  <br>
  <br>
  While the average is 16.1 cubic metres per minute, three of them had an airflow rate of 10 cubic metres or less per minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When you are talking about the airflow rate for different bladeless fans, we found it quite diverse. The energy efficiency, as well, is also quite diverse. Don't assume the fact that this kind of fans are very similar in terms of energy consumption. In actual fact, there are more energy-saving ones for you to select," said the council's chief executive Gilly Wong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The more you use energy-efficient appliances, the more you save for your expenses, but furthermore, you help to save the environment as well."
  <br>
  <br>
  The watchdog said by contrast, reverse-cycle air conditioners, which offers both heating and cooling in one system, may be more energy efficient.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Wong said it's ultimately up to consumers to choose what they want to use.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There are pros and cons. If you are talking about the reverse-cycle air conditioner, its heating capacity is much better and energy efficiency is much better," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But when you are talking about the installation, the cost by itself obviously is higher, and also the mobility of it is not there because it's fixed."
  <br>
  <br>
  The council said the Electrical and Mechanical Services Department could consider including different types of electric fans in the Voluntary Energy Efficiency Labelling Scheme, so consumers can compare products.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong authorities on Friday kicked off their first cybersecurity drill in a bid to enhance their defence capabilities.
 <br>
  <br>
  The three-day event involves a number of government departments and public bodies handling cyberattacks carried out by some members of the IT industry.
  <br>
  <br>
  Innovation and technology minister Sun Dong said cybersecurity is a cornerstone of the digital economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Maintaining online security is an important part of promoting high-quality economic development and building smart cities. This long-term task is always ongoing, and never finished," Sun said in a speech marking the event.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I sincerely hope that participating teams, as well as observing departments and organisations, will seize this opportunity to test yourself and improve."
  <br>
  <br>
  Sun added that eight mainland cybersecurity firms with experience with such drills offered technical support and suggestions for this exercise.
  <br>
  <br>
  The drill was organised by the Digital Policy Office and co-hosted by various departments, such as the police cybersecurity and tech crimes unit.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials did not reveal which government systems are involved in the drill.

    Scent boosters 'unnecessary add-ons for laundry'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Laundry scent boosters did not help with cleaning at all, the consumer watchdog said on Friday, as it found "varying types and concentrations" of fragrance allergens in all 12 samples it tested.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Except for one model with only one type of fragrance allergen, the remaining 11 models had three to eight types of fragrance allergens. The test also revealed that models with two-coloured scented granules generally had more types of fragrance allergens," the Consumer Council said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The council also said a third of the scent boosters contained a musk compound, galaxolide, which is not readily biodegradable and highly toxic to aquatic organisms, potentially posing a threat to marine ecosystems in the long run.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 12 in-wash scent boosters tested were priced ranged from HK$38 to HK$179 per bottle.
  <br>
  <br>
  Half of the models claim to help with softening fabrics.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The council considers these in-wash scent boosters as unnecessary add-ons for laundry as the contained fragrances have no effect on cleaning, while the cost per wash could reach a maximum of HK$21 based on the recommended usage," the watchdog said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As such, consumers should consider the long-term need for these products, especially if they or their family members are prone to skin or respiratory allergies. Should consumers choose to use these products, they should exercise caution when using, and at the same time keep them out of young children's reach to avoid accidental ingestion."

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong, Macau and mainland travellers will be able to cross the border at two checkpoints without showing their travel documents starting next Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The National Immigration Administration said on Friday the trial scheme is meant for making things more convenient for travellers, as well as raising border clearance efficiency.
  <br>
  <br>
  The trial will take place at self-service gates at the Shenzhen Bay checkpoint between Hong Kong and Shenzhen and the Gongbei crossing between Macau and Zhuhai.
  <br>
  <br>
  The scheme covers people aged 14 and above.
  <br>
  <br>
  It applies to mainland residents who travel frequently for private but not business reasons.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also applies to non-ethnic Chinese who have a mainland travel card.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[Residents] who agree to the border inspection agency collecting facial information, fingerprints and other information for verification can choose to use the 'document-free' channel at border inspection, without showing physical travel documents," the authorities said in an announcement.
  <br>
  <br>
  They said all travellers should still bring along their travel documents, in case officials need to check them after they cross the border.
  <br>
  <br>
  The authorities said the scheme would gradually expand to cover other border crossings, as well as children aged under 14.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong's sole delegate to the National People's Congress Standing Committee, Starry Lee of the DAB, said her party welcomes the trial scheme, saying it's something they have been calling for.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Overall speaking, this is a very important trial arrangement, a major step. It's a response to many Hong Kong people's demands for crossing the border even more conveniently," she told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Her partymate and the convenor of the SAR's delegates to the National People's Congress, Brave Chan, said the move will boost the economies on all sides as travelling becomes more convenient.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Consumer Council on Friday called for greater acceptance by the catering trade of customers' own containers when they order takeaways.
 <br>
  <br>
  It said proactive and flexible cooperation by eateries "is of crucial importance" to promote the container-free practice across Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Consumers need clear and easy-to-understand guidelines and promotion, complementing the operational procedures of eateries so that [bringing your own containers] can become a natural behaviour," the watchdog said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The council hopes that the government and the industry will work together to develop and promote reusable container lending services, so that the public can reduce the reliance on disposable containers and join hands to reduce plastic use at source."
  <br>
  <br>
  Checks by the council found some restaurants refusing to take boxes from outside for to-go orders.
  <br>
  <br>
  In August and September, the watchdog's staff members posed as customers and brought reusable food containers to 15 eateries during peak lunch hours on weekdays.
  <br>
  <br>
  Five of them were part of the government's bring-your-own-containers scheme.
  <br>
  <br>
  Of the 45 attempts made for the restaurants to accept self-brought containers for takeaways, almost 70 percent were successful, with the watchdog finding eateries taking part in the government initiative more inclined to do so.
  <br>
  <br>
  The council said four of the 15 eateries refused to accept people's own containers citing food safety and hygiene concerns, with one restaurant employee displaying "a slightly impatient tone" without giving an explanation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Others said to be accepting such containers were not able to entertain all requests citing practical constraints, such as the time being peak hours and the boxes being too small or dirty, the council added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The survey also found that none of the eateries offered discounts for [bringing your own containers], nor did they charge according to the number of disposable containers used on a 'user pays' basis, and some still charged [consumers who brought their own containers] for takeaway packaging," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong rolled out the first phase of a ban on single-use plastics in April, with restaurants prohibited from using or selling polystyrene utensils, plastic straws, cutlery and plates. People who fail to comply face fines of up to HK$100,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  Takeaway plastic lunch boxes and cups will also be prohibited in the second phase of the ban. There's no timetable yet on when that would be put in force.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A charity empowering people with genetic and neurodevelopmental disorders says members will be able to maintain their healthy lifestyle changes thanks to Operation Santa Claus (OSC).
 <br>
  <br>
  The first of 11 OSC beneficiaries this year, LOVE 21 supports Hong Kong’s Down syndrome and autistic communities through sport, nutrition and other programmes that include art therapy, music therapy, and African drumming.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carmel Armstrong, Chief Operating Officer of LOVE 21, said the charity – which now has 457 members – was founded to raise awareness of people who are rarely seen and often misunderstood.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Just have a little think: when did you last see a Down syndrome or autistic person on a train, or kicking a football, or running in the public park? And the answer's probably not very often, or not recently anyway. And we believe that's because of the stigma that is attached to being disabled in this part of the world,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Armstrong said with funding from OSC this year, the charity will expand an existing comprehensive nutrition programme, called "Follow-up Nutrition and Sport Programme", to help their members lead healthier, longer lives.
  <br>
  <br>
  “People with Down syndrome are often born with a higher propensity to be obese, slower metabolism, often eyesight problems, heart problems. And our autistic people often need to put on weight, or they need to learn how to eat in a more varied manner. They often don't like certain textures or colours, and so trying to get them to eat healthily and exercise is important.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Armstrong added the expansion would not only have members on the nutrition programme for a 12-month period, but it would also enable the charity to follow up with members to ensure they are maintaining good eating habits and meeting personal goals.
  <br>
  <br>
  One of those who has been part of LOVE 21’s programmes is Nathan, who said he has been “happy, confident and independent” since taking part.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Since I started the programmes here, most of it has helped in looking at better habits like better eating habits, better exercise habits and personal habits and making sure I make myself an intention to follow. I actually want this foundation to support as many people, as many friends that I have,” the member-turned-staff said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jointly organised by RTHK and South China Morning Post, OSC funds charitable projects that focus on children and youth, the elderly, the community, those with physical and mental disabilities, medical projects, and those concerning the environment.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Observatory cancelled all tropical cyclone warning signals at 1.20am on Friday as Typhoon Toraji weakened and the threat to Hong Kong receded. .
 <br>
  <br>
  However, the Observatory said it's still monitoring another tropical cyclone, Tropical Cyclone Usagi.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said Tropical Cyclone Usagi is currently forecast to cross the Luzon Strait on Friday morning and enter within 800 kilometres of Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said it's expected to stay more than 500 kilometres from Hong Kong, posing little direct threat to the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  It will then move northeastward toward the Ryukyu Islands and to gradually weaken.

 The Hong Kong Observatory downgraded the T3 signal to a T1 at 10.20pm on Thursday as tropical depression Toraji continues to weaken and moves away from Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  At 10pm, Toraji was estimated to be about 150 kilometres south-southwest of Hong Kong, and is forecast to move west slowly across the seas south of the Pearl River Estuary.
  <br>
  <br>
  The forecaster said it will drop all typhoon signals when Toraji no longer poses a threat to the SAR.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The mastermind of a plot to plant bombs and shoot police officers in 2019 was on Thursday jailed for more than 23 years while six others were slapped with jail terms ranging from five years and 10 months to 13 1/2 years each.
 <br>
  <br>
  The case involving the "Dragon Slaying Brigade" was Hong Kong's first-ever trial under a United Nations anti-terrorism ordinance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ng Chi-hung, whom the High Court heard was the mastermind in the case, was given the heaviest sentence of 23 years and 10 months after pleading guilty to one count of conspiring to commit the bombing of prescribed objects and one count of possession of arms or ammunition with intent to endanger life.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong Chun-keung, described as the leader of the group, was sentenced to 13 years and six months behind bars.
  <br>
  <br>
  Five other defendants received jail terms ranging from five years and 10 months to 12 years.
  <br>
  <br>
  During the trial, the High Court heard the defendants had planned to plant two bombs during a rally marking International Human Rights Day in December 2019, one on Hennessy Road in Wan Chai and the other around 100 metres away.
  <br>
  <br>
  Steve Li, chief superintendent from the national security police department, told reporters after the ruling that the heavy sentences reflected the severity of the case.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The statements and evidence [presented in court] showed that this group had the capability and was very active in trying to carry out the action," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If the police hadn't dismantled this group and their plan in time, it's believed that many people would have been impacted, including those participating in protests or innocent bystanders."
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, the government said the ruling shows that Hong Kong is a society underpinned by the rule of law.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The fact that the defendants were convicted and sentenced to imprisonment demonstrates that any person intending to plan and commit terrorist activities, endanger public security or disrupt society tranquillity can never escape sanctions of the law," it wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  It added that the Department of Justice will study the reasons for sentencing and consider whether to appeal the sentences.

    Manpower shortage to more than triple by 2028

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong will face a manpower crunch of 180,000 workers by 2028, compared with the shortage of 50,000 that was recorded last year, according to the government's manpower projection released on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The shortfall in the service industry was the worst last year, as it saw a shortage of 24,000 staff.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the Labour and Welfare Bureau said the situation would change by 2028 as jobs requiring skilled technicians would see a significant shortage of talent.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said the city needs to find at least 60,000 additional staff to fill the shortfall, a six-fold increase from last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Secretary for Labour and Welfare Chris Sun revealed the government already has plans to import 30,000 skilled workers in phases over the next three years.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are going to allow qualified technical professionals, who may not have a graduate degree, they may be educated below the bachelor level, to allow them into Hong Kong to fill the gap," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But one criteria we have to uphold is these people - they must be young technical professionals. By young, we mean those aged at or under 35."
  <br>
  <br>
  Sun revealed the bureau came up with the projection after holding more than 170 consultation sessions with different industries.
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted the rapid development of AI and automation, saying that the labour shortfall would be worse without the help of technology.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An international rugby match will be held on Saturday as part of trial events to test the new Kai Tak Youth Sports Ground.
 <br>
  <br>
  The match from 4pm between Hong Kong and Brazil is the second test event at the 5,000-seat venue, following a local football league game there last month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sports Commissioner George Tsoi said more than 3,000 spectators are expected to attend the match – double the number at the football game.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So we will be progressively increasing the intensity as well as the scale of our test events in the different venues within the Kai Tak Sports Park," Tsoi said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will increase the number of participants each time."
  <br>
  <br>
  Tsoi added that authorities will make direction signs larger and install more gates with metal detectors at the venue.
  <br>
  <br>
  The commissioner also said the government plans to hold a trial event for an indoor venue at the park next month, and another in the 50,000-seat main stadium in January.
  <br>
  <br>
  James Farndon, the CEO of Hong Kong China Rugby, said Saturday's match will be more than just a trial run.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It also gives us a prime opportunity to build on our collaboration with all the local government stakeholders that we've been working with in recent months," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "From a Hong Kong China Rugby perspective, we get the opportunity to really utilise the event as a means to learn and test our event operations as we move towards the big event in March."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong Rugby Sevens will take place at Kai Tak Sports Park from 28-30 March.

    'Professionals need guidance on child abuse reports'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A child welfare organisation on Thursday urged the government to offer professionals guidance before a mandatory reporting mechanism for suspected child abuse comes into effect.
 <br>
  <br>
  Against Child Abuse (ACA) said it handled about 1,000 enquiries between April last year and March this year, of which 185 involved child abuse fears.
  <br>
  <br>
  The organisation said more than 15 percent of the enquiries were from professionals, such as teachers, social workers and doctors.
  <br>
  <br>
  ACA director Donna Wong said she expects the number of cases reported by professionals to gradually increase, as awareness has improved since Legco passed the Mandatory Reporting of Child Abuse Ordinance in July.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Wong said sufficient preparatory work must be carried out before the legislation comes into effect in 2026.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We hope that relevant support measures, such as the mandatory reporting guide, trainings for related professionals, the childcare residential placement, emergency placement and publicity education… will be well prepared in the 18-month transition period so that the mechanism will fully play its effectiveness,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under the legislation, professionals who fail to report abuse cases risk a three-month jail term and a HK$50,000 fine.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Legislators on Thursday said Hong Kong’s stock market operated as usual during the first session under a T8.
 <br>
  <br>
  The decades-long practice of shutting down the markets when there's severe weather was scrapped in September.
  <br>
  <br>
  Financial services sector lawmaker Robert Lee said no major incidents were seen during the morning trading session, but there was room for improvement regarding the use of physical cheques.
  <br>
  <br>
  “From the brokers' perspective a lot of them already have electronic payment methods with the exchange. However, for a lot of the ultimate end clients, they may not all have these electronic payment methods,” he told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I think in terms of physical cheques, that's something that the HKMA recognises as a form of payment. For some of these people that are having some difficulties with dealing with physical cheques, I think there's room for improvement.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Accountancy sector lawmaker Edmund Wong said the stock exchange and the finance sector were well-prepared for business under severe weather conditions, allowing the stock market to run smoothly.
  <br>
  <br>
  The stock market opened at 9.30am. The observatory downgraded the T8 to a T3 at 10.20am.

    HK to sign free trade agreement with Peru: CE

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee has confirmed that a free-trade agreement between Hong Kong and Peru will be signed this week.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lee arrived in Lima on Wednesday evening local time, ahead of the Apec Economic Leaders’ meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a Facebook entry, the CE said he was greeted at the airport by Peruvian energy minister Romulo Mucho Mamani and Chinese Ambassador to Peru Song Yang.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong began negotiating the pact with Peru in January 2023, with the agreement to cover goods and services, as well as investment and a dispute settlement mechanism. Talks concluded in July this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  This will be Hong Kong’s ninth free-trade agreement with the existing eight covering 20 economies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Apart from securing the much-anticipated trade pact, the SAR leader will also attend bilateral meetings with other Apec leaders and meet local business representatives in Lima.
  <br>
  <br>
  Peru is Hong Kong’s fifth-largest trading partner in Latin America and 46th globally. Merchandise trade between the two places totalled HK$5.2 billion last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee will return to Hong Kong next Tuesday.
