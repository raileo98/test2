    Lawmaker urges more flexible sports funding system

<img alt="Lawmaker Kenneth Fok (second right) says if billiard sports are downgraded to Tier B status, it may affect their development.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The city's sports sector lawmaker has called for more flexibility in the funding system for sports, and not just focus on Olympic and Asian Games participation when determining the city's three-tiered support mechanism.
 <br>
  <br>
  Kenneth Fok, who represents the sports, performing arts, culture and publication sector, said on Monday the global sports scene was evolving with events coming in and out in top-level international competitions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Are we just chasing Olympic and Asian Games medals or do we want more? Can we actually have our athletes shine in different international arenas and competitions too?" Fok questioned.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The system should allow for more flexibility, instead of just chasing the Olympic and Asian [Games] medals... The whole mechanism is now more rearward-facing. We're looking at past results only. It creates a system where you first get the results, and then you get the reward."
  <br>
  <br>
  Sports in Hong Kong are classified into three levels: Tier A*, Tier A, and Tier B, with those in the top tier like fencing and swimming being identified as ones with the potential to excel at the Olympics and athletes receiving the best resources.
  <br>
  <br>
  Those with a Tier A status are sports with athletes competing in previous Olympics or Asian Games, and are set to continue doing so. Athletes for such sports get funding for training programmes and dedicated coaching, among others.
  <br>
  <br>
  Support for athletes in the remaining tier depends on individual circumstances.
  <br>
  <br>
  But billiard sports do not meet the criteria of being included in enough Asian and Olympic games between 2010 and 2030, to pass for the Tier A level of support. As it stands, billiard sports are at risk of losing up to 80 percent of current funding.
  <br>
  <br>
  The lawmaker said the achievements of SAR snooker players should not be disregarded simply because they did not compete in the Olympics and Asian Games.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With the proven results of cue sports in Hong Kong, in terms of our athletes repeatedly gaining world championship status, that should be part of the equation too," Fok said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If [billiard sports] are demoted to Tier B, it will not just send a negative image on government support for cue sports despite their results, but it might also impair the ability...to deliver other objectives besides elite athletes."
  <br>
  <br>
  Vincent Law, chairman of the Billiard Sports Council of Hong Kong China, said it could happen as early as April next year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our hands are quite tied, because we have no influence on the policy-making part... But we, and our athletes, will keep doing our job, and we won't waste the resources that the government has given us," Law said.

    Taxi trade reps welcome cameras, e-payment plan

<img alt="A trade representative says the installation of CCTV cameras inside taxis is long overdue. Photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1782724_1_20241209165830.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Some taxi and transport trade representatives have reacted positively to the government's proposal to make the installation of surveillance cameras in cabs compulsory, saying it could help reduce quarrels between drivers and passengers.
 <br>
  <br>
  The government told the legislature on Monday that in the next two years, it wants to mandate the installation of CCTV cameras in taxi cabins, as well as dashcams and Global Positioning System, along with the provision of at least two electronic payment methods.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chow Kwok-keung, a former chairman of the Hong Kong Taxi and Public Light Bus Association, described the cameras plan as long overdue.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he said the government should offer financial assistance, saying the trade is going through tough times.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is like spring season arriving late. As for costs, you can find CCTV cameras in the market costing around HK$4,700, HK$5,000, or more than HK$7,000," he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But we're a bit disappointed that it seems the government won't be subsidising the camera installations at all. So we feel a bit unhappy."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chow said e-payment is clearly the trend moving forward and the industry has to bear the responsibility to provide the systems needed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Transport sector lawmaker Frankie Yick, of the Liberal Party, also welcomed the proposals, noting that the use of CCTV cameras inside taxis is something he has called for for many years.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said drivers actually want the cameras to protect themselves, as they're now subject to a points-deduction system that can lead to a licence suspension for malpractice.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yick said some drivers have encountered instances of passengers accusing them of engaging in wrongdoing, and cameras could help all sides.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also brushed aside any privacy concerns.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I've checked with the privacy commissioner, and I have got positive answers. Because inside the cab, it's not a private environment, it's semi-private, so you have to know that it's not a closed situation," the lawmaker told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And I think the most important thing is to make sure that the passenger is well-aware that the [CCTV] system is on."
  <br>
  <br>
  As for e-payments, Yick said he has come across instances where taxi owners have installed an e-payment system, but the drivers didn't want to use them and so kept them away from passengers.
  <br>
  <br>
  He expressed the hope that making the systems mandatory would "help Hong Kong's reputation".

    Ex-lawmaker Chim Pui-chung, son convicted of fraud

<img alt="The District Court found former lawmaker Chim Pui-chung and his son guilty of conspiracy to defraud. File photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1782721_1_20241209160826.jpg&q=70">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Former lawmaker Chim Pui-chung and his son were on Monday found guilty of conspiracy to defraud more than HK$42 million in transactions linked to a listed company.
 <br>
  <br>
  The District Court ruled that Chim, who was the largest shareholder of Asia Resources, and his son Ricky Chim, who was the chairman, conspired with mainland businessman Ma Zhonghong to defraud the company, its board and shareholders between July 2013 and November 2015.
  <br>
  <br>
  The case involved the issuance of convertible notes to increase the company's share capital while concealing a secret "shell company" agreement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ma had agreed to pay the ex-lawmaker HK$210 million for 70 to 75 percent of Asia Resources' issued shares.
  <br>
  <br>
  His associate and businesswoman, Wong Poe-lai, was convicted of money laundering in connection with the case.
  <br>
  <br>
  A judge in 2022 issued an arrest warrant for Ma who failed to report to the police and appear in court.
  <br>
  <br>
  In his written judgement, Judge Ernest Lin cited evidence found by the ICAC in Chim's office in 2018, which revealed the former lawmaker as the mastermind behind the shareholding control scheme.
  <br>
  <br>
  The financial transactions were found to be unusually complex and "could not possibly be considered normal business activities", which were believed to hide the identities of those involved, the judge added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lin said the elder Chim also made use of his influence to arrange for his son to become the firm’s chairman and executive director and orchestrate transactions.
  <br>
  <br>
  The judge criticised the pair for treating the listed company as private property, harming both Asia Resources and its shareholders.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The victims were not only Asia Resources but also the company's small shareholders, who were denied both the option of a mandatory takeover offer and saw their personal investments turned into tools for others' profit-making," Lin wrote in the judgement.
  <br>
  <br>
  While shell company acquisitions aren't illegal, their actions prevented the board from protecting shareholders' interests, Lin noted.
  <br>
  <br>
  All three defendants were remanded in custody until sentencing next month.

    Privacy breaches spark fraud alert for jobseekers

<img alt="The Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data carried out investigations into JobsDB and eight organisations that placed 'blind ads', where the identity of those behind the post is not clear. File photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1782705_2_20241209161751.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Swindlers could be harvesting the personal information of jobseekers to commit fraud, a watchdog warned on Monday, after it found privacy breaches involving online job adverts.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data (PCPD) said it carried out an investigation into JobsDB and eight organisations that used the platform to post "blind ads" – where the identity of those said to be recruiting isn't clear.
  <br>
  <br>
  "All of the eight organisations that placed the aforesaid blind ads on JobsDB and requested job applicants to submit their personal data to unknown recruiting companies and JobsDB that published the same on its platform were involved in the unfair collection of the job applicants’ personal data, and this constituted contraventions of... the PDPO [Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance]," the watchdog said.
  <br>
  <br>
  It added that it has therefore served enforcement notices on JobsDB and three of the organisations, ordering them to take measures to remedy the contraventions and prevent them from happening again. The other five organisations have been sent advisory notices.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hermina Ng, PCPD's senior legal counsel, said the eight organisations involved businesses in areas including financial securities, apparel retail, Chinese medicine and transport services. But she also warned that some online job adverts may not be legitimate.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The privacy commissioner would also like to call upon other operators of online recruitment platforms to beware of anyone using blind ads to perpetrate fraud or collect personal data by unfair means and to carefully review recruitment advertisements to identify blind ads and avoid publishing the same in order to protect the personal data privacy of members of the public," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Blind ads may be used as an unscrupulous means to collect personal data and may be misused by swindlers to collect personal data for fraudulent activities. When jobseekers are unable to ascertain the employers’ identities, they should check and verify the information contained in the blind ads carefully and should not respond to the blind ads arbitrarily and submit their personal data."
  <br>
  <br>
  Ng also urged employers to increase transparency when placing recruitment adverts, by disclosing their identity.

    Govt dept gets enforcement notice over Covid data leak

<img alt="Earlier this year a data leak was reported involving some 17,000 public housing tenants who underwent mandatory Covid tests in 2022. Photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1782702_1_20241209135743.jpg&q=65">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A government department failed to take adequate measures to protect the personal data of thousands of people ordered to undergo Covid tests back in 2022 and which was later found to be freely available online, the privacy commissioner's office said on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  In April this year the watchdog alerted officials to the fact that information including names, phone numbers, ID card numbers, addresses and Covid vaccination status of more than 17,000 public housing tenants was accessible online, without the need for any account or password.
  <br>
  <br>
  The blunder, by the Electrical and Mechanical Services Department (EMSD), was made public a few days later.
  <br>
  <br>
  During an investigation by the watchdog, the department said that given it had stopped using the services of the e-form platform involved in the breach, it wrongly believed the personal data in question had been automatically deleted.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was only when EMSD became aware of the incident on 30 April 2024 that it requested the contractor to remove the personal data involved," said Hermina Ng, senior legal counsel for the privacy commissioner's office.
  <br>
  <br>
  The watchdog said the department had a lack of written policies on the retention of personal data, had failed to take the initiative to get the information deleted, and didn't follow up the issue with the e-form platform.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The EMSD merely assumed that the contractor would act on its own volition after the expiry of the contract. The EMSD had never urged, checked or reminded the contractor to delete the personal data from the e-form platform, and had never sought to understand or monitor the progress or effectiveness of the contractor’s relevant actions," the office said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The EMSD, as the data user, should not merely await passively for the contractor to take action, nor should it ride on its trust in the contractor and not to verify the work done by the contractor. This is another obvious deficiency."
  <br>
  <br>
  The privacy watchdog concluded that the EMSD failed to ensure the data collected was kept only for as long as necessary, and that it didn't safeguard the personal information from unauthorised or accidental access.
  <br>
  <br>
  Privacy Commissioner Ada Chung said an enforcement notice has been issued to the EMSD, directing it to take measures to remedy the violations and prevent similar situations from happening again in future.

    Govt to mandate cameras and e-payments for cabs

File photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1782694_1_20241209130644.jpg&q=70">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Transport officials on Monday said they plan to require taxi drivers to install surveillance cameras inside their vehicles by the end of 2026, and provide electronic payment methods by the end of next year.
 <br>
  <br>
  On top of that, drivers would also be required by law to install dashcams and Global Positioning Systems, to monitor their behaviour and collect data to help with investigations by law enforcement officials.
  <br>
  <br>
  In documents submitted to the legislature, transport officials said in the past year or so, lawmakers, taxi trade representatives and some members of the public had all said they want the installation of CCTV cameras in the vehicle cabins.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This can record the situation inside the cabin. If disputes arise between taxi drivers and passengers, the footage can become evidence for the police or the Transport Department to follow up on the complaints, and investigate suspected malpractices such as overcharging and refusing a hire," the Transport and Logistics Bureau said.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said drivers would be allowed to pick their own devices, which would be properly sealed to guard against tampering, and data collected must be encrypted and only kept for 30 days.
  <br>
  <br>
  The information would only be transferred to a planned Transport Department central platform when complaints arise or if there was an accident.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials stressed they attach great importance to privacy protection, and would contact the privacy commissioner to discuss guidelines on handling the data and offering training to drivers.
  <br>
  <br>
  On payment methods, the bureau said there are still plenty of drivers who only take cash, and this can easily cause disputes as passengers, especially tourists, find this very inconvenient.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials proposed that drivers provide at least two types of electronic payment methods.
  <br>
  <br>
  They said while this might create extra costs for drivers, there are plenty of such platforms which offer promotions, such exempting device charges or handling fees.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bureau said it plans to table legal amendments for the proposals in the second quarter of next year.

    Streetathon organiser says instructions could improve

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The organiser of Hong Kong Streetathon has admitted that instructions could have been clearer after some half-marathon runners went miles out of their way in Sunday’s event.
 <br>
  <br>
  Both the half-marathon and full marathon started near the East Coast Park in Causeway Bay and finished at San Shan Road in To Kwa Wan. But half-marathon runners did not have to go through the Tseung Lam Highway.
  <br>
  <br>
  Andes Leung, CEO and co-founder of RunOurCity Foundation, said around 20 to 30 half-marathon runners accidentally entered the Tseung Kwan O–Lam Tin Tunnel when they should have turned right.
  <br>
  <br>
  Leung told an RTHK programme on Monday that while the signs were set up correctly, staff could have taken more initiative to instruct runners where to go.

  "I'm not saying the organiser can't improve. I think the staff could have been more proactive. They could have reminded runners, face-to-face, that full marathon runners should go straight ahead, while half-marathon runners should turn right. That would have been better," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Leung added that staff training will be improved to prevent similar issues from happening again.

 When Fok Mei-ling's son was born in 1991, he was diagnosed with Spinal Muscular Atrophy - a rare genetic disorder. She was told he may not live past his first birthday.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Eating was not possible, movement was not possible, and of course, breathing, because all voluntary muscles are affected. But I didn't quit," Fok said.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 1998, Fok started the charity, FSMA - Families of SMA Foundation - after she found out that the disease need not be fatal given proper and aggressive medical intervention.
  <br>
  <br>
  And her son is living proof. He is now 33-years-old.
  <br>
  <br>
  FSMA is one of the 11 beneficiaries of this year's Operation Santa Claus (OSC), an annual charity campaign holding fundraising projects for over 35 years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fok, the charity's founder and chairperson, says they aim to relieve hardship and suffering faced by SMA patients and their families, and also raise awareness about SMA diseases.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We do donate medical equipment, wheelchairs and bespoke baby buggies. We also give them free high nutritional supplements because these are very expensive," Fok said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We also lately have the drug delivery program... and we also offer some emergency home help service, part-time for parents who need some help at home."
  <br>
  <br>
  Fok said she hoped more SMA patients could receive assistance.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[There] is also an important project. It's called Mercy Medical Management. We send a multi-disciplinary medical team with the doctor on Zoom, registered nurses, technicians with medical equipment to go and do the tests."
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is the programme exactly that Operation Santa Claus will help so that we can increase the number of patients that we help who are technology dependent for their survival," she said.

    3D scans of Notre Dame aid restoration efforts

<img alt="First mass open to the public at the Notre-Dame de Paris Cathedral, five-and-a-half years after a fire ravaged the Gothic masterpiece. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1782660_1_20241209090420.jpg&q=45">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An architect in Hong Kong says laser scanning of Paris' famous Notre Dame Cathedral, carried out by late art historian Andrew Tallon, played a crucial role in the restoration of the Gothic gem.
 <br>
  <br>
  The more than 850-year-old cathedral has finally reopened its doors after it was partially destroyed by a fire in 2019.
  <br>
  <br>
  Most of the timber roof and the structure's spire were ravaged by the flames.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yu Ka-sing, Associate Professor of Practice at the Faculty of Architecture from the University of Hong Kong told RTHK that Tallon's scans of the interior and exterior of the cathedral conducted before the blaze provided basic information for the restoration team to start with.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Basically, it is the process that can allow the site to create a digital twin of the historic building by collecting a range of geospatial information," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yu noted that the Emperor Qinshihuang's Mausoleum Site Museum in China cooperated with France on the restoration, and its deputy director Zhou Ping paid a visit to France earlier this year to gain a better understanding of the restoration process.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the international heritage conservation aspect, both France and China are of the highest levels," said Yu.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And also given the fact that the Emperor Qinshihuang's Mausoleum [Site Museum] has also got many burned timber debris, so sharing some similarity with Notre Dame, the two sites have some good knowledge for exchange."
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite rolling out the red carpet to the public, the 700-million euro restoration project has yet to be completed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tasks, such as the restoration of the chevet and sacristy, as well as the installation of stained glass windows will continue.

    HK Streetathon ends with some going the extra mile

<img alt="The Hong Kong Streetathon featured a full marathon around Victoria Harbour, a cross-harbour half marathon, and a 10km race from Tseung Kwan O to Kwun Tong. Photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1782615_1_20241208180257.jpg&q=30">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Nearly 17,000 runners took part in this year's Hong Kong Streetathon on Sunday, but some unintentionally went further than the standard distance during one of the races.
 <br>
  <br>
  The full marathon around Victoria Harbour kicked off the races early this morning under chilly weather, as temperatures dipped to their lowest so far this winter at 16 degrees Celsius.
  <br>
  <br>
  The day also featured a cross-harbour half marathon and a 10km race from Tseung Kwan O to Kwun Tong.
  <br>
  <br>
  For the first time, local delicacies were dished out to runners as part of what's being dubbed a "Five-senses Marathon".
  <br>
  <br>
  Music and fragrance diffusers also featured along parts of the route.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tiffany, a 10km race participant, said she was delighted there was poon choi, a communal dish of foods served in layers which is often eaten on festive occasions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There was a band performing along the way to cheer us up, and someone gave me a high-five. There was also something to eat – poon choi with mushrooms. That could give runners a boost," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  For Patsy, a runner who's visually impaired, the route this time around was a bit different than last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I wanted to challenge myself and see what I was capable of. The most important thing was that I had a guide who took good care of me and encouraged me," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the 21-kilometre half marathon saw some runners go an extra nine kilometres due to unclear instructions.
  <br>
  <br>
  James, who was among those who ran the additional stretch, said he was unable to see where to go during part of the route.
  <br>
  <br>
  “There were traffic cones and a bunch of staff members. We couldn't see any of the signs at all," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If only one or two runners could not see the signs, then it could be their problem. But when you had more than 10 people go the wrong way, would it be an issue with the organisers?"
  <br>
  <br>
  Organisers said they were looking into the incident to see whether there was human error involved.
  <br>
  <br>
  Almost all of the runners who showed up finished the race, organisers said, with more than 3,000 coming from overseas.
  <br>
  <br>
  Four participants were hospitalised, while 110 others suffered minor injuries.

    Hong Kong corals in healthy condition: AFCD

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) on Sunday said Hong Kong's coral reefs are generally healthy, although bleaching was observed during summer this year.
 <br>
  <br>
  The department, along with the non-profit Reef Check Foundation, conducted its five-month review of local corals from June at 33 sites of ecological importance, which included nine marine parks.
  <br>
  <br>
  It found that coral coverage at the sites ranged from 12.8 percent to 75.1 percent, with the highest coverage recorded at Hoi Ha Wan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eleven sites had more than 50 percent coral coverage, in which five of them were marine parks.
  <br>
  <br>
  The average health index of corals across all sites was 3.95, which is above the general average of three.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the AFCD said large-scale coral bleaching reappeared after it last occurred in 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The department has engaged a group of local coral and marine science experts to consult with and gather their views on conserving corals in Hong Kong, and to explore future directions of relevant research and conservation work, such as identification and enhancement of monitoring for the key environmental factors associated with coral bleaching as well as devising research projects for alleviating the impact of coral bleaching in the local environment," an AFCD spokesman said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said corals which saw the most bleaching were recovering due to the influx of cooler waters from last month.
  <br>
  <br>
  The results also indicated there were no signs destructive fishing practices, but abandoned nets were found at 12 sites.
  <br>
  <br>
  The department said the impact was low and the netting would be removed.

    Officials optimistic about tourism sector this month

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Tourism officials on Sunday expressed optimism the industry would enjoy a merry festive period this year, in part because of the boost by the resumption of the multi-entry permit scheme for Shenzhen residents.
 <br>
  <br>
  The new tourism minister, Rosanna Law, said Saturday saw some 145,000 visitor arrivals from the mainland, nearly 30 percent more than the daily average for November.
  <br>
  <br>
  Law believed this was due to last Sunday's resumption of multi-entry permits for Shenzhen residents, saying various sectors should seize the opportunities brought by these visitors.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have so many tourists coming in so let's work together and show a smile," Law told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We've heard mainland travellers saying in interviews that we are smiling more and that our Mandarin has improved. I hope this will continue. It's important to keep an open mind and think of ways to make good use of business opportunities."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Travel Industry Council, meanwhile, said it expects overall tourist arrivals year-on-year to rise by five to 10 percent this month, citing the visa scheme change and a series of upcoming events.
  <br>
  <br>
  "December is also our peak tourist season, with many winter promotional events organised by the Tourism Board taking place. We are very confident there'll be more visitors this December, compared to previous [years]," the council's chairwoman, Gianna Hsu, told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The launch of the Kai Tak Sports Park, the commencement of the airport's three-runway system, and the official debut of giant pandas, also encourages more tourists to come and see the cityscape of Hong Kong."
  <br>
  <br>
  The council and a number of tourism sector groups called on the industry to reinforce Hong Kong's brand as a hospitable destination.

    People flock to Ocean Park for An An and Ke Ke debut

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Panda enthusiasts gathered at Ocean Park on Sunday to get a sight of An An and Ke Ke, as the two pandas gifted by Beijing made their public debut today.
 <br>
  <br>
  Kamy Yeung, who has been following the news about the animals, told RTHK that it is a great day to give the pandas a big welcome.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I happen to be seeing them eating breakfast in the morning... and it’s quite nice to see them being lively and smiley. It’s nice to see all the enthusiasm from everyone around the world to celebrate the joy at the park,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Singapore tourist Rachel Wang spent around HK$1,100 on panda souvenirs. She said she finds An An adorable.
  <br>
  <br>
  “He’s so active, but having seen the pandas, I think Ke Ke is very demure and very loveable. I’m really excited and I love pandas to start with... actually I want to be a panda as well after seeing them,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Anthony Mezzatesta from the United States said he woke up early just to see the pandas.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I like the girl panda a little bit more, she seemed a little bit more shy, very cute to see her get all nervous seeing a bunch of people. We queued up at around 9am. I was very excited to see the pandas. I woke up at six in the morning ready to go to Ocean Park to see the pandas,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The theme park has implemented dispersion measures, in which around 100 tickets are given out every 15 minutes. Each visitor is only allowed to stay in the area for 10 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Following the debut of An An and Ke Ke, the new panda twins will greet the public in the first quarter next year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Also on Sunday, the new tourism minister, Rosanna Law, said the panda naming competition had allowed the public to participate in a meaningful way.
  <br>
  <br>
  Law said the winner of the competition, which received some 20,000 entries, had given good reasons why the original names should be kept.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister described the names as approachable adding it was good there was no need to change them.

    'No worries over undersubscribed bonds'

<div class="itemFullText">
 The finance chief on Sunday said there is no need for concern after the latest offering of retail infrastructure bonds, totalling HK$20 billion, fell short of its target.
 <br>
  <br>
  Around 128,000 investors signed up for the bonds during the offering period that ended on Friday, with the final issuance size expected to be around HK$17.8 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  On a Commercial Radio programme on Sunday, Financial Secretary Paul Chan said people should not worry about the undersubscription of the latest round of bonds.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Institutional investors have oversubscribed for the bonds by three or four times, so we don't have to worry about the amount raised from bonds this year," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Currently there are many investment options. We can also see that in future, many high-quality companies will come to Hong Kong to list, so the investment market will be vibrant."
  <br>
  <br>
  The government previously told lawmakers that it had doubled its estimated deficit for the current financial year to around HK$100 billion, from its forecast of a little more than HK$48 billion announced in February's budget.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said it might take some time for the government to achieve a fiscal balance, but cautioned the process should not be done too quickly.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We believe it will take several years to achieve a fiscal balance," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We've spoken to credit rating agencies and they agreed that major economies have been experiencing financial deficits during the pandemic. They're against achieving a fiscal balance aggressively and within a short period of time, such as one or two years, by significantly cutting spending. This would not only hurt people's livelihoods, but would also cause the economy to contract, which is counterproductive."
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, the finance chief said on his weekly blog that the government is committed to coordinating different mega events to "achieve maximum synergy".
  <br>
  <br>
  Over the past two weeks, Hong Kong has held a number of fashion and design events.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said designers and entrepreneurs from all over the world that have come to Hong Kong for large-scale international arts and culture galas "highly recognised" the capability of the SAR in curating and coordinating such events.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added these events allowed people in the arts and creative industries to more easily reach out to potential partners.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Housing chief Winnie Ho said officials could reward informants who alert authorities to poor quality sub-divided units (SDUs), when the flats are subject to a future regulatory regime.
 <br>
  <br>
  The government is now collecting public views on its proposal to require each SDU to be no less than less than eight square metres in size, or 86 square feet, as well as having features like at least one window and an individual toilet.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials propose that landlords who violate the requirements in future could be subject to a maximum three-year jail term.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho said the reward system might be needed to dig out "hidden" sub-standard flats, but she stressed officials are also gauging public views over the matter.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister said the public has seen the proposed standards and finds them reasonable, and she described the penalty as rather heavy.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We hope that everyone won't have to wait until informant and reward systems - that everyone agrees to follow the new rules, register the flats," she said on a TVB programme that aired on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We'll see how effective the new system is - and we'll see if we need to offer rewards, in addition to the regular reporting system."
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho added that the Rating and Valuation Department has received two complaints so far from sub-divided flat tenants who said they were forced out by landlords because of the proposed regime, and officials will handle different complaints regarding rental issues.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The two giant pandas gifted to Hong Kong by the central government will retain their original names, An An and Ke Ke, which symbolise peace, stability, and endless possibilities for the future of the SAR.
 <br>
  <br>
  The government and Ocean Park organised a naming competition in October for these national treasures, and received over 22,600 suggestions.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a greeting ceremony at Ocean Park on Saturday, it was announced that the judges had selected the suggestion to keep the original names of the five-year-old pandas, as the Chinese pronunciation of "An" and "Ke" together resembles the word "encore," symbolising ongoing good fortune for Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think it is so meaningful. There is more of a sense of belonging by keeping their original names," said a woman surnamed To.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another woman surnamed Li said she fears people might confuse the new An An with the previous panda of the same name, who passed away in 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think it's fine, but some people might think of the old An An. That An An lived in Hong Kong for a very long time, so we were really sad when he passed away. It should be fine to reuse the name because the new panda is used to this name anyway. It should help him adjust a lot easier," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  During his speech at the ceremony, Chief Executive John Lee said he is ecstatic for the pair to officially meet the public on Sunday, adding that the pandas will serve as tourism ambassadors for both the nation and Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This initiative aims to create a panda craze across the city and bring giant pandas to different corners of Hong Kong," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The government will continue to seize the opportunities presented by the giant pandas, actively collaborating with various sectors to organise more related activities and launch locally themed panda products, providing visitors with a unique panda experience and boosting Hong Kong's tourism and retail industries."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee also said that the giant pandas exemplify the nation's successful conservation efforts, and he affirmed that the SAR is dedicated to collaborating with experts from the mainland to advance panda conservation initiatives.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The government will work with Ocean Park to advance panda conservation and outreach efforts. Various educational activities will be organised to allow more friends from both local and international communities to learn about the achievements and strengths of the nation and Hong Kong in conservation, reversing the trends of species extinction, and promoting biodiversity," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee added that Hong Kong is home to the largest number of giant pandas outside the mainland, with a total of six, including also Ying Ying, Le Le and their newborn twins.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, many people also gathered in Tsim Sha Tsui to take photos with the 2,500 giant panda sculptures in the first stop of the "Panda Go! Fest HK" exhibition.

    'Tai Lam Tunnel fee adjustment plans are balanced'

<img alt="Transport chief Mable Chan says the bureau is actively improving transport facilities that connect to the Tai Lam Tunnel. Photo courtesy of Mable Chan's blog" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1782506_2_20241209083606.jpg&q=65">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 New transport chief Mable Chan said on Saturday that further fee reductions at the Tai Lam Tunnel are not possible, as additional vehicle flow will lead to congestion during peak hours.
 <br>
  <br>
  Writing on her blog, she said the bureau is actively improving transport facilities that connect to the tunnel, to ensure the takeover can be executed smoothly.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government announced on Thursday it plans to charge time-varying tolls for the Tai Lam Tunnel after it takes control of the infrastructure in the New Territories on May 31 next year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Instead of the present fixed toll of HK$58, private vehicles would pay HK$45 during peak hours, HK$30 during normal hours, and HK$18 during non-peak hours.
  <br>
  <br>
  As for commercial vehicles – tolls are down from current level of between HK$64 and HK$79 to HK$43 throughout the day.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said the time-varying tolls, in which vehicles will pay different fees according to "peak", "normal" and "non-peak" hours, mean the fees for all vehicle types will be largely reduced, with "non-peak" hour fees set at the lowest possible price.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Road pricing is an important transport management measure to regulate vehicular flow. Tai Lam Tunnel, including its control areas, is 10 kilometres long, which is the length of five Tsing Ma Bridges. The maintenance cost is not low," she wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Tunnels are an important asset of the government. We have to abide by our strict fiscal discipline, and uphold the users pay principle," she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said the plans will help the tunnel reach its full capacity.

    Pokémon Go trainers embark on city safari in HK

<div class="itemFullText">
 Pokémon enthusiasts from around the world are in Hong Kong for the city's inaugural "Pokémon Go City Safari" event, where the popular mobile app will take users to landmarks and historic places in the SAR.
 <br>
  <br>
  Niantic, the game's creators, said the two-day event that started on Saturday is meant to immerse both locals and tourists in the city's rich culture and architecture, while enjoying the augmented reality game.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lisa Broadwell, from Sweden, has been playing the game since 2019, and she said these events are ideal for those who enjoy discovering new cities in unique and innovative ways.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I like the walk and catch aspect of Pokémon Go so this event seemed perfect to able to walk around, see things and just be walking and catching and seeing the sites as I go along. It fits my style of playing," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're still a bit jet-lagged. We came from America, came from Las Vegas. It was a 15 and a half hours flight, so we're still trying to get our bearings of where we are or what we are doing," said Jim Haughey, who often travels for these events.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elaine Hui, director of APAC regional marketing at Niantic, said Hong Kong's unique qualities made it stand out when they were selecting a venue.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We need to find a city that is really easy to travel, and I think Hong Kong has that quality. On the other hand, we want to have something special for this city, and Hong Kong has that quality, too," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They have East and West. They have very new, tall buildings, very iconic buildings, but they also have neighbourhoods, which are a little bit older, but with a lot of history. That's why we think Hong Kong is a good place."

    Subdivided tenants' rights protected by law: minister

<img alt="Housing minister Winnie Ho stressed that the basic housing unit policy is not yet finalised. Photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1782497_1_20241207130131.jpg&q=40">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Housing minister Winnie Ho said on Saturday the Rating and Valuation Department has received two complaints of landlords forcing tenants of subdivided units to move out so they can be renovated to meet government requirements.
 <br>
  <br>
  In his policy address in October, Chief Executive John Lee outlined plans to replace substandard subdivided units with so-called "basic housing units". These must be no less than 8 square metres, or 86 square feet, and have an individual toilet and at least one window.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on an RTHK programme, Ho said tenants' rights are protected under the law.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Tenant's security of tenure is protected. The tenancy contract is regulated for two years plus an additional two years. If water and electricity bills are separate, landlords are not allowed to overcharge for them. The tenant's fees for these services cannot be higher than the service charges that the landlord pays to water and electricity companies," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho stressed that the basic housing unit policy is still under consultation, and further adjustments may be made before the bill is tabled at the Legislative Council.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, Ho said the decision to have the South Island Line (West) adopt the smart transit system cut six years from the construction time, allowing the government to advance the redevelopment of Wah Fu public housing estate.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government announced on Friday that the estate's last remaining residents now have to leave by 2034/35, six years ahead of schedule.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Yesterday the transport chief announced that the railway will use the Smart and Green Mass Transit System, rather than an underground heavy rail system. The green system, which runs above ground, will save almost six years," Ho said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We originally set aside land in the estate for an underground station... and could only move residents after the station was built. But now that land is freed up, and we can put up buildings immediately, speeding up the redevelopment," she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government announcement also laid out clearance and rehousing arrangements for the first phase of the redevelopment of Choi Hung Estate. Residents of Pik Hoi House, Kam Pik House and Tan Fung House will need to move out before April 2029.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho said redevelopment decisions are made according to the condition of the estate and its urgency.
  <br>
  <br>
  She added that the government is yet to discuss building heights, plot ratios and road networks of the redeveloped Choi Hung estate.

    Stress tests to tweak Kai Tak transport links

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The SAR's new transport minister vowed on Saturday to ensure that the new Kai Tak Sports Park's transport links is capable of meeting every possible eventuality.
 <br>
  <br>
  The arena and sports ground will host a stress test involving 12,000 people on Sunday as the bureau assesses the facility's readiness for large events.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters after attending a radio programme, Mable Chan, who took office on Thursday, said the tests are intended to ensure that the preparation work at the park is completed.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Apart from us, the various transport operators including the MTR, buses, and taxis will be involved. We hope that through the various stress tests, we will step up our mobilisation, our preparation, and make ourselves better prepared for different scenarios," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So when the sports park is commissioned, we will have a better and holistic preparation to cater for different scenarios, and give our best to make this (a) success and give the best service to locals and visitors," she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Chan said the bureau will adopt a two-pronged approach to meet the public's expectations.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said it would adopt new technologies and would also strive to have an innovative mindset.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said the contractor for the Northern Link project will be finalised next year - depending on the final arrangements and designs.
  <br>
  <br>
  As for the "smart and green" mass transit system to be used in Kai Tak and East Kowloon, Chan said the bureau had received more than 30 expressions of interest from local, mainland and overseas companies.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said the government will hold a tender next year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan stressed that the new system can serve as a medium capacity transport linking the public with conventional rail systems, even though it won't have the passenger capacity of traditional heavy networks.
  <br>
  <br>
  She also said the government will monitor fare levels for the new systems.

    Aberdeen blaze put out after almost five hours

<div class="itemFullText">
 The No. 3 alarm fire in Aberdeen was put out at 8.55pm on Friday, almost five hours after it started.
 <br>
  <br>
  Officials said the blaze broke out at a shipyard on Shum Wan Road at 4.11pm, and was upgraded to a No. 3 alarm around 30 minutes later.
  <br>
  <br>
  Firefighters pointed out that because many of the vessels under repair at the shipyard were fibreglass boats, that exacerbated the spread of the fire.
  <br>
  <br>
  They added that the sheer size of the shipyard also made it difficult to bring the fire under control.
  <br>
  <br>
  Over 220 firefighters and rescue workers were brought in to fight the blaze.
  <br>
  <br>
  Four fire boat monitors, four jets and breathing apparatus teams were also deployed.
  <br>
  <br>
  61 people had to be evacuated, but no injuries were reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  A woman surnamed Lau, who owns a shipyard in the area, said she suffered major losses as a result of the fire.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Of course I am very sad. How would you feel if you lost everything in less than an hour? How would you feel?"
  <br>
  <br>
  A man surnamed Cheung, whose shipyard was unscathed, said the situation could’ve been worse if the fire broke out at night.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The only positive thing is that the fire broke out in the afternoon. If it had been now, at night… this place wouldn't be saved in time," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "At night time, everybody would have left the shipyard, and it would be too late to call the police."
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials said they're still probing the cause of the fire.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Customs officers on Friday issued a warning about a stress-relieving toy that comes with a syringe, urging shops to remove the item from their shelves immediately.
 <br>
  <br>
  Officers said the toy could hurt children and parents should stop their kids from playing with it right away.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, authorities said they inspected toy shops across Hong Kong after receiving a complaint, but have not found anything so far.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Customs will continue to closely monitor the market situation and step up patrols. If found, the department will take resolute enforcement action," the statement read.
  <br>
  <br>
  A video circulating online shows a person using a syringe to inflate a mini baby doll, creating a bubble effect.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Chief Executive has appointed Kennedy Wong as the chairman of the Council of the Baptist University (HKBU), and Michael Ngai as the head of the City University (CityU) Council.
 <br>
  <br>
  John Lee has also reappointed Lam Tai-fai as the chairman of the Polytechnic University (PolyU) Council.
  <br>
  <br>
  The appointments will take effect from January 1, for a term of three years.
  <br>
  <br>
  "HKBU, CityU and PolyU are important assets of Hong Kong, providing constant impetus for Hong Kong's development into an international post-secondary education hub, and commanding high expectations from the government and the public," the CE, who's the chancellor of these universities, said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The new appointees are all prominent leaders in society. They have been dedicated to serving the community in different fields over the years. They possess outstanding capabilities and rich experience, and have made remarkable contributions to Hong Kong's education sector."

 At least nine people were evacuated over a fire in Aberdeen on Friday afternoon.
 <br>
  <br>
  The fire broke out at a shipyard on Shum Wan Road at around 4.10pm, and was upgraded to a No 3 alarm half an hour later.
  <br>
  <br>
  At least three jets as well as two breathing apparatus teams were deployed to the scene.
  <br>
  <br>
  Videos circulating online showed large plumes of thick smoke billowing into the sky.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Members of the public who are being affected by the smoke and an unusual odour carried by the wind are advised to close their doors and windows and stay calm," the Fire Services Department said.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The High Court on Friday rejected a bid by an inmate jailed for inciting secession to challenge the authorities' decision denying him early release under the city's homegrown national security law.
 <br>
  <br>
  Ma Chun-man, also known as “Captain America 2.0” for dressing up as the comic book character at anti-government protests in 2019, was jailed for five years for promoting “Hong Kong independence”.
  <br>
  <br>
  After serving two-thirds of his sentence in March, Ma was denied an early release normally granted for good behaviour in prison, in line with the provisions of Article 23 national security legislation.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Commissioner of Correctional Services made the decision two days after the new security law took effect, saying he was "not satisfied that an early release of the prisoner will not be contrary to the interests of national security".
  <br>
  <br>
  Ma filed a judicial review, arguing it was unfair and that the commissioner should have taken into account his “legitimate expectation” for early release.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a written judgement handed down on Friday, judge Alex Lee ruled that the commissioner's decision was a "holistic, predictive and evaluative exercise based on a consideration of all the relevant factors".
  <br>
  <br>
  Ma also failed to explain how his "legitimate expectation" of an early release would affect the national security assessment, the judge added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I am unable to see how the fact that a prisoner based on the past practice of the CSD [Correctional Services Department] has a 'legitimate expectation' for early release may either increase or reduce the national security risk that might arise from his or her early release," Lee wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ruling means Ma will need to serve his full term until November next year.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The last remaining residents of the Wah Fu public housing estate in Pok Fu Lam that is set to be redeveloped will have to leave their homes several years earlier than envisaged, with officials planning to bring forward the third and final clearance and rehousing phase of the project.
 <br>
  <br>
  Tenants of Wah Chui House and Wah King House were originally expected to have vacated their homes by 2040/41, but the new plan announced on Friday is for these units to be empty by 2034/35.
  <br>
  <br>
  The residents involved will be able to move into the first buildings finished at the new Wah Fu Estate, Housing Authority officials said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The first clearance phase, involving five other blocks, is still set to take place between 2026 and 2030 at the latest and the second phase, covering 11 blocks, is to be carried out by 2030/31.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials said they can bring the third phase forward thanks to the government’s decision to use a "smart and green mass transit system" for the future South Island Line (West), instead of the heavy rail project originally planned. This change will allow sites at the estate to be freed up sooner.
  <br>
  <br>
  The estate, next to Waterfall Bay, was built in 1967 and the 18 blocks are home to some 9,000 households.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, officials also announced clearance and rehousing arrangements for the first phase of the redevelopment of Choi Hung Estate.
  <br>
  <br>
  They said residents of Pik Hoi House, Kam Pik House and Tan Fung House will need to move out before April 2029.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elderly tenants affected can apply to live in blocks scheduled for redevelopment in the second or third phase of the project, officials said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Choi Hung Estate, with its 11 blocks, was built in the 1960s. It is home to about 17,500 people.

    More subsidised dental services on the way
   </title>

<img alt="" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1782399_1_20241206163049.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Friday said it will roll out a series of projects to help people access dental services, with a focus on those most in need.
 <br>
  <br>
  This came after the Working Group on Oral Health and Dental Care suggested in a report that the administration should strengthen dental care for grassroots residents.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under the Primary Dental Co-care Pilot Scheme to be implemented in the first quarter of next year, the government will provide a subsidy of HK$200 for those aged 13 to 17 to access services such as teeth assessment and scaling in the private sector.
  <br>
  <br>
  Clinics can set their own fees, but these must be transparent. Around 370,000 teenagers are predicted to benefit from the scheme each year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, from the second quarter of next year, people with financial difficulties can enrol in the Community Dental Support Programme to get subsidised services such as check-ups, fillings, tooth extraction and painkillers from non-profit organisations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Those who do not have to pay for medical expenses will be fully subsidised by the government.
  <br>
  <br>
  Patients approved by the Hospital Authority to have their medical fees partly waived, living allowance recipients aged 65 to 74, and people with a referral from social workers will only have to pay around 10 percent of the fees involved.
  <br>
  <br>
  At least 40,000 quotas will be available under the scheme.
  <br>
  <br>
  Deputy Secretary for Health Eddie Lee said the government is working with NGOs to enable more underprivileged people to see a dentist.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have rounds of meetings with all relevant NGOs in Hong Kong, and most of them express very keen interest in collaborating with the government, but at the same time they do express some constraints such as manpower," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Upon knowing that we are going to have more supply of dental health professionals, they [NGOs] are more ready and feel more comfortable to work with us."
  <br>
  <br>
  An online queuing system for general public sessions at Department of Health dental clinics will also be available from December 30.

    Giant red ball popping up across Hong Kong

<div class="itemFullText">
 A huge bright red ball is popping up in various places in Hong Kong from Friday until next Sunday as part of "the world’s longest-running street artwork".
 <br>
  <br>
  Since its debut in 2001, the enormous sphere has criss-crossed the globe, visiting cities including Paris, Chicago, London and Tokyo.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong marks its 48th stop and it will make appearances at 10 spots across the SAR, starting with the Central Piers and ending on The Peak.
  <br>
  <br>
  It has already drawn curious spectators for selfies, but Anna preferred to sketch it.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's just a one-off opportunity to come and draw it. I draw, I sketch all across Hong Kong, so I love to capture scenes in Hong Kong and this is just a rare opportunity to do something different. It's only here today," she told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's always interesting. I think any art project anywhere is interesting and it's always good to support the arts and you want more to come here."
  <br>
  <br>
  American artist Kurt Perschke, the creator of the RedBall project, said he was happy to have the art work showcased in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The project has been in Europe, in the US, all over in Sydney. I think one of the things that I've been excited about to bring it to Hong Kong is to see how the Hong Kong people respond to the piece and to see how we can explore and have fun with the city of Hong Kong, which is such a dynamic and amazing city. I've wanted to bring it here for a long time," he said.

  <br>
  Rather than a heavy rail system proposed earlier, officials said they plan to build a "smart and green" mass transit system using viaducts, along with a tunnel through the hilly terrain between Queen Mary Hospital and the University of Hong Kong, according to a paper submitted to Legco earlier this week.
  <br>
  <br>
  The proposed transit line will span about 7.5 kilometres and link HKU and Wong Chuk Hang MTR stations. Officials hope to start the planning and design process next year, with construction set to begin in 2027.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a Legco subcommittee meeting, lawmakers generally expressed support for the project, saying it has been a longstanding priority for Southern District residents.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said the government opted for the smart and green model after taking into consideration issues such as technical capabilities and financing.
  <br>
  <br>
  The transport minister said the new plan could be much cheaper than the original one.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the potential visual impact and noise issues for residents, Chan said authorities would seek residents' feedback before construction work begins.
  <br>
  <br>
  “As far as visual impact and noise are concerned, if we are using the smart and green mass transit system with rubber wheels, the noise levels generated will be less than for heavy rail systems, and it will take up less space,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Principal Government Engineer Eddie Leung said he believes the new transit line will be able to cater to the needs of Southern District.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials have said it will serve 130,000 residents and 50,000 people working there.
  <br>
  <br>
  As for a new mass transit system for Kai Tak, Chan said the objective is to award the contract in 2026 and have it completed within three years after construction starts.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Asia's largest cruise ship, the Spectrum of the Seas, docked at Kai Tak Cruise Terminal on Friday morning, with passengers saying they were satisfied with the onward transport arrangements.
 <br>
  <br>
  The ship, which had departed from Shanghai, was carrying about 5,000 passengers.
  <br>
  <br>
  The authorities strengthened transport services at the terminal, which included additional bus routes and shuttle services to various MTR stations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two passengers from Germany said they were satisfied with the arrangements.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It's very organised here and everybody can help you,” they told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We stay two days in Hong Kong and then we fly home. It's a short stay. We bookmarked on the Victoria Peak or so, and then SoHo.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Staff were seen giving out LPG coupons to taxi drivers who picked up passengers at the terminal.
  <br>
  <br>
  There was a short queue at the taxi stop, but a traveller from Australia said this wasn’t a problem.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It's okay so far. It’s been quite smooth. We're staying at the Disneyland Resort, so there'll be quite a bit of time spent there. Our daughter and grandson will be meeting us,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  But a British tourist said she did not know that most taxis only accept cash for payment.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We’re going to take a taxi to the train station, and it’s got to be Hong Kong dollars… doesn’t say that anywhere, and there’s no ATM to get money, so it’s not really good at all,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officiating at a welcoming ceremony for the cruise ship, Deputy Financial Secretary Michael Wong said the authorities wanted the transport arrangements to be as smooth as possible.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This morning, these arrangements have proven to be rather effective. So well done. I'm so happy, and my thanks to everyone who contributed to us making this possible. Of course, we will continue to monitor the situation and fine-tune and improve those arrangements as we move along," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong added that he expects Hong Kong to attract more tourists in 2025 with different policies, including the resumption of the multi-entry visa scheme for Shenzhen residents.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Benjamin Bouldin, president of Royal Caribbean China, said sailing from Hong Kong allows cruises to have a diverse pool of tourists.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong has always been a gateway for international travel and it's great to be able to get it back to that place. We know we get a slightly different guest mix from Hong Kong and that's one we're looking forward to reuniting with this winter," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ship is scheduled to depart for Japan on Friday afternoon.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong will be the vessel's seasonal home port, and the cruise line is expected to double its home port sailings to 10 next year.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Nearly 200 people were led to safety after the Hong Kong Observation Wheel at the Central Harbourfront malfunctioned on Thursday afternoon, with the ride remaining stationary for 40 minutes.
 <br>
  <br>
  Police and firefighters were called to the scene just after 5pm, after receiving calls for assistance.
  <br>
  <br>
  The wheel's operator revealed the attraction had experienced a technical failure in its "secondary system", which triggered a temporary stoppage as part of safety procedures.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, the company said operation resumed at 5.30pm, and all 190 passengers disembarked safely 15 minutes later.
  <br>
  <br>
  The attraction was shut down for the rest of Thursday evening to facilitate safety checks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some tourists were left disappointed, including Meizi and John from the Philippines.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're kind of disappointed ... we're upset because we actually just [came] here to experience. Now it's closed, we're not sure why. We'll go somewhere else, I think," they said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Development Bureau, meanwhile, has requested an investigation report from the operator as soon as possible.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bureau noted the operator has maintained a solid record in running the attraction over the years, and was confident it can learn from the experience and avoid a repeat of the incident.
  <br>
  <br>
  The existing operator, the Entertainment Corporation Limited, was awarded a tender in June to manage the wheel until 2029.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The authorities will hold their first test event at the Kai Tak Arena within the sports park on Saturday, with two basketball games in the afternoon.
 <br>
  <br>
  Gates will open for the 2,000 spectators from 1.30pm, with the games tipping off at 3pm and 5pm.
  <br>
  <br>
  Spectators are advised to use the MTR to get there. No tickets will be sold at the venue.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sports Commissioner George Tsoi said officials will set up six to eight security check counters for the drill.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Long umbrellas and food and beverages, including empty bottles, are not allowed. If you do not have a bag, you can [go through] a dedicated corridor to speed up the security checking," he told reporters on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tsoi added that the arena will host a concert on December 20 and test events for the 50,000-seater Kai Tak Stadium will begin next month.
  <br>
  <br>
  The park's director, Tang King-shing, said the arena is an international-level multi-purpose venue with 10,000 seats.
  <br>
  <br>
  When there are no special events, he said, the arena will be open to the public, noting that it can house up to 40 badminton courts at one time.
  <br>
  <br>
  There will be another stress test for the arena and the youth sports ground next to it on Sunday afternoon, involving 12,000 participants.
  <br>
  <br>
  The authorities said those taking part will include Kai Tak residents, youth uniformed group members and civil servants.
  <br>
  <br>
  As part of the drill, officials will arrange dozens of buses and taxis to take participants to a drop-off area at Sung Wong Toi MTR Station.
  <br>
  <br>
  There will also be a fire drill at the youth sports ground.

    New appointments will improve governance: Lau Siu-kai

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A senior member of a leading national think tank on Thursday said he thinks the reshuffle of the SAR cabinet will serve as a stimulus for better governance.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lau Siu-kai, a consultant to the Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macau Studies, told RTHK that he's not surprised by the new appointments.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Under the principal officials' accountability system, it is quite normal for the chief executive to replace ministers from time to time so that he can get his job done better, get his government more popular, and to be seen as accountable to the public," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The replacements will also push existing officials to do a better job to "avoid being replaced by new ministers" and to improve overall government performance, Lau added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I would say the public... expect them to do a much better job than their predecessors, given their two predecessors have done something which has been quite controversial before. The new ministers should be able to elicit new expectations from the public or the government."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lau said the new culture and transport chiefs are expected to outperform their predecessors, and ensure smooth sailing of important projects like the Kai Tak Sports Park and next year's National Games.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the next couple of years, the chief executive must be very concerned that the Kai Tak Sports Park and the national sports event will be held very successfully, and no mistake will be committed.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If that is the case, it is not surprising that he is going to replace two officials. He will be more comfortable with the new ministers and be confident that they can get the job done and to enhance the popularity and the authority of the government."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lau added that he thinks the two new ministers are hardworking and willing to face the media, and will work closely with professionals in their bureaus.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Newly appointed Secretary for Transport and Logistics Mable Chan on Thursday said she was confident she could bring impetus to the bureau and lead her team to push forward various transport policies and plans.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chan replaces Lam Sai-hung who vacated his position in the first cabinet reshuffle of Chief Executive John Lee.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters, Chan said the government was working on different railway projects, including the Tung Chung Line Extension, Tuen Mun South Extension and the Northern Link.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Transport and railway development is pivotal to the economic development of Hong Kong. We have promulgated a transport and traffic blueprint which lists out a number of railway and road projects," Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the coming years, I will be leading my bureau in taking forward, steadfastly, in order to make sure that these projects are implemented and constructed on time, within budget."
  <br>
  <br>
  She added that with the implementation of the three-runway system, the government would continue to work on raising Hong Kong's status as an international aviation hub.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked about bus fare hikes, Chan said authorities must consider what the public could afford, but pointed out the importance of bus operators having a stable financial situation, in order to ensure their quality of services.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan had previously served as the commissioner for transport, before becoming the permanent secretary for transport and logistics in 2020.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Newly appointed Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism Rosanna Law on Thursday said her bureau will be well prepared for the official opening of Kai Tak Sports Park and for the 15th National Games next year.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Opportunities are everywhere. And so my priority would be to learn the latest development of my bureau's work and then to meet old friends, make new friends, have candid, useful, constructive discussions with all stakeholders, with a view of bringing culture, sports and tourism to new heights," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meeting reporters for the first time after stepping into her new role, Law said she is confident in her new position, saying her experience in various bureaus has helped her learn fast and adapt to changes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Well, no one knows everything. I have been an administrative officer and what is unique for this job is that every few years I change to a new field, I take up a new post. But as always, we do our best in getting our hands on a job as quickly as possible," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I remember about 16 months ago, I was deployed to the Housing Bureau. Although I did not have any experience in housing, I became the director of housing and I just learned what I had to do as quickly as possible. And I'm sure that my colleagues will continue to give me the best support they can."
  <br>
  <br>
  Law said she would not comment on the work of her predecessor, Kevin Yeung, saying her colleagues have been making an all-out effort and working tirelessly.
  <br>
  <br>
  She joined the government in 1989 and had held various positions, including deputy commissioner for tourism, deputy secretary for constitutional and mainland affairs and commissioner for transport, before becoming permanent secretary for housing and director of housing last year.

<div class="itemFullText">
 New People's Party lawmaker Regina Ip said it's an appropriate time for the government to appoint two "young and energetic" ministers, saying the bureaus they head serve important roles.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a reshuffle announced by the government on Thursday, Mable Chan, formerly the Permanent Secretary for Transport and Logistics, is succeeding Lam Sai-hung as transport minister, and Director of Housing Rosanna Law has replaced Kevin Yeung as Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ip said both the Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau and the Transport and Logistics Bureau have a lot of work ahead.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Tourism promotion is a priority for this administration. Moreover, we are launching the Kai Tak sports complex, we will be hosting the National Games, and the blueprint for tourism, recreation and sport has just been unveiled. So there's a lot of work to be done," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The same with the Transport and Logistics Bureau. We are launching the third runway, we need to strengthen and broaden our aviation network and set up a new maritime services and harbour development board."
  <br>
  <br>
  The DAB also welcomed the appointment of the two new ministers, hoping that they will strive to make breakthroughs in their respective policy portfolios.
  <br>
  <br>
  Roundtable lawmaker Michael Tien said he has high expectations for Law, saying she has demonstrated her vision for the future while working as the commissioner for transport and director of housing in the past.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If you look at the Cross-Harbour Tunnel today, it's basically an exercise from bottom-up. They ran years and years of modelling, looked at all the possible scenarios and then came up with something and that's it. It turned out quite well.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Her stint at the Housing Department... there was a lot of abuse of public housing privileges, and she responded very aggressively to our Roundtable demand to clamp down on the abuse."
  <br>
  <br>
  The lawmaker representing the sports and culture sector, Kenneth Fok, said he is looking forward to working with Law, saying that the government has been highly concerned about sports and cultural development.

    New tolls to drive Tai Lam Tunnel capacity: official

<img alt="Leung Sai-ho says Tai Lam Tunnel is heavily used by truck and van drivers. File photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1782188_1_20241205104029.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Plans to impose time-varying tolls at Tai Lam Tunnel could help it reach full capacity, an official said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on an RTHK programme, the Transport Department’s Assistant Commissioner Leung Sai-ho noted that if the tolls for the tunnel connecting Ting Kau and Yuen Long stay at their current levels, there would still be about 15 percent capacity untapped by 2026.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said authorities hope the adjusted tolls would attract drivers to use the tunnel and help disperse traffic flow on alternative routes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We were thinking about how we might utilise remaining capacity and help spread traffic for different routes. People may be familiar with Tuen Mun Road and Tolo Highway. If we adjust the tolls, we hope to attract more drivers to use the Tai Lam Tunnel, which is the most crucial factor in our consideration," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The proposed changes will include three tiers of charges for “peak”, “normal” and “non-peak” hours, similar to the system used for the cross-harbour tunnels.
  <br>
  <br>
  Instead of the present fixed toll of HK$58, private vehicles would pay HK$45 during peak hours, HK$30 during normal hours, and HK$18 during non-peak hours.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked whether there was room to further lower the charges during peak hours, Leung said authorities had been very careful in setting toll levels, warning that if tolls are lowered again congestion may occur.
  <br>
  <br>
  The official also mentioned that the fall in tolls for commercial vehicles - down from current level of between HK$64 and HK$79 to HK$43 throughout the day - is quite high.
  <br>
  <br>
  He stressed that data shows that Tai Lam Tunnel is heavily used by vans and trucks, indicating that the logistics industry relies on it to travel between the northwestern New Territories and urban areas.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Thursday made his first cabinet reshuffle at the mid-point of his five-year term, replacing transport minister Lam Sai-hung and tourism chief Kevin Yeung.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lam was replaced by the former Permanent Secretary for Transport and Logistics Mable Chan, while Rosanna Law moves on from her former position as housing director to take up the culture, sports and tourism portfolio.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I appreciate the leadership the articulation skill, and also the proactiveness of Ms Chan and Ms Law because this is exactly what I need in the years to come to ensure that we will reap the best results and also to ensure good governance,” Lee told a press conference unveiling his new ministers.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said while he believes the majority of the community largely agrees with his administration’s policy aims and strategies, Hong Kong has “lost time” due both to the Covid pandemic and the 2019 riots, and he wants to “chase back the results and time.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan and Law, the CE said, will help him realise his policy objectives, work closely with him and unite to further improve governance and serve the best interests of Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I am pleased with the team I have now with the two newly appointed secretaries joining us,” Lee said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “All the team members now are able people who will be implementing my governance philosophies and aims and are willing to take up challenges, make tough decisions, build the teams, and lead the officials to do what will be in alignment with my governance philosophy and aims.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee did not say where the two former ministers were found wanting, and expressed his appreciation for their past efforts.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I really think that they have contributed their best [and have given] their best efforts for Hong Kong. So I thank them sincerely and I hope that they will have a good life, happy life after their departure,” Lee said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “But I want to do more in these two and a half years. I want to get the people who will fit my criteria in building more results and ensuring the community understand and appreciate government policies. And I think I've got the best choices,” the CE added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The new ministers vowed to work hard to bring the best results to the people of Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said she was determined to cement Hong Kong's status as a transport and logistics hub.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I am honoured to be nominated by the chief executive and the appointment of the central people's government to become the Secretary for Transport and Logistics," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I will lead my bureau and four departments to strive for opportunities to change and take forward various infrastructure projects."
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Law said culture and tourism were important to the fabric of the city and were essential to many people's livelihoods.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is my honour and I feel there is a lot of responsibility on my shoulder. I thank the chief executive for his trust in me. I am going to be fully dedicated to supporting the chief executive and I will also stay united with principal officials, as well as the civil service."
  <br>
  <br>
  Law said top of her agenda would be to prepare for the introduction of the pandas to the public at Ocean Park, ensuring the smooth implementation of the multi-entry visa scheme for Shenzhen residents and preparing for next year's National Games.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, Lam described serving various government positions in his 40-year public service career as "the greatest honour of my life".
  <br>
  <br>
  He said he's grateful for the trust of the central government, the support of the CE as well as help from his government colleagues and friends in the industry over the years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeung thanked his colleagues at the Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau for working alongside with him.
  <br>
  <br>
  He believes his successor will continue to work towards the betterment and improvement of Hong Kong's future.

<img alt="Authorities held a meeting on Tuesday to discuss transportation arrangements ahead of the arrival of the Spectrum of the Seas. Photo courtesy: Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1782129_1_20241204215527.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Wednesday has announced a series of measures to boost public transport capacity to and from the Kai Tak cruise terminal this weekend, when a major cruise ship is set to sail into Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Spectrum of the Seas, the largest cruise liner in Asia, will make eight port calls in the SAR in December and January. The first call is happening this Friday, when the ship arrives from Shanghai with about 4,900 passengers.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The government welcomes the ship to choose Hong Kong as its homeport, and looks forward to working with the trade to better prepare to receive cruise passengers,” a government statement read.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau confirmed that two new express bus routes will be ready to take visitors to the nearby Kai Tak MTR station, and West Kowloon high speed rail station via Tsim Sha Tsui.
  <br>
  <br>
  The cruise passengers can also opt for free and paid shuttle buses to various tourist hotspots.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Transport Department has communicated with the taxi trade on the possible demand surge on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The cruise terminal will provide HK$100 gas coupons to each taxi which picks up passengers, if an “exceptionally strong demand” is anticipated.
  <br>
  <br>
  That’s double the previous offer of HK$50 voucher per taxi.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tourism Commissioner Angelina Cheung hoped the arrangements can offer cruise passengers with a better travelling experience, and consolidate Hong Kong's position as a major homeport in Asia and attract more ship calls.

<img alt="Professor Hau Kit-tai, who led the research in Hong Kong, said local students have remained stable in terms of their competitiveness in maths and science.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong pupils remain competitive among their worldwide peers in mathematical and scientific literacy, finishing among the top 10 in a major international research which is conducted every four years.
 <br>
  <br>
  The latest results for the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study, or TIMSS, was released on Wednesday. The study aims to help jurisdictions identify strengths in their education systems, as well as areas for improvement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Education Bureau commissioned the Chinese University of Hong Kong for the citywide assessment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Around 8,600 students from more than 270 primary and secondary schools took part in computer-based tests from May to July last year
  <br>
  <br>
  Primary four pupils came back fourth out of 58 economies in maths, down from second in the previous survey in 2019. But the cohort jumped six places to ninth in science.
  <br>
  <br>
  Secondary two students, meanwhile, retained fifth place among 44 economies in maths. There was a significant improvement in science, as they improved from 17th to eighth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Singapore topped the chart in all four categories.
  <br>
  <br>
  "From the previous few cycles starting from 1997, Hong Kong students’ math performance has been quite outstanding, which is within the first few economies among some 50 or 40 participating economies,” said Professor Hau Kit-tai, who coordinated the research in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But for science, our improvement is slightly on a broad trend but not so obvious. In terms of ranking, as compared to the last cycle in 2019, we have improved quite a lot," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Education Bureau has recently amended the primary curriculum so that science will become an independent subject, instead of being part of general studies.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We don’t know if that is a direct effect of such action that led to the improvement in science results as compared to last cycle," Hau said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He predicted schools will continue to place more emphasis on science, which in turn could attract more science graduates into the education sector and improve teaching quality.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hau also noted the performance gap between boys and girls is shrinking, with girls gradually catching up with their peers in recent cycles.
  <br>
  <br>
  The only exception is the primary four cohort, in which boys outperformed girls by 14 points in maths, and 10 points in science.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Biodiversity Expert Group on Wednesday called on the government and developers to minimise the impact of development on the city's wildlife.
 <br>
  <br>
  The group said the authorities' approach of prioritising development and then attempting to mitigate environmental damage has been ineffective in protecting marine and terrestrial ecosystems.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a press briefing, Simon Ng, a member of the group and the CEO of the Business Environment Council, urged the government to give a policy signal to the business sector, as it has recognised the importance of wildlife conservation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They see nature and biodiversity potentially as a risk management issue. So, on the one hand, some business operations actually rely [on] and are dependent on ecological services and nature, providing resources and support," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But on the other hand, biodiversity loss actually will cost the business sector dearly in terms of their operations, in terms of the supply chain."
  <br>
  <br>
  The group also recommended the government start large-scale restoration of terrestrial and marine ecosystems, as well as strengthen protection for Hong Kong's most endangered species.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Outward Bound Hong Kong on Wednesday said a survey it's carried out suggests most children in Hong Kong lack confidence in their resilience and are unsure how to develop this skill.
 <br>
  <br>
  The outdoor education provider surveyed more than 700 parents and students between May and June, finding that both groups consider resilience a crucial life skill.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, 80 percent of the 337 young people polled said they find it difficult to get resilience training at school.
  <br>
  <br>
  Announcing the findings at a forum, the group's executive director Nick Cotton said it's important for youngsters to learn from failure.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We need to be prepared to let young people fail. Because through failure you learn, and through learning that's where you develop that resilience because you know that failing is not the end of the world,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “And that process then of reflecting and thinking how you can improve, that's what resilience really is. Because next time you're faced with a challenge, you're able to tackle it head on.”
  <br>
  <br>
  At the same event, Paralympic boccia gold medallist Ho Yuen-kei encouraged young people to pursue their dreams and never give up.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The study said that nowadays youngsters lack resilience. But I suggest try to do something you like and join the activity in our community. You can try something that you may not be familiar with. Don't be afraid of being unsuccessful," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jack Wong, who chairs Clearwater Bay Golf and Country Club, said it's a reality that less resourceful students may have less opportunity to access resilience training.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong added that his organisation is working with NGOs to empower youngsters through sports tournaments.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A French cultural and educational organisation is launching an immersive augmented reality experience of Notre-Dame de Paris in Hong Kong on Sunday, coinciding with the cathedral's reopening after its devastating fire in 2019.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lydie Blandeau, co-founder and CEO of Visionairs, said the exhibition at the West Kowloon cultural hub aims to showcase the cathedral's 850-year history through innovative technology and artefacts, fostering cultural exchange between France and Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  She also said the AR exhibition will enable people of all ages to explore the iconic landmark without the need for travel.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This experience, it's a mix of history and what has happened in the 21st century when the cathedral was on fire, so they will enjoy the new constructions, but all of these new constructions are based on real strong work from people, we can say like craftsmanship people, who rebuilt the cathedral to what it was, including by using the stone they used 800 years," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's a very interesting combination of 360 degrees of augmented reality, so you can turn around and you can see from the bottom to the top different aspects and visuals of the cathedral."
  <br>
  <br>
  Visitors will receive a portable touch-screen tablet that guides them on an interactive tour of grand historical events, including the wedding of King Henry IV, Napoleon Bonaparte's coronation, and the construction of Viollet-le-Duc's spire in the 19th century.
  <br>
  <br>
  This exhibition has travelled the globe, from Paris to Dubai and Montreal to Shanghai, attracting over 750,000 visitors across 19 locations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Blandeau said she hopes to create a similar exhibition showcasing Hong Kong's landmarks for a global audience in the future.
  <br>

  "We hope we can work with different Hong Kong museums and especially culture here because Hong Kong, it's really a place in Asia where everything comes true regarding arts and culture. I think Hong Kong people, they appreciate art and history," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We hope we can create more content from here to exhibit also in our next venue we want to do in Paris and Arab countries where we have different offers to enlarge different locations like this."

    Significant rise in airplane theft cases in 2024: govt

<img alt="The Security Bureau said there's been a significant increase in theft cases on board Hong Kong-bound flights this year. File photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1782061_1_20241204143235.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government said the number of thefts on board Hong Kong-bound aircraft for the first 10 months of the year reached a seven-year high, involving property worth more than HK$4.3 million.
 <br>
  <br>
  Security minister Chris Tang on Wednesday said there were 169 such cases recorded through October, with most of them involving short-haul flights from Southeast Asia.
  <br>
  <br>
  The figure compares to 147 cases for the whole of 2019, and 103 the year before that.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a written reply to the legislature, the minister described the rise in the number of cases as significant, saying items stolen included cash, credit cards, jewellery and watches.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[The increase] might be due to the fact that the police have stepped up publicity to encourage more people to report crimes, or the overall economic situation," he wrote in response to DAB lawmaker Kennedy Wong.
  <br>
  <br>
  Four people have been arrested - one of them on remand pending trial, with another released on bail.
  <br>
  <br>
  Charges for two others were dropped because of a lack of evidence, or because witnesses refused to come to Hong Kong to testify.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister said the government had no plans to install surveillance cameras or arrange security personal in airplane cabins for now, citing privacy reasons, manpower and the principle of proportionality.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Currently, there are no international policies regulating the installation of CCTV or arrangements of security staff on duty inside cabins, nor are these common practices generally adopted by airlines," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Tang said officials would work with airlines to engage in more educational and publicity campaigns.

    Proposed Tai Lam Tunnel tolls are reasonable: lawmaker

    <![CDATA[<div>
<img alt="Frankie Yick backed the decision not to allow toll-free journeys during non-peak hours. File photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1782050_1_20241204132256.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government’s plan to charge time-varying tolls for the Tai Lam Tunnel has been welcomed by transport sector lawmaker Frankie Yick who describes the proposed new tolls as “acceptable”.
 <br>
  <br>
  Yick told RTHK on Wednesday that he understands people want to see lower tolls, but they have to realise the priority is to ease traffic congestion.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Well, of course, I think everybody wants the government to lower down the toll to make it even more affordable. But I think we have to look at the numbers. So, if we believe the numbers are correct, I think the most important thing is after the introduction of the new toll, we have to make sure the Tai Lam Tunnel will not be congested. Otherwise, it will defeat the whole purpose,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yick also backed the decision not to allow toll-free journeys during non-peak hours, saying the charges are affordable and it is reasonable to make people pay for the maintenance costs.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I think I would agree that we should maintain some charges, but of course the most important thing is whether it's affordable by the driving public. If you look at the non-peak hours fee right now at HK$18 [for private cars], I think it's quite reasonable in a sense.”
  <br>
  <br>
  “And of course the government, after taking over the management of the tunnel, they do have the maintenance costs and future investment costs, upgrade of services, that sort of stuff. I think they still need money to do that,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  DAB lawmaker Ben Chan, the chairman of Legco's panel on transport, expressed hope that the government would consider further reducing the tolls for taxis and commercial vehicles.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The government has provided us data and told us it hopes to avoid congestion in the tunnel. This is also in the public's interest. We hope that if the new toll system is implemented, there will be a review after about a year to assess the actual transport situation and see if these tolls are necessary,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Federation of Trade Unions lawmaker Michael Luk, meanwhile, said he thinks the charges during peak hours will still be high, urging authorities to shorten the peak hours period and further reduce fees during other times of day.

    Govt reviewing scheme to help traffic accident victims

<img alt="Chris Sun said officials are looking into making changes to a scheme offering help to traffic accident victims." src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1782041_1_20241204124607.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Labour and welfare minister Chris Sun on Wednesday said officials were looking at lowering the maximum amount of sick leave allowed under a subsidy scheme for people involved in traffic accidents.
 <br>
  <br>
  Last month, the police said they had arrested 275 people on suspicion of "staging" accidents to obtain the allowance.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister told lawmakers the scheme currently allows for 180 days of leave, and officials are inclined to cut that down.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Currently, the maximum sick leave allowed is roughly half a year. We think this should be subject to review. We'll see if we should give so much, and whether we should lower the number.....and by how much? We will have a look," Sun said at a Legislative Council meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Another thing is that there are quite a number of subsidy items on offer. One is for those injured, another is for those who cannot go to work. We think there are too many forms of subsidies. The aim is mainly to weather the storm for the recipient. So we'll think of ways to consolidate these, to simplify things."
  <br>
  <br>
  Sun said officials also have to implement the scheme under the principle of keeping expenditures within the limits of revenues.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added the money for the subsidies comes from transport-related fees such as licensing and vehicle registration.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister hoped the review could be completed before the end of the year, for tabling the proposed changes to the legislature for discussion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sun also said following the arrests, social welfare officials have reviewed their workflow, and made extra efforts to check the documents submitted by subsidy applicants, especially those who were making repeated claims.

    CUHK invents non-invasive way to find bowel disease

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chinese University researchers on Wednesday said they have invented non-invasive technology to identify bowel disease, reducing the need for endoscopies.
 <br>
  <br>
  The university made use of faecal samples from about 6,000 people from different regions, and found about 20 types of bacteria associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).
  <br>
  <br>
  Francis Chan, professor of medicine and therapeutics, said droplet digital PCR technology can be used to test stool samples and determine whether a patient has IBD or a different gut disorder.
  <br>
  <br>
  “IBD, at least early stage, their symptoms are no different from our common functional gut problems like irritable bowel syndrome,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “That's the reason why when many patients present with these recurrent symptoms related to the gut, they go to see the doctor, and then they have no choice but to undergo endoscopy, just to make sure that they are not suffering from IBD.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said traditionally, it takes up to 12 months for a patient with IBD to be diagnosed, and delayed treatment can lead to serious complications like bleeding and bowel cancer.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said results from the stool test are available in a week, allowing for earlier diagnosis.
  <br>
  <br>
  Researchers said the technology can also assess the risk of bowel cancer among IBD patients, adding that the test is expected to be ready for clinical use in Hong Kong in 2027.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Wednesday said it is important to uphold the Constitution when making legislative and policy changes, to ensure reform is in the right direction.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a seminar on Constitution Day, Lee said the Constitution is the country's supreme law and provides the legal framework for policy formulation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In further deepening reform comprehensively, we must regard the Constitution as our country's fundamental law by upholding and implementing the Constitution's requirements, principles, and spirit," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Only then can we ensure our reform stays on the right track and proceeds in the right way at a steady pace."
  <br>
  <br>
  The CE added that constitutional education and implementation must go hand in hand to ensure that people respect and comply with the law.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is because a solid grasp of the Constitution's substance and spirit among the entire populace is crucial to a healthy atmosphere of respect for the law and compliance," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee said Hong Kong can play its role by maximising its unique strengths under the "One Country, Two Systems" framework.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zheng Yanxiong, director of the liaison office, told the same seminar that the SAR should continue to pursue high-quality development and deepen reform under the rule of law.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We must also embark on innovations. We have accumulated new experience, and we have also designated a Constitution Day and other measures. So all these have been taken under our new innovative spirit, and this is a result of the rule of law and reform," he said.

    Govt urges HK residents to be careful in South Korea

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong tourists heading to South Korea on Wednesday said they were not fazed about the short-lived martial law in the country as the government called on residents to remain cautious.
 <br>
  <br>
  South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol ended martial law hours after the declaration last night.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Hong Kong, flights for South Korea were operating as usual.
  <br>
  <br>
  A woman surnamed Wong was heading to South Korea alone.
  <br>
  <br>
  She admitted she was a bit worried when martial law was declared, but noted that it was short-lived.
  <br>
  <br>
  She believed the situation in the country should be fine.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I plan to check the news before I head out," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I will also try to avoid places with crowds, as my friends told me that if I see people gathering, I should not get close."
  <br>
  <br>
  A woman surnamed Cheung told RTHK that she's not too concerned about the situation, adding that whatever happens, happens.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another Hongkonger, surnamed Law, believed she will be safe as long as she stays away from protests.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said if anything happens, she will stay in the hotel.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some Koreans in the SAR said they were shocked about the declaration of martial law.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mr Park, who's in the region with a friend for a taekwondo competition, said he and his pal were sceptical about the news when it broke.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We [thought] that it's not real situation. [We thought] it's fake. We talked to each other that it's fake news. But it's a real situation. So we are very surprised. About 40 years ago, you know that Korea is under the military government, but Korea is very developed economically and politically," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And democracy, we Korean people made democracy. So we believe that this kind of situation cannot be real and cannot stay [for long]. So we are very happy to see that the situation is over."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Travel Industry Council said around 400 people from 26 tours groups are in South Korea.
  <br>
  <br>
  Their trips have not been affected and there are no plans for them to return to Hong Kong earlier than scheduled.
  <br>
  <br>
  The council has not received any requests for assistance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Still, the SAR government urged Hong Kong residents who are in the country or plan to go to South Korea to remain cautious.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[They should] monitor the situation, exercise caution, attend to personal safety, avoid large gatherings of people and pay attention to local announcements on the latest situation."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Security Bureau said social order in South Korea is normal for now, and it would closely monitor the situation.
  <br>
  <br>
  So far, no one has asked for assistance from the Immigration Department.

    Time-varying tolls proposed for Tai Lam Tunnel
   </title>

<img alt="The morning rush hour at the Tai Lam Tunnel will be from 7.15am to 9.45am, while the evening peak period will be from 5.15pm to 7pm. File photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1782036_1_20241204122011.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government says it plans to charge time-varying tolls for the Tai Lam Tunnel after it takes control of the infrastructure in the New Territories on May 31 next year.
 <br>
  <br>
  Currently, private car and taxi drivers pay HK$58, while commercial vehicle drivers pay between HK$64 and HK$79 for using the tunnel connecting Ting Kau and Yuen Long.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under the new tolling system, there will be three levels of charges for “peak”, “general” and “non-peak” hours, similar to the system used for the cross-harbour tunnels.
  <br>
  <br>
  The morning rush hour will be from 7.15am to 9.45am, while the evening peak period will be from 5.15pm to 7pm.
  <br>
  <br>
  For private cars, the proposed toll during peak hours is HK$45, HK$30 for normal periods of the day, and HK$18 for non-peak hours.
  <br>
  <br>
  Motorcyclists will pay HK$18 during peak hours, HK$12 during normal periods and HK$7.2 at non-peak hours.
  <br>
  <br>
  Taxis will be charged a fixed toll of HK$28 and commercial vehicles HK$43 throughout the day.
  <br>
  <br>
  A fixed charging scheme will apply to all vehicles on Sundays and public holidays.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government also explained that it hasn't considered toll-free journeys in non-peak hours because it believes the best approach is to have users cover the infrastructure costs, emphasising this has nothing to do with the higher-than-expected government deficit this fiscal year.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said the scheme will ease traffic on alternative routes such as Tuen Mun Road and the Tolo Highway.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tuen Mun Road is expected to see 300 fewer private cars during the busiest hour of the day.
  <br>
  <br>
  There will be a mechanism in place to adjust the tolls, with any changes capped at no more than HK$3.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government said it plans to table a bill on the plans to Legco for a first reading next Wednesday, and hopes to see it passed in the first quarter of next year.

 A charity group which helps the refugee community is seeking support to boost its efforts to educate the needy, particularly to make recipients more tech-savvy.
 <br>
  <br>
  Grassroots Future is among 11 beneficiaries of this year's Operation Santa Claus (OSC). It was founded four years ago during the pandemic to help refugees and asylum seekers in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  The charity now focuses on helping the recipients with their education, mental well-being and community building.
  <br>
  <br>
  Its director, Tegan Smyth, said with many things getting more expensive, such as textbooks, one of her group's initiatives is to relieve the financial stress of parents.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's called TE(A)CH at the Grassroots and it's covering an IT program for refugee and asylum seeker children and their parents over a two-year basis. It's also covering textbook expenses, which is a really pressing need for the community," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Smyth said education is a major barrier for refugee children in the SAR, because their parents are unable to work, making it hard for them to pay upfront for textbooks and other school expenses.
  <br>
  <br>
  She added that her charity has been helping around 30 children a year, and she hopes the number will keep rising.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jointly organised by RTHK and South China Morning Post, OSC funds charitable projects that focus on children and youth, the elderly, the community, those with physical and mental disabilities, medical projects, and those concerning the environment.

    HK must reform amid economic transformation: CE

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee said the time is ripe for various sectors in Hong Kong to speed up reform, and there is no exception for the government especially after the country adopted a resolution on further deepening reform to advance Chinese modernisation.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a new season of the RTHK programme
  <i>
   Overview Policy
  </i>
  , Lee said he has been trying to push for reform since he took office in 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  "At that time, I used milder words, such as 'change'. That's because everybody will interpret the reform differently," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CE said reform is never easy, as it often affects people with vested interests or forces people to leave their comfort zone, so it's necessary to convince the public why reform is necessary.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Some of the elements of success Hong Kong rode on in the past may not work anymore... Mainland cities are improving very quickly, with new technologies and systems. They have a stronger social basis and are more receptive to reform."
  <br>
  <br>
  He said businesses must adapt amid the city's economic transformation and changes in consumption patterns for locals and visitors alike.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If [businesses] don't carry out reform, they'll be phased out," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The chief executive said society has reached a consensus on the need for reform.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Now, we only have to tell people the disadvantages of not carrying out reform and the advantages of reform. Society already knows about it."
  <br>
  <br>
  The CE said the government needs to embrace reform as well, and that he's told senior staff to be more proactive.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You have to strike first. Before a problem surfaces, it's best that you foresee the problem and correct it... if there are ambiguous situations, just step in, instead of wasting time to debate who should take responsibility," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee also said principal officials have been ordered to face the public more by disseminating messages regularly on social media, so the public knows the government is tackling problems whenever they arise.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Justice Secretary Paul Lam on Wednesday said the Constitution provides the fundamental legal protection for the "One Country, Two Systems" framework, and people should start learning about the Constitution from a young age.
 <br>
  <br>
  Addressing the flag-raising ceremony on Constitution Day, Lam said the event was established to promote constitutional spirit and the rule of law.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Given the fundamental importance of the Constitution in implementing 'One Country, Two Systems' in Hong Kong, we must strengthen constitutional awareness. The prerequisite is to deepen public understanding and knowledge of the Constitution," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The activities on Constitution Day serve to promote and propagate the Constitution. It's also a good opportunity to promote rule of law awareness through public education."
  <br>
  <br>
  The SAR should make full use of the unique advantages under "One Country, Two Systems" and safeguard national sovereignty, security and development interests, Lam added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The justice chief also called it an "important mission" to teach youngsters about what the Constitution is and why it matters, adding that disciplinary services officers should stand at the forefront as guardians of the Constitution.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 100 members of the disciplined services took part in the flag-raising ceremony led by the Security Bureau at the Hong Kong Customs College.

    Ideas for Ocean Park to cut costs and raise revenues

<img alt="Lawmakers looked at ways Ocean Park could cut costs and raise revenues during a Legco panel meeting on Tuesday. File photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1781940_1_20241203204442.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lawmakers on Tuesday discussed ways to help Ocean Park improve its finances after it posted a deficit of more than HK$71 million for the financial year ending in June, despite revenue and visitor numbers hitting five-year highs.
 <br>
  <br>
  At a Legco panel meeting on economic development, the theme park disclosed that its water park, or Water World, lost over HK$200 million last financial year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ocean Park chairman Paulo Pong explained Water World had only been running for two years and was still in its growth phase, promising lawmakers the theme park would work hard to reduce losses.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lawmakers voiced concerns Ocean Park might struggle to stay financially sustainable, urging it to use the opportunities created by its six pandas.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tourism sector lawmaker Perry Yiu noted that following the resumption of multiple-entry visas for Shenzhen residents, Ocean Park could consider giving them more discounts to boost visitor numbers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Benson Luk from the Business and Professionals Alliance, suggested Ocean Park lease out its outdoor areas to host major events to increase revenue.
  <br>
  <br>
  Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism Kevin Yeung noted Ocean Park has been thinking of different ways to find more sources of income.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Ocean Park will make use of the resources available to try to increase revenue, for example concerts can be held in the park. This will also help solve the problem of not having enough venues in Hong Kong,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Roundtable lawmaker Michael Tien suggested the Leisure and Cultural Services Department (LCSD) take over the water park's operations to reduce losses.
  <br>
  <br>
  “[Ocean Park’s] current loss last year is strictly due to one project, which is the water park. The loss of the water park, which is in excess of HK$200 million, is about the same as the government subsidy,” he said
  <br>
  <br>
  “So basically, the government is not subsidising the other activities of Ocean Park, and that is unfair to Ocean Park and is tying up the hands of the entire team. So my suggestion is to spin off the water park, and give it to LCSD,” he said.

    HK children don't exercise enough: study

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A new study shows that most schoolchildren in Hong Kong are not doing the 60 minutes of moderate to vigorous exercise each day recommended by the World Health Organisation.
 <br>
  <br>
  Professor Patrick Ip from the University of Hong Kong’s department of paediatrics said research he carried out for the InspiringHK Sports Foundation found less than eight percent of more than 1,000 primary and secondary students studied met the exercise standard over the past year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ip blamed this on poor habits developed during the Covid pandemic.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We have observed a very alarming situation that during non-school days and public holidays, children actually did not go out with their friends, their family members to play sports or do any activities under the sunshine,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “This turns out to be a very bad habit. If that habit continues, our next generation will be at a much worse physical activity level, as well as having a poor shape in both physical and mental health.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The foundation said it hopes that by 2030, 16 percent of Hong Kong schoolchildren will reach the 60 minutes per day recommendation, adding that it will launch a scheme next year aimed at promoting physical activity among schoolchildren.

<img alt="Security chief Chris Tang says authorities have received 23 requests for assistance so far this year of Hongkongers allegedly being detained in Southeast Asia to work illegally." src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1781904_1_20241203162256.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Security minister Chris Tang has warned against a resurgence of cases involving Hong Kong residents allegedly being held captive in Southeast Asia to work illegally.
 <br>
  <br>
  A number of Hongkongers fell for employment scams and were detained in various Southeast Asian countries in 2022, prompting the government to set up a task force to coordinate follow-up actions.
  <br>
  <br>
  So far this year, authorities received 23 requests for assistance. Eleven of them returned to the SAR, while the others were discovered safe even though their movements were reportedly restricted.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Since the second quarter of 2024, there have been signs of a resurgence of cases of Hong Kong residents being suspected to have been lured to Southeast Asian countries and detained to engage in illegal work," Tang told a Legislative Council panel on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister said immigration officials have been following up on the cases through foreign ministry representatives in Hong Kong as well as diplomatic and consular missions elsewhere.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked if the government had learned about what happened from those who had returned to Hong Kong, Tang said none of the Hongkongers suspected to be detained against their will were taken away while on holiday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For each case, once the citizen has returned to Hong Kong, we would interview them, ask them why they were lured overseas and how they were released," Tang told lawmakers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But let me say this, most of the individuals went voluntarily and then they were detained there illegally. There was never a case that an individual was abducted."
  <br>
  <br>
  The security chief said authorities would continue to monitor online communications and strengthen cooperation with their international counterparts, while stepping up calls for people to be more alert to job scams.

    'HKU community pharmacy for education, research use'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The University of Hong Kong (HKU) on Tuesday said its community pharmacy merged pharmaceutical services with education and research, which is different from other medical dispensaries in the city.
 <br>
  <br>
  Located at the medical school's campus in Pok Fu Lam, the community pharmacy opened its doors in November, serving mainly Queen Mary Hospital patients as well as HKU staff and students.
  <br>
  <br>
  The medical facility, which is the city's first teaching community pharmacy on a university campus, offers a number of prescription-only medications and drugs for minor ailments.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jovan Chow, a third year pharmacy student at HKU, said he was able to learn by observing how pharmacists interact with patients.
  <br>
  <br>
  "My biggest takeaway from [working at] the community pharmacy is actually the soft skills I acquired during my time here... I have more opportunities to have a glance of how community pharmacies operate," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ian Wong, professor of pharmacology and pharmacy at the university's medical faculty, said the facility goes beyond serving those seeking help.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The main duties and core functions of a university are teaching, research, and knowledge transfer," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our pharmacy's mission is also to [give] the best education to our students, and secondly, is to make use of this pharmacy to conduct research, so that we can help our patients and citizens to optimise the use of medicine. And finally, providing services is actually a knowledge transfer, so that we make use of our knowledge to treat our patients."

 Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday said he believes the Northern Metropolis project will bring a good return on investment and the public will be able to share the fruits of the development.
 <br>
  <br>
  Last week, more than 80 enterprises and developers signed an expression of interest for the development, along with separate agreements for projects worth some HK$100 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are very confident that the Northern Metropolis development plan will invite and attract a lot of interest," Lee told reporters before heading into the weekly Executive Council meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will be also developing the San Tin Technopole. There will also be a university city and different pockets of land, and all these will add together to create extra value for Hong Kong. All these projects will bring a good return on investment."
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked whether there will be penalties for enterprises that sign agreements but don't invest, Lee said he believes these investments will pay off well in the long run.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Of course, we have to look very far ahead in the future. Some investment periods may be as long as five to 15 years," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CE added that he hopes to find innovative ways to ensure regular citizens also benefit from these investments.
