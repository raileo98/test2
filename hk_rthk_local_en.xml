<div class="itemFullText">
 The Education Bureau on Wednesday said it has ordered tour group service providers to stop using restaurants linked to the gastroenteritis cluster involving dozens of teachers and students.
 <br>
  <br>
  More than 50 students and teachers from three local secondary schools contracted gastroenteritis after dining at the same restaurants during an exchange trip to Shaoguan in Guangdong province.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the bureau said preliminary investigations by mainland authorities showed no proof that the infections were caused by the arranged meals during the tour.
  <br>
  <br>
  It added that the investigations revealed that the outbreak was likely spread through daily contact between tour members or exposure to vomit.
  <br>
  <br>
  As a precaution, the bureau said it has also ordered all restaurants serving mainland study tours to temporarily stop serving raw and cold food.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bureau stressed that it has strict rules for meal safety and restaurant hygiene, and has been working closely with mainland officials to make sure all safety measures are followed.

 Police on Wednesday said they arrested five people on suspicion of stealing more than HK$1 million worth of copper pipes across Hong Kong since January.
 <br>
  <br>
  The three men and two women arrested, aged between 51 and 97, allegedly stole a total of around 2.5 kilometres of copper pipes in 22 different cases between January and March.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officers said the suspects took the pipes from parks and back alleys and sold them for money. They were arrested at a recycling shop in Tai Kok Tsui on suspicion of theft and handling stolen goods on Tuesday night.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police called on recycling shop owners to watch out for suspicious sellers.

<img alt="The privacy watchdog says a total of 109,002 people may have been affected by a Companies Registry data leak in April. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795447_1_20250312193702.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The privacy watchdog said on Wednesday it completed an investigation on last April's Companies Registry data leak, which affected nearly 110,000 people.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data (PCPD) said there is insufficient evidence to show that the registry contravened Hong Kong’s data protection guidelines.
  <br>
  <br>
  It launched the probe after the registry discovered that people might be able to see extra personal details, such as ID card numbers, on its e-Search services if they tapped a certain key.
  <br>
  <br>
  In its report, the PCPD said the risk of “unauthorised or accidental access” to personal data of the affected people is “relatively low”, and that security measures were enhanced when the registry revamped its system.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The PCPD noted that the additional personal data involved was not directly displayed on the search result pages. Searchers needed to take additional steps or procedures through tools such as web developer tools or [a] robotic search to access the relevant data,” the watchdog said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Furthermore, there is also no evidence to suggest that any additional personal data had been subject to improper access,” it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The PCPD also noted that the registry had appointed an independent third party to review the relevant system.

<img alt="Ivan Lin hopes any price increment for 16 weeks worth of medication at public hospitals could be less than 10 percent, saying that would hurt members of the grassroots. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795440_1_20250312174458.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A community group on Wednesday welcomed the Hospital Authority’s new arrangement to cut the amount of medication distributed to patients.
 <br>
  <br>
  It also said any possible fee increase should be limited to 10 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Starting March 24, patients discharged from hospitals and those at specialist outpatient and general clinics will only get up to 24 weeks of medication each time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ivan Lin, a community organiser from the Society for Community Organisation (SoCO), noted that there are various reasons causing drug wastage.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said, for instance, the long gap between each consultation meant patients didn't have the opportunity to talk to medical professionals if they suffer from unexpected side effects.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hospital Authority also said it was reviewing the HK$15 charge for 16 weeks of medication.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lin hopes any increase would be below 10 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  “For grassroots patients, it’s very difficult to get a fee waiver,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “And also for, perhaps, lower middle class patients, it’s an ongoing expense, and some of the specific drugs are more expensive, way more than HK$15. So it’s still financial pressure for the lower middle class.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Lin suggested expanding the fee waiver to cover Old Age Living Allowance recipients aged 65 or above, rather than the current threshold of 75 or above, and to also include recipients of the Working Family Allowance Scheme.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lin also pointed out that the move to deliver medicine to patients' doorsteps since the service was implemented two years ago was "a good policy".
  <br>
  <br>
  But he said the delivery fee of HK$65 poses a burden for grassroots patients.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, medical sector lawmaker Dr David Lam has suggested the authority should set up a multidisciplinary team comprising of public hospital doctors and pharmacists from community pharmacies.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The pharmacist will give [the patients] a more detailed explanation on how to use the drugs," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And there should also be an opportunity for the patient to go back and see the pharmacist after taking the new medicine...[when they] can ask the pharmacist about some worries [they] might have after taking that medicine."

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong’s privacy watchdog said on Wednesday it launched a compliance check on Deliveroo to ensure the personal data of its customers and food couriers will not be leaked.
 <br>
  <br>
  The online food delivery firm on Monday announced it will quit the Hong Kong market, and sell some of its assets to rival foodpanda.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Privacy Commissioner’s Office said in a statement that Deliveroo’s closure may affect the personal data of its customers and riders.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The compliance check has been commenced to ensure that the personal data concerned would not be misused, leaked or fall into the hands of fraudsters for fraudulent activities,” it said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  It added it will assist relevant merchants, including foodpanda, in handling, deleting or transferring the personal data in compliance with data protection laws.

 Police on Wednesday said they arrested three men who are suspected of stealing electronic devices from a Hong Kong Disneyland warehouse, and handling stolen goods.
 <br>
  <br>
  Sources told RTHK the items included computer routers and TV remote controls stored in 18 boxes, and are worth about HK$3 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  RTHK understands that when officers went through surveillance footage, they found that a man had been to the warehouse earlier this month and he was driving a car registered under a warehouse staff member.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sources said police suspect that the electronic goods were taken away in several rounds, and later sold to a recycling company in Sham Shui Po.
  <br>
  <br>
  They also said the arrestees are aged between 23 and 28, and that two of them are connected to the recycling firm, while the remaining person works at the warehouse.
  <br>
  <br>
  In response, Hong Kong Disneyland said that none of the suspects are its employees, and it would fully cooperate with the police investigation.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The convenor of the Path of Democracy, Ronny Tong, on Wednesday said people are confident about the One Country, Two Systems principle, despite Hong Kong facing a deficit and geopolitical tensions.
 <br>
  <br>
  Tong made the remarks as his organisation unveiled the latest figures from its One Country, Two Systems Index – based on a local survey conducted by the Chinese University of Hong Kong, as well as data from international think tanks – which covered the last six months of 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  The index found that people generally have a positive view on the SAR’s governance model, with a score of 6.14 out of 10, a 0.5 percent drop from the previous round.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I think despite the rather negative news about the deficit, about a general economic situation, in particular the geopolitical situation, Hong Kong people are still rather confident that One Country, Two Systems would continue beyond 2047, and I think that itself is rather reassuring”, Tong said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I think the index speaks volumes about how they look at One Country, Two Systems, that although there is a slight decline, they still think the future is good.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The index also found that people’s sense of belonging to Hong Kong generally held steady.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nearly 84 percent of respondents said they have no plans to emigrate, slightly down from last round’s 84.1 percent.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Wednesday hinted that the city could double the funds raised for its initial public offering (IPO) market this year compared to that of last year, as optimism over the nation’s tech sector grows.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chan made the remarks in a speech, during which he noted that the SAR will ramp up efforts to woo leading firms to list here.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm pleased to report that our IPO market has regained momentum. Last year, we raised some US$11 billion, ranking fourth globally," he told participants.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This year, we are benefiting from optimism in the tech sector, and the continued support from the central authorities in encouraging leading mainland companies to list on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. We are expecting to raise some US$17 to $20 billion this year."
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, Chan noted that Hong Kong is on track to become a leading global technological and innovation centre.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said while the city's innovation and technology sectors are growing, the transition to become a leading tech hub will not be complete without the development of the Northern Metropolis, which will link the SAR with the "innovation powerhouse" that is the Greater Bay Area.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Shenzhen-Hong Kong-Guangzhou science and technology cluster has been ranked second globally in innovation by the World Intellectual Property Organization for each of the past five years," Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Northern Metropolis will support Hong Kong's synergistic development with our sister cities in the GBA. Bordering Shenzhen and spanning nearly one third of the total landmass of Hong Kong, it comprises a 300-hectare I&T cluster that will be home to many strategic tech enterprises," he added.

  More than 90,000 people have been granted visas of up to three years under the scheme since its launch at the end of 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sun said the government is currently handling visa-renewal requests by more than 300 people who are here under the talent scheme.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that about 10,000 visas are going to expire by the middle of the year.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We will analyse the situation by then." Sun said. "We think things will be more accurate and provide a much clearer picture regarding the situation about the talent's visa renewal, jobs and contributions to Hong Kong. There will be more data. But even with such small number of renewals at the moment, we are still satisfied with how things are going,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The scheme allows successful applicants to stay in the SAR without proof of employment during their first visa granted under the talent scheme.
  <br>
  <br>
  For renewals, top talents also don't need to show a work contract, although they have to demonstrate their contributions to the city, such as by showing their income or other forms of economic benefits that their work brought.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Cathay Pacific Airways on Wednesday reported marginal full-year profit growth as airfares fell amid intense competition at a time when Asia's airlines are continuing to get back to pre-pandemic seat capacity.
 <br>
  <br>
  The city’s flagship airline posted a one percent rise in its group net profit of HK$9.89 billion for the year ended December 31, supported by elevated cargo demand, more passengers, lower fuel prices and cost efficiencies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shares in the Hong Kong-listed airline jumped almost four percent to their highest since May 2019 just after the results were announced.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cathay Pacific's full-service airline, however, saw its annual yield, a proxy for airfares, fall 12 percent, while yields at the group's fully owned low-cost carrier HK Express fell 23 percent year on year.
  <br>
  <br>
  HK Express reported a full-year loss of HK$400 million compared to a profit of HK$433 million in 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cathay attributed the drops at HK Express to intense competition on regional routes pushing airfares down and industry-wide issues with the Pratt & Whitney engines that power its Airbus A320neo planes, which grounded some aircraft in 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A path to sustained profitability can be expected as [HK Express] continues to grow and increase its efficiencies," Cathay said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The airline's cargo yields, meanwhile, rose three percent year on year and the airline carried 11 percent more cargo tonnage, although Cathay warned that developing global trade conflicts could pose challenges to its freight business.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Given the global geopolitical situation, we are cautiously monitoring any short-term impacts on air cargo demand," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a press conference, Cathay's chief customer and commercial officer,  Lavinia Lau, noted that shifts in global trade policies, such as de minimis changes, have increased uncertainties over the cargo market.
  <br>
  <br>
  She pointed out that the airline has contingency plans to handle unexpected changes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have always built in flexibility in our business, meaning that if we see demand from a certain country or region having changes, we can always shift our network and flights to other parts of the world," she said. (Additional reporting by Reuters)

    'Measures to cut construction costs to come this year'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Development secretary Bernadette Linn said reviewing construction standards and centralising procurement of materials are among concrete measures that the government will take to lower costs.
 <br>
  <br>
  Her bureau had conducted research last year on why construction costs are high by comparing projects here with those in other major cities around the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on RTHK's Overview Policy programme on Wednesday, Linn said it's been quite some time since officials had taken a look at local construction standards, such as those on design and use of materials.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the past, our standards tended to be closer to those in the UK or the European Union. But  construction industries in many places in the world now have their own development," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We can take reference from more places, including the mainland of course, and the advantage of this is that we can then turn them into our own standards and possibly open up more markets and sources [of materials] for ourselves."
  <br>
  <br>
  Linn stressed that suppressing local wages is not a way to lower costs, describing it as a hot potato social issue.
  <br>
  <br>
  But she added that by this year, officials will start on the central procurement of certain construction materials, as well as cutting red tape for project approvals.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The government uses a similar bunch of construction materials for a project, or a series of projects, such as steel. So we can centralise the procurement and buy in bulk at cheaper prices," Linn said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As for streamlining the project approval process, we don't give empty promises, we'll look to come up with concrete measures to streamline the administrative process in the coming months."
  <br>
  <br>
  She said the time-saving move for administrative procedures comes after legal changes in 2023 to compress the statutory time needed for project approvals.

    Social workers board 'to review applications by law'

<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Labour and Welfare Chris Sun said on Wednesday he believes the Social Workers Registration Board will review any renewal application as required by law.
 <br>
  <br>
  Sun was speaking a day after social worker Jackie Chen was convicted of rioting during the 2019 protests.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to the board’s website, Chen’s registration as a social worker expired last month and that her renewal application is being considered.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The Social Workers Registration Ordinance states clearly that if certain designated offences are committed, the Social Workers Registration Board will fulfill its duties. I firmly believe the board will handle renewal applications in accordance with the law and the regulations, including Chen’s request,” Sun said after attending a radio programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ordinance states that the board may refuse to register people who committed a crime that “may bring the profession of social worker into disrepute and is punishable with imprisonment” as a social worker.
  <br>
  <br>
  Social workers who commit more serious offences, including murder, rape, as well as any offence endangering national security will be permanently removed from the registration list.

    HA to cut medication dispensed to patients

<img alt="The Hospital Authority's chief pharmacist William Chui said around one-fifth of patients do not finish their medication. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795358_1_20250312090613.jpg&q=45">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hospital Authority said on Wednesday it was working on reducing the amount of medicine distributed to patients to reduce wastage.
 <br>
  <br>
  It said this applied in particular to long-term medications or those taken only when necessary.
  <br>
  <br>
  The authority's chief pharmacist William Chui said such measures were needed as around one-fifth of patients did not finish their medication.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Most of the non-adherence of patients is due to the forgetfulness. The second reason is because they are afraid of the side effect of the medication, and the third reason is because their symptoms improved, so they stop it by themselves," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under the first phase of its new arrangement from March 24, patients will be dispensed a maximum of 24 weeks drug supply each time. For medications exceeding that limit, patients will have to pick up their prescription in person at another time.
  <br>
  <br>
  For drugs prescribed when needed, such as painkillers, patients will receive no more than 25 percent of the total amount if the prescription is longer than 28 days.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the second phase of the arrangement - set to be implemented by the fourth quarter of this year - some 'use only when needed' drugs will be dispensed for up to eight weeks.
  <br>
  <br>
  The authority predicted that such measures could help reduce medical expenses and allow pharmacists to follow-up on a patient's drug usage.
  <br>
  <br>
  The authority added that there was room for price adjustments, namely the HK$15 paid for 16 weeks' worth of medicine.
  <br>
  <br>
  "At present, [the fee] is highly subsidised by the governmen," Chui said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Any savings from the medication or any savings from the fees and charges will be converted to the listing of new drugs, and also subsidise serious disease drug treatment," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The authority said it's in discussions with officials regarding fee adjustments. It said it would submit a proposal to the government after completing a review.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) on Tuesday said it is investigating a cluster of gastroenteritis involving 52 teachers and students who participated in exchange tours to Shaoguan in Guangdong province earlier this month.
 <br>
  <br>
  They developed symptoms from March 3 to 10. Sixteen of them sought medical attention though none required hospitalisation.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CHP said the teachers and students – from three secondary schools – had dined at the same restaurants.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said some of them may have been infected by eating contaminated food, while others may have contracted gastroenteritis through person-to-person transmission or a contaminated environment.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CHP has notified authorities in Guangdong of the restaurants involved.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A senior member of a leading national think tank on Tuesday said the annual "Two Sessions" which just wrapped up in Beijing showed China's emphasis on the economy and innovation amid Sino-US tensions.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lau Siu-kai, a consultant to the Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macau Studies, said Beijing has shifted its focus from export and infrastructure to consumption and innovation technology.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Basically the emphasis is still on the economy, particularly at a time when the world economy is in a poor state and that China is under containment by the United States. That's why China is very desperate to change the course of economic development," he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  In his annual work report, Premier Li Qiang called on Hong Kong to "deepen international exchanges and cooperation" while safeguarding the constitutional order.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lau highlighted the SAR's role in helping Beijing develop connections beyond Western countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Both China and Hong Kong today, in order to shake off the constraints imposed on us by the United States and its Western allies, we have to explore new opportunities for development from the non-Western world," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That's why China wants Hong Kong as an international city with widespread international linkages to help both Hong Kong itself and China to develop more connections with other places apart from the Western world."
  <br>
  <br>
  Looking ahead to the 15th Five-Year Plan that begins next year, Lau stressed the need for the city to align its development plan with the nation's strategy.
  <br>
  <br>
  During the weeklong "Two Sessions", the National People's Congress Standing Committee released a work report stating that Beijing will formulate the private economy promotion law to strengthen legal protection and policy support for private enterprises.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lau said he believes Beijing is stepping up support for and giving a bigger role to private companies, to put them on an equal footing with state enterprises.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Most importantly, Beijing will allow the private enterprises to have a much larger market within China, and to help them explore the opportunities abroad," he said.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The judiciary said on Tuesday it will start webcasting some proceedings at Hong Kong's top court from April 1, as part of a pilot scheme.
 <br>
  <br>
  It said certain types of Court of Final Appeal hearings will not be part of the two-year scheme.
  <br>
  <br>
  These include cases involving national security, commercial confidentiality, children or the mentally disabled, as well as those deemed to be "highly politically charged" or "high-profile public order cases".
  <br>
  <br>
  "Open justice is a key to maintaining public confidence in the judicial system and upholding the rule of law," the judiciary said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Live broadcasting of judicial proceedings beyond court premises will enhance the transparency of court procedures and strengthen public confidence in the judicial process."
  <br>
  <br>
  People will be able to watch the livestreams on the top court's website, but they are not allowed to record them or use the footage for any purpose, it said, adding that the media is no exception to this rule.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hearings will be kept online for a month.
  <br>
  <br>
  The upcoming pilot scheme comes after the top court conducted four webcast test runs last year.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Social worker Jackie Chen was on Tuesday convicted of rioting in Wan Chai during the 2019 protests, following a retrial.
 <br>
  <br>
  She will be sentenced next month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chen was accused of taking part in a riot on August 31, 2019, when protestors set up roadblocks with debris in Wan Chai and clashed with police. In 2020, a District Court judge ruled that she had no case to answer. The Department of Justice then lodged an appeal, leading to the retrial.
  <br>
  <br>
  In her ruling, Deputy District Judge May Chung said Chen chose not to leave the scene even though she clearly knew that it had turned into a dangerous riot.
  <br>
  <br>
  The judge said the defendant kept shouting false accusations against the police while they were dispersing protesters, prompting others to stick around and continue confronting officers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chung said the only reasonable explanation is that Chen intended to participate in the riot and encourage other people to engage in actions that undermined social order.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chen had pleaded not guilty and said she was trying to mediate.
  <br>
  <br>
  She did not testify in the latest trial.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 48-year-old is now on remand, and the court has been adjourned until April 3 for mitigation and April 9 for sentencing.

    'No plans for a comprehensive tax-regime review'

 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Tuesday said the government does not plan to conduct a comprehensive review on the SAR's tax regime in the near term, despite calls to introduce new sources of revenue to tackle the city’s deficit.
 <br>
  <br>
  He was responding to questions at a luncheon held by the Hong Kong Coalition of Professional Services in Wan Chai, where he also elaborated on his budget proposals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said the government is very cautious in its approach to adjusting the tax system, as competition remains intense with neighbouring regions to woo global talent and investments.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We believe that at this point, the most important [task] for the society is to concentrate our energy on developing the economy, to fend off external risks, so we do not want to distract our minds at this time, to ignite other controversies due to discussions over the tax regime," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, the finance minister said he expects the government to make extra cash in the coming financial year if Hong Kong's stock market continues to climb in the coming months.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SAR’s stock market has experienced a revival since the start of the year, with the average daily turnover for the first two months of 2025 at about HK$220 billion, an increase of 138 percent compared with HK$93 billion for the same period last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When I was calculating for the budget… I was assuming that the daily average stock turnover will be about HK$110 billion, but now we are talking about HK$200 billion," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Every HK$100 billion of turnover brings me about HK$130 million of stock stamp duty, so that's about 10 percent of the total. And if the daily average turnover is about HK$200 billion, that means we'll get an extra HK$130 million of revenue each day, and there are 250 [trading] days in a year, which will be a lot of money," he added.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A mainland man was jailed for three months on Tuesday, after pleading guilty to using fake academic qualifications to gain a spot in a Chinese University (CUHK) postgraduate programme.
 <br>
  <br>
  Bao Junyang, 30, admitted to obtaining services by deception at Shatin Court.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prosecutors dropped a separate charge of using a false statement to obtain an entry permit against the defendant.
  <br>
  <br>
  The court heard that Bao claimed to have graduated from New York University, and managed to gain admission to CUHK's Master of Business Administration programme around two years ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  Acting principal magistrate Cheang Kei-hong rejected the defence's plea for a community service order, saying it would be unrealistic.
  <br>
  <br>
  The magistrate gave one third of a discount for the jail sentence due to the guilty plea.

    'Restaurants may need to pay more to delivery firms'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A catering sector representative on Tuesday said he was concerned restaurants would need to pay higher fees for using delivery platforms in future.
 <br>
  <br>
  This came a day after online food delivery platform Deliveroo announced it would shut down its Hong Kong operations next month, leaving Foodpanda and mainland-based Keeta in the sector.
  <br>
  <br>
  Simon Wong, president of the Hong Kong Federation of Restaurants and Related Trades, said eateries might still get away with paying less for the moment, but that would probably not continue.
  <br>
  <br>
  “In the short term, I believe there will be intense competition between the two companies, Foodpanda and Keeta. But in the end when they find a balance where neither can defeat the other, then restaurants may have to accept that there will be fewer discounts,” he told an RTHK radio programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, a marketing professor from Hang Seng University said the delivery market in Hong Kong is saturated and the city could only accommodate two to three delivery platforms at most.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kenneth Kwong told the same programme that delivery platforms need to think of other forms of business opportunities.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The delivery platform operators should come up with new ideas, for example working more closely with restaurants, as well as expanding their business. Can they also deliver household items as well? I think this will open up more space for development in the market,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The scholar thinks Deliveroo made the decision to exit Hong Kong market purely on commercial considerations.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the operating costs for delivery platforms are quite high as they need to update their software and hardware on a regular basis.

    'Snooker hiccup not a problem for National Games'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A local deputy to the National People's Congress has stressed that Hong Kong is ready to co-host its first National Games in November, despite a recent hiccup at a major snooker tournament in Kai Tak.
 <br>
  <br>
  Herman Hu, a former vice-president of the Sports Federation and Olympic Committee of Hong Kong, China, told RTHK in an exclusive interview in Beijing that the organisers had "learned a lesson" after spectators were booted before the end of a match.
  <br>
  <br>
  The newly-opened Kai Tak Sports Park - the venue from where fans enjoying the World Snooker Grand Prix were ejected - is set to host a number of National Games competitions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm quite sure that [the Kai Tak Sports Park] is already ready," said Hu.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on the sidelines of the "Two Sessions" in the capital, he said organisers could learn from what happened during the snooker tournament.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That is not a big problem. I’m sure all the people concerned have ways to tackle that," Hu said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Over 13 days later this year, Hong Kong will host the nation's top athletes in cycling, fencing, rugby sevens, beach volleyball, golf, triathlon, men's handball and men's under-22 basketball.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hu urged officials to better promote these sports and educate the public on "how to appreciate" the competitions, such as organising district tournaments.
  <br>
  <br>
  Additionally, the SAR will help organise cross-border events, including a marathon and road cycling competition.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to Hu, there was room for further collaboration with counterparts across the border.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I personally had a conversation with the Guangdong province's sports bureau and they welcome us to go there anytime. And especially they have a lot more facilities and high-quality coaches, world-class athletes, that can work with our youngsters," Hu said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zhaoqing, one of nine municipalities which make up the Greater Bay Area along with Hong Kong and Macau, will kick-start test events in May.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a written response to RTHK, Zhaoqing mayor Xu Xiaoxiong said the authorities were fully pushing forward preparatory work "in a state similar to a 100-metre sprint".
  <br>
  <br>
  Xu also said the Games could attract 150,000 spectators and tourists to the city, bringing in hundreds of millions of yuan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities from Shantou, a coastal city in eastern Guangdong which will also get a piece of the action, saw the Games as an "important opportunity" to promote regional cooperation and enhance its influence.

    Deficit not a big problem for HK: Wang Linggui

<div class="itemFullText">
 A deputy director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office on Monday said he does not believe the SAR's fiscal deficit is a major concern, citing the size of the city's economy.
 <br>
  <br>
  Wang Linggui, who's also a member of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), felt Hong Kong remains in a strong position despite an estimated deficit of HK$87.2 billion in the fiscal year ending March 31.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong's economic situation is not weak among developed economies in the world. Its economic growth exceeded two percent last year," he told reporters in Beijing.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A deficit of [around] HK$100 billion shouldn't be a big deal for an economy of Hong Kong's size."
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang noted the central government rolled out preferential policies for Hong Kong last year, adding more will come in the future.
  <br>
  <br>
  For instance, he said a multi-entry visa scheme will continue to expand to make it easier for mainland residents to visit the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he urged Hong Kong residents to be prepared for a rise in arrivals, including the need to draw up crowd control measures.

    Deliveroo to exit HK, sack 200 staff

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Online food delivery firm Deliveroo said on Monday it is exiting Hong Kong for financial reasons, after operating in the SAR for nine years.
 <br>
  <br>
  Its UK-based parent company said its service platform will run until April 7, and it will close Deliveroo's operations by selling some assets to rival foodpanda, and closing other assets.
  <br>
  <br>
  About 200 staff members will be laid off.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There are several dynamics specific to the Hong Kong market which led the Board to consider strategic options," Deliveroo said in a statement, without explaining what the dynamics were.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Given the Group's commitment to disciplined capital allocation, [we] determine that it would not serve shareholders' best interests to continue to operate in Hong Kong."
  <br>
  <br>
  The company's chief operating officer, Eric French, said the firm wants to thank all of its staff, consumers, riders and restaurant and grocery partners in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  Deliveroo said in its 2024 interim results that Hong Kong "was a laggard amongst our major markets", citing "a more difficult market and competitive environment".
  <br>
  <br>
  Its Hong Kong market share fell after the entry of mainland-based Keeta, a subsidiary of Meituan, in late 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  The company said on Monday that Hong Kong represented five percent of the group's gross transaction value in 2024, and had a five percentage point negative impact on international gross transaction value growth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, foodpanda's parent, Delivery Hero, announced it reached an agreement with Deliveroo, saying that some of the outgoing food courier's customers and riders will be directed to foodpanda.
  <br>
  <br>
  Delivery Hero had said in a trading update last month that it saw "strong customer growth" in the SAR in December. (Additional reporting by Reuters)

 Hong Kong will improve as long as everyone works together to tackle the fiscal deficit, a former deputy director of Beijing's liaison office in the SAR said on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Qiu Hong, who is also a member of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), said unity is important when it comes to improving the economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think the deficit is a challenge Hong Kong faces in its development progress. As long as everyone works together and makes a joint effort for Hong Kong's future, I believe the situation will definitely keep improving," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Qiu also expressed optimism about the city's future, noting that residents are actively taking part in national development and Hong Kong's growth.

 Hong Kong's finance and technology ministers on Monday welcomed a HK$200 million donation by property developers to support the city’s generative artificial intelligence development.
 <br>
  <br>
  The fund will be used to support the Hong Kong Generative AI Research and Development Centre (HKGAI), and to develop an app for the recently launched HKGAI V1, the SAR's first locally developed generative AI tool.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a press event during which the donation provided by the Ng Teng Fong Charitable Foundation and Sino Group was announced, Financial Secretary Paul Chan said Hong Kong must grasp opportunities brought by AI.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The donation will support the establishment of a service platform for the InnoHK Research Clusters to provide services for residents based on the locally-produced large [AI] model, HKGAI," he told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I look forward to the further development of the model, to extend the platform to cover more application scenarios, so that the services will be more diversified and benefit more local residents," Chan added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong launched the HKGAI V1 large model about two weeks ago. It powers a chatbot called HKChat which is capable of answering users' questions on topics ranging from the SAR's government structure to cinema schedules.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at the same event, the Secretary for Innovation, Technology and Industry, Sun Dong, added that the funds will help make the service platform more market-driven, and help the centre hire more staff.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When you try to run a service system to the general public, you must have enough resources to support this platform, including human power as well as computing power, I think this is the main purpose of this donation," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I also hope the new version, or the mobile version of the large language model of HKGAI will be able to serve Hong Kong people as soon as possible, hopefully in the next several months."
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, Sun dismissed concerns that the latest reduction in government spending announced in last month’s budget will affect research and innovation in technology.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said authorities will support those developments in a more targeted way.

 Four people were injured and one driver fled the scene following a three-vehicle collision in Shing Mun Tunnel early on Monday morning.
 <br>
  <br>
  Two private cars and a taxi collided while travelling towards Sha Tin at about 4am.
  <br>
  <br>
  An online photo showed the taxi had overturned, and significant damage to all three vehicles, including shattered windshields.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police said the 41-year-old female driver of one private car experienced neck pain, and her 27-year-old male passenger reported pain in the hand. Both were hospitalised.
  <br>
  <br>
  Also sent to hospital were the 53-year-old taxi driver – who had chest pain – and his 62-year-old passenger, who suffered abrasions to her head.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police said the driver of the other private car fled the scene.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Businessman Irons Sze on Monday said Hong Kong's position as an international financial centre is attributed to China's reform and opening up and reinforced by the "One Country, Two Systems" principle.
 <br>
  <br>
  Sze, a Standing Committee member of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), said the SAR plays a vital role in the country's development.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As of the end of 2024, 1,478 mainland enterprises were listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, accounting for more than 80 percent of the total market value and 90 percent of daily transactions," he told reporters in Beijing.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the shipping front, Sze said Hong Kong's ports handled 13 million standard containers in 2024, with 40 percent of cargo coming from the mainland and 60 percent destined for the mainland.
  <br>
  <br>
  He concluded by saying that Hong Kong's future lies in its integration with the mainland, and the city would continue to contribute to the nation's development with its unique advantages.

  , Leung said the city had to build on its unique strengths and expand its global role.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Apart from maintaining our existing niches of system, such as the legal system, the economic and financial system, we have to explore more opportunities in terms of tech and international relations," Leung said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is a unique role of Hong Kong and the message is very clear: we also have to maximise some of the uniqueness in One Country, Two Systems, such as becoming an international trade dispute centre, arbitration centre as well as the only bi-lingual system that practices common law."

    Unsold homes dampens interest for new sites: tycoon

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A property tycoon says he believes Hong Kong developers will take a "conservative" approach over acquiring new plots, noting such firms still had a lot of unsold units.
 <br>
  <br>
  In an exclusive interview with RTHK, David Chiu – who sits on the Standing Committee of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference – also said this year might see some unsuccessful government land tenders.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Far East Consortium chairman said given the ample supply in inventory, developers would not feel the need to purchase more sites, likening it to “taking a break from eating and clearing the system when one’s full".
  <br>
  <br>
  “I believe now the stock in hand by all the property developers collectively – stock that they want to sell – could be as high as 20,000 to 30,000 units,” he told RTHK on the sidelines of the Two Sessions in Beijing.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I think a lot of developers' minds today... with interest rates being so high... is how to reduce their gearing first.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The government has announced plans to put eight residential plots up for sale in the coming year, but not any commercial sites.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The good news is the government has stopped selling commercial land, which I think is sensible and smart. But we've still got close to 10 pieces of land they want to sell,” Chiu said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “My advice to the government... I would not be too aggressive.”
  <br>
  <br>
  While home prices in the SAR tumbled 7.1 percent in 2024, the businessman said the property market was not expected to weaken further.
  <br>
  <br>
  It would be “unlikely” for residential property prices to skyrocket, Chiu added.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The price should be stable. It's not going up because of two reasons. Number one, interest rates still remain high. Secondly, frankly, supply is still quite sufficient,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Chiu cautioned the commercial real estate market sentiment remained weak, with an oversupply of office buildings.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chiu, separately, is a proponent of taking part in the development of the Northern Metropolis, citing the cheaper costs and proximity to Shenzhen.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I believe the future growth of China… is the Greater Bay [Area]. One of the local motifs of the Greater Bay [Area] is Shenzhen,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We got the wisdom, we got the education, we got the capital market, but we haven’t gotten the people… We need China as a backup. So linking up [mainland Chinese] young people and Hong Kong’s young people on high-tech is going to be a fantastic marriage.”

<div class="itemFullText">
 Neil Robertson from Australia won the 2025 World Snooker Grand Prix on Sunday, delivering a dominant performance by whitewashing Stuart Bingham from England by a score of 10-frames-to-nil.
 <br>
  <br>
  It was Robertson's second championship title at the World Grand Prix.
  <br>
  <br>
  The final began at 1 pm, with Bingham already down 8-0 by the end of the first session.
  <br>
  <br>
  One spectator, Awlam, shared that this was his first time watching a snooker match, and he was excited about the whole experience.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Yes! Nice! It’s actually very nice. I’ve been here every day except for one. The sports park is absolutely amazing,” he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The whole development, including the stadium, the arena, the malls, and everything around it, is really impressive. I am very happy to see this.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Another spectator, Mr Chan, remarked that it was a great experience to watch snooker at the Kai Tak Arena, where the atmosphere was fantastic.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It’s big and beautiful; it’s quite nice. And it’s close to the MTR station.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The match resumed at 7:30 pm, and Robertson continued his impressive performance, winning two straight games and defeating Bingham 10-0.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier in the day, an exhibition match took place between Hong Kong's top player, Ng On-yee, and world number one Mink Nutcharut, with Nutcharut winning 2-0.

    Fans enjoy the atmosphere on the final day of LIV Golf

<img alt="Many fans told RTHK the all-star player roster was a big draw for them. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795008_1_20250309201219.jpg&q=80">

<div class="itemFullText">
 Spectators were immersed in what felt like a party-like atmosphere on the third and final day of the LIV Golf Hong Kong tournament, as the second edition of the event wrapped up in Fanling on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Fans told RTHK that the large number of star players included in the LIV Golf draw – a field that included six-time major winner Phil Mickelson and 2024 US Open champion Bryson DeChambeau – helped bring more fans to the historic Hong Kong Golf Club course.
  <br>
  <br>
  A man surnamed Mok, who was at the Hong Kong Golf Open in Fanling last November, said it was a big step-up from last year's inaugural competition.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think in the past, you might get one or two top names," he said. "Obviously, most of the LIV Golf roster are top players who won multiple majors. And I think that in itself is very attractive."
  <br>
  <br>
  He also commended the accessibility for fans and families travelling to the tournament, which he said helped draw much larger crowds than he expected.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Promoting [the tournament] is one thing, but it also needs to be accessible," Mok explained. "There's an effort to make it participatory, rather than just putting up the names. The big events will sell themselves, but giving people the chance to access it in an equitable way would be great."
  <br>
  <br>
  Another fan from Argentina, surnamed Caceres, shared his experience as a first-time spectator at a major golf tournament in the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think people in Hong Kong love their sports and these kinds of events," said Caceres, who attended both the second and final day of the competition. "There's rugby, tennis, and now golf events – and every time I go, lots of people [are attending]."
  <br>
  <br>
  Many young fans came to support some of their favourite players.
  <br>
  <br>
  A local fan who was at last year's edition of the tournament, surnamed Nandwani, was at the event to see Australia's Cameron Smith in action.
  <br>
  <br>
  "People come in [from overseas] to watch this event. I think it's just a great thing to have... it's a great thing as a whole for the community to show up."

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Sergio Garcia of Spain on Sunday carded a seven-under 63 to take home the LIV Golf Hong Kong tournament crown in Fanling, as the 45-year-old claimed his second career individual title on the men's golf tour.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Spaniard kickstarted his bid for a maiden victory in the SAR with an impressive early eagle on the par-5 third hole, before recording four consecutive birdies on the 8th to 11th holes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 35-time international tournament winner added a fifth birdie on the 16th to seal the three-shot victory in a thrilling final round.
  <br>
  <br>
  "My goal at the beginning of the day was to shoot five under," Garcia said after his individual win. "It was solid. I played very well, I gave myself a lot of chances throughout the whole day."
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'll admit I had a couple of bad swings, but I managed to get away with them and recover nicely," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Garcia edged out Dean Burmester of South Africa and American Phil Mickelson, who finished 15-under-par and 14-under-par respectively, to round out the podium.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the festivities for Garcia didn't stop there.
  <br>
  <br>
  Team Fireballs GC, led by Garcia, came out on top of the Team event – securing a double for the Spaniard.
  <br>
  <br>
  The team finished one stroke ahead of Stinger GC, who carded a 37-under-par.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was nice to see that not only was I doing well in leading the tournament, but also that my teammates were playing great," Garcia said of his team, which includes last year's LIV Golf Hong Kong champion Abraham Ancer.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They were keeping us there with a chance to win. Obviously, when you can pull off a double, it's a lot sweeter than if it's just one of them – so I'm very proud of them."
  <br>
  <br>
  Both the sports minister, Rosanna Law, who attended the event, and LIV Golf say they strongly intend to make the tournament an annual showcase in Hong Kong. Law said the sides are close to an agreement, but they're still working out the details.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tournament in Hong Kong was the third stop of the LIV Golf 2025 season, before it heads to Singapore from March 14 to 16.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A rule banning spectators from bringing water bottles into competition venues at Kai Tak Sports Park should be relaxed to reduce waste, a green group said, after noticing exemptions were given to certain guests.
 <br>
  <br>
  Greenpeace campaigner Leanne Tam told RTHK on Sunday that during the World Snooker Grand Prix at Kai Tak Arena, a VIP ticket holder was seen using their own bottle, an otherwise prohibited item for the general audience.
  <br>
  <br>
  She added that other spectators from the VIP section were even handed bottled water, generating unnecessary waste.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I do think that their security problem is the most important issue. When the Kai Tak Sports Park keep [repeating] that you cannot bring your own bottle and water bottle is not safe enough, but you can see that in the venue, the event organiser will freely distribute the plastic water bottle [with a] cap," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think actually there's no so-called safety issue in that situation because in the whole event, I can feel that it's so safe. It doesn't become dangerous when the VIP have their water bottle in their seats."
  <br>
  <br>
  Tam suggested that if water bottles are indeed considered a safety risk, the park should immediately introduce a reusable cup regime.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If...the organiser really wants to keep their balance between the safety and user experience and also the environmental protection issue, we suggest that they should have a reusable cup service to all the guests in the venue," she urged.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You can freely use it to fill water in your own cup and it's safe because it's without a cap, and it's purchased by the venue so it's under the safety regulations."
  <br>
  <br>
  The environmental campaigner added that the idea had been implemented before, including the Rugby Sevens at Hong Kong Stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  Similar venues overseas also provide a reusable option for attendees, she noted, and Kai Tak Sports Park should be able to follow suit.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Seventeen large cruise ships will visit Hong Kong this month, according to Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism Rosanna Law.
 <br>
  <br>
  These include the newly built luxury cruises "Silver Nova" and "Queen Anne".
  <br>
  <br>
  This weekend, four cruise ships are visiting the SAR which the Hong Kong Tourism Board said will attract 5,400 tourists.
  <br>
  <br>
  Law said on social media that cruise guests will be arranged to join trips covering the Kai Tak Sports Park, among other locations.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said officials will utilise the Kai Tai Cruise Terminal and its surrounding infrastructure, as Hong Kong works towards developing its cruise-tourism sector.

    'Improve doctors' training at new medical school'

<img alt="Two patients' groups unveil findings of their survey on Hong Kong's third medical school. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1794994_1_20250309165758.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Two patients' groups on Sunday gave their thoughts on the city's future medical school, hoping it would improve training for doctors and minimise the risk of mishaps.
 <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong has announced plans to build a third medical school, and the University of Science and Technology, City University and Polytechnic University have expressed their interest.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two patients' groups conducted a survey of 537 people in the past month, involving chronically ill patients or the disabled, as well as caregivers.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to the Patients' Alliance On Healthcare Reform and the Alliance for Patients' Mutual Help Organizations, the respondents emphasised the importance of better training for doctors, especially on the use of Chinese medicine and on handling patients with special needs such as those with autism.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Patients' Alliance On Healthcare Reform said because of a lack of centralised training, patients with different levels of autism often need to go from doctor to doctor, which is time-consuming and inconvenient.
  <br>
  <br>
  The group also said in light of a recent spate of medical incidents, the new medical school should increase research on technology to help prevent blunders in future.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to the study, the new medical school should also be closely connected with international medical institutions and complement Hong Kong's two existing medical schools.
  <br>
  <br>
  Local universities interested in running the new medical school are to submit their proposals by March 17, and a member of the Patients' Alliance On Healthcare Reform, Theresa Chu, urged the universities to take their findings into consideration.
  <br>
  <br>
  'We hope that our information and our analysis would be given just in time to highlight what are the expectations of the patients' groups and also the general community, with regard to what they're going to deliver in the future.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Maybe they will reassess, or adjust, or modify their approach, and this will likely (allow them to rethink) to present a more comprehensive picture to the assessment board,' Chu said.

    'Non-recurrent social welfare spending can be reduced'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Labour and Welfare Chris Sun said there's room for non-recurrent social welfare expenditure to go down.
 <br>
  <br>
  In the budget last month, the government said all departments need to cut spending by an accumulative 7 percent until the 2027-28 fiscal year, and the same applies to funding for some 170 social welfare organisations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking after attending a TVB programme on Sunday, Sun said more flexible and creative use of non-recurrent funding could be part of the solution.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I don't see room for further adjustment in terms of recurrent spending," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But as you all know, there is non-recurrent spending, such as the HK$20 billion quota approved by the Legco Finance Committee earmarked for buying space," he told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Say, we can buy units on higher floors that could be cheaper, so that facilities for youth and family purposes can move up there and free up space on the lower floors for elderly or children services."
  <br>
  <br>
  Sun stressed that officials have been helping the social welfare sector by, for example, using more technology and streamlining procedures to cut down on administrative work, so organisations can focus on providing services.

    Fleet taxis do not have to charge by meter: govt

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Commuters who reserve a ride from a licensed taxi fleet will have the option of negotiating a fare with the driver and not pay by the meter, according to the transport chief.
 <br>
  <br>
  Mable Chan added there will be oversight to ensure fleet operators keep their rates to a reasonable level, while authorities will roll out specific measures to help them pick up passengers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a Commercial Radio programme on Sunday, Chan explained that people who flag down a fleet taxi on the street only have to pay the normal rate. For an urban cab, that means a base fare of HK$29 plus the incremental charge.
  <br>
  <br>
  But when they book a ride online or over the phone, both sides are allowed to negotiate a fixed fare similar to a "charter" arrangement, she added. Alternatively, passengers can still opt for the meter rate, plus a booking fee.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked if the fixed fare can be set below the meter rate, Chan called for "caution", but it is ultimately a business decision by the operators. She also stressed that regulatory supervision will be in place to ensure that fares remain reasonable and are not set excessively high.
  <br>
  <br>
  Additionally, Chan noted that the Transport Department has earmarked 13 dedicated pick-up points for fleet taxis. Nine of these spots are ready, and they can mostly be found at boundary control points, as well as the airport, the high-speed rail station and the Kai Tak Cruise Terminal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Regarding service quality, the transport minister noted that passengers who are not happy with the service can rate their drivers on the online ride-hailing platform. Fleet managers are required to monitor such feedback.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Technology will also be used with in-vehicle monitoring systems checking whether drivers are driving safely and whether there are any service problems," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  She also said that taxi fleets are encouraged to devise strategies and find ways to serve different needs in the market, such as passengers with disabilities and those with luggage.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan said on Sunday that Hong Kong must closely link its development with that of the country's, as the SAR actively integrates into the nation's growth.
 <br>
  <br>
  Writing on his weekly blog, Chan said as all eyes are on the "Two Sessions" meetings in Beijing, the SAR also needs to expedite work in three areas to align with China's development.
  <br>
  <br>
  One is to speed up the technological drive and innovation for economic growth, and another is to unleash more local consumption potential by creating new experiences in spending.
  <br>
  <br>
  The third, the minister said, is for Hong Kong to deepen international cooperation and exchanges.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan noted that on the mainland, digital-economic industries have grown to around 10 percent of GDP, with expansion in new industries and businesses.
  <br>
  <br>
  "From AI models, online games, the use of robots to animation movies, there are constant breakthroughs on the mainland in terms of science, technology and cultural industries," he wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Many new creative startups were born out of nowhere, and this is inspiring."
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister said Hong Kong needs to integrate the spirit of the "Two Sessions" into its social-economic development, so as to contribute more to the nation's rejuvenation.

 Each Legislative Council election should be better than the previous one, according to a senior Beijing official overseeing Hong Kong affairs, who also stressed the SAR needs “capable, responsible and accomplished” individuals to serve the city.
 <br>
  <br>
  Wang Linggui, deputy director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, said the city should add more talent not only in the political arena but also innovation and technology.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong is expected to hold its next polls for the legislature in December this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  “In the new stage of transitioning from stability to prosperity, Hong Kong needs people who are capable, responsible and accomplished, to seek the best for the general public of Hong Kong,” Wang told RTHK on Sunday on the sidelines of the “Two Sessions” in Beijing.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Each Legislative Council election should be better than the previous one. Just like the Olympic Games, there is never the best, only better. Being ‘good’ is a goal that should be constantly pursued.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang added that he believes Hong Kong authorities would consult different sectors, including local deputies to the National People’s Congress and the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference, on the upcoming polls.

 Hong Kong and Macau delegates to the country's top political advisory body said the two SARs should make good use of their advantages under the One Country, Two Systems principle.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a plenary meeting of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) on Sunday, Hong Kong delegate Tu Haiming said the One Country, Two Systems principle helps Hong Kong and Macau maintain their long-term prosperity and stability.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the first phase of its implementation has been completed, but some people still don't have a deep understanding about the principle.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Entering a new phase, the advantages of One Country, Two Systems should be realised through vitalisation and an increase in volume. We not only have to develop Hong Kong, contribute to the country and bring the country together, but also have to benefit the world,” Tu said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Through deepening the understanding of the One Country, Two Systems principle in the new phase, we have to further enhance the sense of responsibility and mission of Hong Kong society.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Macau CPPCC delegate Lao Nga-wong, meanwhile, said Macau is an example of the successful implementation of the One Country, Two Systems.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Macau should use its advantages in reinforcing connection with both the mainland and the world… and build the SAR into another international passage besides Hong Kong,” he said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The director of the central government's liaison office, Zheng Yanxiong, on Saturday said Hong Kong should take the “One Country, Two Systems” principle to a new level, and strive for better development.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to Hong Kong deputies to the National People’s Congress (NPC) in Beijing, Zheng said President Xi Jinping made the remarks when meeting Jiangsu deputies, asking them to promote scientific and technological innovation.
  <br>
  <br>
  The director said the remarks were also meaningful for Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Hong Kong must focus on reform and innovation and walk on the new path of developing new quality productive forces,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zheng said Hong Kong should consolidate and enhance its status as the so-called “three centres”, and as an international hub for tertiary education, and innovation and technology.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the SAR should safeguard national security, pursue economic growth and advance development, as pointed out by Vice Premier Ding Xuexiang.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zheng added that Hong Kong should fully leverage its advantages under the “One Country, Two Systems” principle, and speed up the process of advancing to prosperity.

 Two former world champions, Shaun Murphy of England and Neil Robertson of Australia, put on a show for fans at the Kai Tak Arena on Saturday.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The chairwoman of Gree Electrics on Saturday said private enterprises need continuous innovation and technological investment to thrive.
 <br>
  <br>
  Dong Mingzhu, who's also a deputy to the National People's Congress (NPC), said the country has long supported private enterprises through various forms of assistance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters in Beijing, Dong said her company's trade-in policy helps consumers gain a better understanding of household appliances and improves safety awareness.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xiang Wenbo, NPC deputy and chairman of SANY Heavy Industry, which earlier announced plans to list in Hong Kong, said the timing is favourable given the current capital market conditions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xiang added that he believes listing in the SAR will speed up his company's international development.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong officials on Saturday said they will learn from the spirit of "Two Sessions" and stressed the importance of unity in advancing the SAR's development.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a Facebook post, Civil Service Secretary Ingrid Yeung said her team was inspired by the speech of Vice Premier Ding Xuexiang.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeung stressed the civil service's role in implementing One Country, Two Systems, highlighting the importance of using technology in government operations.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Health Bureau said the city is making use of its advantages under One Country, Two Systems to attract medical professionals and help Chinese medicine reach international markets.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, home and youth affairs chief Alice Mak said she will work with care teams and district councillors to promote the spirit of Two Sessions at grassroots level.
  <br>
  <br>
  On her Facebook page, cultural, sports and tourism minister Rosanna Law said Premier Li Qiang's work report has provided important direction for the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  Law outlined plans to implement the Blueprint for Arts and Culture and Creative Industries Development, enhance cultural exchanges and organise major sporting events, including the National Games in November.
  <br>
  <br>
  Development Secretary Bernadette Linn, for her part, said her bureau will continue to push forward the development of the Northern Metropolis and enhance cooperation with the Greater Bay Area.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Mainland authorities on Saturday said Hong Kong and the mainland should work together to tackle cross-border scams, after six more SAR residents were released from scam farms in Myanmar.
 <br>
  <br>
  The nation’s vice minister of public security Xu Ganlu said the joint operation of China and Thailand achieved success in rescuing victims from Myanmar.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We hope people trapped in scam farms can return to their families as soon as possible. The Chinese public security organs will work closely with foreign police to rescue more victims,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The chairman of the China International Development Cooperation Agency, Luo Zhaohui, said phone scams are outrageous, and Hong Kong should join hands with the mainland.
  <br>
  <br>
  “With our cooperation with relevant countries in Southeast Asia, and through diplomatic and public security efforts, we have seen progress in cooperation with Myanmar and Thailand,” he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It must be challenging to crack down on any kind of scams… Hong Kong is also facing this problem, so it is necessary for the SAR to work with the mainland.”

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Saturday said they have arrested six people for allegedly assaulting a 14-year-old girl in Mong Kok last August.
 <br>
  <br>
  The five women and a man, aged 15 to 22, were arrested on suspicion of assault occasioning actual bodily harm, after the teenage girl made a report to the police on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police said the girl was allegedly slapped and bullied by around 10 teenage boys and girls, at a rear staircase of a shopping mall in Mong Kok.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police said they had argued over “an attitude problem and trivial matters.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Police also believe that one of the attackers had filmed a video of the assault, but officers are investigating why the video was posted to the internet.
  <br>
  <br>
  The arrestees are being detained for further enquiries, and police said they have information about other alleged attackers. Some of the attackers allegedly have a triad background.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Deputy Secretary for Justice Horace Cheung on Saturday said the government will think about how to enforce the national security law better.
 <br>
  <br>
  His comment came after the Court of Final Appeal earlier overturned the convictions of three members of the now-disbanded Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements of China, for refusing to hand information over to the police in a national security investigation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a Commercial Radio programme, Cheung said the national security law is considered as a relatively new piece of legislation as this year marks the fifth anniversary of the implementation of the law in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said there was no precedent for law enforcement agencies to follow when carrying out the law.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Cheung said the government will take the court’s view into account and think about how to improve the enforcement of the law.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We’ll carefully study the judgement handed down by the Court of Final Appeal. We will see how the judgement can further improve the law enforcement mechanism of national security in Hong Kong,” Cheung said to reporters after attending the programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  “But I will say the judgement and the case law will contribute significantly to the development of jurisprudence of the national security law in Hong Kong,” he added.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee praised the contribution of women to society and pledged that the government is committed to promoting women's rights.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lee made the remarks on Saturday at a reception held at government headquarters, celebrating March 8 - the International Women's Day.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Yes, women are the backbone of our society.  They include leaders, innovators, caregivers, change-makers and more. From boardrooms to classrooms, from workspace to marketplace, the women of Hong Kong continue to break barriers and inspire future generations," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The government is dedicated to promoting gender equality and empowering women in every facet of life."
  <br>
  <br>
  The CE noted since taking over office, he had established the Women Empowerment Fund and organised the first Family and Women Development Summit in the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the government will work together with the Women's Commission to foster an inclusive, opportunity-filled Hong Kong for all women.

 There's hope that a new scheme can help eliminate poorly managed, so-called "three-nil buildings" - which are blocks that lack owners’ corporations, property management services, or resident organizations.
 <br>
  <br>
  Secretary for Home and Youth Affairs Alice Mak says the joint building management scheme will involve the same property management company handling aged building clusters in the area.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government will act as a middleman to link property owners with professionals from NGOs who can advise them on finding the right management company.
  <br>
  <br>
  It will commence a one-year test in Yau Tsim Mong, Sham Shui Po, Kowloon City, and Tsuen Wan later this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a Commercial Radio programme, Mak noted the project will help take care of aged buildings in the relevant areas.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Aside from the three-nil buildings, there are some aging, single-block buildings in old districts that only have 10 to 20 households. Even if they manage to form an owners' corporation, hiring a management company can be expensive as the cost can be too high for just a few units to share. So, in most cases they just choose not to set one up,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mak said the government has set aside HK$7 million for the project, with care teams and community NGOs helping to promote it.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister added that consultations have started in District Councils across the four districts and hoped that the project can commence by mid-year.

    'HK can't stop residential and industrial land sale'

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Secretary for Development Bernadette Linn on Saturday said Hong Kong is not in a position to stop selling residential and industrial land.
 <br>
  <br>
  In this year’s budget, the government stated it wouldn't sell commercial sites in the coming year in light of the high office vacancy rate.
  <br>
  <br>
  Linn pushed back against opinions saying that all land sales should be put on hold.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Firstly, Hong Kong is eager to grow various industries. We want to make as much industrial land available for development as possible, so there’s no room to hold back. That goes against our strategy," she told an RTHK programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We also won’t stop selling residential land. We have a solid plan in place, with a 10-year projection for how much land we need for public and private housing. This plan has been in play for several years, and we allocate based on this estimate every year."
  <br>
  <br>
  The budget also proposed converting some commercial land into residential use, with locations including Hung Shui Kiu Ha Tsuen, Tung Chung, Shek Mun, and Kowloon East.
  <br>
  <br>
  Linn said the government will take various factors into consideration before making a decision.
  <br>
  <br>
  “If the area is not designated as a core business area, I think there's more room to include more residential elements in it. We’ll also look at the office vacancy rates. Additionally, are there newly built commercial buildings? If there are, it suggests the supply is sufficient, so we have room for adjustment,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  When asked if the government is considering installment payments to encourage developers to bid for land, the development minister said they have an open mind toward large-scale land deals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Linn pointed out that each pilot zone in the Northern Metropolis could involve HK$10 billion to HK$20 billion in investment, adding that the administration will seek opinions from developers in the market sentiment survey.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tending process for the three pilot zones, located in Hung Shui Kiu Ha Tsuen, Fanling North, and San Tin Technopole, will begin tendering work from second half of the year.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong Customs intensified enforcement at the international airport and uncovered multiple cases of illicit cigarette smuggling involving air passengers.
 <br>
  <br>
  On Thursday, Customs raided a suspected storage facility in Yuen Long, seizing approximately 6.7 million illicit cigarettes and 570,000 alternative smoked products, valued at an estimated HK$33 million, with a duty potential of HK$22 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the early hours of Friday, Customs arrested a 36-year-old man outside a hotel in Tin Shui Wai.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was found in possession of 90,000 illicit cigarettes and 110,000 alternative smoking products.
  <br>
  <br>
  Investigations revealed that the syndicate used air passengers to smuggle these items, which were stored in hotel rooms for further distribution.
  <br>
  <br>
  The man, who claimed to be unemployed, faces charges and will appear in Tuen Mun Magistrate's Courts on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Seized alternative smoking products will be handed over to the Department of Health for further action.
  <br>
  <br>
  Over the past two weeks, Customs intercepted 20 illicit cigarette smuggling cases at the airport, arresting 13 men and eight women.
  <br>
  <br>
  About 600,000 illicit cigarettes and 460,000 alternative smoking products were seized, with an estimated market value of HK$4 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  A follow-up operation at a Yuen Long logistics warehouse led to the arrest of a 44-year-old driver after the discovery of 6 million illicit cigarettes.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was released on bail pending further investigation.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Security minister Chris Tang said on Friday that six more Hongkongers trapped in scam farms in Myanmar have been rescued in a joint operation by the Security Bureau and authorities from the mainland, Thailand and Myanmar.
 <br>
  <br>
  Tang said the victims - three men and three women aged between 29 and 44 - had been held for five to seven months, after falling for job scams.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said Myanmar soldiers rescued them overnight and sent them to Thailand, adding that they are in good health.
  <br>
  <br>
  Five of the victims are scheduled to return to Hong Kong on Friday night, while the remaining person will stay in Thailand for at least one more day to assist with the ongoing probe.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was a rescue operation, so we did not pay any ransom," the minister told reporters at the airport after returning from Bangkok.
  <br>
  <br>
  "25 people, including these six, have returned, or will be returning to Hong Kong. The SAR government will spare no effort to rescue the remaining three people [trapped in Southeast Asia]."
  <br>
  <br>
  Tang was due to attend an event on Lantau on Thursday, but cancelled it at the last minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said he couldn't announce his trip because of the need to keep the rescue operation under wraps.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister also thanked Beijing officials from the Ministries of Public Security and Foreign Affairs, as well as authorities in Myanmar and Thailand for taking part in the mission.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Legal scholar and Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) member Albert Chen on Friday said the National Security Law can be amended, and that won't have retroactive effect.
 <br>
  <br>
  His comments came a day after the SAR's top court overturned the convictions of three former members of Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements in China for refusing to hand information to the police in a national security investigation.
  <br>
  <br>
  In response, the Hong Kong government said it will study the ruling, review how it enforces national security laws, and look for ways to improve them.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to RTHK in Beijing, Chen said the Court of Final Appeal's ruling is reasonable and aligns with common law principles.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked whether changes are needed, he said Hong Kong's Committee for Safeguarding National Security is in charge of making rules for the National Security Law.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Laws can be amended at any time. Of course, these amendments won't have retrospective effect. But after the amendment, the court will need to make rulings based on the newly amended laws," the University of Hong Kong professor said.
  <br>
  <br>
  This committee can decide to change the rules on its own without seeking approval from the National People's Congress, Chen added.

 Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) Standing Committee member Henry Tang on Friday said Hong Kong should leverage its advantages and further promote internationalisation.
 <br>
  <br>
  Vice Premier Ding Xuexiang held talks with Hong Kong and Macau CPPCC delegates on Thursday on the sidelines of the "Two Sessions" in Beijing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tang said one of the issues they discussed was the city's responsibility to promote internationalisation, it being one of the most international cities in China.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We understand and recognise our responsibilities in how to further the internationalisation of Hong Kong so that we will play to the Two Systems advantage under the One Country,” Tang said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “At the same time, we are able to facilitate and to forge relationships with overseas organisations and counterparts that otherwise will be helpful in promoting relationships in this very complex political environment today.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Tang, who is also the chairman of the board of the West Kowloon Cultural District Authority, said the cultural hub will continue to promote exchanges with different countries in the cultural sector.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said West Kowloon will help enhance the cultural soft power and allow Chinese culture to go global.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Vice Premier Ding Xuexiang has urged Hong Kong to act more firmly in safeguarding national security while recognising the city's effort in implementing Article 23 legislation, according to attendees at a meeting with the top official in Beijing on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Ding, who's also a Politburo Standing Committee member and heads the Central Leading Group on Hong Kong and Macau Affairs, held a closed-door meeting with local deputies to the National People’s Congress (NPC) on the sidelines of the "Two Sessions".
  <br>
  <br>
  During the 90-minute meeting, the vice premier was quoted as saying the SAR made “new progress and breakthroughs” in the past year, such as enacting its own national security law.
  <br>
  <br>
  Starry Lee, the city’s sole delegate to the NPC Standing Committee, said Ding attached great importance to what has been happening in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  Addressing the meeting, Lee said NPC deputies must “be pioneers and lead by example”, and that security is the prerequisite for development.
  <br>
  <br>
  “At present, Hong Kong’s long-term stability is hard-won and must be cherished even more," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “[As Hong Kong delegates], we must firmly safeguard national security and have the courage to say 'no' to all words and actions that violate the Constitution and the Basic Law.”
  <br>
  <br>
  NPC delegate Ma Fung-kwok told reporters after the meeting that Ding highlighted the passage of Article 23 legislation last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  “He mentioned that this is a very important achievement, in terms of legislation concerning national security,” Ma said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He didn’t elaborate much on those directions. He just restated that we had done a very good job.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Ding also noted the city’s economic recovery and its increased influence globally, Ma added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, Xia Baolong; the head of Beijing’s liaison office, Zheng Yanxiong; and Minister of Science and Technology, Yin Hejun, were also present at the meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ding met Hong Kong and Macau delegates of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference a day earlier.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A Beijing official on Friday said that it'll be the right thing to do to keep improving the National Security Law.
 <br>
  <br>
  Sun Qingye, deputy head of the Office for Safeguarding National Security of the Central People's Government in the SAR, made the remarks on the sidelines of the "Two Sessions" in Beijing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking in a group interview, Sun, who is also a delegate to the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), said the SAR government has been implementing the National Security Law well over the past five years or so, but noted that it'll be good to keep improving the law.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If there are any issues or problems in our National Security Law, it should be revised, but this is a matter for the National People's Congress to decide," he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sun added that the city's domestic Article 23 laws helped to complement efforts to safeguard national security.
  <br>
  <br>
  He slammed certain Western nations for imposing sanctions on SAR officials and judges.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Whether it is from the United States or from other countries, it is unreasonable for them to sanction our judges. We have to support the judges to handle relevant national security cases well. [For those countries], they are wrong and should not impose sanctions. Why don't they sanction their own judges?" he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sun also rejected calls to pardon Jimmy Lai, founder of the now-defunct Apple Daily newspaper who's on trial for alleged national security offences.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This should be handled in accordance with the law. Why should special pardons be granted? What are the reasons to grant a special pardon?
  <br>
  <br>
  "He's not the son of a certain president, so that the president can pardon him."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Beijing official also said it's important to enhance national security education at local schools, to help raise awareness among youngsters.

 The Kai Tak Sports Park will promote sports development and exchanges between Hong Kong and the mainland, according to senior Chinese sports officials attending the "Two Sessions" in Beijing.
 <br>
  <br>
  Zhou Jinqiang, vice president of the Chinese Olympic Committee and a member of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), said athletes from the national team who attended the sports park's opening last week were very impressed with the new facility.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If possible, of course we hope to organise some international events and sports exchange activities between Hong Kong and the mainland at the sports park," Zhou told RTHK on the sidelines of the "Two Sessions".
  <br>
  <br>
  Zhou also said preparations for the National Games are going well, adding that it will be an important milestone in China's development as a leading sports nation.
  <br>
  <br>
  This year's National Games will be co-hosted by Guangdong, Macau and Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liu Guoliang, president of the Chinese Table Tennis Association and also a CPPCC member, highlighted Hong Kong's strong performance in table tennis over the past year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liu, who also chairs the World Table Tennis (WTT) Board, said the SAR may play host to the WTT finals this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm really looking forward to having table tennis competitions at this new sports venue and have been following its development closely. Hong Kong's table tennis development has been excellent with widespread participation. This year's WTT finals may also be held in Hong Kong," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liu also expressed confidence that the National Games will lead to major breakthroughs in sports and tourism in the Greater Bay Area.
