 Customs officers on Friday arrested a man and a woman at the airport, after allegedly finding 1.1 kilogrammes of the space oil drug strapped around their waists.
 <br>
  <br>
  They had arrived from Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia.
  <br>
  <br>
  The alleged drugs had a street value of 1.2 million Hong Kong dollars.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two suspects have been released on bail pending further investigation.

 Secretary for Constitutional and Mainland Affairs Erick Tsang on Saturday said the administration had received nearly 120,000 applications through the Top Talent Pass Scheme by the end of last year.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a luncheon event, the minister noted that more than 90,000 applications have been approved and about 76,000 people have arrived in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nine universities on the mainland and four overseas were added to the list of institutions covered by the talent scheme in November last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  With an annual update at the beginning of this year, 199 universities are now on the list.

    'Businesses need to adapt and innovate'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development, Algernon Yau, said it's important for the city's retail, catering and hotel sectors to be adaptable and innovative - to attract a broader consumer base.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on an RTHK programme on Saturday, he said the total number of visitors to Hong Kong last year surpassed 44 million, marking a 30 percent annual increase.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that despite the SAR experiencing a 7.3 percent year-on-year decline in retail sales value last November, there was a positive shift during the Christmas and New Year period, with some businesses reporting double-digit growth.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Apart from an increase in visitors from mainland China, there were also many more visitors from Southeast Asia under the new 'multiple-entry visa' scheme. I believe that, especially this year, this should greatly benefit the retail sector, particularly during holidays," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But given the overall global economic environment and changing consumer patterns, we need to adapt. The retail and catering sectors need to think about how to transform. Hong Kong has many eateries with long queues, indicating their popularity. We can look at why these eateries are so successful."
  <br>
  <br>
  He also said online shopping is going to become the dominant trend in the global retail landscape, making it necessary for businesses to revamp their business models.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yau said the Hong Kong Brands and Products Expo this year will be promoted on e-commerce platforms across mainland China and Southeast Asia.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that the SAR offers a plethora of sought-after brands and products, including food, cosmetics, and health items that hold significant popularity in mainland markets.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked if recent cases of Hong Kong residents being forced to work on illegal scams in several Southeast Asian countries would impact Hong Kong businesses' willingness to invest and operate in those areas, Yau said the two issues should not be intertwined.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong has been doing business in Southeast Asia for a long time. There are many Hong Kong businesses in Thailand, Myanmar, Cambodia, Vietnam and Laos. When I went to Cambodia, there were also many Hong Kong people who are living happily there and setting up business there. Similarly, there are Hong Kong businesses in Laos," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think these are two separate matters that should not be confused. The occurrence of such events should not affect people's willingness to do business."

    CE puts best foot forward in North Point visit

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Saturday wrapped up a visit to the harbourfront boardwalk in North Point to talk to Hongkongers – and managed to fit in an impromptu jog.
 <br>
  <br>
  The walkway – built under the Island Eastern Corridor – spans 2.2 kilometres in total.
  <br>
  <br>
  The section from Fortress Hill to North Point will open to the public on January 26.
  <br>
  <br>
  The boardwalk will have viewing platforms and shared spaces for pedestrians, joggers, cyclists, and pet owners.
  <br>
  <br>
  Movable bridges have also been installed to allow vessels access to the inner waters.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Development Bureau and the Eastern District Office invited some people on Saturday to try out the boardwalk – while Lee was there for an inspection.
  <br>
  <br>
  After an inspection of about half an hour, Lee invited some Hongkongers to join him for a jog along the boardwalk.
  <br>
  <br>
  “My personal feeling is that whether you run, jog, or cycle along the boardwalk, the scenery is amazing. It’s nice to take in the views in a busy schedule, and Hong Kong is a beautiful place to call home,” he said after the run.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Development Bureau earlier announced that the section between North Point and Quarry Bay will be opened in phases in the second half of this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  After the completion of the project, a 13-kilometre harbourfront promenade will connect Kennedy Town in the west with Shau Kei Wan in the east of Hong Kong Island.

    Children should get flu jabs 'before LNY travel'

<div class="itemFullText">
 A paediatrician has urged parents planning Lunar New Year travels with their kids to ensure their children get their flu jabs immediately, citing an increased risk of influenza-related complications following the pandemic.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters after appearing on a radio programme on Saturday, Dr Patrick Ip, from the University of Hong Kong's department of paediatrics, said severe influenza infections could result in complications such as pneumonia, pneumococcal infection or respiratory syncytial virus infection, posing a heightened risk, especially for children.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that the vaccination rate among children is still low, with more than 50 percent yet to receive their jabs.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are already entering into the winter and already entering into the peak season of influenza outbreak. We want to encourage all the parents to try to bring your children to receive influenza vaccination as quickly as possible. Now for those younger children younger than nine years old, they need to receive at least two doses of influenza vaccine separated by four weeks," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For each dose of influenza, usually after the vaccination, it takes two weeks to become much more effective in protection."
  <br>
  <br>
  He said parents have different vaccination options available for their children, which can be accessed at different locations.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The vaccination programme this year actually has been well being conducted in the different areas including by hospital clinic settings, but also with a very good outreach programme," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This year, the government ... allowed a very flexible on-site vaccination scheme to the schools. They can choose either to receive the conventional injection of inactivated vaccine or they could also choose the nasal influenza live-attenuated vaccine option."
  <br>
  <br>
  Ip added that the upward trend in influenza cases is expected to continue, predicting more severe instances in the next few weeks.

    Law change on public housing misuse on its way
   </title>

<img alt="" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1788106_1_20250118105244.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Housing Winnie Ho on Saturday said the government is confident of passing a law change this legislative session making serious misuse of public housing a crime.
 <br>
  <br>
  Under the proposed amendments to the Housing Ordinance, people who break the rules - such as subletting units or using them for business without living there - can face fines of up to HK$500,000 and jail terms of up to a year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Currently, the toughest punishment for rule-breakers is eviction.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a Commercial Radio programme, Ho gave some examples of what might qualify as serious misuse.
  <br>
  <br>
  “For example, one unit had lots of mirrors installed and was used as a dance studio. And we found a unit which had fitness equipment in which the tenant was training gym-goers. In these situations, people aren't living there, and they're using public housing to make money, so we class this as serious misuse of public housing,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho said the administration would look at each instance on a case-by-case basis, and would be reasonable and compassionate in enforcing the law.
  <br>
  <br>
  For example, residents who hold small-scale tutorial classes for money, or make handcrafts for online businesses might not be seen as seriously misusing their units, the housing minister said.
  <br>
  <br>
  She added that the administration had held talks with major parties and received their support.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Legco's panel on housing is scheduled to discuss the legislation change next month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the cash reward scheme for people who want to report illegal public housing use kicked off on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho said about 200 reports had been submitted in the last two days, although one-fourth of informants didn’t want the reward, and there were some false claims.
  <br>
  <br>
  She estimated there would be about 1,300 successful reports this year, with authorities giving out more than HK$4 million in cash.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The director of Beijing's Liaison Office in Hong Kong, Zheng Yanxiong, on Friday said the SAR has to strengthen its advantage of international connectivity, and not weaken it.
 <br>
  <br>
  He made the comment during the office's annual spring reception at the Convention and Exhibition Centre in Wan Chai.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zheng said Hong Kong needs to "shoulder its sacred responsibilities to the motherland" by safeguarding the constitutional order and the One Country, Two Systems principle, while being able to adapt to changes and be innovative.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said while the world is going through great changes not seen in a century, Hong Kong could seize the opportunities that came its way as it has the country's strong backing.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong can surely attract money and resources from all sides. The key is to achieve our better selves through staying upright, and continue to write the legendary story of Hong Kong in the new era," Zheng said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The director said by staying upright, he meant maintaining a business environment that is free and based on the rule of law, as well as an inclusive and multicultural environment.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We need to persist in connecting both with the mainland and with the world, while resolutely integrating into the country's overall development," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong's advantage to connect internally, is that it is an external-oriented [city.] Its international advantages can only be strengthened, not weakened."
  <br>
  <br>
  Zheng went on to stress that safeguarding security and focusing on development go hand in hand, and local officials have to always stay vigilant.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at the same event, Chief Executive John Lee said he would lead the government in uniting different sectors of society, while working hard on reforms.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said Hong Kong would focus on increasing the liquidity of offshore reminbi, in a bid to attract more mainland and international firms to list on the local stock exchange.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CE added that officials would also look into improving the mechanism of connecting local financial markets with those on the mainland, as well as signing more investment and trade pacts with different countries and regions.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Friday said the government was very cautious when considering tax reforms and that many factors had to be taken into consideration.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a forum organised by the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, Chan said the government hoped to achieve a fiscal balance in three years, but the SAR would focus more on managing costs than generating revenue.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In terms of raising taxes, first, we must consider our competitiveness, comparing to our neighbouring regions and the impact on attracting enterprises and investment," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Second, as society recovers from the pandemic, including small and medium enterprises, big corporations, and even individuals, we have to rebuild our balance sheets. We hope to provide more room for companies and individuals to strengthen their financial abilities."
  <br>
  <br>
  The government deducted one percent from the recurrent expenditure resources of government departments from the 2024/25 financial year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The finance minister said the government would look into whether there was a need to further reduce expenditures in his Budget, due to be announced next month.
  <br>
  <br>
  On whether the "affordable users pay" principle could be further implemented, he said Hong Kong has to work on it in a gradual and orderly way.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan added there were currently no plans to cut costs on infrastructure, saying the Northern Metropolis project could not be delayed.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Friday raised its travel alert for southeastern Myanmar to red, following cases of Hongkongers being lured there and forced to work at scam farms.
 <br>
  <br>
  Red is the middle level of the government's three-tier outward travel alert system, meaning there is a significant threat of going to the place and people should avoid making non-essential trips.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Security Bureau is calling on people to avoid non-essential travel to four districts of the country, while keeping the alert level at amber for other parts of Myanmar.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Residents who plan to visit south-eastern regions of Myanmar, including Myawaddy district, Hpapun district, Hpa-An district, and Kawkareik district should adjust their travel plans and avoid non-essential travel there," the government said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said for those who are already there, they should monitor the situation, exercise caution and attend to their personal safety.
  <br>
  <br>
  While officials said they have received reports that some Hong Kong people are also trapped in Cambodia, security officials have kept the alert level for the country at amber.
  <br>
  <br>
  They said they've updated the website with new information, to remind people to exercise caution and beware of overseas job scams.
  <br>
  <br>
  Security minister Chris Tang told a HOY TV programme on Friday that the alert was raised because it is now riskier for Hongkongers to be in those districts in Myanmar.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said there are currently no plans to raise the travel alert for Thailand -- where some victims had initially gone to before being taken to scam farms.

    HK to see more opportunity than challenges in 2025: FS

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Friday said Hong Kong would see more opportunities than challenges this year.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a forum organised by the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, Chan said the city's economy saw improvements in the past year in areas like innovation and technology, while attracting enterprises and investment.
  <br>
  <br>
  The finance chief said the economic performance of Asian countries was strong, which included China recording five percent GDP growth in 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said Hong Kong should continue to leverage its unique advantages, and reinforce its connectivity with both the mainland and the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  "While consolidating traditional markets in Europe and the United States that are closely connected to Hong Kong, we have to fully explore new markets and sources of capital at the same time," Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong not only acts as a bridge for the mainland and advanced economies like Western countries and the United States, but it also serves as a link for the mainland and Global South countries, including in the Middle East, Southeast Asia and Central Asia."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said Hong Kong's economy would still undergo a structural adjustment this year, and the United States' presidential handover would bring uncertainties to the market.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he stressed that the SAR would have a "better future" through reform and change.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police say an 18-year-old woman has lost around HK$9.2 million after falling for a phone scam.
 <br>
  <br>
  Sources said on Friday that the mainland woman is a University of Hong Kong student. They also said police have put five suspects on their wanted list.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police said the woman received a call almost two months ago from somebody claiming to be a mainland law enforcement officer.
  <br>
  <br>
  She reported being told she was implicated in a money laundering investigation and had to repeatedly transfer money to another bank account as part of the probe.
  <br>
  <br>
  After the transfers were made, the scammers cut off contact, police said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The force has listed the case as obtaining property by deception, with no arrests made so far.

    'Bamboo scaffolding ban not a wise move'

<img alt="The Federation of Hong Kong and Kowloon Labour Unions has called for enhanced training for safety supervisors at construction sites: Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1787994_1_20250117144702.jpg&q=65">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A concern group representing scaffolding workers on Friday said they opposed the idea of stopping the use of bamboo scaffolding in construction.
 <br>
  <br>
  A scaffolding collapse at a construction site in Kai Tak injured 11 workers earlier this week, sparking conversations about completely replacing bamboo with metal scaffolding.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a press conference on Friday, the group said they believe the many incidents involving scaffolding were caused by poor site safety management, not the safety of bamboo scaffolding structures.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho Ping-tak, from the Hong Kong and Kowloon Bamboo Scaffolding Workers Union, noted that currently more than 80 percent of sites use bamboo scaffolding and thousands of workers would be affected if it were banned.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have to think about the sustainable development of bamboo scaffolding in the construction industry. If people insist on hindering our development, it could cost some 4,000 scaffolding workers their jobs, hurting the livelihood of some 4,000 households,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He urged the government and various stakeholders to join hands and come up with a long-term plan to improve construction procedures.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the Federation of Hong Kong and Kowloon Labour Unions called for more training for safety inspectors at construction sites.
  <br>
  <br>
  The federation said more than 16 percent of 310 respondents to a recent survey said they had been injured at least once in industrial accidents.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under current regulations, one safety supervisor should be appointed to every 20 workers at a construction site.
  <br>
  <br>
  But lawmaker Lam Chun-sing, who also chairs the federation, said many supervisors receive inadequate training and were not qualified to guide workers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "From our survey, many workers believe that there's nobody to supervise them and monitor them and tell them about their occupational health and safety issues,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The supervisor may be a general worker and they do not receive professional training and so in fact they cannot play the function of the safety supervisor... So we hope that the government can strengthen their professional training and also strengthen their role.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Reacting to the Kai Tak incident, Lam said it was not optimal that a serious accident occurred just months after the government published a revised safety code.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lam said other than enhanced inspections, the government should also consider whether sites can use other materials to replace bamboo scaffolding at construction sites.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Fond memories of travels to the mainland are likely to come flooding back for visitors to the MTR's exhibition at Hung Hom as the Kowloon-Canton Railway Through Train pulls into the station again for the first time in years.
 <br>
  <br>
  Compartments from the doubler-decker KTT trains which ran to Dongguan and Guangzhou from 1998 to 2020 have been added to the Station Rail Voyage experiential gallery which is designed to give people a behind-the-scenes glimpse of railway operations, along with a trip down memory lane.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Through showcasing the KTT compartments at the Station Rail Voyage exhibition, we bring everyone back to the days of the through train platform at Hung Hom Station," MTR CEO Jason Kam said at an opening ceremony for the revamped exhibition.
  <br>
  <br>
  "These journeys bring back memories of visiting family, meeting friends or doing business."
  <br>
  <br>
  Secretary for Transport and Logistics Mable Chan said the exhibition has proved popular with locals and tourists alike, and is also a hotspot for social media influencers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said the success of the exhibition shows that Hong Kong should make use of heritage such as the MTR when designing attractions for tourists.
  <br>
  <br>
  The revamped exhibition will be open from January 23 until the end of the year. People can book a free visit via the MTR's website.

<div class="itemFullText">
 More than 9,000 bankruptcy applications were made in Hong Kong last year, the highest annual number in almost a decade.
 <br>
  <br>
  Data released by the Official Receiver's Office on Friday showed 9,190 petitions for bankruptcy were recorded, up 17 percent from 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was the highest number since 9,875 applications were made in 2015.
  <br>
  <br>
  There were 781 applications in December alone, representing a 16 percent increase year-on-year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The number of bankruptcy orders by the court last year also rose, standing at 8,553.
  <br>
  <br>
  The office also received 740 compulsory winding-up petitions, a 30 percent jump over the number in 2023 and the highest figure since 2009.
  <br>
  <br>
  There were 443 court orders last year for companies to be liquidated.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lawmakers on Friday said the new SKYTOPIA development planned as part of an expansion of Airport City will boost tourism-related industries.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Airport Authority says the development will include a "one-stop arts hub" and a "jet fresh market".
  <br>
  <br>
  DAB lawmaker Holden Chow welcomed the move, saying it will boost the economy by bringing more tourists to the city and creating jobs.
  <br>
  <br>
  He told RTHK’s Hong Kong Today programme that now is also a good time for more flights routes to be introduced, to further enhance the SAR's status as a global aviation hub.
  <br>
  <br>
  “With the third runway already launched, we believe that we always need to connect more direct air services to more jurisdictions, including Europe and North America,” Chow said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The authority says SKYTOPIA will cost about HK$100 billion, including HK$30 billion for infrastructure.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lawmaker Rock Chen, who’s a member of the authority's board, said many potential investors have expressed an interest in funding the plan.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the authority hopes to collaborate with Art Basel to stage events, as well as art sales to attract collectors, entrepreneurs and artists to Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  Calvin Au, a researcher at the Our Hong Kong Foundation think tank said having interesting facilities around the airport could attract people to choose to use Chek Lap Kok for their travels.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police have arrested a man for using forged documents and making false crime reports, after he allegedly fabricated an email from the Kai Tak Sports Park and separately claimed he was the victim of a blackmail case.
 <br>
  <br>
  Officers alleged that the man released a press statement earlier this month claiming that his application to host an international football event -- featuring FC Barcelona -- at the new stadium was rejected, and included what he claimed was an email from the park.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kai Tak Sports Park said it never received any application documents about the proposed match.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officers said the suspect also filed a false police report claiming that a journalist covering the story blackmailed him for HK$10 million via an email.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sun Yi-ki, a chief inspector with the force, said officers believe both emails were forged by the suspect.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Police do not rule out that the suspect may have been overly optimistic about his ability to organise international events. When his plan failed due to inexperience and poor management, he tried to shift the responsibility by misleading the media and forging emails that falsely claimed Kai Tak Sports Park had rejected his venue application," Sun said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kai Tak Sports Park said it is willing to cooperate with the police probe and will continue to handle all leasing applications in a professional manner.

 Police on Thursday said they arrested 12 people, including seven police officers, on suspicion of money laundering, involving about HK$10.5 million.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, the force said the eight men and four women, aged between 28 and 68, allegedly laundered suspected criminal proceeds using 22 bank accounts between 2017 and last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two of the detained officers were also arrested for suspected fraud. They’d allegedly rented out their mortgaged residential properties between 2019 and last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officers from the Financial Intelligence and Investigation Bureau arrested the 12 people in Sheung Shui, Fanling, Tuen Mun and Kwai Chung on Thursday morning. The police officers were off-duty at the time of the arrests.
  <br>
  <br>
  The force said all seven officers, aged between 28 and 39, have been suspended from duty.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities stressed they attach great emphasis on the conduct of their officers, adding that those who breach the law will not be condoned.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Thursday said a Hongkonger who was rescued after being trapped in Southeast Asia was forced to work 17 hours a day and beaten for not meeting targets.
 <br>
  <br>
  Officers said the victim, 25, was lured by a social media job advertisement offering HK$120,000 to transport diamonds from Thailand to Taiwan.
  <br>
  <br>
  After arriving in Bangkok last October, he was taken to Myanmar and held in a mountain compound guarded by armed men.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lau Ho-tak, a chief inspector with the force, said the victim was forced to conduct online scams on social media.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Over the past three months, the victim was repeatedly beaten and denied meals because he failed to meet the fraud targets set by management staff at the compound. There are still visible injuries on his body," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police did not disclose whether the victim's family paid ransom in this case.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officers added that they are still in contact with some of the remaining 11 Hongkongers held captive in Southeast Asia and are trying all means to rescue them.
  <br>
  <br>
  The force warned members of the public to stay vigilant against overseas job offers that promise high salaries without requiring professional skills.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong Disneyland said on Thursday that it’s pleased with the theme park’s performance last year in terms of visitor numbers and revenue, and expects it to continue doing very well this year.
 <br>
  <br>
  The theme park’s vice president for communications and public affairs, Anita Lai, said the new 'World of Frozen' attraction, which opened in November 2023, was a big draw for tourists.
  <br>
  <br>
  “A year ago, we launched 'World of Frozen'. This is a movie and a story that people love,” Lai told reporters, adding that there’s been a surge in the number of mainland tourists buying the park’s annual pass.
  <br>
  <br>
  She pointed out that there was a double-digit growth in the number of Shenzhen visitors during last year’s Halloween compared to the same period in 2023, and that Hong Kong Disneyland Resort hotels reached 90 percent occupancy during the Christmas period.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said the park will step up promotions in both the mainland and Southeast Asian countries to entice more visitors during the Lunar New Year period.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked if the park is worried about vigorous competition with Ocean Park -- which will be putting the twin panda cubs on display next month -- Lai said Hong Kong Disneyland welcomes new events and highlights to inject momentum into the city's tourism industry.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Chinese Manufacturers' Association of Hong Kong has urged the government to provide more fiscal and tax support for local enterprises, including extending the principal moratorium arrangements to allow companies to delay their loan payments for a longer time.
 <br>
  <br>
  This was among an array of proposals it put forward to the administration on Thursday ahead of the financial budget next month.
  <br>
  <br>
  The association’s president Wingco Lo said small and medium-sized companies are facing several challenges at the moment.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Currently we are facing a couple of difficulties, like the pricing from the importer, and also the geopolitical pressure, and also the operating [costs]. We are suggesting the government have more support for the small and medium companies to promote local businesses," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  With Donald Trump set to return to the White House next week, Lo said more efforts are needed to diversify businesses to minimise the impact of possible tariffs and Sino-US tensions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lawmaker Jimmy Ng, and the association's executive committee member, said he wants to see more bilateral free trade agreements between the SAR and emerging economies.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We should now focus more on the Asean countries and the Belt and Road countries. For a traditional market they are either not rich enough now or they are not very friendly to us. So the international market is no longer only the States and Europe. We should look for other business economies for a better future."

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Airport Authority on Thursday unveiled a new development called "SKYTOPIA" for Hong Kong's Airport City, aiming to develop it into a world-class landmark.
 <br>
  <br>
  The authority unveiled the Airport City development blueprint which includes measures to expand AsiaWorld-Expo, build the city’s largest yacht bay, and set up the city’s first art storage facility.
  <br>
  <br>
  The three-runway system at the airport commenced operation in November last year, and will boost the airport’s capacity to 120 million passengers a year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chairman of the Airport Authority, Fred Lam, said the Airport City will be more than just about serving travellers using the airport.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We envisage that our airport will not be just a place for passengers to board their planes or a portal for entering Hong Kong,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Our vision is to develop SKYTOPIA into a landmark of its own and also a world leading destination, attracting visitors from within Hong Kong and its prosperous Greater Bay Area, as well as major markets in Asia and around the world.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Cissy Chan, an executive director with the authority, said the Airport City will integrate commercial and cultural activities, and will be a key economic driver for Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said the project would not only consolidate Hong Kong’s status as an international aviation hub, but also boost the city’s development in art trading and entertainment.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Airport Authority said the project would cost about HK$100 billion, including HK$30 billion on infrastructure.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police say they believe they have caught one of four people who raided a jewellery store in Sheung Shui on Wednesday evening and the man, 23, will be charged with robbery.
 <br>
  <br>
  Jewellery worth HK$1.5 million was stolen from a shop on San Fung Avenue by a group of people wielding knives and hammers who escaped in a private car, officers said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Weapons believed to be linked to the raid were later found in a car involved in a crash on Lam Kam Road, while clothes and masks officers suspect were worn by the robbers were found on a nearby hillside.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Through our investigation, we suspect that the vehicle that we mentioned had been surveilling the crime scene a couple of days before the incident took place," Chief Inspector Law Like-him said at a media briefing.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We suspect this shows it was a pre-planned, organised crime."
  <br>
  <br>
  The suspect, who was arrested in Pat Heung in the early hours of Thursday, is expected to appear in Tuen Mun Magistrates' Courts on Saturday, police said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Another Hongkonger held captive in Southeast Asia has been released and returned to Hong Kong on Thursday, officials said.
 <br>
  <br>
  No details were revealed as to what had happened to the SAR resident or how their ordeal came to an end.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Security Bureau, along with colleagues from the police force and the Immigration Department, immediately went to the airport to follow up, confirming that the rescued individual had arrived safely," an official post on social media said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Secretary for Security Chris Tang described the return as "good news".
  <br>
  <br>
  "My team and I will continue to follow up and hope that every Hong Kong resident [detained] can come home safely," he wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier this week, officials said 12 Hongkongers were being held prisoner in Myanmar and Cambodia after being tricked into travelling to Thailand on the false promise of well-paid work there. The captives are said to have been forced into taking part in scams.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police on Wednesday said two women also recently returned to Hong Kong after suffering a similar fate, with their families paying ransoms to secure their release.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tang met representatives from the Royal Thai Consulate-General on Thursday to discuss rescue plans for those still detained in the region.
  <br>
  <br>
  A government taskforce also went to Bangkok earlier this week to talk to officials there about the situation.

    First concert test to happen at main Kai Tak Stadium

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A charity concert is set to take place on Saturday at Kai Tak Sports Park, marking the main stadium's inaugural non-sporting event, with authorities saying it will serve as a test to simulate the logistics for future large-scale performances at the venue.
 <br>
  <br>
  Authorities said approximately 18,000 spectators will attend, with about 4,000 gathering on the ground-level turf area.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tang King-shing, the venue's director for strategic planning, said that assessing the turf's use will be one area of focus during their testing.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The stage and the spectators will be sitting on protective layer using I-track, it's the name of the protective layer, so there won't be any question of damaging the turf itself. So that's why before we have been emphasising the fact that as far as the surface of the main stadium is concerned, it's a flexible arrangement," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We can use genuine turf for high-quality football or rugby events and use the layer underneath, the I-track, for concert events like the one coming this Saturday by simply removing the turf."
  <br>
  <br>
  Commissioner for Sports George Tsoi said event organisers have chosen to close the roof for this concert to better test their acoustics and audio effects.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We hope we can have the opportunity to test out all the different elements and the coordination amongst our different staff and as well as the arrival and dispersal of our audience," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We hope that we can have good experience and further improve our operations in future."
  <br>
  <br>
  Tsoi said doors will open for concert goers at 4pm, with the performance scheduled to start at 6pm and wrap up before 8pm.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that attendees should have already gotten their tickets in advance and they should review the list of prohibited items prior to arriving.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tsoi said more test events are to come, with each one increasing in scale and sophistication, highlighting another large test on January 24 with over 60,000 participants to prepare for the official opening of the Sports Park in March.
  <br>
  <br>
  Principal Transport Officer/Urban of the Transport Department Eric Wan said the MTR will implement special service arrangements, including increased train frequencies, and KMB and Citybus will organise three bus routes serving East Kowloon, West Kowloon and Hong Kong Island during the dispersal period.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Security minister Chris Tang said on Thursday that a government taskforce's trip to Thailand this week has improved the chances of securing the release of a dozen Hongkongers being held captive in Southeast Asia.
 <br>
  <br>
  Tang said the delegation, led by his deputy Michael Cheuk, exchanged important information with Thai counterparts, as well as the Chinese Embassy.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Of course our country helps a lot. During their trip, our officials met officials at the Chinese Embassy in Thailand. Organisations from our country are also working behind the scenes to get the 12 home safely," he told NOW TV.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tang conceded, however, that it will not be easy to rescue those being held prisoner.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will do everything we can in the hope that we can secure the safe return of the 12," the minister said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tang said the Hongkongers, in their early 20s to 40s, were tricked into travelling to Thailand by gangs who falsely promised them well-paid jobs and good accommodation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two other SAR residents who suffered a similar fate were recently freed after their families paid ransoms, according to the police. Tang said people should contact the police if they are asked to hand over money to secure the release of relatives held captive.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tang also offered advice for people who suspect they have been tricked into travelling abroad, saying they should scream while in a public place and seek help immediately.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said from 2022 to 2023, 46 people from Hong Kong were deceived into working for scamming syndicates in Southeast Asia, with the majority eventually returning to the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said such crimes resurfaced in the second quarter of last year.

 Sources on Thursday said a man has been arrested in Pat Heung, in connection with an armed robbery in Sheung Shui the previous evening.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a statement released earlier, police said they suspect that four men, wielding knives and hammers, had robbed a jewellery shop on San Fung Avenue at around 6.30pm on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officers said the suspects fled the scene in a private car, which later crashed with another vehicle on Lam Kam Road near Ng Tung Chai.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police said three men then fled the crash scene.

<img alt="Lawmaker Johnny Ng says there's no urgent need to raise the amber travel alert for Thailand, given it remains safe to travel there. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1787765_1_20250116094448.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A lawmaker on Thursday said the great importance that both Hong Kong and Thai officials have attached to tackling the problem of so-called scam farms in Southeast Asian countries will help prevent citizens falling prey to fake job offers in future.
 <br>
  <br>
  This came as police in Hong Kong arrested a woman for allegedly luring two females from the SAR to Southeast Asia and forcing them to take part in scams.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 32-year-old has been charged with conspiracy to defraud.
  <br>
  <br>
  Undersecretary for Security Michael Cheuk led a delegation to Thailand earlier in the week to help 12 Hong Kong residents who were detained in Myanmar and Cambodia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme, Johnny Ng noted the two governments took the matter very seriously.
  <br>
  <br>
  He believes this will allow the public to realise the seriousness of the matter.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is a very, very good education to let the general public know that we cannot take free air tickets, or free hotels, hospitality... in order to get more unbalanced [rewards] from some jobs," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He suggested the SAR government reach out to its Myanmar and Cambodian counterparts directly, as well as step up cooperation with international police with the help of the central government.
  <br>
  <br>
  While Hong Kong raised the travel alert for Thailand to amber in 2014 due to mass demonstrations in the country, Ng said there was no urgent need to raise the alert level amid the current situation, as it remains a safe destination.

 Police on Wednesday said they arrested a man for attempted snatching, after the 39-year-old allegedly tried to take a police officer’s gun at the Tsim Sha Tsui police station.
 <br>
  <br>
  A statement said officers subdued the man, who was held at the station for an investigation in another case.
  <br>
  <br>
  The force said the arrested person is an off-duty officer who had earlier been arrested on suspicion of voyeurism.
  <br>
  <br>
  The man, along with two officers who subdued him, sustained injuries and was taken to hospital.

<img alt="Police have charged a 32-year-old suspected of tricking two women into travelling to Southeast Asia where they were forced to work for fraudsters.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police in Hong Kong on Wednesday said they had arrested and charged a woman after two people from the SAR were lured to Southeast Asia and forced to take part in scams, with the victims' families paying ransoms to have them freed.
 <br>
  <br>
  The announcement came as SAR officials vowed to work with Bangkok to try to rescue a dozen Hongkongers being held captive in countries neighbouring Thailand.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police said a beauty worker, 32, had been charged with conspiracy to defraud and was due to appear at Shatin Magistrates' Courts on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a press conference, officers said she was suspected of enticing two women, aged 21 and 23, to Thailand in late December. The women were driven to a "scam hub" in Myanmar where they were forced to take part in fraudulent activities, officers said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The pair returned to Hong Kong this month after their families paid ransoms, police said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The women told officers there were armed guards at the site where they were held and the area was surrounded by a barbed wire fence.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chief Inspector Yu Pok-hon said the arrested woman is believed to have socialised with the two victims to gain their trust, before offering them free travel and job opportunities in Thailand.
  <br>
  <br>
  The force urged people to be wary of online adverts promising jobs with large salaries, and not to put too much trust in friends they have made only recently.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Security Secretary Chris Tang said he has been briefed by a government task force sent to Thailand over reports of other Hongkongers being held in dangerous locations after being tricked into travelling to Bangkok.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tang said the administration will continue to liaise with Thai authorities to bring home 12 SAR residents being held prisoner in Myanmar and Cambodia.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than a dozen other victims have already returned to Hong Kong, officials said on Tuesday.

    HK saw more than 44 million visitors in 2024

<img alt="The government said the 44.5 million visitor arrivals last year were in line with estimates. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1787653_1_20250115153427.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Wednesday said that Hong Kong saw 44.5 million tourist arrivals in 2024, in part boosted by Beijing's relaxation of visa rules for Shenzhen residents.
 <br>
  <br>
  Tourism minister Rosanna Law said the figure represented a near one-third increase from the year before, and was in line with estimates.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since the start of December, Shenzhen residents with the visas have been allowed to visit the SAR for as many times as they like, compared to a previous restriction of one trip per week.
  <br>
  <br>
  Law said last month, there were more than 3.1 million mainland visitor arrivals, or an average of more than 100,000 a day.
  <br>
  <br>
  That was a 17-percent rise from the daily average in November.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The government will make good use of the various measures benefiting Hong Kong to promote the all-round development of Hong Kong’s tourism industry," the minister said in a written reply to the legislature.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said officials will maintain communication with different ministries of the central government, with a view to enable more travellers from the mainland to visit the SAR in a flexible and convenient manner.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Tourism Board, meanwhile, noted that for the annual number of visitors, more than 10 million were from places outside the mainland, representing a 44 percent jump year on year.
  <br>
  <br>
  It noted that out of the 44.5 million arrivals, half of them spent at least one night in Hong Kong, and they stay for around three nights here on average.
  <br>
  <br>
  DAB lawmaker Brave Chan asked if the government would get the United Nation's culture agency, Unesco, to include Hong Kong on its list of "World Cities of Gastronomy".
  <br>
  <br>
  Law said there are now 50 such cities, with Macau, Chengdu, Shunde, Yangzhou, Huaian and Chaozhou the six Chinese places on the list.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said officials will study the matter with reference to the experience of cities on the list.

    EV charging providers urged to improve transparency

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Consumer Council on Wednesday urged charging service providers to improve transparency following complaints about electric vehicle (EV) charging facilities across Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  The watchdog received 179 complaints last year on issues such as unstable power supply, insufficient charging spots and fee disputes.
  <br>
  <br>
  In one case, an EV owner found his overnight charging sessions had been interrupted and his vehicle was left without sufficient power.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another complainant reported she was charged HK$150 in idle fees without being notified – nearly ten times the actual charging cost.
  <br>
  <br>
  The council’s chief executive, Gilly Wong, said service providers should explain the way they set fees.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is a free market, they can charge according to different business models. It could be charged by kilowatts, it could be charged by time, or it could be charged by a monthly plan,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We urge the service providers to align and standardise the unit that they use."
  <br>
  <br>
  The council reminded EV owners to carefully review charging plans and pricing details before use, and to promptly vacate charging spots to avoid idle fees.

    'Some tumblers have lower capacity than advertised'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Some brands of tumblers and travel mugs have a lower capacity than is claimed, the Consumer Council said on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The watchdog also found that plastic mugs are not as effective in keeping drinks hot or cold.
  <br>
  <br>
  The council tested 18 models of tumblers and travel mugs, which claimed a capacity from 350ml to 900ml.
  <br>
  <br>
  But only four models had the actual capacity that was stated. The rest of them held less liquid than claimed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Five mugs or tumblers, from Muji, 24Bottles, Decathlon, National Geographic, and PoleBear, were found to have a discrepancy in capacity of more than 10 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The Council reminds manufacturers that their product design must take into consideration the actual usage by consumers and clearly and accurately state on the product label the actual capacity,” said convenor of the council’s advisory group on digital economy and information technology Jack Poon.
  <br>
  <br>
  The watchdog also passed the results to the Customs and Excise Department for potential follow up actions.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the thermal insulation efficacy test, two stainless steel tumblers from NOC and Stanley performed well as they were able to keep the water temperature at over 60 degrees Celsius after six hours.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thirteen models could maintain the water temperature at above 40 degrees Celsius, but the water temperature in three plastic mugs or tumblers, dropped significantly to between 29 and 26.3 degrees.
  <br>
  <br>
  For cold drinks with temperatures from five degrees to minus one degree Celsius, temperatures from three plastic models rose to as much as 22 degrees after six hours.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two-thirds of samples showed a satisfactory performance in the leak-proof test.
  <br>
  <br>
  The council reminded people to clean their tumblers or mugs as often as they could and recommended they use tools like small brushes to wash narrow bottles.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It's better for you to clean it thoroughly because you never know when the pathogenic bacteria will breed in your container. So the cleaner it is, the better for your food safety,” the council’s chief executive Gilly Wong said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “When you buy this kind of tumbler, check out how many parts they have so that you know you have to open it up and how to clean it and put it back, ensure that you know it performs as well as its original,” she said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong may need to import halal food for all the Muslim tourists it aims to entice to the city, a minister said on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Plans for new measures to attract visitors from the Middle East and Southeast Asia were announced in last year's chief executive policy address.
  <br>
  <br>
  On RTHK's Overview Policy programme, Deputy Chief Secretary Warner Cheuk said as Hong Kong develops into a Muslim-friendly tourist destination, halal food could be brought in from abroad.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong may not have many Muslims, but we need to make a lot of halal food. There are many Muslim countries in Asean, and we can attract restaurants and import food from these nations," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other government moves aimed at attracting more visitors from Muslim nations include encouraging hotels to set up worship facilities, and persuading taxi drivers to provide information in Arabic.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A pilot scheme which helps separating or divorcing couples from low-income families handle spouse maintenance has processed nearly 40 cases in the first two months since its introduction, taking less than a month on average to close a file.
 <br>
  <br>
  In October last year, authorities introduced a programme through the Community Care Fund to offer free mediation services.
  <br>
  <br>
  The initiative, set to last for three years, aims to process a total of 1,200 cases and help 2,400 people who are going through a separation or divorce.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alice Mak, secretary for home and youth affairs, said the scheme handled 38 cases relating to alimony as of the end of November.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Sixty percent of the cases have either reached an agreement or partially made an agreement, meaning there's an outcome from the mediation. For those completed cases, it takes roughly 24 days from opening to closing a file," she said during an exclusive interview with RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We can see that these mediation services have indeed helped some divorcees to reach maintenance agreements. Some of the participants told us that they found it helpful and they would recommend programme to those in need around them."
  <br>
  <br>
  As for the remaining 40 percent, Mak said the administration would look into possible follow-up actions after collecting more data.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, the minister said her bureau and the Family Council will jointly organise the "Hong Kong Excellent Family Awards" in the second quarter, with participants being judged on a number of areas.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said families must show how well they support each other and whether they have experiences on educating the next generation which are worthy of being referenced, among other criteria.

<img alt="Miachel Cheuk accepted a petition from Kelvin, whose brother is among those detained in Southeast Asia. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1787597_2_20250115102627.jpg&q=85">

<div class="itemFullText">
 Undersecretary for Security Michael Cheuk said he hopes 12 Hong Kong residents who remain unlawfully detained in Southeast Asia can come home before Chinese New Year, as a six-member task force he led concluded their two-day trip to Thailand.
 <br>
  <br>
  Cheuk was also pleased with the progress made by the task force, and expressed gratitude to their Thai counterparts for attaching great importance to the matter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters upon landing at Hong Kong airport on Tuesday evening, the former assistant police commissioner confirmed that 11 of the trapped SAR residents are in Myanmar, while the remaining one is in Cambodia.
  <br>
  <br>
  He described their locations as chaotic and not safe, while armed forces are also present.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cheuk pointed out that all of the victims fell for job scams, and were lured by the syndicates to Bangkok and picked up at the airport.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So far, none of the 72 people who sought assistance were abducted. In this regard, Thailand remains a very safe place," he said, although he cautioned against visiting regions bordering Myanmar, Laos or Cambodia.
  <br>
  <br>
  SAR authorities will now reach out to their counterparts in Myanmar, but admitted the situation was quite complicated.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cheuk also quoted Thai officials as saying that safety measures will be rolled out this week to enhance the safety of tourists.
  <br>
  <br>
  These include a 24-hour hotline that supports eight languages, and a mobile app that allows users to share their real-time location to law enforcement in emergency situations.
  <br>
  <br>
  The number two security official in Hong Kong also explained why the task force embarked on a visit to Thailand when the SAR residents are held elsewhere.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said Thailand has a lot of exchanges with neighbouring countries both historically and culturally, and Thai officials have numerous ways to talk to people in the region, including unofficial means.
  <br>
  <br>
  Before he left the airport, Cheuk received a petition letter from a man whose brother is among those unlawfully detained.
  <br>
  <br>
  The man, who gave his name as Kelvin, hopes to meet the task force soon and receive the latest update on the situation.

    Test strips to be used to detect space oil drug

<img alt="The rapid test kit contains a swabbing strip, a bottle of solution, a pair of surgical gloves, and a sample bag. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1787604_2_20250115101808.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police will begin using rapid test kits to detect a regulated sedative from Saturday to tackle the emerging use of the space oil drug.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chief Inspector of the narcotics bureau Kelvin Cheung said the test will serve as an aid during operations when officers suspect products could contain etomidate, a short-acting anaesthetic normally used as an ingredient for the narcotic.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The officers will conduct the stop-and-search in an ordinary manner. When they find the vapes, they will conduct enquiries, they will ask questions, and they will also conduct observations before conducting the interception," Cheung said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If they, after conducting all the necessary enquiries at the scene, are still unable to form the reasonable belief, and they still suspect that the vapes actually contain etomidate... they will use the test kit."
  <br>
  <br>
  The kit contains a testing strip used to swab samples of alternative smoking products. It will then be mixed with a solution that can show a positive or negative result in less than a minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  The accuracy of the test can reach up to 99 percent, Cheung said, adding that the force has procured a sufficient amount of testing kits.
  <br>
  <br>
  Etomidate is a controlled drug that is prescribed by a doctor and is currently classified as a Part 1 poison.
  <br>
  <br>
  The number of arrests relating to the controlled drug skyrocketed from eight in 2023 to 206 in the first 11 months of last year. Nearly 23 percent of those arrested last year were people aged below 21, with the youngest being only 12 years old.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sky, who is said to be about 20 years old, first got a taste of the space oil drug at a bar. Speaking at a police press event, Sky said it looked like a normal e-cigarette. Sky later became addicted to the drug and started experiencing memory loss.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Sometimes I forgot what I did. I also had errors in my judgement. When my friends saw the traffic light was red, I thought it was green and walked out onto the road," Sky said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Leo Man, from the Hong Kong Federation of Youth Groups, told the same event that etomidate is very addictive. He said there has been a case where someone taking the drug died after mistaking a window for a door.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government is planning to list etomidate as a dangerous drug on February 14.
  <br>
  <br>
  Once listed, those illegally possessing or consuming space oil drugs containing the sedative would face a maximum of seven years in prison and a fine of HK$1 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  And those trafficking or illegally importing the drug would be liable to a maximum penalty of life imprisonment and a fine of HK$5 million.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The government's task force to help Hong Kong residents who were allegedly lured to Southeast Asian countries to engage in illegal work on Tuesday concluded its visit to Thailand.
 <br>
  <br>
  Led by Under Secretary for Security Michael Cheuk, the task force arrived in the country on Sunday to follow up on the cases.
  <br>
  <br>
  A government statement said Cheuk received positive feedback in a Tuesday meeting to exchange intelligence with Thailand's senior inspector general Thatchai Pitaneelaboot.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pitaneelaboot said Thai authorities will further strengthen the prevention of transnational crimes, and do their utmost to assist the safe return of Hong Kong residents.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cheuk also met Thailand's vice minister for tourism and sports Jakkaphon Tangsutthitham and the commissioner of the tourist police bureau Saksira Pheuak-um to learn about the latest measures to protect tourists.
  <br>
  <br>
  Members of the task force later met a deputy commissioner general of the Thai National Police Prachuab Wongsuk to reflect the situation of the cases involving Hong Kong residents.
  <br>
  <br>
  The statement also said Cheuk expressed gratitude to the Chinese Embassy in Thailand and Thai authorities for attaching great importance to the requests for assistance from Hong Kong people.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[Authorities] will continue to maintain close liaison with the embassy and the Thai authorities in the future to exchange intelligence on the latest situation of the cases, and to provide appropriate advice and all practicable assistance to the assistance seekers and their families," it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The task force is expected to return to Hong Kong on Tuesday night.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A scholar has been convicted of killing his wife and daughter with a yoga ball filled with lethal gas following a retrial, with a High Court judge sentencing him to life imprisonment.
 <br>
  <br>
  A seven-member jury unanimously found Khaw Kim Sun, a former Chinese University medical professor, guilty of causing the deaths of his wife and second child, after less than four hours of deliberation.
  <br>
  <br>
  The academic appeared calm when the verdict was handed down and chose not to make a mitigation plea.
  <br>
  <br>
  He had been accused of putting a yoga ball filled with carbon monoxide in the boot of a Mini Cooper in 2015, with the gas leaking out and killing the pair.
  <br>
  <br>
  Khaw was first convicted of two counts of murder in 2018 and sentenced to life behind bars.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2023, the top court quashed his murder conviction and ordered a retrial, after ruling the initial trial judge had misdirected the jury.
  <br>
  <br>
  During the retrial that began in November last year, Khaw opted to defend himself and claimed he had bought carbon monoxide for an experiment.
  <br>
  <br>
  But prosecutors challenged his claims, saying the experiment was a "sham" to hide his real motive of possessing the lethal gas.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Tuesday launched a caring food coupon programme, allowing elderly people in need to taste dishes at discounted prices from the Lunar New Year holiday.
 <br>
  <br>
  About 50,000 seniors, including those living alone, will receive a set of five coupons so they can try signature dishes from five catering groups for just HK$25 each.
  <br>
  <br>
  The coupons will be accepted from January 29 to late March.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chief Secretary Eric Chan, who officiated at a launching ceremony, said he hopes the elderly people will feel warmth through the programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is a collaboration between the government, the business sector and the community, building a harmonious and caring society together," Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are going to test out this programme, and see how to review it based on the experience. We hope more catering groups and restaurants will participate in the future."
  <br>
  <br>
  One of the fast food chains taking part in the programme, Café de Coral, said it is a meaningful way to help the elderly.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This time, we have HK$25 baked pork chop rice, which is our signature dish. All the Café de Coral stores will offer this special price for the programme's participants," general manager Nelson Lo said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other chains will offer dishes like boneless Hainan chicken rice, fish burgers, and char siu rice with sunny-side up eggs.

    HK should cut down on red tape, survey finds

<img alt="About a third of mainland residents in Hong Kong felt the SAR could cut down on red tape. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1787463_1_20250114144638.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Nearly a third of mainland students and workers in Hong Kong said there is too much red tape in the city, according to a survey by a concern group helping young mainlanders.
 <br>
  <br>
  Around 800 young and educated mainlanders who are working or studying in Hong Kong, participated in an online survey jointly conducted by the Youth Expats Association and two lawmakers, Gary Zhang and Johnny Ng.
  <br>
  <br>
  The respondents were asked about their life in Hong Kong and their perspectives on the economy, culture and policies in the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 30 percent said there is too much red tape in Hong Kong, such as regulations governing money transfers.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The banking system is very troublesome if you want to make a legal transfer back to mainland China,” Zhang said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said some drifters also encountered difficulties when starting a business in Hong Kong, such as getting licences.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Like if they want to open a restaurant, the requirements from different government departments are quite complicated and stringent,” Zhang said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some 45 percent of respondents also said they had trouble building connections at work.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zhang said the drifters also needed more support as they do not have family and friends in Hong Kong, and the language barrier also hindered them from building relationships in the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 10 percent of respondents found there was a lack of smoking areas in Hong Kong, and think the government should not impose more tobacco control measures at this stage.

    Serious abuse of public housing could be made a crime

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Serious misuse of public housing could be made a criminal offence, Housing Department sources said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  At present the toughest punishment for tenants who break the rules, for example by subletting their units or using them for business purposes, is eviction.
  <br>
  <br>
  But plans are in place to amend the Housing Ordinance to allow the Housing Authority to prosecute offenders, with proposed fines of up to HK$500,000 and jail terms of up to a year.
  <br>
  <br>
  It's understood the authority also wants officials to be given the power to check the identity of any suspicious people they encounter while carrying out inspections at public flats. Anyone who refuses to hand over their details could be fined HK$10,000 or imprisoned for six months.
  <br>
  <br>
  Providing false statements to the authorities can already lead to prosecution, but officials want to extend the time period for bringing cases to court to six years after the offence, or one year after it is discovered, whichever comes first.
  <br>
  <br>
  The authority's subsidised housing committee held a meeting on Tuesday morning to discuss the plans.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters afterwards, Cleresa Wong, who chairs the committee, said she believes the proposed legislation would have a deterrent effect.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We do not propose to encompass all abuses under the new piece of legislation that we are proposing. We will only focus on the severe abuses and the reason is because if convicted, the people who are charged with these kinds of crimes would be criminalised, and they would have a criminal record. And so that, I think, is a deterrence,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The proposed legal amendments would not be applied retrospectively, it is believed.
  <br>
  <br>
  “As a matter of law, legal principles, it is very rare for a government to introduce crimes with retrospective effect because this is somehow contrary to natural justice and fairness,” Wong said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I think that would have a very draconian effect and that should be avoided in my personal view.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Sources said the proposals will be reviewed by Legco's housing panel next month and are still subject to change.
  <br>
  <br>
  It’s believed the authority hopes to bring a bill to Legco for vetting in April.

 Chief Executive John Lee said on Tuesday authorities will comprehensively investigate any suspected links people or organisations may have with those who endanger national security, to see if any support or assistance has been given.
 <br>
  <br>
  His comments came a day after prominent pollster Robert Chung was was taken away from his home on Monday morning, and brought to the Wong Chuk Hang office of the Public Opinion Research Institute (Pori), of which he is president and chief executive officer.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officers also took away computers and boxes of materials from his office.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sources said the investigation was to do with his former deputy at the institute, Chung Kim-wah, who was put on the national security wanted list last month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ahead of the Executive Council meeting, Lee said professional bodies have nothing to worry about if they have no intention to break the law, saying the security laws clearly define what constitutes an offence.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If professional organisations don't have any intention to endanger national security, they just need to follow their own work process, their ethics, their code of conduct in carrying on with their business, and that will be fine," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's stated clearly in the law which sorts of acts constitute offences. And then each time, in every operation, the law enforcement agency will explain clearly what sorts of acts constitute the offence of endangering national security."
  <br>
  <br>
  The chief executive stressed that officers will get to the bottom of every case in accordance with the law.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, sources said the wife and son of Chung Kim-wah were taken to the police station to assist with the investigation.

 Chief Executive John Lee said on Tuesday that plans to redevelop a cluster of government buildings in Wan Chai will go ahead, even though his predecessor, Carrie Lam, is moving her office there.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lam's relocation to Immigration Tower later this year comes after lawmakers complained about how much public money is being spent on the rent for her current office in Pacific Place.
  <br>
  <br>
  Immigration Tower is earmarked for redevelopment, with the building to be used for conventions and commercial use.
  <br>
  <br>
  Before the weekly Executive Council meeting, Lee said Lam's move will be temporary and will ensure the proper use of government resources.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Wan Chai redevelopment plan will go ahead as planned," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The buildings that have been vacated, we should make good use of them. That is why we're now renovating, so as to allow the former chief executive to move in."
  <br>
  <br>
  The government earlier explained that Lam rented the Grade A office space in Admiralty after her term ended in 2022 because there was no room for her at offices for former CEs in Mid-Levels.

 Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday said the government is doing what it can to help Hong Kong residents who were reportedly lured to Southeast Asia for illegal work.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters before the weekly Executive Council meeting, Lee said a task force led by Under Secretary for Security Michael Cheuk has made significant progress.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The visit by the Security Bureau task force I think has achieved some positive results, and they have been met by the Minister of Justice in Thailand," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Thailand officials have already indicated that they will attach great importance to the cases and try all their means to try to rescue those Hong Kong people who are [in captivity]."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee added that authorities will consider various factors when deciding whether to raise Thailand's travel alert to red.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have included a lot of information on the Security Bureau's web page in relation to travel information to Thailand, so I have asked the SB [Security Bureau] to update it regularly with the latest information and developments."
  <br>
  <br>
  SAR officials have received 28 requests for assistance in relation to Hong Kong residents who are allegedly being detained in various Southeast Asian countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sixteen of these people have already returned to Hong Kong, while the other 12 remain stranded.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong passport holders can obtain tourist visas when they arrive at designated control points in Saudi Arabia starting on Wednesday, Chief Executive John Lee announced.
 <br>
  <br>
  Visitors can apply for a multiple-entry visa with stays for up to 90 days or a single-entry visa for a maximum 30-day stay.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That means holders of [an] SAR passport could visit all six members of the Cooperation Council of the Arab States, including Kuwait, Qatar, UAE, Oman and so on," Lee told reporters on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So they could all enjoy either visa-free access or visa-on-arrival application on arrival."
  <br>
  <br>
  Also from Wednesday, Saudi Arabian nationals will be able to visit Hong Kong without a visa for up to 90 days instead of 30, Lee added.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, the Immigration Department said the new arrangements would foster closer ties between the two places.
  <br>
  <br>
  "These arrangements and the extension of the visa-free visit period for nationals of Saudi Arabia will enhance tourism, cultural and economic ties between the two places."

    Three hurt in excavator, rubbish truck smash

<div class="itemFullText">
 Three men were injured on Tuesday when a rubbish truck was crushed by a collapsing noise barrier that had been hit by an out-of-control excavator.
 <br>
  <br>
  The excavator rolled down a slope at a construction site in Lin Tak Road, Lam Tin at around 9.40am, firefighters said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The drivers of both vehicles were among those hurt, but were able to free themselves and were said to have suffered minor injuries.
  <br>
  <br>
  A passenger was trapped in the truck and firefighters spent about two hours freeing him.
  <br>
  <br>
  “After conducting a risk assessment and stabilising the injured person, the Disaster Response and Rescue Team arranged a crane to secure and lift the excavator and the stone block, while simultaneously using explosive tools to create enough space to enable us to rescue him,” Assistant Divisional Officer Kao Chung-lei said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The three men aged between 25 to 50, were conscious when taken to United Christian Hospital for treatment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police said they were investigating the cause of the incident.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong Construction Industry Employees General Union said frontline staff and inspectors should do more to ensure site safety.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Working on-site we have safety personnel and construction workers. They all bear significant responsibility. In situations like this, it's important to find out whether the frontline construction workers and management did their jobs properly," said chairman Chau Sze-kit.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Edward Ma from the Association for the Rights of Industrial Accident Victims said the group is really worried about serious industrial accidents occurring two days in a row, adding that safety awareness is still lacking.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eleven people were injured in a scaffolding collapse at a construction site in Kai Tak on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The code of practice on bamboo scaffolding safety was revised in October, requiring workers to hold a valid safety training certificate before carrying out such works.
  <br>
  <br>
  Labour minister Chris Sun said on Tuesday that the administration would hold a conference with relevant stakeholders to seek improvements in the industry workflow.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Apart from looking into whether or not those involved, have fully complied with the code of practice, we have to look at, which is why we're going to hold a stakeholders conference, inviting not just those involved in scaffolding work, but also the principal contractors as well as those responsible for installing external glass walls,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It's because we have to look at not just the scaffolding work itself, but also the workflow, and also the related work procedures.”
  <br>
  <br>
  He added the government will step up its inspections, as well as take enforcement action against those violating the law.

    Thailand still safe for tourists: travel agency boss

<img alt="Thailand is one of Hong Kong residents' favourite destinations, attracting around 1 million visitors from the SAR each year before Covid. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1787420_2_20250114120033.jpg&q=30">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A leading travel agency said on Tuesday it has no plans to adjust the itinerary of its package tours to Thailand, amid an ongoing investigation by the Hong Kong government to see if any SAR resident was unlawfully detained there.
 <br>
  <br>
  In an interview with RTHK, EGL Tours executive director Steve Huen insisted Thailand remains safe for recreational travellers, and dismissed fears that people would be abducted on the streets.
  <br>
  <br>
  He pointed out the SAR's amber outbound travel alert was issued years ago in response to mass demonstrations in Thailand, and had nothing to do with the current situation.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Huen admitted that enquiries for travel products in the region have dropped. A few individual customers who decided to go ahead signed up for package tours because they felt safer to stick to a group, he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  He did offer some general tips for travellers whenever they are overseas.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When heading out at night for a drink or walk, you should be careful," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You should also stay alert, and for instance, not let others exploit our kindness and trick us into into suffering financial losses."
  <br>
  <br>
  He was confident the jitters will die down soon, especially after government officials clarified on Monday that none of the Hongkongers involved in the alleged incidents of false imprisonment were abducted
  <br>
  <br>
  A task force led by Undersecretary for Security Michael Cheuk is expected to return from Bangkok on Tuesday evening.

<img alt="CES 2025 saw more than 138,000 attendees, according to the Consumer Technology Association. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1787411_1_20250114100720.jpg&q=45">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Everything from autonomous snow blowers to humanoid robots filled the show floors at this year's Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas.
 <br>
  <br>
  Considered the World Cup of technology, the world's largest personal electronics convention wrapped up on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Making their tech presence felt at the four-day event were nearly 100 registered companies from Hong Kong, more than half supported by the Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks Corporation (HKSTP).
  <br>
  <br>
  "So this year, we bring 51 companies from Hong Kong... it's actually a huge growth compared to last year. Last year we have about 18," says Derek Chim, Head of Startup Ecosystem at HKSTP.
  <br>
  <br>
  HKSTP-supported companies brought in three CES Innovation Awards.
  <br>
  <br>
  One of those, Vidi Labs, demonstrated how their wearable device - with AI-driven software - could describe the surrounding environment for a visually-impaired user.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This actually proves a lot that the route that we are on is actually the right one, because a product like this not only is for Hong Kong, it's actually for the rest of the world," said Turzo Bose, co-founder & CEO of Vidi Labs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Also at the Hong Kong Pavilion, South Korean Minji Seo - who earned her PhD in Hong Kong - displays technology that rejuvenates your eyeballs with hot yoga therapy. It's intended to help people with dry eyes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We create a vacuum seal, using the silicone band around the goggle, and that's the chamber that we are controlling the temperature and pressure. Our main goal to join this event was to, like, verify whether we have a market here. And we definitely verified it," said Seo, founder of Ooley Care.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another Hong Kong exhibitor, Michael Wong - a veteran of the Hong Kong hair care industry - uses a scanner to take images of your hair and scalp, and provide an analysis and recommendation for the right shampoo, conditioner and treatment.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We use over millions of pictures to train our AI models so that's why it's accurate, over 90 percent. So everything just can do it within three minutes. So every American has their hair growth again, said Wong, founder and CEO of HairCoSys.
  <br>
  <br>
  His showmanship helps his startup, HairCoSys, stand out among the more than 4,500 exhibitors.
  <br>
  <br>
  But so do products with unique compositions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fever Chu, co-founder of Zence Object Technology, displays everything from a TV remote that integrates recycled tea leaves, to a calculator frame composed of coffee grounds.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are using their waste and turn it into new material and give back to them. Somehow we can help them to promote their waste product, the material, to the bigger market," said Chu.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chu says their products have drawn plenty of interest.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Last night... over 60 [emails] within two days to the potential clients."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chu says he has already heard back from many of them, confirming his belief that companies around the world want a greener supply chain.

 Security chief Chris Tang on Monday said senior Thai officials have promised to do all they could to secure the safe return of Hongkongers who were reportedly lured to Southeast Asia for illegal work.
 <br>
  <br>
  "The minister of justice gave great importance of our concern, and had responded positively. [Thai authorities] said they would do their utmost to help with the safe return of the Hong Kong people," said Tang, who stressed that none of those involved were abducted.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tang's comments came as a task force, led by Under Secretary for Security Michael Cheuk, met Thai officials and representatives of the Chinese embassy in Bangkok.
  <br>
  <br>
  They spoke with representatives from Thailand's justice ministry who sit on the Anti Trafficking-in-Persons Committee chaired by the country's prime minister.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cheuk said he is confident that Thai authorities would do their best to help those affected, noting that Hongkongers involved had been brought to areas near borders with Myanmar and Laos.
  <br>
  <br>
  He declined to disclose further details, saying that the SAR government wishes to rescue these residents as soon as possible.
  <br>
  <br>
  The task force also held talks with Wu Zhiwu, the deputy chief of mission at the Chinese embassy in Thailand, on topics such as offering consular assistance, before meeting with staff at the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office in the Thai capital to discuss further actions.
  <br>
  <br>
  The delegation is set to meet representatives of the Royal Thai Police on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  SAR authorities have so far received 28 requests for assistance in relation to Hong Kong residents alleging to be detained in Southeast Asian countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sixteen of these people have already returned to Hong Kong, while the remaining 12 reported that there were restrictions on their movement but were safe and able to remain in touch with the task force.

    'Marriage a goal for many same-sex couples in HK'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A survey carried out by Chinese University researchers suggests many same-sex couples in Hong Kong would like to get married one day.
 <br>
  <br>
  The government last year said it was working on an alternative legal framework, after the city's top court ordered authorities to look at how to recognise same-sex relationships by October.
  <br>
  <br>
  CUHK researchers on Monday said a survey involving 908 people who identify as members of sexual minorities in Hong Kong in 2023 found 90 percent believe same-sex marriage is important, and around 70 percent would like to get married themselves one day.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Right now, so for married heterosexual couples, they already have an existing framework. So if they can pass on kind of the same pattern of laws, which they can call civil partnership, they can call it marriage, but then make it comparable to non-heterosexual couples, then that would be great," said Alan, who joined the researchers' press conference along with his partner Hong.
  <br>
  <br>
  The couple, who wed in the US in 2022, said the lack of legal recognition of same-sex marriages in Hong Kong at the moment can pose challenges.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For example, when my spouse gets sick, I would like to use my insurance package from work so that he can also be covered for medical visits. But I know in Hong Kong, not all insurance companies explicitly state that your spouse also includes same-sex couples," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And also inheritance rights, that's also a significant hurdle for us," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, CUHK said another survey involving 146 people with non-heterosexual children found more than half of the parents were worried their sons and daughters would not get married due to their sexual orientation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Seventy percent of the parents expressed fears that their children would have no one to take care of them when they are older.

    Four critically injured in scaffolding collapse

<div class="itemFullText">
 Eleven people on Monday were injured in a scaffolding collapse at a construction site in Kai Tak, with four in critical condition and one seriously hurt.
 <br>
  <br>
  Emergency personnel received reports of the incident on Shing Cheong Road at around 4pm.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bamboo structure, measuring 60 by 20 metres, was said to give way at the site where the New Acute Hospital is being built.
  <br>
  <br>
  One worker was temporarily trapped five metres above ground after the collapse, according to firefighters, who said the rescue operation took about an hour.
  <br>
  <br>
  Given the seriousness of the incident, police said they are working with government departments to conduct in-depth investigations.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We would see whether anyone should bear criminal responsibility... The cause of the scaffolding collapse is one of the directions of our investigation," said senior Inspector Li Ka-wai of the Kowloon East regional crime unit.
  <br>
  <br>
  The project at the Kai Tak Development Area is set to be one of the largest hospitals in Hong Kong, with 2,400 beds, and 37 operating theatres.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hospital Authority (HA) expressed concerns over the incident and said the injured workers were hired by the contractor, China State Construction Engineering (Hong Kong) Limited.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The incident occurred at one of the buildings at the new acute hospital construction site, where curtain wall installation works were undergone," the authority said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "All scaffolding work at the site will be temporarily suspended, and the HA reserves the right to hold the construction contractor accountable."
  <br>
  <br>
  The authority has instructed the contractor to implement all necessary safety measures as soon as possible and requested it to thoroughly investigate the cause of the incident and to submit a report.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fay Siu from the Association for the Rights of Industrial Accident Victims noted that a similar incident happened in Kai Tak almost a year ago, saying it showed that there are safety hazards when bamboo scaffolding is used.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The government should review the safety of bamboo scaffolding, because they are not made from a very stable material," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If we are continuing to use bamboo scaffolding, there should be better inspections. The use of metal scaffolding should be encouraged too."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong Construction Industry Employees General Union has also strongly urged labour authorities to conduct an in-depth probe and make its report public.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Labour Department must seriously learn from the hard lessons of past industrial accidents, quickly review regulatory and enforcement loopholes, swiftly address deficiencies, and effectively strengthen supervision and inspection work," it said.

    'Reducing sodium will not affect dim sum taste'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Centre for Food Safety of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department urged dim sum restaurants to reduce sodium content in their dishes after its survey revealed that a small decrease in salt would not affect its taste.
 <br>
  <br>
  The department conducted a test among 72 people to evaluate standard and reduced-sodium samples of two types of classic dim sum dishes, including shrimp siu mai and steamed pork ribs in black bean sauce.
  <br>
  <br>
  The results showed that only 15 people were able to identify the altered shrimp siu mai, while only 13 spotted the modified steamed pork ribs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tony Chow, principal medical officer of risk assessment and communication at the Centre for Food Safety, said restaurants could consider choosing ingredients with lower sodium content or using natural ingredients for flavouring and marinating.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We advise the [dim sum] trade to consider the reformulation of the dim sum so that the sodium content can be reduced because our study indicates that for the 10 to 20 percent reduction in sodium, the consumer will not differentiate the difference in the sodium content," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They should not worry [that] the less salty food will be rejected by the consumer."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chow also said people should request that their dim sum be served separately from sauces when possible, and to taste before including additional flavouring.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also recommended that people share dim sum dishes when possible to avoid indulging, adding that the elderly should be more mindful of sodium levels when choosing their dishes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The department said the World Health Organisation recommends less than five grammes of salt intake daily, as excessive sodium intake could increase the risk of high blood pressure, and other diseases.

  Police said the incident happened at about 3pm on Monday on Waterloo Road near Ferry Street.
  <br>
  <br>

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan said on Monday that Hong Kong can offer professional services to companies seeking to diversify risk by moving their businesses to different places.
 <br>
  <br>
  At the annual Asian Financial Forum, the minister noted that many firms are realigning or restructuring their industrial and supply chains across different countries, particularly in the Global South.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said Hong Kong, as a supply chain management centre, has things to offer companies seeking diversification.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The [firms] would require project finance, corporate treasury and logistics services, professional consultancies and extensive international connections," Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong is well positioned and geared up to provide all these services as a one-stop shop to help businesses expand their presence in the region and beyond effectively."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said the SAR will navigate the global geopolitical and economic landscape with caution and confidence, saying opportunities come with every challenge.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that Hong Kong can also offer technological solutions and sustainable development for the region, with its plans to develop an innovation and technology cooperation zone with Shenzhen in the Hetao area, also known as the Lok Ma Chau Loop.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said the SAR is looking to expand in areas such as artificial intelligence, biotech and new energy.
  <br>
  <br>
  And the Loop, he said, is an example of Hong Kong forming synergy with sister cities in the Greater Bay area for IT development, such as speeding up the development of medicines.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[The zone] will be a base to pioneer with innovative policies and collaborations, such as joint clinical trials that leverage on data and bio-samples from both the mainland and Hong Kong," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister stressed that these areas of development come on top of the SAR's traditional positioning as an international financial centre.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Tourism officials on Monday called on industry leaders to find ways to attract more overnight visitors to Hong Kong during the Lunar New Year "golden week" holiday on the mainland, as they expect a significant rise in tourist numbers over the eight-day period.
 <br>
  <br>
  Rosanna Law, the secretary for culture, sports and tourism, noted the upcoming holiday is a peak travel season and the SAR would be holding a series of festive activities.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We expect there to be a significant increase in tourists visiting Hong Kong during the Lunar New Year golden week," Law said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We encourage the industry to seize this opportunity and be flexible to provide visitors with more high-quality and innovative experiences, attract them to stay overnight in Hong Kong to fully experience Hong Kong's unique festive atmosphere."
  <br>
  <br>
  Law, who chaired a meeting with various government departments and representatives of the tourism and hotel sectors, also said relevant authorities would continue to maintain close communication and make preparations on welcoming visitors.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The chief executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, Eddie Yue, has welcomed news that the People's Bank of China will unveil various measures to boost financial collaboration between the SAR and the mainland.
 <br>
  <br>
  PBOC Governor Pan Gongsheng made the announcement during a speech on the first day of the Asian Financial Forum.
  <br>
  <br>
  The measures include the linking of Hong Kong's Fast Payment System (FPS) to the mainland's Internet Banking Payment System (IBPS).
  <br>
  <br>
  “Residents in the two places can make real-time cross-boundary payments using their phone number,” Yue told reporters after attending the forum.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We expect to launch part of the service in the middle of the year, and will expand the scheme slowly and in an orderly manner, based on our actual implementation situation and experience.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Other measures include the launch of a trade finance scheme to help enterprises trading in yuan improve liquidity.
  <br>
  <br>
  There will be 100 billion yuan available in currency swaps for one, three and six months.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yue said the scheme will be rolled out by February.
  <br>
  <br>
  From Tuesday, the clearing time for Southbound Trading under Bond Connect will be pushed back by one hour to 4.30pm, while mainland investors will also be allowed to buy securities of more currency types, including the US dollar and the euro.
  <br>
  <br>
  Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury Christopher Hui, for his part, said the various measures show the central bank’s support in consolidating Hong Kong’s role as a financial centre.

 Governor of the People's Bank of China (PBOC) Pan Gongsheng on Monday said Beijing will significantly increase the proportion of its national foreign exchange reserves and asset allocation in Hong Kong, as part of efforts to boost the development of the city's financial markets.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at the 18th annual Asian Financial Forum in the SAR, Pan also said authorities will continue to deepen the financial market connectivity between Hong Kong and the mainland, to attract foreign capital.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Prosperous capital markets are the cornerstone of Hong Kong as an international financial centre...We'll support more quality enterprises to list and issue bonds in the SAR, and continue to improve connectivity between the mainland and Hong Kong in areas like stocks, bonds, wealth management and interest rate swaps, to deepen financial cooperation within the Greater Bay Area," he told forum participants.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will significantly increase the proportion of our foreign exchange reserves and our asset allocation in Hong Kong to open up a broader space for Hong Kong's financial development."
  <br>
  <br>
  Pan said the PBOC and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority will introduce relevant policies to improve Hong Kong's offshore renminbi markets, while providing more convenience regarding cross-border payment and settlements.
  <br>
  <br>
  One of the measures is the launch of an additional renminbi trade financing liquidity fund, with terms of one month, three months and six months, totalling 100 billion yuan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, Zhou Ji, executive deputy director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office (HKMAO), said the central government will continue to support the SAR in consolidating its status as a global financial hub.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the future, the central government will, as always, do its utmost to support the consolidation of Hong Kong's status as an international financial centre, trade centre and shipping centre, and will support the SAR in accelerating the pace of developing scientific and technological innovation," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  On another note, Zhou said Beijing will continue to create new advantages by developing new quality productive forces to help with regional growth, stressing that the Chinese economy remains resilient with stable fundamentals.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Former security minister Lai Tung-kwok said he was optimistic about the prospects of the SAR's task force in Thailand, which is investigating allegations that Hongkongers have been lured to Southeast Asian countries to engage in illegal types of work.
 <br>
  <br>
  The task force, led by Undersecretary for Security Michael Cheuk, with members from Security Bureau and the Immigration Department, flew to Thailand on Sunday, after receiving 28 requests for assistance connected to Hong Kong residents who were allegedly held in the region against their will.
  <br>
  <br>
  So far, 16 people have managed to return to Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  Seven men and five women reported restrictions on their movement, but are safe and able to remain in touch with the task force. It is thought they were not forcibly abducted.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a RTHK programme on Monday, Lai said the SAR government was highly concerned which is why it sent the task force led by Cheuk.
  <br>
  <br>
  He had high hopes for the task force's prospects given it has been liaising with Thai authorities.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lai also believed the Thai police would also pay high attention to such incidents, considering the potential impact on tourism.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The Thai police also attach importance to this issue because it seriously affects the country's tourist industry. There have been media reports that many mainland tourists have cancelled trips to Thailand over the upcoming Lunar New Year - so I think Thailand wants to handle any incidents well,” Lai said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lai said many were lured to Southeast Asia on bogus job offers.
  <br>
  <br>
  He called on authorities to raise public awareness about the dangers of getting lured by such schemes.

    Pollster under probe over 'assisting absconder'

 Security minister Chris Tang has confirmed that national security police are investigating whether pollster Robert Chung or his research organisation had provided assistance to an absconder.
 <br>
  <br>
  Sources earlier said Chung was taken away from his home on Monday morning, and brought to the Wong Chuk Hang office of the Public Opinion Research Institute, of which he is president and chief executive officer.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Chung was being invited back to the police station for investigations on suspected assistance to an absconder. At this moment in time, Chung has not been arrested," Tang told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This has nothing to do with any research being done by Chung or his organisation. Our whole investigation is focusing on how Chung and his organisation [allegedly assisted] the absconder. It's absolutely nothing to do with the result of their poll."
  <br>
  <br>
  It's understood the probe is related to the pollster's former deputy at the institute, Chung Kim-wah.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last month, Chung Kim-wah was last month put on a police wanted list for alleged national security offences.
  <br>
  <br>
  He is suspected of inciting secession on social media and colluding with foreign forces, and police are offering a HK$1 million reward for information leading to his arrest.

 Chief Executive John Lee has told thousands of business leaders from around the world that Hong Kong is working towards developing itself into an international gold trading centre.
 <br>
  <br>
  Delivering his opening remarks at the Asian Financial Forum on Monday, Lee revealed that the SAR will build world-class gold storage facilities, and strengthen support services in insurance, testing and certification, as well as logistics.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Ultimately, we plan to create a holistic gold trading centre with an industry chain," Lee said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The stability in Hong Kong amidst rapid changes in geopolitics around the world will provide a world of investors a secure environment for gold storage as well as other forms of wealth management."
  <br>
  <br>
  He also said the SAR will build on its existing advantages, and expand its overseas network, particularly with Belt and Road countries and regions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our strategies include strengthening financial cooperation with the Middle East and the 10-member states of ASEAN, as well as other established and emerging markets."
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will also organise more international financial events, seek collaboration in financial products, talent and experience sharing, and attract more overseas enterprises and capital to Hong Kong."
  <br>
  <br>
  The 18th edition of the two-day Asian Financial Forum - themed "Powering the Next Growth Engine" - has attracted some 3,600 business and financial leaders from more than 50 countries and regions this year.
