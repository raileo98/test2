 An SAR government rescue team is set to begin inspection work on the ground in earthquake-stricken Myanmar as they arrived in the country's capital Naypyidaw.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 51-member team, led by deputy chief fire officer Cheu Yu-kok, were greeted by diplomats from the Chinese Embassy in Myanmar.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a video posted on the Security Bureau's Facebook page, Cheu said his squad will work with other rescue teams to assess the situation and make further action plans.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chief Executive John Lee said earlier the SAR government has earmarked HK$30 million from the Disaster Relief Fund to help victims of the tremor.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, a number of international rescue organisations called for support for the quake victims.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kyi Minn, national director of World Vision International Myanmar, talked about the devastation in a video message on Facebook.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was quite a prolonged quake compared to the previous one, like nearly four to five minutes is shaking. So staff were quite nervous and could not contact anyone because all the phone lines were cut off," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also expressed concerns about the safety of children, particularly those separated from their parents.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong Red Cross, for its part, said it has allocated HK$200,000 in relief support.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The head of the Hong Kong, China Rugby Association, James Farndon, on Sunday hailed the first-ever Sevens at the Kai Tak Stadium, calling the event a massive success for the SAR.
 <br>
  <br>
  Farndon stressed the importance of the upgraded fan experience at the new venue, following nearly half a century at the Hong Kong Stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's been an amazing experience for all involved," Farndon told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The main point I'd make is what the experience is like for the fans -- and from what I see, it's obviously a bigger house, bigger party. The fan experience has been fantastic."
  <br>
  <br>
  He also spoke about the popularity of the stadium's South Stand.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The South Stand's been rocking, and the entertainment has been fantastic too," he added. "If you look at the other aspects of the stadium we've been able to add in... it's just a lot more for the fans to experience, and I think they really enjoyed it."
  <br>
  <br>
  Farndon also highlighted the work to bring the showpiece tournament to Kai Tak, having gone through multiple stress tests in the run-up to the three-day sporting event.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's been a real journey for us, but a real positive one," Farndon explained. "We've had test events at various stages, which have been able to give experience to our event operations team -- to learn the back of house and how [the Sevens] is going to work for the players, coaches and the international teams coming in."
  <br>
  <br>
  Brett Robinson, the chairman of World Rugby, also spoke highly about new Kai Tak experience.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For those of us who had the chance to be around [the stadium], and also from an athlete's perspective, it's purpose-built for the game of Sevens," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You've got women that are singing songs, and athletes that are just really enjoying the experience and really feeling quite valued."

<div class="itemFullText">
 Culture, sports and tourism minister Rosanna Law said operators of Kai Tak Sports Park made improvements every day during the three-day Rugby Sevens tournament.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters on Sunday afternoon at Kai Tak, Law said the atmosphere and operations at the venue were very good in general.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I also had to wait in line for some time when buying a hamburger yesterday, so I told the venue operators to enhance their food supply services. The operators increased their supplies today, and I know that more staff were arranged to help out at vendors at the arena and youth sports ground," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Law added that more improvements can be made in terms of the variety of food available, and whether to allow more taxis there to help disperse visitors.
  <br>
  <br>
  She also called on fans to make use of the MTR and buses to leave the venue when the Sevens draw to a close.

    Cathay plane flyover marks old airport's centennial

<div class="itemFullText">
 A Cathay Pacific aircraft on Sunday flew near Kai Tak during the Hong Kong Sevens, an area where the city's former international airport began operations 100 years ago.
 <br>
  <br>
  The A350 operated by the flagship carrier took off for its tour over Hong Kong at around 4pm, flying over Victoria Harbour and passing the old Kai Tak Airport runway.
  <br>
  <br>
  The aircraft flew at an altitude of as low as 1,100ft.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some at the Kai Tak Stadium were able to see the plane through giant windows near the South Stand, while others viewed the flyover on a big screen.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stuart Morton, who's lived in Hong Kong for decades, said he felt nostalgic when he saw the plane.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I first came here in 1985 with the military. I landed at Kai Tak," he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It brings back memories of coming in over [Checkerboard Hill], turning around and then coming and landing at Kai Tak."
  <br>
  <br>
  Visitor Mavi Mbochay said the flyover served as a reminder of what the stadium used to be.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It just symbolises the history. It's important to connect the past and the future," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The flyover marked the centennial of the old airport.

 Rugby lovers from Hong Kong and beyond filled up the Kai Tak Stadium on Sunday to enjoy a final day of sport and partying at the Hong Kong Sevens.
 <br>
  <br>
  Now in its new home, the annual rugby showcase isn't just about the action on the pitch. The food and drinks, the raucous atmosphere and the people are also what attracted fans to the stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brian Hopkins, who supports Great Britain, said the Sevens is the perfect occasion to celebrate his 40th birthday.
  <br>

   "There's no better place to do it. It's a great atmosphere, great rugby, great stadium as well," he told RTHK. "We tried the food, we tried plenty of drinks... It's going to be a keg of Guinness against my name."
   <br>
   <br>
   For Donna Hopkins, the stadium was friendly to wheelchair users.
   <br>
   <br>
   "Down and around here, I could get to the food, the toilets were really accessible. I could see the pitch really well," she said.
   <br>
   <br>

    Brett Muntz, who grew up in Fiji and now lives in New Zealand, stuck to his roots and supports the Flying Fijians.
    <br>
    <br>
    "It's all about the people, connecting and enjoying a magnificent occasion and this magnificent venue," he said. "Everyone seems to come for the right reason - have a good time, meet people, enjoy, and leave the results on the field and celebrate together."

     Epeli Buliciri, also a Fiji fan, was adding this year's Hong Kong Sevens to his impressive resume.
     <br>
     <br>
     "This is my 122nd tournament. It's my 17th Hong Kong Sevens tournament," he said.
     <br>
     <br>
     "Hong Kong is always special for Fiji. Even sometimes when life gets down and all that, you can always rely on the Hong Kong Sevens and the Fiji team to get you back up there."

     His hat with a glistening pin collection was not the only one competing for attention at the stadium.

       Others drew inspiration from Freddy, an animated weatherman on local TV.

       The group said they planned for their costume one month or two ago, and chose one relating to rainy conditions.

    'Hutchison deal won't stop family offices coming here'

<img alt="Christopher Hui says the SAR is an attractive destination for capital and family offices. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798116_1_20250330155453.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The controversy over CK Hutchison's plans to sell dozens of ports won't affect family offices' interest in investing in Hong Kong, financial services minister Christopher Hui said on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a TV programme, Hui said those attending the Wealth for Good in Hong Kong Summit last week did not raise concerns about the deal.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said 160 family offices from around the world indicated they will or are planning to set up shop in Hong Kong, of which a quarter are from Europe and the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So as you can see, I think there has been absolutely no impact. We continue to be an ideal destination for attracting capital and especially for family offices and other institutions to establish themselves here."
  <br>
  <br>
  Hui also said the government is planning to amend legislation to expand tax concessions for family office investments, covering loans, virtual assets and carbon credits.
  <br>
  <br>
  He expressed confidence that the number of family offices in Hong Kong would increase from 2,700 to over 3,000 in the short term.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sources said the US$23 billion port deal between CK Hutchison and a consortium led by American investment firm BlackRock, which includes strategic assets along the Panama Canal, won't be signed as expected this week.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing officials in charge of SAR affairs have reposted a number of commentaries at the Ta Kung Pao newspaper, criticising the proposed sale.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the latest piece reposted by the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office on Sunday, political and business leaders were quoted as saying that the impact of the proposed deal extends beyond commerce to national security.
  <br>
  <br>
  The article said various sectors in Hong Kong support the move by the State Administration for Market Regulation to examine the deal, adding it is critical for safeguarding fair competition and national interests.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also urged CK Hutchison to reconsider the deal, quoting a number of Hong Kong lawmakers as saying it's naive to view it as a business matter only, given the complex international environment.

 Financial Secretary Paul Chan said "Super March" has attracted more than 3.4 million visitors to Hong Kong, a 12 percent increase from a year ago.
 <br>
  <br>
  As of Friday, non-mainland arrivals this month reached 960,000, accounting for almost 30 percent of the total.
  <br>
  <br>
  Writing on his weekly blog, Chan also said hotel occupancy at popular areas was near 90 percent, while the retail sector also said the increased foot traffic helped their business.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong has hosted more than 10 major events this month, including snooker's World Grand Prix, the Rugby Sevens and the Art Basel art fair.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan wrote on his blog that when he spoke to visitors and exhibitors at the Art Basel, he expressed hope that more people will do business in Hong Kong apart from enjoying art.
  <br>
  <br>
  The financial secretary also said the new Kai Tak Sports Arena has provided a larger venue and finer facilities for events such as the Rugby Sevens.
  <br>
  <br>
  Attendance at the Sevens is expected to top 140,000 from Friday to Sunday, and all hospitality boxes have been sold out.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Many business representatives attending financial events in Hong Kong this week told me that they look forward to watching matches and participating in other cultural events to experience the vibrancy of the city, in addition to having business meetings," he wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan also said the administration will continue to promote its mega-events economy to attract more high-end business travellers to the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that the government will encourage and support businesses to develop more special products and services, to make Hong Kong a prosperous and enjoyable place.

 Police Commissioner Raymond Siu on Sunday said the force's efforts to raise its image among young people were bearing fruit.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a Commercial Radio programme, Siu said the police have been spreading the message that the force is acting for the benefit of young people.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We asked a university to conduct public opinion research last year and the results are encouraging. It surveyed young people aged 18 to 29 on their views towards the police force and the force's ratings have increased by almost 38 percent. This shows that our efforts over the past few years have not been wasted," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said that the force had faced unprecedented challenges during the 2019 social unrest but that officers had remained united while under great pressure.
  <br>
  <br>
  Siu also said frontline staff had contributed greatly to the city moving from chaos to order.
  <br>
  <br>
  Siu will step down from his post on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I hope the force will continue to work hard and tell citizens clearly what kind of a team we are. I think the Hong Kong Police Force is the most efficient, empathetic and passionate in the world when it comes to police work," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Siu said he would miss working for the force.

 Chief Executive John Lee says the SAR government has earmarked HK$30 million from the Disaster Relief Fund to help victims of the severe earthquake that struck central Myanmar on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a Facebook post on Saturday evening, Lee said the government was in close contact with rescue groups to provide swift relief assistance to affected communities.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Disaster Relief Fund Advisory Committee will promptly process related funding applications from organisations," he wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CE added that officials are coordinating with Myanmar's Consul-General in Hong Kong to collect and deliver necessary relief supplies.
  <br>
  <br>
  A 51-member SAR rescue team, including personnel from various departments and two search dogs, arrived in Yangon on Sunday morning.
  <br>
  <br>
  The team, carrying nine tonnes of relief supplies, will drive for 10 hours to the affected area.
  <br>
  <br>
  The number of dead in Myanmar and Thailand stood at nearly 1,700, while thousands were hurt.
  <br>
  <br>
  About 200 people were unaccounted for in both countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among those injured were 13 Chinese nationals in Myanmar, according to the Chinese Embassy in Myanmar.
  <br>
  <br>
  The embassy also said as of Sunday morning, it had received and handled hundreds of requests for help from Chinese citizens and assisted dozens of people in finding their missing relatives and friends.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, rescuers from Myanmar and Yunnan province joined hands in plucking to safety an elderly man who had been trapped for nearly 40 hours under the rubble in the capital, Naypyitaw.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was the first survivor rescued by the 37-member Chinese team that arrived at the quake-hit area on Saturday. (Additional reporting by Xinhua)

 Fans soaked up the raucous atmosphere at the new Kai Tak Stadium where the Hong Kong Sevens are being held for the first time.
 <br>
  <br>
  Applause and cheers filled the air as day two of the tournament got underway, with many fans praising the party-like mood at the new stadium.
  <br>

   <br>
   One Australian spectator, Dan – who has been to many previous editions of the Sevens in Causeway Bay's Hong Kong Stadium – said he really likes the new venue.
   <br>
   <br>
   "It feels like the old stadium's atmosphere, just in a much more upgraded arena. It's a great new stadium."
   <br>
   <br>
   He said that besides Australia, he has thrown his support behind the Hong Kong, China squad in the Melrose Claymores competition – after both the men's and women's sides won big in both their respective matches earlier in the day.
   <br>
   <br>
   "[The SAR squad] is always my next best team," he said. "The atmosphere when they play is amazing. I can't wait to see the stadium packed out, it's gonna be a great time."
   <br>
   <img src="https://rthk-s3-nps-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/mfile_1798035_4_L_20250329183213.jpg">
    <div class="image-title-1">

    </div>
    <br>
    Another fan, from the United Kingdom, shared similar views on the new arena.
    <br>
    <br>
    "I think it's absolutely fantastic," he told RTHK. "Not only is [the stadium] bigger, you've got all those fancy light shows and the tech and everything. All the amenities and everything is so much better – absolutely amazing atmosphere."
    <br>
    <br>
    The stadium's South Stand – where many fans are known to gather in large numbers at the Sevens each year – reached maximum capacity just after 1pm.
    <br>

     "It's a great vibe here," another Australia fan, named Justin, said.
     <br>
     <br>
     "There's space, you can walk around and meet all your friends and your mates. It's unreal."
     <br>
     <br>
     Meanwhile, rugby players said the roar of the crowd was electrifying.
     <br>
     <br>
     "We were so excited to be on the pitch. The crowds were very enthusiastic, cheering us on." Jiang Yutong, who plays for the national women's squad, told RTHK.
     <br>
     <br>
     "It feels so good."

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police Commissioner Raymond Siu revealed on Saturday that the force has arrested 157 people in relation to the space oil drug.
 <br>
  <br>
  He pointed out that 37 of the arrestees were aged below 21, and 16 of them were students.
  <br>
  <br>
  The figure was recorded between February 14 – when etomidate, the drug's main ingredient was classified as a dangerous drug – and Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Siu told reporters that police have stepped up enforcement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Apart from stepping up street patrols, we also have a lot of intelligence-led operations," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Among the 120 cases, the arrests for 70 of the cases were carried out on the streets, and another 50 were made in non-public places."
  <br>
  <br>
  He emphasised that all stakeholders, including school principals and teachers, as well as social workers, play a crucial role in tackling the space oil drug issue.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Constitutional and Mainland Affairs Erick Tsang said on Saturday the government will step up its promotion on national security education next month, to achieve patriotism everywhere.
 <br>
  <br>
  His remarks came as the SAR prepares to mark National Security Education Day on April 15.
  <br>
  <br>
  In an interview with a local newspaper, Tsang pointed out that the Constitutional and Mainland Affairs Bureau will coordinate with relevant departments to promote national security at various levels.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister pointed out that since the Working Group on Patriotic Education was set up last year, it has strengthened national history and culture, as well as national affairs education on different fronts to widely promote the spirit of patriotism.
  <br>
  <br>
  Looking ahead, the group will adopt short-, medium- and long-term goals and measures, Tsang said, adding that his bureau will continue to attach great importance and enhance national security education.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Saturday said Hong Kong will send a search and rescue team to Myanmar, after a magnitude 7.7 earthquake struck the country.
 <br>
  <br>
  The massive quake which struck central Myanmar on Friday, also affected neighbouring Thailand, with the death toll passing 1,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee, along with Secretary for Security Chris Tang sent the rescue team off at the airport in the afternoon.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CE said the team is made up of professionals from multiple departments.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This rescue team has 51 members, including the team leader, who is a deputy chief fire officer. Other members come from the Security Bureau, the Fire Services and Immigration Departments and the Hospital Authority. There are also two doctors and two nurses,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier in a Facebook post, the CE expressed condolences to the victims on behalf of all Hongkongers and the government.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tang, for his part, said the rescue team would first fly to Yangon and then make a ten-hour drive to reach central Myanmar.
  <br>
  <br>
  “After arriving, the team will get in touch with the local commander in charge of the rescue operation. Then they will assess to situation and determine which areas and aspects of work the team can help with,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tang added the administration has so far received enquiries from 55 Hongkongers as of 5pm, but none of them required assistance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, a Hongkonger currently in Bangkok, which was also hit by the devastating earthquake on Friday, said he would not cancel his travel plans.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mr Siu said he was shopping with his wife when he felt the tremor, and the shaking had made people around panic and rush outside for safety.
  <br>

  “It has been a day since the earthquake, and there haven't been many aftershocks. Unless something significant happens, I don't plan to change my itinerary,” he told RTHK on Saturday morning.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another tourist who flew to Hong Kong from Bangkok on Saturday morning said that normalcy was being restored in the Thai capital after the quake.
  <br>
  <br>
  “[Transport] is back. Everything is fine today, It’s better than yesterday. But I am still sad about the earthquake. I was working on the 25th floor. I felt the earthquake, [I was] so shocked,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Immigration Department said it would continue to monitor the situation and work with Chinese Embassies in Thailand and Myanmar.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, local travel agency, WWPKG, said it will cancel all tour groups to Thailand in April. It said about 150 affected customers can either choose to switch to a different tour or receive a full refund.

<img alt="Health chief Lo Chung-mau hopes the public can turn to other choices than A&E when the new fees take effect next year. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797998_1_20250329122451.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Secretary for Health Lo Chung-mau says he hopes some people can find alternatives to accident and emergency wards at public hospitals at all times when new fees take effect.
 <br>
  <br>
  From next year, non-critical and non-emergency patients - or those who are classified as category three to five patients - will have to pay HK$400 when they visit A&E, up from the current flat rate of HK$180.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities hope higher fees for non-critical and non-emergency patients will deter them, so urgent cases can receive prompt care.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lo said some patients abused A&E services, such as heading there to get a sick leave certificate.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Apart from the low charges, A&E are open 24 hours a day, 365 days a-year. It's very convenient, and people don't need to make a booking in advance. You only need to go straight to the wards, which is very convenient. This is necessary for those who are critically ill or need resuscitation," he told a Commercial Radio show.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I said a small group of people abused the system, but some people really misused it... I believe the public need to change this mindset."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lo pointed out that if A&E doctors - who were specially trained to save critically ill patients - had to take care of patients with mild illnesses, that would be a waste of resources.
  <br>
  <br>
  Patients with minor problems should head to their family doctors instead, the health chief said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lo also told an RTHK radio programme that almost half of the semi- and non-urgent - or category four and five patients - showed up at A&E between 8am and 4pm.
  <br>
  <br>
  During this period, there are definitely other choices than A&E, he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lo emphasised that the revamp was not aimed at helping the government tackle its budget deficit.
  <br>
  <br>
  We are only aiming to better safeguard patients and reduce wastage, he added.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Both the men’s and women’s squads for the SAR on Saturday kept their winning streak alive on day two of the Hong Kong Sevens, which also saw an end to New Zealand's campaign to win a third-straight title.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong China men’s squad beat Japan 43-21 in the Melrose Claymores competition.
  <br>
  <br>
  The team’s captain, James Christie – who came up big in the second half – said team effort played a big role in their victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  “You know it’s all about scoring tries and we all got people who could finish them off, you know, but it’s nice to come on on the end of a nice team try, and that’s what makes us good,” Christie told RTHK after the match.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also described the atmosphere at the new stadium, which has a retractable roof, as “crazy”.
  <br>
  <br>
  “With the roof open, it’s still as loud, so it’s pretty crazy, especially some of [the people] at the South Stand [who have been here] since 8am I think…Thank you all for coming out, means the world to us.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier, the SAR women’s squad easily saw off their Thai opponents 47-0, with the crowd “absolutely pumping from start to finish," Pete Laverick, RTHK's sports correspondent who watched the match at Kai Tak Stadium, said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both squads have secured a spot in the Melrose tournament’s finals which will be held on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the main Sevens tournament, there has been a major upset in the men's Cup quarterfinals, where France beat defending champions New Zealand by 21-14, denying the Kiwis' attempt to win a third consecutive title in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  France – who had trailed New Zealand by 14 points before coming from behind to take the win – will now take on Fiji, with Australia facing Argentina in the semifinals on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  And on the women's side, it will be Canada versus New Zealand, while Australia take on France in Sunday's semifinals.

    'Longer grace period doesn't mean landlords can relax'

<img alt="The administration has introduced a countdown period to penalise landlords who enter new tenancy contracts for units that haven’t been certified. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797986_1_20250329102422.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Housing Winnie Ho on Saturday said she hoped landlords of subdivided flats would take action to upgrade them, even though they now had a longer grace period to comply with new criteria.
 <br>
  <br>
  Under the Housing Bureau's latest proposal for a regulatory framework to manage the city’s subdivided units, landlords will be given a 36-month grace period to make necessary improvements so they can be certified as Basic Housing Units.
  <br>
  <br>
  The grace period was previously proposed as 12 - or up to 24 months - after a 12-month registration period.
  <br>
  <br>
  The administration has also introduced a countdown period, starting six months before the end of the grace period.
  <br>
  <br>
  During the countdown period, landlords who enter new tenancy contracts for units that haven’t been certified may face a maximum fine of HK$300,000 and be jailed for up to three years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho told a Commercial Radio programme that she hoped landlords wouldn't leave their renovations until the last minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Just like when we were in university and the lecturer gave us two extra weeks to finish our coursework, some students would just go watch a movie, thinking they had plenty of time. We want to avoid that with landlords. Even though the grace period is extended, we need to introduce some kind of enforcement to ensure they stay on track and don’t get too relaxed,” said Ho.
  <br>
  <br>
  Landlords also have to hire a certified professional to assess their units in order to obtain the Basic Housing Unit recognition, which will be valid for five years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho noted that the list of certified professionals has been expanded to include some 8,000 engineers, which now also feature specialists under the disciplines of fire and building services.
  <br>
  <br>
  A fee is payable to the government for the certification process and the housing minister said the charge would be around a few thousand dollars, although the exact amount has yet to be finalised.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government’s revised Basic Housing Units legislation will be discussed in Legco's housing panel on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the first group of 50 light public housing tenants moved into their flats in Yuen Long on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho said about 50 to 100 tenants would move in every day and the plan is to get all 2,156 tenants for the Yau Pok Road project to move in by the end of May.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development Algernon Yau on Friday said the SAR government is taking forward a series of initiatives to protect intellectual property rights to help develop the city into a regional IP trading centre.
 <br>
  <br>
  He was speaking after visiting a company in Beijing that had developed toys with proprietary intellectual property that had found success in both domestic and overseas markets.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yau noted that the effective protection and efficient transaction of IP is crucial to promoting the development of cultural and creative industries as well as technological innovation.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister also met with representatives of the China Alcoholic Drinks Association to promote opportunities for wine merchants in Hong Kong following the deduction in liquor duty announced in last October’s Policy Address, which had resulted in increases in both the quantity and value of liquor imported into the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yau said Hong Kong could serve as a key hub for trading and distribution of high-end liquor, including Chinese baijiu, and Mainland wine merchants are encouraged to use Hong Kong as a platform for Chinese baijiu to go global.

    CK Hutchison ports deal 'won't be signed next week'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A controversial ports deal between CK Hutchison and a consortium led by US investment firm BlackRock won’t be signed as expected next week – according to a source with close links to the Hong Kong conglomerate.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong-based firm owned by tycoon Li Ka-shing announced earlier this month that it had entered into a in-principle agreement to sell 45 ports from 23 countries – including two ports near the Panama Canal – in a US$23 billion deal.
  <br>
  <br>
  A filing to the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing stated that the negotiations would last 145 days, with reports suggesting both sides were planning to sign "definitive documents" on April 2.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the source on Friday revealed that the signing will not happen next week, saying, “Everyone knows why.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the State Administration for Market Regulation's anti-monopoly branch told the Ta Kung Wen Wei Media Group that it will conduct a review of the deal in accordance with the law to protect fair competition and safeguard the public interest.
  <br>
  <br>
  A local deputy to the National People’s Congress and chairman of the Federation of Trade Unions, Stanley Ng, said anything irregular that’s discovered in the review should be halted immediately.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ng further stressed that influential businessmen here must have a sense of national security and consider matters from the perspective of the nation.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office and the central government’s liaison office here have both repeatedly reposted articles from Ta Kung Pao criticising the deal.

<div class="itemFullText">
 There were winning starts for the Hong Kong, China men's and women's squads on Friday as the Rugby Sevens got underway to much fanfare at the Kai Tak Sports Park.
 <br>
  <br>
  The SAR men's representatives - who are looking to defend their Melrose Claymores title - cruised to a 31-7 victory over the national team.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[We're] feeling pretty good, we went down early there, so we [had] good composure, good fightback to score some good tries out there," men's captain James Christie told RTHK after the win, who also credited the support of home fans at the stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You have to be here to witness it. It's nothing like I've seen before. Obviously [the fans are] the eighth man on the pitch, so it really helps us, inspires us."
  <br>
  <br>
  They will look to keep their winning momentum going when they take on Japan on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The women's side, meanwhile, held on for a 29-14 win over Kazakhstan in the opener. They will next face Thailand.
  <br>
  <br>
  Co-captain Chloe Chan was confident that the squad can clinch the top prize, having finished as runners-up last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We trained hard in and out every day," Chan said. "Once we're on there, it's all the same stuff – if we all do our job well, then we'll be okay."
  <br>
  <br>
  The two matches were separated by an official opening ceremony featuring a dragon and lion dance, a performance by cheerleaders of South Korean baseball team Kia Tigers, and a laser show on the pitch.
  <br>
  <br>
  Irish rugby legend Brian O'Driscoll and former Hong Kong winger Salom Yiu also made an appearance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Outside the Melrose Claymores, 12 teams in the men's - and another 12 for the women's - fought to reach the knockout round.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both the New Zealand men's and women's are aiming to defend their Hong Kong Sevens titles for a third successive year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The women's squad, who are 12-time champions in the SAR, began the day with a 45-0 demolition of the national team.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was a really good game, and I thought we played pretty well," captain Sarah Hirini said after the match.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[We] did some pretty cool things out there, and obviously very stoked to get a win like that against China who are a very quality team."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Kiwis men's, meanwhile, also took care of business by beating Australia 21-12 in the opener.
  <br>
  <br>
  Argentina, which fielded only a men's team, are also emerging as favourites. They were dominant on Friday, with big wins over Ireland and the United States.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A Cathay Pacific flight to Bangkok was forced to return to Hong Kong after take-off on Friday after a deadly earthquake that hit Thailand and Myanmar.
 <br>
  <br>
  The powerful tremor left at least several people dead and dozens wounded in the two Southeast Asian countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to flight tracking websites, CX751 took off at Hong Kong International Airport just after 3pm, and was near Hainan island when it made a u-turn. It landed at Chek Lap Kok just before 5pm.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Airport Authority's website suggested the flight will set off again at 8.15pm on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Other Cathay Pacific flights to and from Bangkok today (Friday) are expected to experience delays," the SAR flag carrier said. "We are assessing the situation and will keep our customers informed with the latest updates."
  <br>
  <br>
  Another Bangkok-bound Cathay flight CX630 also returned to Singapore after take-off.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other flights on Friday between the SAR and Thailand were unaffected, according to the Airport Authority.
  <br>
  <br>
  Greater Bay Airlines said in a statement that services remain normal, while offering to change flights for passengers who have booked trips to and from Bangkok between Friday and Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another local carrier, Hong Kong Airlines, cautioned that its flights to and from Bangkok "may be affected" due to the earthquake, advising passengers to check the latest information before heading to the airport.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong Airlines will waive all charges on rebooking, reissue and refund for all tickets issued for travel on Hong Kong Airlines flights with confirmed booking," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, the Travel Industry Council said there are around six Hong Kong tour groups in Thailand, consisting less than 100 people. All of them are safe, the council confirmed.

    Praise for new stadium on day 1 of HK Sevens

<img alt="Fans gathered for day one of the Hong Kong Sevens. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797906_2_20250328181344.jpg&q=75">

<div class="itemFullText">
 Rugby fans from around the world showered praise on the brand new stadium in Kai Tak as this year's Hong Kong Sevens got underway on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  After decades at the Hong Kong Stadium in Causeway Bay, the three-day tournament has moved to Kai Tak Stadium, which can accommodate a larger crowd.
  <br>
  <br>
  People in the South Stand told RTHK that the new stadium modernises the tournament with new facilities and a large variety of food and drinks, all while preserving the event's rich traditions, including vibrant costumes, lively music and a passionate crowd.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zwelethu Kala from South Africa said he loves the new venue and that the fans have brought the same energy from the old stadium to Kai Tak Sporks Park.
  <br>
  <br>
  "What a beautiful stadium, wow! Biggest thing is, one, it now has a roof so it can close, get full-running rugby. And two, outside, the village, wow," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You also have a DJ outside, nice space for the kids to play in as well. It's just awesome. It's looking really, really good."
  <br>
  <br>
  Alexane, who travelled from Belgium with friends for her second Sevens, said Hong Kong is the ultimate destination for international rugby.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong is the main place. It's so interesting. It's the main city to go for rugby. I don't know anything about rugby, but Hong Kong is like the best place," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[The stadium is filled with] amazing colours. I really like the colours and everything is so practical. Honestly, there's so much room for tourists, and it's really nice."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Larger crowds. More cosy because we have aircon. I would like them to open [the roof], so the atmosphere would be better," said local fan Damon Wong, who was sporting a headpiece from the Japanese manga Chiikawa.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another fan from the SAR, Matt Grange, highlighted the improved amenities, praising the stadium's additional toilets and impressive food and drink outlets, including one of Asia's longest bars.

    MTR fares to freeze under adjustment mechanism
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<div>
<img alt="While MTR fares will freeze for 2025-26, commuters could face a steep hike next year after 3.36 percent of adjustments are brought forward. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797892_1_20250328173801.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 There is relief for MTR passengers after the fare adjustment formula – which takes into account factors such as inflation and median household income – showed that fares would freeze for the coming year.
 <br>
  <br>
  Under its operating agreement with the government, the MTR Corporation (MTRC) is entitled to an annual fare review using figures published by the Census and Statistics Department.
  <br>
  <br>
  Based on the department's latest figures on Friday, transportation sector wages rose 3.1 percent year on year, while inflation stood at 1.4 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The mean value of 2.25 percent is then curtailed by a so-called "productivity factor" linked to the MTRC’s profit from property development. The more it earns in a particular year, the higher the productivity factor.
  <br>
  <br>
  This year the productivity factor amounted to a deduction of 0.8 percent, bringing the increase down from 2.25 percent to 1.45 percent, below the threshold of 1.5 percent required to trigger an actual adjustment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Even if it exceeds the threshold, there is still another "affordability cap" where the actual fare adjustment cannot be higher than the change in median monthly household income, which recorded a slight drop last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  As a result of these constraints, fares will be frozen for the first time since 2022-23.
  <br>
  <br>
  The intended 1.45 percent increase, together with another 1.91 percent rise supposedly brought forward from last year, will both be rolled over to 2026-27, which means commuters could face a steep hike next year.

 The Hong Kong Sevens tournament kicked off with a bang at Kai Tak Stadium on Friday, as the Canadian and Japanese women's squads faced off.
 <br>
  <br>
  More than 1,000 spectators watched the inaugural Hong Kong Sevens match played at the new venue at 10:30am.

   <br>
   A Canadian fan said she was excited to watch the tournament in Kai Tak and that it was easy getting to the stadium.
   <br>
   <br>
   Another rugby fan also said it is now comfortable to watch the matches because there is air conditioning.

    ICAC chief lays down law on calls for invalid votes

<img alt="Danny Woo says the ICAC has started using an AI system to improve work efficiency. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797856_2_20250328151239.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The city's top graft-buster, Danny Woo, on Friday warned that authorities will take tough action against those who call for invalid votes to be cast during the upcoming election for the city's legislature at the end of the year.
 <br>
  <br>
  His remarks came after Chief Executive John Lee last week announced that the general election for the Legislative Council will be held on December 7, with a by-election to be held on September 7.
  <br>
  <br>
  In an interview with local media, Woo, who heads the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC), reminded the public that disrupting the electoral process is a legal offence.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Never ever try to challenge the law because it's clearly written that it's an offence for any person to incite others not to vote or to cast invalid votes through any public activities during the election period," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And also do not share or repost these remarks as there is a chance of breaking the law as well."
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, Woo noted that the number of complaints reported to the ICAC rose to 2,058 last year, three percent higher.
  <br>
  <br>
  Forty-four of the cases were made against the Hong Kong Correctional Services, and that was more than double that of a year earlier.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, Woo pointed out, only a small number of the cases reached the prosecution phase.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ICAC, he said, is seeking to use artificial intelligence to improve work efficiency and has launched an AI system, Dr Deep, based on mainland firm DeepSeek's AI models, to help combat corruption.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I want to emphasise that many of our own systems are developed by ourselves because many of them contain confidential and sensitive information," Woo said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So our computer systems are studied and maintained in-house and not operated on by outsiders.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This means our development of AI is also done by ourselves.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Since DeepSeek unveiled its large AI models, it's been a real eye-opener," Woo said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He hinted that the Dr Deep system could be available for public use in the future and that residents could search for corruption-related information on the system.

 Public transport operators are boosting services to accommodate the large crowds of passengers expected during the Hong Kong Sevens tournament.
 <br>
  <br>
  The three-day event at the new Kai Tak Stadium started on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The MTR said it was increasing the frequency of trains on the Tuen Ma Line and deploying more staff than usual at Kai Tak and Sung Wong Toi stations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Citybus and KMB, meanwhile, said 11 special routes would be in operation at the end of each day of the tournament.

    'Use AI chatbots in triage system to avoid mistakes'

    <![CDATA[<div>
<img alt="A patients' rights group has proposed the use of AI chatbots in triage system at public hospitals to help patients gain a better understanding of their conditions. File Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797824_1_20250328114303.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A patients' rights group says it hopes the government can use AI chatbots in its triage system at public hospitals to help patients gain a better understanding of their conditions and symptoms.
 <br>
  <br>
  “I have used the UK emergency service as well,” WeCareBill Foundation co-founder Kelly Yim said in RTHK's Backchat programme on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I find it quite useful when they have the AI chatbot to do the challenging bits, like differentiating the level of emergency of a patient.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I'm just thinking maybe we can do this with nurse consultations or triages, and try with more advanced technology so that maybe this risk [of misjudgements] can be mitigated.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Some people have expressed worries about being charged more because of being categorised wrongly during triages when the revamped healthcare charges come into effect from January 1.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under the changes, "critical" and "emergency" patients being treated at  accident and emergency (A&E) wards will have their charges exempted, while fees for “urgent”, “semi-urgent” and “non-urgent” patients will be raised to HK$400 from HK$180.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government has relaxed income and asset limits to expand eligibility for medical fee waivers and said about 1.4 million people are expected to benefit from the tweaks, up from 300,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the same programme, an official from the Hospital Authority reiterated that the revamp is aimed at focusing resources on serving those in need.
  <br>
  <br>
  “With all these measures, we are trying to reserve our healthcare resources [in order to help, in particular, acute, serious and critical patients]," the authority’s chief manager in allied health,  Priscilla Poon, said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “But at the same time, we won't forget [the less well-off sections of the public].
  <br>
  <br>
  “So that's the reason why we need ... balance.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We need to impose some kind of relaxation of our waiver mechanisms and safety net in order to help ... the poor, who are not really actually supported by other, say, private services.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, a former A&E doctor also urged the government to prioritise the implementation of advanced technology to help cope with a manpower shortage.
  <br>
  <br>
  Aaron Lee, who’s now a clinical assistant professor at the University of Hong Kong, said the new fees planned for emergency wards at public hospitals could reduce the burden on staff.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he stressed that the effect may only be short-term.
  <br>
  <br>
  “This effect will tail off," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We saw it with previous increases in fees in the departments before,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “So there must be some implementation of more important measures in the departments...
  <br>
  <br>
  "There may be implementation of the AI system, not only in the A&E departments, but also maybe at the primary-care level.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee said a big burden would be lifted from the public healthcare system if patients were able to conduct some sort of tests themselves before deciding whether to seek medical attention at hospitals.

    'Kowloon City won't be congested during the Sevens'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A Kowloon City district councillor believes the area will not be congested when Hong Kong Rugby Sevens tournament games end every evening.
 <br>
  <br>
  The three-day tournament that kicks off today will be staged at Kai Tak Sports Park for the first time ever, having been held at Hong Kong Stadium in Causeway Bay for decades.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on an RTHK radio programme on Friday, Vivian Wong, who also chairs a working group on boosting the local economy in the district, said previous test events at the new grounds had gone smoothly.
  <br>
  <br>
  "During the Hong Kong Sevens, spectators will be coming in and out at all times," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They won't enter or leave at the same time.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Therefore, it's kind of different than, say, the opening ceremony on March the first when they could test out what problems would arise if people left the venue all at once."
  <br>
  <br>
  Apart from visiting nearby malls and Kowloon City, Wong expects spectators will also head for the new Sevens fan village for live music, meet-and-greet opportunities with rugby teams, as well as drinks and food booths.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said the inaugural Kai Tak Dining Cove Carnival next to the Kai Tak Stadium will also be a lure for revellers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, a Kowloon City restaurant owner revealed on the same show that businesses near the stadium are already seeing a boom in business.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mark Lam pointed out that business in the area had gone up 20 percent whenever tests events were held, as well as during the stadium's opening ceremony.
  <br>
  <br>
  His eatery has been flexible with its opening hours whenever events are scheduled at the city's largest sports venue.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the past, before the pandemic, our restaurant closed at 3am," Lam said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Business was booming at that time.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But after and during the pandemic, the catering business was sluggish. We had to close by 10:30 or 11pm.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With the Kai Tak Sports Park opening, now we close around 1 o'clock in the morning, and we open at 11:30am, with no breaks during the day.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So customers can come during lunch, tea, or after shows at the venue."
  <br>
  <br>
  Pedestrian traffic in the district had surged by 20 to 30 percent during the stress tests and the opening ceremony, Lam added.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 When Hong Kong artist Movana Chen moved to Lisbon in 2021, she started knitting together maps collected during Covid isolation in an attempt to unravel physical boundaries.
 <br>
  <br>
  She transformed the maps into large pieces of garment donned by herself and her partner, dancer Francisco Borges, as part of a performance art piece at Art Basel Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <img src="https://rthk-s3-nps-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/mfile_1797813_2_L_20250328104141.jpg">
   <div class="image-title-1">
    <span>
    </span>
   </div>
   <br>
   The inspiration for the performance – which sees the pair cocooned in the weaved-together maps – came from Chen’s time living near the Portuguese seaside, when she experienced pandemic-induced solitude.
   <br>
   <br>
   "[The act of weaving together] the maps is like inviting people and my friends during the lockdown period. So like in 2020, people can't send me the maps during that time. Everything was closed," she said.
   <br>
   <br>
   Chen said their performance, titled "Questioning the Line", also explores the entanglement between human and nature and the roles of borders and nationality.
   <br>
   <br>
   "For us it has different layers of lines, different lines to question. For example, one of the lines is this, between human and nature. Where is that line really?" Chen's partner, Borges told RTHK.
   <br>
   <br>
   "We are born from the land, we eat the food from the land, we drink the water from the land. And when we poison the land, and we poison the water, we poison ourselves. So where is really that barrier, that clear line?" he said.
   <br>

    <div class="image-title-1">
     <span>
     </span>
    </div>
    <br>
    To show human unity and interdependence, Chen also collects expired passports and gives them new life by knitting them together in a separate project called "Beyond the Surface".
    <br>
    <br>
    She is not the only artist exploring humanity and nature at this year's Art Basel.
    <br>
    <br>
    American painter and writer Alec Egan lost his home and studio to the Los Angeles fire in January. Despite the devastation, he created five new paintings to depict LA coastal scenes in a temporary studio provided by Anat Egbi Gallery, which is showcasing his works at Art Basel.
    <br>
    <br>
    Egan's new works – which reflects both disaster and nature – pays homage to his lost work and captures the eerie beauty of ash-filled skies.
    <br>

     <div class="image-title-1">
      <span>
      </span>
     </div>
     <br>
     "In the face of something really traumatic, he continues to focus on beauty and there is quiet solitude. So I hope that [audiences will take away] hopefulness," said the gallery's sales director Amanda McMorran.
     <br>
     <br>
     Adding another compelling voice to the fair is first-time exhibitor Shin Min from Seoul's P21 studio.
     <br>
     <img src="https://rthk-s3-nps-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/mfile_1797813_4_L_20250328104141.jpg">

      <br>
      Drawing from her experience working in the service industry, her "Ew! There is hair in the food!!" exhibition highlights misogyny in Korea, and challenges the notion of never saying no to customers.
      <br>
      <br>
      "I talk about workers' hair because we are not robots. We are human and we are not machines. We have hair. We have spit," Shin said in explaining the central message of her work.
      <br>
      <br>
      Art Basel, the SAR's largest international art fair, brings together more than 240 galleries from around the world this year.

    Government strongly condemns UK report on HK

<img alt='The SAR government urged the UK to "respect international law" and "immediately stop interfering in Hong Kong matters." File photo: RTHK' src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797769_1_20250328093204.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Thursday said it strongly disapproved of and must resolutely refute the untruthful remarks, slanders and smears against various aspects of the SAR in the UK's six-monthly report on Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  "The HKSAR Government strongly condemns and rejects the UK's attempt through a so-called six-monthly report to make misleading and irresponsible remarks about Hong Kong matters, wantonly put politics above the rule of law and attempt to interfere in Hong Kong's law-based governance by despicable political manoeuvres," a government statement said.
  <br>
  <br>
  It urged the UK to discern facts from fallacies, respect international law and basic norms governing international relations, and stop interfering in Hong Kong matters.
  <br>
  <br>
  The statement said Hong Kong enjoyed a high degree of autonomy under the 'one country, two systems' principle, pointing out that the Sino-British Joint Declaration did not authorise the UK to interfere in Hong Kong's affairs after its return to the motherland.
  <br>
  <br>
  The statement also rejected UK criticism that laws safeguarding national security in the SAR had eroded rights and freedoms.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With at least 14 pieces of laws safeguarding national security in the UK, those remarks by the UK are not only totally distorting and confounding right and wrong, but they also entirely disregard the constitutional duty and practical needs of the HKSAR to legislate, and the positive effects brought by the enactment of the relevant national security legislation on economic development and protection of human rights," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government statement highlighted Hong Kong's number one ranking in the Economic Freedom of the World 2024 Annual Report, among 165 economies. It said it was evident that international funds and investments were confident in Hong Kong's development.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government spokesman stressed that "the rule of law in Hong Kong is strong and robust, and withstands the test of time", while human rights in the city have always been guaranteed constitutionally by both the Constitution and the Basic Law.

    Work under way to boost night-time services: HA
   </title>

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hospital Authority (HA) has stressed that decisions on how and where to beef up public healthcare services will "depend on the actual situation", amid calls to offer more general outpatient services at night.
 <br>
  <br>
  Tony Ko, the authority's chief executive, also said on Thursday reforms to the city's public healthcare system should be looked at "in totality".
  <br>
  <br>
  At present, less than one-third of 74 government general outpatient clinics offer evening consultations, with services running until 10pm.
  <br>
  <br>
  During a Legislative Council meeting on Wednesday, health chief Lo Chung-mau was asked if authorities were planning to boost evening services so people need not seek help at accident and emergency wards.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lo responded by saying that work is being done to increase capacity.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked about offering more night-time services, Ko said that the HA is working to expand general outpatient clinic capacity.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We work closely with not only our primary healthcare colleagues to provide more sessions both during daytime, holidays, weekends as well as night time, and at the same time, we have close liaison with our private medical practitioner counterparts, encouraging them to do more sessions during holidays, during weekends, giving more general support to patients," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  With the administration facing a budget deficit, chairman Henry Fan said the HA is looking at ways to trim its expenditure. The body is set to receive some HK$100 billion in government subvention for 2025/26.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fan said the authority should focus on boosting productivity, including cutting administrative work for frontline staff, further using technology and simplifying procurement procedures.
  <br>
  <br>
  The most painless way to save money is to reduce waste, he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, public hospitals recorded a turnover rate of 5 percent for full-time doctors in the 12 months ending in January. Nearly 340 doctors left the public workforce, while some 7,200 doctors remain.
  <br>
  <br>
  There are now over 29,500 nurses, with a departure rate of 7.2 percent during the same period.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The chairman of Polytechnic University (PolyU)'s governing council on Thursday said Hong Kong must make use of its super-connector role under One Country, Two Systems to support the nation's diplomatic efforts.
 <br>
  <br>
  At a seminar focusing on China's diplomacy in the new era, Lam Tai-fai said Western countries such as the United States are creating problems through unfair practices like sanctions and protectionism.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the other hand, Lam added, Beijing continued to promote peace and cooperation through building friendships with countries. He said one of PolyU's missions is to nurture patriotic students with a global perspective.
  <br>
  <br>
  Also at the seminar was Huo Yuzhen, former Chinese ambassador to the Czech Republic and Romania.
  <br>
  <br>
  The veteran diplomat was involved in a Foreign Ministry initiative aimed at fostering cooperation between China and Central and Eastern European nations, such as Poland, Greece and Serbia.
  <br>
  <br>
  She described the initiative, which began in 2012, as a success, pointing to achievements in many areas which benefitted the people of both sides.
  <br>
  <br>
  Looking ahead, Huo suggested focusing on new areas of cooperation, such as green energy, advanced technology, and artificial intelligence.
  <br>
  <br>
  At the same event, former Chinese ambassador to Georgia and Tajikistan Yue Bin spoke about the development of Sino-Russian relations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yue described how the bond between the two neighbours has grown stronger over time, evolving into a comprehensive strategic partnership building on mutual trust.

 Hong Kong will continue to deepen international co-operation and integrate into national development despite a complex external environment, Chief Executive John Lee said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Writing on his Facebook page after attending the opening ceremony of the Boao Forum in Hainan, Lee said he was encouraged by Vice Premier Ding Xuexiang's remarks.
  <br>
  <br>
  In his speech, Ding pointed out four suggestions for Asia and the world's future and "three perspectives" on China's economic development.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee said the SAR must move forward steadily by leveraging its unique position of supporting the country's development while connecting with the rest of the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Under One Country, Two Systems, Hong Kong is the world's only open economy that simultaneously enjoys both Chinese and international advantages," he wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  The chief executive outlined plans to continue pursuing reforms with breakthrough thinking, including advancing projects like the Northern Metropolis and Greater Bay Area development.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee met the director-general of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, Qu Dongyu, earlier in the morning.
  <br>
  <br>
  During the meeting, Lee discussed the city's potential for developing its fisheries and agricultural sector with diverse food industries.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also expressed interest in working with the organisation on water quality simulation systems and sustainable aquaculture development, according to his Facebook page.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Thursday said they are investigating a suspected assault at a flat in Sham Shui Po after a video shared online appeared to show an elderly woman being physically abused by a helper.
 <br>
  <br>
  Officers said a woman reported last week that her mother, 81, had been abused in a flat at Lai On Estate.
  <br>
  <br>
  Footage reportedly from a surveillance camera appeared to show the elderly woman tied up in bed and being gagged with a towel.
  <br>
  <br>
  She was later taken to hospital with injuries to her face and hands, police said.
  <br>
  <br>
  No arrests have been made over the alleged incident.

    Thais give green light to draft law for casinos

<img alt="Protesters rally near Government House in Bangkok against the casino-entertainment complex bill. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797665_1_20250327133509.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Thailand's cabinet on Thursday approved a draft law for casinos and entertainment complexes, as the government looks to attract more tourists and build a major gaming industry.
 <br>
  <br>
  Gambling is mostly banned in Thailand apart from state-controlled horse racing, the lottery and on some sports but successive governments have pressed the case for allowing casinos to draw in more foreign visitors and create more jobs and state revenue.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the latest draft approved by cabinet will significantly limit how many Thai punters can go to casinos, with an entry fee of 5,000 baht and proof of at least 50 million baht in bank deposits, effectively blocking large swathes of the population, where per capita gross domestic product is about US$7,300.
  <br>
  <br>
  A deputy finance minister said this month the assets requirement for Thai nationals would be dropped because it would exclude too many people.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another restriction is that the casino area may only occupy up to 10 percent of the entire space of an entertainment complex, according to a government statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The draft law will be sent to parliament, and if passed, will also need approval from the Senate and the king.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra said details of the law were not final as parliament would have the final say.
  <br>
  <br>
  A Citi report late last year estimated that about half of people aged 20 and more in Thailand could be casino players, providing a base for the country to potentially become the world's third-largest gambling destination.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government, led by the populist Pheu Thai party, hopes to attract at least 100 billion baht in new investment in casinos and entertainment complexes and see an annual boost to foreign arrivals of 5 to 10 percent, while generating revenue of more than 12 billion baht a year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite most betting and gambling being outlawed in Thailand, illicit operations have operated for years.
  <br>
  <br>
  A January opinion poll in Thailand indicated there was opposition to the plan, however, and some political parties have argued that building a gambling industry would worsen social problems.
  <br>
  <br>
  Several countries in Southeast Asia have legalised casinos, but only a few like Singapore has been successful in drawing global giants such as Las Vegas Sands Corp on the back of robust regulations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tourism is a key driver of Thailand, Southeast Asia's second-largest economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  This year, the government expects 38 million foreign arrivals, closing in on its pre-pandemic record of nearly 40 million tourists. (Reuters)

<img alt='Irina Fan, director of research at the Trade Development Council, says the impact of US tariffs on Hong Kong is "relatively mild". File photo: RTHK' src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797662_1_20250327132129.jpg&q=60">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Trade Development Council said Hong Kong exporters are well-prepared for the new round of US tariffs set to take effect on April 2.
 <br>
  <br>
  The council's export confidence index for the first quarter stood at 51, up 1.8 points from the fourth quarter of 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  The expectation index, which shows exporters’ expectations for the next quarter, also rose. It climbed one point to 51.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on RTHK’s
  <i>
   Backchat
  </i>
  programme on Thursday, the council’s director of research Irina Fan said the city’s export performance is driven by strong sales and procurement, as well as higher prices.
  <br>
  <br>
  Regarding the impact of US tariffs on local exports, Fan described it as “relatively mild” compared with some of Washington's major trading partners, including China, Canada and Mexico.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Hong Kong's exporters are quite well-prepared for higher US tariffs," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Our exporters took a very agile and flexible business strategy also actually in the past few years to mitigate the risk from higher US tariffs, which actually started in the year of 2018.
  <br>
  <br>
  “They already adopted strategies like diversifying their sourcing, engaging with new partners and new markets, relocating some of their production lines, and also continuing to reduce their reliance, the selling to the US markets."
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite trade tensions, Fan said 75 percent of exporters expect their profits to remain stable or grow, and that industries such as jewellery, equipment and materials, timepieces, electronics and toys remained positive in their outlook.

    'Art Basel, Art Central a barometer for art market'

<img alt="Daniel Kwok, an independent art consultant, says that art fairs and auctions will give the city's art market a boost. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797660_1_20250327130541.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An expert has said that ongoing art shows and upcoming auctions will give the mainland and Hong Kong art scene a boost, and serve as a barometer for future market performance.
 <br>
  <br>
  Last year, the broader art market suffered a notable hit, with sales of modern and contemporary works declining by about 40 percent year on year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sales of traditional Chinese artworks also fared poorly, with transactions for Chinese painting and calligraphy auctions dropping by more than 20 percent year on year to 12.6 billion yuan last year, according to independent consultant Daniel Kwok.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I would say the traditional Chinese art market remained depressed last year, as the weak performance of the real economy and financial markets has clearly reduced buyers’ interest in the art market," he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Even though stock markets in mainland China and Hong Kong seem to be recovering, collectors and buyers still need time to rebuild their confidence," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, Kwok said that events such as Art Basel and Art Central, as well as auctions next month, will offer more clues on whether sentiment in the art market has improved, and if Beijing’s recent stimulus measures have had any effect on collectors.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I believe Art Basel and Art Central will create an exciting weekend for Hong Kong, providing a direct boost to both our cultural and tourism industries. These events also showcase the strength of the Hong Kong art market," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, the art specialist noted that despite the economic downturn, interest in Chinese porcelain antiques have been growing.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Because those imperial porcelain made for the emperors are all produced with exceptional craftsmanship, so even by today's standards, these pieces remain stunning to us," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kwok said another hot trend is Ming-style wood furniture famous for its intricate designs and Huanghuali wood – which comes from a rare species of rosewood. He noted that a Huanghuali wood table was sold for more than 45 million yuan on the mainland last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Looking ahead, Kwok cautioned that the heightened tension between China and the US might weigh on the art market.
  <br>
  <br>
  He pointed out that US tariff hikes may affect art shipments between the two countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I believe the unstable international climate will make buyers more cautious and conservative,” he explained.

    Govt 'pays almost all drug costs despite fee hike'
   </title>

<img alt="" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797648_1_20250327115415.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hospital Authority's chief pharmacist said on Thursday the upcoming hike in medication fees will help to subsidise the purchase of new drugs, as well as those used to fight cancer or rare diseases.
 <br>
  <br>
  Starting January, patients have to pay HK$20 for a four-week supply of drugs, up from the current HK$15 for a 16-week supply.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on an RTHK radio programme, William Chui pointed out that the government is still covering nearly all healthcare costs even with the hike.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The government now subsidises 92 to 93 percent of the cost of a drug," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Even after increasing the fees, 90 percent of the cost is still covered.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Therefore, we cannot actually recover the cost of the drug, we can only hope to reduce waste.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We hope patients will understand that – when there is medicine they do not need or when they have a lot of drugs left over at home, they can let their doctors know."
  <br>
  <br>
  He emphasised that even though each prescription is set to be for a maximum for four weeks, this does not mean patients have to return to hospitals and clinics for another prescription after the period.
  <br>
  <br>
  Otherwise, the workload of pharmacies will be much heavier, he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chui added that patients can still be dispensed a maximum supply of 24 weeks each time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the consultant of the accident and emergency wards of the New Territories East cluster believes higher fees for A&E wards will not discourage patients from turning up.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If you ask whether the higher charge will cause patients to not come, I believe it won't," Cheng Chi-hung said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Because they will gradually know how to assess the situation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Sometimes patients might not be clear about their condition.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Obviously, for a cold, they will turn to primary healthcare.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But when it comes to cases like a sprain after exercising, or a suspected bone fracture, I believe patients will still choose to head to accident and emergency wards."
  <br>
  <br>
  Non-critical and non-emergency cases, or those deemed as category three to five patients, will need to pay HK$400 per visit – up from the present flat rate of HK$180 – starting next year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hung noted that it is difficult to predict that there will be a decline in the number of A&E patients, even though the figure dropped by five percent after the previous fee increment in 2017.

    'Winter flu season over but summer poses new threat'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) says the winter influenza season has come to an end after about 11 weeks, but people should next get jabs to protect themselves against a possible summer flu season.
 <br>
  <br>
  Around 800 severe and fatal cases were recorded among adults over winter, while 10 children became seriously ill after catching the virus, the centre said on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a press briefing, CHP controller Edwin Tsui said the predominant strain of the virus during winter, A (H1), was also prevalent in 2018/19, but the number of severe and fatal cases among adults this time decreased by 15 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tsui said severe cases involving children dropped by 60 percent when compared with six years ago, thanks to a higher vaccination rate.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said people should also get vaccinated in case flu strikes again this summer.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think the risk or the probability of having a summer influenza season in Hong Kong is still present, and usually the summer influenza season will come in July and August," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "After this winter influenza season, we have to guard against any respiratory infections, especially the summer influenza activities and seasons. So what members of the public should do is to get vaccinated."
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the Hospital Authority said it will increase manpower around Easter.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For Easter, according to previous experience, the attendance will slowly grow along the four days of the public holidays. After that, there will be the peak in the following weekend," chief manager Larry Lee said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The good thing about this year is we don't bundle the Easter holiday together with the Ching Ming Festival."

    Online applications set for healthcare bills waivers

<img alt="The Hospital Authority’s chief manager of allied health, Priscilla Poon, says there are ways to ensure the expanded fee waiver mechanism will not overwhelm medical social workers.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 People who have financial difficulties would be able to apply online for waivers of healthcare charges in a few months' time.
 <br>
  <br>
  The online applications will be possible under an expansion of waiver mechanism for healthcare charges as part of reforms to the city’s healthcare sector, the Hospital Authority said on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  To apply, patients must at present submit documents at public hospitals or social service centres for assessment.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, Priscilla Poon, the authority’s chief manager of allied health, said officials are looking to utilise technology.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We are thinking that at about the end of this year we would be able to release a simple version of this waiver app, that the patients are able to access [via] ‘HA Go’ to see how long their waiver period is and what the validity period is,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “By around the second quarter of next year, we should be able to launch this online application.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Under the reforms, the government will relax the income and asset requirements for people to qualify for a fee waiver, meaning an extra 1.1 million people will be eligible.
  <br>
  <br>
  The validity period of each waiver application will be extended from 12 to 18 months, which Poon said is a way to alleviate the workload of medical social workers.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It reduces the frequency of visits of patients to the medical social worker department,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among other changes to the fee waiver mechanism are the inclusion of people aged under 65 who use general outpatient services occasionally and the revision of the definition of “family” to exclude members living with the patient who have no direct financial ties from asset reviews.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Wednesday said a renewed capital investment migrant scheme could bring investments worth HK$27 billion to Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  The New Capital Investment Entrant Scheme was launched in March last year, with the minimum amount of investment for applicants tripled to HK$30 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a written reply to Legco, financial services minister Christopher Hui said more than 900 applications have been received for the scheme.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said about 750 applications have been approved in principle, and some 340 cases have been officially greenlit.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister said HK$27 billion of investments will be brought into the SAR if all cases are approved.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hui said none of the applicants have invested in residential flats so far, and that among the more than HK$10 billion of approved investments, some HK$5.1 billion have been made in collective investment schemes, HK$3.6 billion were put into equities, and HK$1.8 billion were made in debt securities.

    HK, Hainan to cooperate in promoting trade ties

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee said on Wednesday a cooperation deal between Hong Kong and Hainan will contribute to the nation further opening up on the back of the free-trade advantages from the two regions.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lee made the remarks as he signed a memorandum of understanding with officials from the southern island province to boost trade and economic ties between the two sides.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee, who is attending the annual Boao Forum for Asia on Hainan, said Hong Kong has been the region's major source of foreign investment and that Hainan has also invested heavily in the SAR with the issuances of more than 13 billion yuan worth of offshore bonds.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the cooperation deal will make use of the free-trade advantages to be found on both sides and covers five key areas – trade and investment, finance, data flow, tourism and personnel exchange.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We very much welcome Hainan to expand the scope of recognition of Hong Kong professionals in Hainan, so as to provide more development opportunities for Hong Kong's professional services sector in the region, and to complement the advantages of Hainan's international level of its professional services, while serving the vigorous development of Hainan Free Trade Port," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee also said the cooperation deal will help the two regions to create new synergies in their supply chain expansions and explore the Asean markets together.
  <br>
  <br>
  Specifically, the deal offers support for Hong Kong firms in setting up processing factories in Hainan for premium consumer brands and also encourages Hainan to open up its finance, law, accounting, consulting, exhibition and construction sectors to professionals from the SAR.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Housing Society on Wednesday announced two subsidised flat projects in Fanling and Kwun Tong, with units to be sold at 70 percent of market value, will go on sale in April.
 <br>
  <br>
  The "Hemma Fab" project on Jockey Club Road in Fanling offers about 650 units with saleable areas ranging from 302 to 616 square feet, and prices from HK$2.3 million to HK$5.4 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the "Hemma Emerald" project on Anderson Road offers 960 units with saleable areas ranging from 302 to 664 square feet, and prices from about HK$2.5 million to HK$6.3 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  And although the Housing Authority will change the ratio for quota allocation between Green Form and White Form applicants under the Home Ownership Scheme from 40:60 to 50:50 in October, the ratio for the two projects will remain at 40:60.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will take reference to [the Housing Authority's] implementation, and we may add these new arrangements in the next phase," the Housing Society's development and marketing director Monita Ko said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ko added that about 40 percent of units will be reserved for families with elderly members or newborns.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eligible people can apply for the two projects from April 1 to 14.

    Certify your subdivided flat early or pay more: govt

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Discounts will be offered to landlords who get their subdivided homes certified early under a proposed certification system, according to housing minister Winnie Ho.
 <br>
  <br>
  The government announced last year a regulatory regime to manage the city's subdivided units and hope to kick-start the process by the end of this year or early 2026, depending on the legislation process.
  <br>
  <br>
  Landlords will first have 12 months to declare their dwellings as "basic housing units". A grace period of 36 months will follow, not just to help owners complete certification, but also give tenants ample time to relocate if their flat is deemed unsuitable for living.
  <br>
  <br>
  To certify as a basic housing unit, owners must hire a building professional who checks if the flat meets a set of prescribed requirements. If not, modifications will have to be made.
  <br>
  <br>
  A fee is also payable to the government, and Ho explained why this was necessary in an interview with RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The administrative fees generated by this exercise should not be borne by all taxpayers. We expect to fix the problems involving around 110,000 units within 36 months. There will be a lot of documents for my colleagues to go through. This is the duty of affected landlords, so we’re merely trying to recoup the costs," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The housing chief said landlords who complete the certification in the first 12 months of the grace period will pay the least – or even nothing.
  <br>
  <br>
  The fee then goes up in the second year, and rises again in the final year.
  <br>
  <br>
  She expected the fee to be "a few thousand" dollars, with a final decision to be made later.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked about the likelihood that landlords will offload such costs to tenants, Ho pointed out they could turn to public housing units.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There will be a lot of options for tenants. We have 20,000 transitional homes and 30,000 light public housing units. As for traditional public rental housing, 158,000 units will be completed in the next five years… If the rents (for basic housing units) become unreasonable, tenants will have a choice of moving elsewhere," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government has announced that each basic housing unit must also have a window facing the street or semi-enclosed light well for ventilation and lighting reasons. But after hearing views from stakeholders and conducting site visits, Ho confirmed officials may also consider accepting windows facing fully-enclosed light wells, citing constraints of old buildings.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said there are about 2,000 such units around the city, and believes they won't constitute a hygiene issue as long as the light wells are kept clean.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lawmakers will discuss the proposal at a Legislative Council panel next Monday, and Ho said she looks forward to any feedback to fine-tune the arrangements.

    GBA cities need to maximise tourism synergy: survey

<img alt="The study, led by the Polytechnic University, suggests cities in the Greater Bay Area work together to grow the tourism market together. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797477_1_20250326142939.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Findings from a study led by the Polytechnic University’s School of Hotel and Tourism Management have indicated there’s great potential for cities within the Greater Bay Area (GBA) to collaborate further in their tourism strategies.
 <br>
  <br>
  The project, which also involved the University of Macau and Sun Yat-sen University, started about two years ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  Researchers conducted site visits to Hong Kong, Macau and nine other GBA cities on the mainland to look at their tourism resources.
  <br>
  <br>
  They also analysed 200,000 comments from popular online platforms and interviewed 182 residents, tourism officials and business owners in local communities to better understand travel experiences in the GBA.
  <br>
  <br>
  The study found that GBA cities share many similarities in their tourism strengths, such as food, cultural heritage and natural resources.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Professor Tony Tse from the study team said the region has failed to take advantage of them, noting that there is a dearth of long-haul travellers in many GBA cities.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The 11 cities have all their attractions, they have their own unique points about tourism... I think they can work together in a very complementary way to attract visitors from both within and outside the region," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Professor Hung Kam, the principal investigator, said GBA cities should build a "regional tourism brand," such as by coming up with travel itineraries that include multiple destinations.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong has a very unique cuisine with its [cha chaan teng] and others, such as Michelin restaurants," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Macau has a very unique cuisine with Portuguese cuisine fusioned with Chinese.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Zhongshan has its famous roast pigeon, and Guangzhou has double-skinned milk dessert.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So every destination has its uniqueness," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And we can organise this gastronomy tour, not only to explore cuisines in Hong Kong but across the region.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And that could be more appealing to those who only offered Hong Kong cuisine, for example."
  <br>
  <br>
  The PolyU professor said that even though Hong Kong is a well-developed tourism destination, there are still many opportunities for growth through working more closely with others in the GBA.
  <br>
  <br>
  She proposed authorities in different cities establish a central unit to coordinate regional branding efforts and set up a one-stop online platform to distribute travel information to travellers.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The organiser of Art Basel Hong Kong said on Wednesday this year's edition aims to strengthen Hong Kong's position as an arts and cultural hub while connecting creative ecosystems across the globe.
 <br>
  <br>
  In an exclusive interview with RTHK, director Angelle Siyang-Le said the event brings together 240 galleries from 42 countries and places, including 23 newcomers.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, "it's not only about the number of galleries, what we focus on is the content of what the gallery is bringing," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think our galleries continue to bring top quality artworks to our regions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That also shows how much the galleries really value the support from the collectors in Asia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Siyang-Le said she expects a good turnout especially from Southeast Asia, noting that collectors from the region were showing strong interest.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Apart from Hong Kong and mainland China, which remain the [biggest groups of people attending], people from the Philippines and Singapore are definitely on the rise," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under moves unveiled in the Budget this year, Art Basel is also partnering with the Tourism Board to create "immersive experience zones" and promote local culture and tourism.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We want to make sure that locally people understand the importance of culture, but more importantly we want to [take the Hong Kong brand international] through all our Basel shows," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We want to promote the living culture of Hong Kong and most importantly to remind people outside of Hong Kong constantly and regularly that Hong Kong is such an amazing place to visit."
  <br>
  <br>
  The premium art fair will run from Friday to Sunday at the Convention and Exhibition Centre in Wan Chai.
  <br>
  <br>
  With the fair expanding into public spaces like M+ Museum and Tai Kwun, Siyang-Le said the moves are happening because she wants to make art accessible beyond just the convention centre.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Home and Youth Affairs Alice Mak said there has been a strong response to various government youth programmes.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on RTHK’s
  <i>
   Overview Policy
  </i>
  programme, Mak said application numbers for various activities, such as internships and exchange programmes, have gone up in recent years.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister cited a 16-week internship scheme in Dunhuang, Gansu province, during which students learnt the history of the ancient city and trained as tour guides to welcome tourists from all over the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said the overall positive response is due to the proactive outreach by officials in the past two years.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We have introduced various measures during this term of government. Therefore, we have to get into the schools to introduce all these measures so students are aware of the programmes that they can participate in,” Mak said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The youth affairs chief also said the government encourages students who have taken part in these programmes to join “Youth Link”, a network established last September and is part of the Youth Development Blueprint.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said the network already has more than 10,000 members.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mak said youngsters can share their experience with fellow students through the “Youth Link”.
  <br>
  <br>
  She added that one of the floors in Youth Square in Chai Wan will be renovated and a studio will be set up, so young people can share their stories through videos.

 The Kai Tak Sports Park said it's ready to host the Hong Kong Rugby Sevens tournament later this week.
 <br>
  <br>
  “We are fine-tuning our arrangements, and we learn from our past experiences. We adjust our operations and enhance communication with various parties and maintain continuous improvement,” Tang King-shing, a Kai Tak Sports Park director, told reporters on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We are confident that we are ready for the Rugby Sevens.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The venue experienced mishaps earlier. In one incident, fans at the World Snooker Grand Prix were told to leave while a match was still in progress.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Rugby Sevens will take place from Friday to Sunday at the new Kai Tak Stadium, having moved from Hong Kong Stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  Security checks will be conducted outside the venue, with spectators asked not to bring long umbrellas.
  <br>
  <br>
  Organisers also said they have retained the iconic South Stand – a ground for rugby fans donning elaborate outfits – which will have a “complete upgrade” in its new home.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We are very pleased to see our fans in fancy dress enjoying themselves in the South Stand,” said Hong Kong China Rugby executive director Bryan Rennie.
  <br>
  <br>
  “They have a good idea of what is appropriate and what is not. We have a list of prohibited items… We encourage all of our fans to follow that list, to ensure that they’re not bringing in any props that won’t be allowed into the stadium.“
  <br>
  <br>
  A fan village outside the stadium will hold various activities such as live stage performances, and all matches will be shown live on a big screen.
  <br>
  <br>
  But organisers said the opening hours at the village will be shorter than previously announced “to make egress as smooth as possible”.
  <br>
  <br>
  “There’s still plenty of time for people to enjoy themselves. We don’t view this as a negative, this is a positive response,” said Rennie.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also said about 43,000 tickets have been snapped up, and is optimistic that the three-day event would be sold out.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Development Bernadette Linn said on Wednesday officials will soon come up with measures to allow shopping malls to host more business activities within their public open spaces.
 <br>
  <br>
  That came after a revamped ante-chamber meeting at the Legislative Council, where officials bounce ideas off lawmakers based on their membership in specific panels, rather than a more general group.
  <br>
  <br>
  Linn said lawmakers generally welcomed the government's idea for malls, which is meant to give the economy a shot in the arm.
  <br>
  <br>
  "How can we remove barriers and allow owners to make good use of spaces to host activities, to drive up the economic environment in the community?" she told lawmakers after the meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  "How can we streamline our vetting?"
  <br>
  <br>
  Linn also said officials are studying whether to give floor-area concessions to developers for building carparks above ground and not just for underground facilities.
  <br>
  <br>
  For her part, Secretary for Housing Winnie Ho said she gave an update to lawmakers about how officials have lowered the construction cost to date for building light public housing flats by around HK$6 billion to HK$21 billion mainly through the improved use of modular integrated construction.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both Deputy Financial Secretary Michael Wong and development panel chairman Lo Wai-kwok hailed the revamped meeting prodedure, saying it allows more frank and free exchange of ideas between the two sides.

    New A&amp;E fee to bring timely treatment in urgent cases
   </title>
   <link>

<img alt="" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797455_1_20250326115900.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Secretary for Health says the new fee for people seeking help at accident and emergency wards in public hospitals can result in quicker treatment for more serious cases.
 <br>
  <br>
  Starting January 1 next year, non-critical and non-emergency patients will have to pay HK$400 per visit, up from the present flat fee of HK$180.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on an RTHK programme on Wednesday, Lo Chung-mau pointed out that the new fee is reasonable, saying that charges for similar services in other places can exceed US$1,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted that category four and five patients, or those deemed as "semi-urgent" and "non-urgent" respectively, now account for 60 percent of the cases.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lo said this has led to urgent patients – or category three cases – not getting treated in time sometimes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have not met the target of treating 90 percent of [category three] patients within 30 minutes," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have only managed to treat about 70 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Now we think we should be able to improve on that.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Through the fee adjustments, we hope to help more category three patients and meet our service targets, allowing them to be treated sooner."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lo said the government has taken into account public affordability, how to better utilise services, as well as cost sharing when coming up with the adjustments.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lo emphasised that while evening outpatient services have been stepped up, patients will not opt for that if A&E fees remain at a low level.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Hospital Authority chief executive Tony Ko pointed out that the decision not to exempt category three A&E patients from the fee rise helps to avoid unnecessary arguments.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have talked to a lot of colleagues, especially those from A&E," he told a Commercial Radio show.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In terms of triage, it's very clear for category one and two patients because we will look at their vital signs.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But sometimes, when it comes to category three and four, it's not that easy to differentiate between the two.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Most of the time, it's clear.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But to avoid unnecessary argument and taking into consideration day-to-day operations, we think that the charge of HK$400 is suitable."
  <br>
  <br>
  Under the revamp, each drug prescription will be for up to a maximum of four weeks, down from up to 16 weeks at present.
  <br>
  <br>
  Drugs will cost HK$20 per four-week supply at specialist outpatient clinics and HK$5 at general outpatient clinics.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ko pointed out that patients can still be dispersed a maximum of 24 weeks drug supply each time, depending on the doctor's prescription.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added public education will be stepped up to ensure that people are aware of the adjustments.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hospital Authority has suspended the use of about 200 examination lights of the same model as that involved in a recent incident that saw a surgical lamp fall at Hong Kong Adventist Hospital in Tsuen Wan.
 <br>
  <br>
  The authority said late on Tuesday that it has been notified of the incident, which saw the lamp hit a doctor and a healthcare staff while a patient was under examination, by the Department of Health and the manufacturer.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As a precautionary measure, the Hospital Authority has immediately halted the use of all ceiling-mounted examination lights of the relevant model," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Temporary replacements from other manufacturers or using different models have been carried out to ensure that clinical services remain unaffected.
  <br>
  <br>
  The authority urged the manufacturer to complete thorough inspections as soon as possible and to guarantee the safety of the examination lights.
  <br>
  <br>
  Until then, it said, hospitals and clinics will not use the model.
  <br>
  <br>
  It stressed that all ceiling-mounted medical equipment in hospitals and clinics undergo regular maintenance and servicing.
  <br>
  <br>
  The authority will closely monitor the manufacturer to ensure proper inspection, maintenance and servicing of medical equipment, safeguarding the safety of both patients and staff.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong, China and hosts Singapore battled to a goalless draw on Tuesday night as they began the final round of their AFC Asian Cup football qualifying campaign.
 <br>
  <br>
  This extended Hong Kong’s unbeaten run against Singapore to seven games, of which the SAR had secured victories on three occasions.
  <br>
  <br>
  But it was the hosts who dominated the first half, forcing the SAR squad to sub out attacking midfielder Wong Wai for defender Yue Tze-nam in the 34th minute to withstand the pressure.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SAR squad had a much better performance after the break, building a more structured offence, but could not catch a break.
  <br>
  <br>
  The hosts had two goals disallowed, including a lovely chip shot by Shawal Anuar in the 77th minute that was ruled offside.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong will be back to play at Kai Tak Sports Park on June 10 against India for their next qualifying match.
  <br>
  <br>
  To earn a spot in the 2027 Asian Cup finals in Saudi Arabia, the SAR will need to come out on top of Group C, which also features Bangladesh.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Coleman Wong’s history-making performance at the Miami Open will serve as a huge morale boost for the SAR’s next generation of tennis players, Hong Kong, China’s tennis chief said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 20-year-old became the first-ever player from the SAR to get a win at a Masters 1000 match, and reached the event’s round of 32.
  <br>
  <br>
  Michael Cheng, president of Hong Kong China Tennis Association, said it was a remarkable achievement.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The draw size of a 1000 event is actually 96, which means that we're putting him inside the top 100 players in the world and he is able to get through a couple of rounds,” he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  “He's done something which no one has done before in Hong Kong.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The city’s tennis boss said Wong’s groundbreaking result would inspire a lot of young players in the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  “What we're looking at in the tennis generation here overall is to make sure that one generation is better than the last one,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, tennis has retained its "Tier A" sport status for two more years, avoiding a significant funding cut.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cheng said the decision is vital to the development of the sport in the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It's not just about the funding, but it's also about the coaching and the technical support and the strength and conditioning support and the sports science support coming from the Sports Institute.
  <br>
  <br>
  “If you put it all together, it's the complete package,” he said.

<img alt="Experts say family doctors should educate patients about whether a visit to the accident and emergency unit is necessary. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797359_1_20250325203807.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A family physician said on Tuesday that the government's overhaul of healthcare charges could motivate people to prioritise their overall health instead of only focusing on treating a disease.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lau Ho-lim, vice president of general affairs at the Hong Kong College of Family Physicians, said it is important for family doctors to educate patients about urgent and non-urgent symptoms so they could decide whether a visit to the accident and emergency unit is necessary.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If we promote health – and with a healthy lifestyle and with a very good management of chronic diseases – a lot of complications and a lot of acute conditions can be prevented," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In turn, it will reduce the attendance to specialist operations departments or the A&E department."
  <br>
  <br>
  Dr Lau pointed out that the cost of advanced pathology and non-urgent imaging tests in the public sector remain significantly lower than those in the private sector.
  <br>
  <br>
  Head of healthcare and social innovation at Our Hong Kong Foundation, Dicky Chow, welcomed the government's review of the public healthcare fee structure.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chow believes it will enhance the healthcare system’s sustainability and ensure that public funds are used more effectively.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, Chow urged the government to enhance the capacity of outpatient and primary care services.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also suggested that authorities should establish more evening clinics and better utilise community pharmacies to help meet demand.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the Society for Community Organisation (SoCo) expressed the concern that the proposed fee adjustments could add significant financial burden to grassroots and lower-middle class patients with chronic illnesses.
  <br>
  <br>
  They emphasised the need for a more comprehensive medical fee waiver system to prevent these groups from missing out on necessary treatments due to financial constraints.
  <br>
  <br>
  SoCo also suggested that the government should clarify how increased fees would enhance public healthcare services.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Tuesday said that artificial intelligence is a game changer for Hong Kong in its goal to become a more sustainable society, as the city goes all out to achieve its carbon emission goals.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chan made the remarks on the second day of the "2025 Hong Kong Climate Forum" in Kowloon, where he also noted that there is an urgency to speed up the green transition in the face of more frequent extreme weather events, record-breaking heat, rising sea levels, as well as increasing stress on the public health system.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said that Hong Kong is dedicated to reaching carbon neutrality by 2050, and is especially focusing on net-zero electricity generation, green transport, buildings, and waste reduction.
  <br>
  <br>
  The financial secretary said that not only can AI empower specific green tech but it can act as a catalyst for encouraging behaviourial changes, while transforming various sectors and businesses.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Clearly, AI has vast potential in optimising energy production and consumption," he told participants.
  <br>
  <br>
  "AI can also accelerate the invention of new materials. It can improve climate modelling and forecasting, enhancing our preparedness in the face of natural disasters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "From energy-saving tech for home appliances and vehicles to smarter traffic management, these innovations are spreading across our country and the world at large," he said, adding that AI could also help optimise capital arrangements to achieve sustainable returns.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan also pointed out that Hong Kong is now developing AI on five fronts, including in super-computing capabilities, algorithms, data, capital, and talent.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The annual Art Central fair is returning to Central Harbourfront from Wednesday with works from more than 100 galleries around the world.
 <br>
  <br>
  Corey Andrew Barr, the fair director, said he expects a good turnout for the event, which features workshops, installations and art performances.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Last year we had over 40,000 people here and we expect to see something similar this year, if not greater,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  To mark its 10th anniversary, the fair debuts the "Legend" gallery to highlight lesser-known artists from earlier generations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among the works on show is a collection by Japanese “rainbow artist” Ay-O as presented by Whitestone Gallery.
  <br>
  <br>
  “So the Legend section is a new thing for us,” said Inessa Li, art adviser at Whitestone Gallery.
  <br>
  <br>
  “For the art fair, we are just very honoured to participate in it and get more people to know this excellent talented artist.”
  <br>
  <br>
  In partnership with the Tourism Board, the fair presents three artists who explored and created works inspired by Central and Sheung Wan, Yau Ma Tei and Sham Shui Po neighbourhoods.
  <br>
  <br>
  Visitors can experience the creative process in a transformed art booth.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Because they all have their own stories that are related to the neighbourhood through their artistic approach, we want to show what's the art related to the neighbourhood and what's the significance of Hong Kong's different areas,” said curator Shirky Chan.
  <br>
  <br>
  The cornerstone art fair runs until Sunday.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A deputy at Beijing's top office on Hong Kong affairs has called on the SAR to roll out a blueprint to further drive its capital market development, seizing on opportunities brought about by the revitalisation of the city's stock market this year.
 <br>
  <br>
  The remarks were made by Qi Bin, deputy director of the central government's liaison office, who noted that Hong Kong's stock market is one of the best outperforming markets in the world this year, with average daily turnover reaching nearly HK$300 billion since last month, indicating a strong return of global capital to the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  Qi, a former vice-president of China's sovereign wealth fund China Investment Corporation, said the SAR should roll out more reforms to drive the city's capital market growth, including a blueprint that offers the market medium to long-term expectations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at the HSBC Global Investment Summit, he pointed out that a blueprint made by the Chinese Securities Regulatory Commission in 2008 helped make the country's capital market the second largest in the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  The blueprint offered a comprehensive analysis of the country's capital market, a slate of reform measures and clear timetables.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This blueprint [in Hong Kong] will provide suggestions for improvements to Hong Kong's capital markets," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A dedicated task force will solicit feedback from leading global investors and financial institutions for the coordinated growth of both Hong Kong and Asia's capital market."
  <br>
  <br>
  Other proposed measures, he added, include "accelerated integration between the city's capital markets and mainland's high-tech enterprises," such as emerging artificial intelligence and robotics firms, while ramping up market supervision to fend off systemic risks and introducing extra long-term funds, including foreign exchange reserves and social security funds.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also noted that Beijing will offer strong support for the city's upcoming inaugural "Hong Kong Global Financial and Industry Summit" in June, when more than 1,000 chief executives from around the world will gather and discuss new projects in the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  Acting Chief Executive Eric Chan said at the same event that there are signs that global capital is returning as the city's total deposits rose by 7.1 percent last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan added that the SAR will also continue to strengthen its position as an offshore yuan centre.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong's role as a super connector has never been more vital," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We remain the world's largest offshore renminbi business hub, each day processing close to 80 percent of cross border renminbi payments outside the mainland.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are now working to enable multi-currency settlements and enrich renminbi products, offering REITs under Stock Connect and exploring new initiatives with mainland regulators," Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  For his part, Alibaba chairman Joe Tsai warned about a potential "bubble" from the over-construction of data centres in the world, following the rapid growth of artificial intelligence technology.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said that some projects were being built without clear customers in mind.
  <br>
  <br>
  "My question to them is, has Microsoft or Google or Amazon or even Alibaba agreed to start using your data centres once it's built? Do you have any agreements? And they said 'no.' So I start to see the beginning of some kind of bubble,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tsai also said that private enterprise confidence had increased on the mainland after President Xi Jinping met a group of entrepreneurs in Beijing last month.

    Non-urgent A&amp;E visits to cost more in fee revamp
   </title>

<img alt="Health minister Lo Chung-mau (middle) says the fee reform is aimed at directing public resources to patients most in need. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797291_1_20250325131640.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Non-urgent patients seeking help at the city's public accident and emergency wards are set to pay more than double the current rate as part of the government's revamp on healthcare charges, with the new fees taking effect over three phases starting on January 1, 2026.
 <br>
  <br>
  The comprehensive reform will also see fee adjustments for other services, such as hospital stays and consultations at specialist and family medicine outpatient clinics.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the administration is planning to cap charges at HK$10,000 for each patient every year. It also pledged to make it easier for eligible people to apply for a fee waiver.
  <br>
  <br>
  Health minister Lo Chung-mau said the fee reform was meant to offer more help for the underprivileged and those with severe illnesses.
  <br>
  <br>
  He stressed that the extra revenue - estimated at some HK$3 billion each year for the initial phase - will go back into public hospital services.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under the proposal, public A&E departments will charge patients depending on their condition, instead of the current flat rate of HK$180.
  <br>
  <br>
  Critical and emergency cases will be treated for free, while the rest will have to pay HK$400 per visit.
  <br>
  <br>
  The authorities are also introducing a "co-payment model" to charge patients between HK$50 and HK$500 for advanced and highly complicated pathology and non-urgent imaging tests.
  <br>
  <br>
  But basic check-ups with high demand will remain free.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fees for medicine from specialist and family medicine outpatient clinics will also be adjusted, while patients will be prescribed no more than four weeks' worth of drugs each time.
  <br>
  <br>
  The changes are expected to lower the government's subsidy ratio for public hospital services from 97.6 percent to about 90 percent, which officials said remains a high level.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Past experience showed that after this kind of structure review, a certain percentage of patients…they are more inclined to see alternative methods of care," said Hospital Authority chief executive Tony Ko.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This enables us to have more capability to reserve our manpower resources to take care of the patients who really need emergency and accidents, and urgent care."
  <br>
  <br>
  At the same time, the government will relax the income and asset requirements to qualify for a fee waiver. About 1.4 million people are expected to benefit after the tweak, up from 300,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  The HK$10,000 annual fee cap, meanwhile, is estimated to help about 70,000 chronic or severely-ill patients who visit hospitals frequently.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thomas Chan, permanent secretary for health, is confident that the government is able to shoulder the financial burden.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is to provide another protection for all Hong Kong citizens who may or may not be eligible to apply for medical waivers, but we will assure them that under this public subsidisation reform, they would not be required to pay an amount that is unaffordable," Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The $10,000 from our estimate is less than half of the median monthly household income. So we try to maintain it to an affordable level."
  <br>
  <br>
  A Health Bureau spokesperson said while the HK$10,000 ceiling applies to all patients, it will not kick in automatically and an application must be made.
  <br>
  <br>
  All surplus fees will be refunded once the application is approved, while subsequent charges for the remainder of that calendar year will be waived, the spokesperson added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials aimed to complete the fee reform within five years, and conduct reviews every two years.

    Relief as billiards keep Tier A status
   </title>

<div class="itemFullText">
 The chairman of the Billiard Sports Council of Hong Kong China welcomes the government's decision to retain the sport's Tier A status, saying the impact would have been devastating had the sport been downgraded.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on an RTHK radio programme on Tuesday, Vincent Law said the retention announcement, made a day ago, comes as a relief to both athletes and coaches, as it allows them to focus on training.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, he stressed that athletes would still face the pressure of having to perform well for the sport to retain the status in the next review, which will be held in two years' time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Law pointed out that billiard has been an elite sport since 2009.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If we had dropped to Tier B this year, our funding would have been cut by about 80 percent," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Therefore, if we just look at it from a funding standpoint, it would already have been a great loss.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But a more severe blow would be the billiards' sector having to quit the Sports Institute.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There would no longer be a billiard sports department, meaning that our training facilities, coaches – as well as the support that players get, such as accommodation – would all go."
  <br>
  <br>
  Law also said the move to retain the sport's status will allow the public to get to know more about billiards, and he believes more children will also try out the sport.
  <br>
  <br>
  If there are more venues in the SAR that allow us to stage competitions, that will also help promote the sport, he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the minimum monthly grant for full-time athletes will increase from HK$7,130 to HK$10,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vincent Cheng, vice-chairman of the Hong Kong Sports Institute and a Sports Commission member, said he hopes the increment can offer more stable lifestyles for athletes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cheng, who's also a DAB lawmaker, said the commission took reference from the salaries given to management trainees at various organisations before coming up with the figure.
