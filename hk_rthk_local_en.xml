<div class="itemFullText">
 Customs have arrested an inbound traveller at the airport for allegedly smuggling cannabis buds into Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 47-year-old man arrived at the SAR on Saturday on a flight from Bangkok.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was subsequently stopped at customs clearance, when officers found around 10kg of suspected cannabis buds in his suitcase.
  <br>
  <br>
  The suspected drugs are worth HK$2.2 million in market value.
  <br>
  <br>
  An investigation is still ongoing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Customs also reminded the public that drug trafficking is a serious offence, and offenders upon conviction face a maximum fine of HK$5 million and life imprisonment.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Breast Milk Bank has begun serving premature or critically-ill newborns across the city, just two months after it came into operation in January.
 <br>
  <br>
  The city's first milk bank, located at the Children's Hospital in Kai Tak, has so far recruited more than 100 eligible donors and collected more than 300 litres of milk.
  <br>
  <br>
  Paediatrician Rosanna Wong, the milk bank's director, said the numbers were "more than expected".
  <br>
  <br>
  She revealed the bank began distributing donor milk to the city's nine public neonatal intensive care units starting this month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Priority is currently given to babies born under 32 weeks of gestation, or weigh less than 1.5kg.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Other babies who require the milk will be those who have severe diseases like congenital heart disease, or after a gastrointestinal operation," she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong called for additional donations from lactating mothers, saying they could help the bank extend its free service to less premature babies or full-term infants with special needs.

    'Organ donor sign-ups hit record, but more needed'

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Secretary for Health Lo Chung-mau has urged more individuals to register as organ donors, as many patients continue to wait for life-saving transplants.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a ceremony honouring organ donors on Sunday, Lo noted that over 2,600 patients in Hong Kong are currently on the waiting list for organ transplants.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said that while nearly 400,000 people have signed up on the Centralised Organ Donation Register - an all-time high - there still remains considerable potential for growth.
  <br>
  <br>
  "While the number 400,000 is commendable, it still represents less than 6 percent of Hong Kong's 7.5 million population, and less than 10 percent if we consider those over 18 years old. I have always been ambitious. 400,000 is an excellent figure, but history is meant to be broken," Lo said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I hope to report an even greater number next year at this gathering, not just a modest increase. I hope we can see a significant rise in organ donation numbers."
  <br>
  <br>
  The health minister also highlighted two cross-border organ donation cases from recent years, benefitting a then four-month-old baby girl in 2022, and an eight-month-old infant earlier this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  He expressed admiration for families who, even in their saddest moments, turn their loss into a gift for others, describing it as an act of great generosity that helps complete another family.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, James Fung, president of the Hong Kong Society of Transplantation, said that in the past two years, there were 54 deceased organ donors who saved 138 patients suffering from organ failure.
  <br>
  <br>
  Additionally, there were 56 living organ donors, who benefited 56 patients suffering from kidney or liver failure.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fung pointed out that there were less than 30 deceased organ donors in each of the past two years, making Hong Kong among places in the world with the lowest organ donation rates.

<img alt="Financial secretary Paul Chan said Hong Kong will continue to help mainland companies enter international markets. Photo courtesy of Paul Chan's blog" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797020_1_20250323141446.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial secretary Paul Chan pledged his support for Hong Kong's cultural and creative industries, saying they will thrive under the city's unique east-meets-west and inclusive environment.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chan, who's currently in Beijing, revealed in his weekly article on Sunday that he had visited a leading pop cultural entertainment firm to learn more about the incubation of cultural and creative intellectual property (IP) products.
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted the enormous potential of the creative industry, saying IP rights holders can ride on the popularity of their products to develop toys, theme parks and even catering services.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Apart from meeting actual needs of the consumers, these IP products also focus on giving them a joyful experience," he wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan believed Hong Kong remains the ideal location for mainland companies looking to expand abroad, citing the city's advantages in sourcing capital, abundance of talent and professional services, and free flow of information.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Developing IP and extending it to different industries, this creates tremendous value. The mainland has a very rich culture, and is highly creative. Hong Kong can be a platform, and help mainland companies go global. We are very willing to do that," he told the company in Beijing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong's creative industry workers, he added, not only understand the mainland market, but also possess global vision and are able to create content which resonates with the public.
  <br>
  <br>
  Citing his latest Budget, the finance chief said the SAR government will support over 30 cultural IP projects in the next five years.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Office for Attracting Strategic Enterprises, meanwhile, will expand the scope of its target companies to bring in more creative firms that integrate innovation and technology, he said.

 The head of the Science Park called for a balanced approach in technological development, saying while research and development is important, the results must also be applied in practical and real-world settings.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a Commercial Radio programme on Sunday, Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks Corporation CEO Albert Wong noted the SAR's strong fundamental research capabilities.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added the park is committed to helping startups and enterprises transform their technology into marketable products.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to Wong's estimates, Hong Kong is home to over 4,700 innovation and technology companies, employing 40,000 to 50,000 people. He says those numbers still pale in comparison to cities like Shenzhen and Shanghai.
  <br>
  <br>
  Going forward, Wong said the SAR needs to focus on attracting more tech firms to set up shop here, noting the ongoing development of two tech projects in the Northern Metropolis - the San Tin Technopole and the Hong Kong-Shenzhen Innovation and Technology Park.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also talked about how the Science Park has been helping startups gain exposure overseas. Dozens of tech firms were given a chance to showcase their products at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, as well as the Mobile World Congress (MWC) in Barcelona earlier this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We also send companies to other parts of the world. But US Silicon Valley is important because it is a mecca of entrepreneurship and startup. There's a lot to learn about early stage investment, about entrepreneurship, about product market fit," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Startups with great potential even have the chance to undergo six months of training in Silicon Valley through a booster programme. Six firms were earmarked last year, and secured over US$15 million of investment.
  <br>
  <br>
  "These five companies that went there last year, it was very, very useful. They have to survive and they did survive. That is why we're going to send another 10 companies there this year," Wong said.

 The government is demanding that ticketing platform Cityline fix printing errors on some Coldplay concert tickets.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a statement issued late on Saturday, the Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau said Cityline should deal with the matter swiftly so ticket holders would not be affected. The British band is due to perform at the Kai Tak Sports Park next month.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to Cityline's website, the inaccurate information is printed on the $1,399 "Coldplay: Music Of The Spheres World Tour—delivered by DHL" standing tickets.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cityline said it was extending ticket exchanges and adding locations in Guangzhou and Shenzhen. It also apologised and said it would refund handling fees.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mainland ticket holders have also been complaining about Cityline on Tourism Secretary Rosanna Law's Xiaohongshu social media page.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Consumer Council said it had received 17 complaints as of 7 pm on Saturday.

 Financial Secretary Paul Chan visited two mainland firms in Beijing on Friday, highlighting Hong Kong's role as a gateway for business expansion and global market access.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chan first visited a leading pop-culture entertainment company listed in Hong Kong, which operates popular intellectual property (IP) artistic toys. He toured the company's thematic park and met with senior management to discuss their business development.
  <br>
  <br>
  He welcomed the firm's plans to expand its physical retail network in Hong Kong and diversify services, noting that the SAR government is reviewing tax deductions for acquiring IP usage rights to boost the industry.
  <br>
  <br>
  Later, Chan visited a high-precision artificial intelligence (AI) firm specialising in intelligent sensing solutions for smart traffic management, autonomous driving, perception robots, and low-altitude economic applications.
  <br>
  <br>
  The company, with projects in cities such as Beijing and Shanghai, plans to establish its international headquarters and a global R&D centre in Hong Kong while preparing for a listing. Chan encouraged the firm to utilise Hong Kong's capital, talent, and professional services to expand internationally.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan was due to attend the China Development Forum on Saturday and speak at the thematic seminar.

  The school said they are receiving treatment at a local hospital and are in stable condition.
  <br>
  <br>
  It added that it had notified the Education Bureau, the Centre for Health Protection and parents regarding the incident, and also taken measures to reduce the risk of infection to others.

 The Department of Health said on Saturday that a 35-year-old woman remains in a critical condition, after she was sedated before a tooth extraction at a dental clinic in Central two months ago.
 <br>
  <br>
  Deep sedation was used before the surgery, and the woman failed to wake up after the extraction.
  <br>
  <br>
  She was sent to hospital immediately.
  <br>
  <br>
  After the incident, the clinic stopped offering sedation to patients.
  <br>
  <br>
  The clinic also reported the sentinel event to the department and it has submitted an investigation report as requested.
  <br>
  <br>
  The department will decide whether or not to take any further action.
  <br>
  <br>
  During the investigation, the department also found that the clinic did not properly manage patients’ medical records and medication, nor implement effective infection control.
  <br>
  <br>
  To ensure patient safety, the department has requested that the clinic improve its procedures.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Thousands of people flocked to Ocean Park on Saturday as they can now see the panda twins and their mother, Ying Ying, all in one go.
 <br>
  <br>
  Visitors who collect an entry ticket can meet the pandas for three minutes, though all tickets for the last session at 4:20 pm were gone by noon.
  <br>
  <br>
  The park distributed more than 3,000 entry tickets in total.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lau, a frequent visitor, said she arrived one and a half hours before the park opened.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I want to capture the first moments of the panda twins, and I'm really looking forward to seeing Ying Ying with her babies. That’s why I need to arrive early,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another tourist, Chan and her husband spent HK$1,500 each for a special, 30-minute visit before the park opened.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I think it’s worth the price. Because the panda twins will grow up and the money will be used to take care of them. So we think it’s ok,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Her husband said it’s a remarkable experience seeing Ying Ying licking her babies clean.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Transport Department on Saturday said it received almost 37,000 online applications for vehicle licence renewals in the first two months of the year, a more than 80 percent year-on-year increase.
 <br>
  <br>
  The department rolled out an enhanced scheme in December last year to simplify the licensing process.
  <br>
  <br>
  Following the change, the vehicle licence is no longer printed with an expiry date, so vehicle owners don't need to replace it with a new one after each renewal.
  <br>
  <br>
  A QR code is printed on the licence instead, allowing vehicle owners to scan and check their expiry date.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vehicle owners also no longer need to present the vehicle registration document when applying for a licence renewal. They can even skip uploading their third-party insurance certificate if the application is made online.
  <br>
  <br>
  Currently, the department has issued more than 190,000 such new vehicle licences.

    Scheme aims to identify patients with high cholesterol

<div class="itemFullText">
 Commissioner for primary healthcare Pang Fei-chau said on Saturday that it is expected more patients will be detected with high cholesterol after a government-led primary healthcare scheme expands to cover blood lipid testing from Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Chronic Disease Co-Care Pilot Scheme, launched in November 2023, was set up to detect chronic diseases at an early stage. Under the scheme, the government will subsidise residents aged 45 or above with no known medical history of diabetes or hypertension, to undergo screenings for high blood sugar and high blood pressure.
  <br>
  <br>
  So far, over 60,000 people have been screened under the pilot scheme, and nearly 40 percent were diagnosed with diabetes, high blood sugar, or high blood pressure.
  <br>
  <br>
  Starting from Friday, the screenings will be expanded to blood lipid testing so people can find out whether they have high cholesterol.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on an RTHK programme, Pang said it is thought four percent of those screened might have high cholesterol.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said treatment would have to be tailored to their needs.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Three highs affect our cardiac health. If a person already has diabetes and also has high cholesterol, his or her risk of heart and blood vessel disease is high,” Pang said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “However, if a person only has high cholesterol, the risk is different. Therefore, we will reassess the cardiac risk for people who have three highs,” he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eligible residents can undergo the screenings through pairing with a family doctor of their choice. Residents will be charged a co-payment fee of about HK$150 for doctor consultations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pang said about 650 doctors have joined the scheme. He hopes they can share their experiences with industry peers so more doctors can join the scheme.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development Algernon Yau said on Saturday that the government is preparing to file a complaint to the World Trade Organization (WTO) regarding US tariffs.
 <br>
  <br>
  The US has imposed an additional 20 percent duty on goods from Hong Kong, the same as for mainland China.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a Commercial Radio programme, Yau accused Donald Trump’s government of violating WTO agreements, which state that the SAR is a separate customs territory.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The executive orders of the US government noted that they are imposing new tariffs on goods from mainland China. But the Department of Homeland Security and Customs said the rule includes products of Hong Kong. This is a violation of the WTO agreement and it is completely wrong to mingle Hong Kong goods with those of China,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister said the levies have a minimal impact on Hong Kong, noting the US has had a trade surplus of US$270 billion with the SAR over the past decade.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yau also said that despite rising geological tension between the US and China, foreign investors still have confidence in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  “In the last two years we’ve seen an increase of more than 900 foreign enterprises. And in 2024, there were 539 more, creating more than 7,000 jobs and HK$67 billion in investments."
  <br>
  <br>
  Yau said the administration would continue to help local businesses find new opportunities in emerging markets, including ASEAN and Latin America.

 The MTR says Light Rail services are returning to normal after several routes in Tin Shui Wai were disrupted on Saturday morning.
 <br>
  <br>
  It took maintenance staff about four hours to fix an overhead line near Tin Yuet, which had been damaged by a crane lorry at around 7:30 am.
  <br>
  <br>
  Routes 705, 706 and 751 were diverted as a result.
  <br>
  <br>
  The MTR asked people to use other forms of public transport while laying on free shuttle buses for affected passengers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police later arrested the 41-year-old crane lorry driver on suspicion of dangerous driving. The force said no one was hurt in the incident.

    Separate fees for radiology services 'minimal': HA

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Requiring patients to pay separately for tests and scans at public hospitals will leave them with a "minimal" financial burden as such services will still be "highly subsidised" by the government, health officials say amid plans to adjust medical fees.
 <br>
  <br>
  Currently, the government covers the cost of diagnostic radiology services at public hospitals.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government has said it may charge separately for services such as computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, although emergency and hospitalised patients will remain exempt.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials say they hope hospital fees can be adjusted to a level where there would be a reasonable co-payment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Michael Wong, a director at the Hospital Authority, said Hongkongers will likely be asked to pay a certain amount for "more complicated" radiology services, but this should not cost them too much.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This co-payment should still be a highly subsidised amount [from the government]. The public should expect the co-payment to be minimal, and [it] will not affect most of the patients," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If the patients really have some financial difficulties in paying that small amount, they can still apply for a fee exemption or reduction."
  <br>
  <br>
  Introducing a co-payment model could be a way to tackle patient no-shows, Wong said, with around 10 percent of them missing scheduled appointments for medical imaging tests like CT and MRI scans.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hopefully, [we] could reduce this proportion of patients defaulting their attendance, and they could release the appointments for some other patients," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Paul Lee, who chairs the authority's coordinating committee in radiology, said there were also cases of patients attending a scheduled appointment despite no longer requiring a check-up.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some of them, who had scheduled for a scan due to certain symptoms presented at the time of the medical consultation, had been treated for and recovered from their ailments before they could undergo the test, Lee explained.

<img alt="Hong Kong Investment Corporation has signed a strategic partnership deal with Shanghai-based startup StarFive to speed up RISC-V chips' adoption in the SAR. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796829_2_20250321182218.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan said on Friday a strategic partnership between the government-backed investment firm and a mainland chipmaker will speed up adoption of the popular RISC-V chips in the city.
 <br>
  <br>
  The remarks came as Chan delivered a keynote speech at the signing ceremony to mark the deal between Hong Kong Investment Corporation (HKIC) and Shanghai-based semiconductor start-up, StarFive, which produces the chips.
  <br>
  <br>
  RISC-V is an open-source architecture that is used to design a range of less-sophisticated chips and allows developers to configure and customise their chip designs.
  <br>
  <br>
  It's considered capable of challenging Intel's x86 architecture's domination of the personal computer market as well as the Arm Holdings architecture that dominates the smartphone markets.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at the event via a recorded video, Chan said that based on the characteristics of the RISC-V architecture as well as Hong Kong's strengths, the two sides could together reach new heights in creating new industries and forging global cooperation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As the application of open-source large language models, such as that of DeepSeek's, become more inclusive and flexible, combining it with the supply and applications of RISC-V open-source chips will mean a great reduction in cost and a great increase in their flexibilities," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Of course, as the RISC-V technology is now being developed at a fast speed, there's a need to further enrich [its relevant] industrial clusters and for accelerated international collaboration. This will allow Hong Kong to fully leverage our advantages under One Country, Two Systems," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, HKIC chief executive Clara Chan said the collaboration with StarFive will bring co-operation between the tech firm and local universities and institutes, while bringing new employment opportunities.
  <br>
  <br>
  StarFive, she added, will also give priority to the SAR as its potential listing venue in the future.
  <br>
  <br>
  The deal came as Beijing has been doubling down on the use of the RISC-V architecture as a bet to strengthen its domestic chip industry and reduce reliance on foreign suppliers.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, it's not known how much HKIC has invested in the six-year-old RISC-V chipmaker.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Sunday, Chan also said in his weekly blog that the design and application of RISC-V open source chips is an important part of strategic planning for Hong Kong's future.

 Chief Executive John Lee said the government will soon offer land for private development in Hong Kong-Shenzhen Innovation and Technology Park, now that the first three buildings in zone's Hong Kong Park have been completed.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lee's remarks came as he attended the topping-out ceremony for the No 8 and 9 laboratory buildings in the zone in Lok Ma Chau Loop, which also saw the successful completion of the No 11 talent accommodation building.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the completion of the buildings marks a milestone for technological collaboration between the Hong Kong and Shenzhen governments and paves the way for the zone to become a world-class cluster.
  <br>
  <br>
  He called for more private firms to participate in jointly developing the high-tech area.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will soon select suitable sites this year and seek private development plans to make use of the market forces to accelerate the development of the park, and we will complete the detailed planning of the second phase of the park within this year," Lee said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With the gradual completion of the park, it will provide more room for the development of more innovation and technology enterprises and talents, and I call on all sectors from society as well as market forces to actively participate [in the park's development]," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, Lee, who chairs the park's steering committee, said a second edition of the committee's meeting was held yesterday to speed up planning and usage of the three buildings, and authorities are now going all out with development plans for five more planned buildings.
  <br>
  <br>
  The first batch of tenants, including companies specialising in bio-health technology and data science, is expected to be move in and start operating during the second half of the year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier, the government also said it is earmarking HK$3.7 billion to assist the park's construction.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee, meanwhile, noted that the SAR government will continue to explore the possibility of eliciting policy support from the mainland to enhance the free flow of personnel, resources, capital and data to assist with cross-border collaboration.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Friday said they will launch a citywide operation next week to tackle inattentive driving, following an increase in fatal traffic accidents in the first three months of this year.
 <br>
  <br>
  Officers said there were 21 fatal accidents from January to March, up around 40 percent from the same period last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a press conference, the force said most cases involved motorcyclists and truck drivers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan Sin-hang, a chief inspector with the force, explained the reasons for the increase.
  <br>
  <br>
  “One of the reasons may be because of the end of the new year and there may be a lot of deliveries for the truck drivers. So maybe they're in a hurry, and so they neglected the situation on the road,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “They failed to pay attention to the road situation and maybe they didn't maintain a safe distance with the cars in front of them, or they didn't pay attention before they cut into the other lane, and also speeding.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Starting next week, police will launch a stringent enforcement operation across Hong Kong to combat careless driving, speeding, and jaywalking.
  <br>
  <br>
  The force also reported 18,355 traffic accidents in 2024, involving 23,659 injuries, most of which were minor.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A French aeronautic services company on Friday said it is working with the Airport Authority (AA) to develop the SAR into Asia’s first aircraft parts processing and trading hub.
 <br>
  <br>
  The French firm, Elior Group, signed a memorandum of understanding with the authority last month to explore the possibility of providing services such as aircraft dismantling, parts recycling and related training in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  Its chairman Daniel Derichebourg said the company is looking forward to developing and exploring new opportunities in Hong Kong, and expanding its businesses across Asia.
  <br>
  <br>
  The company also said it will discuss the topic of training local talents with the Hong Kong International Aviation Academy.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The city has always been a prime location for foreign investment and international conglomerates,” said Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development Algernon Yau in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Hong Kong will continue to play its unique role of connecting the mainland and the world to attract more companies from around the world to set up in the city,” he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alpha Lau, the director-general of investment promotion at InvestHK – which will help Elior set up its Asia headquarters in Hong Kong – said: “The signing of this MoU is a testament to global businesses confidence in the Hong Kong market."
  <br>
  <br>
  She added the move reaffirms "that Hong Kong is the ideal destination for companies to establish or expand their operations in the region”.
  <br>
  <br>
  And transport minister Mabel Chan said she is pleased about the collaboration, which will enrich the SAR’s position as an international aviation hub and support the aviation development in the country and Asia.

    Well-off public housing tenants to pay more

<img alt="Cleresa Wong said the higher rental charges for well-off tenants are aimed at bringing about a fairer use of public resources and not at raising government revenue. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796794_1_20250321160610.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A Housing Authority committee tightened rules on Friday for well-off public housing tenants, raising the likelihood that their rent would more than double.
 <br>
  <br>
  The new measures, which will be implemented in October, could also see hundreds of well-off households required to move out in four years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Currently, households that earn two to five times the income limit are paying 1.5 times to double the standard rent.
  <br>
  <br>
  After the changes, they'd have to pay 2.5 to 4.5 times the normal rate.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials said that within a four-year period, if a tenant's income is twice found to be between four to five times the limit, the tenants will have to move out.
  <br>
  <br>
  As for those who earn five times the limit, the rule remains that they must return the flat immediately.
  <br>
  <br>
  The chairwoman of the authority's subsidised housing committee, Cleresa Wong, said the government is expected to receive around HK$1.5 billion more a year as a result of the changes.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, she stressed that the move is not about raising government revenue but about ensuring a fair use of public resources and ensuring all tenants have a similar income-to-rent ratio.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As a result of this review, generally well-off tenants will now be paying roughly 11 percent of their household income as their rental housing expenses," Wong said after a committee meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The 'ables' should pay more."
  <br>
  <br>
  The rental changes, she added, will affect around five percent of public rental tenants, or around 40,000 households.
  <br>
  <br>
  She also said rules for well-off tenants to buy subsidised flats are also being relaxed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Those earning four to five times the limit will keep their status as green form applicants for four more years after they'd moved out of public housing.

    NJZ loses court fight to leave label

<img alt="The Seoul Central District Court prohibits members of NJZ from pursuing independent endeavours. File photo: NewJeans" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796797_1_20250321161623.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A South Korean court on Friday ruled against popular K-pop girl group NewJeans, which had sought to sever ties with their label ADOR over what they called "mistreatment" by the company.
 <br>
  <br>
  The group, which now calls themselves NJZ and is to appear in Hong Kong's ComplexCon this weekend, made headlines in November by announcing their decision to leave ADOR, whose parent company HYBE is behind K-pop sensation BTS.
  <br>
  <br>
  The label later filed for an injunction to maintain its status as the managing agency of NewJeans, requesting that the Seoul Central District Court prohibit the group's members from engaging in independent commercial activities.
  <br>
  <br>
  The court sided with ADOR, issuing a ruling that the group, now branding themselves as NJZ, must not pursue independent endeavours.
  <br>
  <br>
  The court said that if the group "unilaterally terminate their exclusive contract" with ADOR, and change their name autonomously, the label would suffer "significant damages".
  <br>
  <br>
  The group's actions would also "severely damage not only the brand value of NewJeans but also ADOR's reputation as a management company," the court added.
  <br>
  <br>
  NewJeans made their debut in 2022 and the K-pop phenomenon is among HYBE's most successful acts.
  <br>
  <br>
  NewJeans and ADOR have been caught in the heated contract dispute since August, following allegations that HYBE forced out the group's star producer, Min Hee-jin.
  <br>
  <br>
  The band issued an ultimatum for Min's reinstatement, which HYBE declined.
  <br>
  <br>
  In response, the members took their grievances public, accusing the label of intentionally sabotaging their careers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Band member Hanni alleged last year that the group experienced workplace harassment, such as "deliberate miscommunications and manipulation regarding multiple areas" while working with ADOR.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is not the type of work ethic we respect and not one we want to be a part of, and to continue working under a company with no intention of protecting NewJeans would only do us harm," she said at the time.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the court on Friday said that based on the claims and evidence submitted by the group, it is "difficult to conclude that ADOR has sufficiently violated the essential obligations of the exclusive contract."
  <br>
  <br>
  ADOR welcomed the court's "judicious" decision, and said they "eagerly anticipate meeting with the artists for a heartfelt conversation at the earliest opportunity".
  <br>
  <br>
  "With our status as NewJeans' exclusive agency now legally affirmed, we are fully committed to supporting the artists going forward," it said. (With additional reporting from AFP)

    HKMU launches Cantonese opera translation library

<img alt="The team behind the Cantonese opera translations says they pay special attention to the culture and history behind the stories. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796790_1_20250321154817.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Metropolitan University on Friday launched a new online library that features English translations of classic Cantonese opera scripts.
 <br>
  <br>
  The project started a year ago and the initial collection includes scripts from the renowned Cantonese opera “Forty Years of Cherished Love”, which tells the tragic love story of the poet Lu You and his wife Tang Wan in the Song dynasty.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kelly Chan, director of the university’s Ina Ho Cantonese Opera Research Centre and head of the team, said she hopes the translations will bring Cantonese opera to a broader audience.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan – who is also a language and translation professor – noted that the team has also included explainers to certain translations to make it easier for English readers to understand.
  <br>
  <br>
  “If you see the Chinese term ‘milky way', what does that mean, especially for westerners? Does it mean silver river? There's actually a love story behind, for the cowherd and the weaving girl, so that would be more beneficial for people who did not really know this tradition.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Sheryl Zhang, who is part of the translation team, said one challenge is to balance language and cultural context.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Their love story was so sorrowful and carries grief. In the translation, we had to pay so much attention to the emotions, the cultural, and particularly, historical phase behind the story.
  <br>
  <br>
  The nine-member team is currently working on translating more works, including selections from the opera adaptation of “The Dream of the Red Chamber”.
  <br>
  <br>
  Their full collection is currently only available to the university’s students and staff, though people who are interested in the works can reach out to the university to request full access to the library.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A global pop culture festival ComplexCon has returned to Hong Kong for a second year, with organisers expecting the stronger lineup to bring in more visitors.
 <br>
  <br>
  The three-day event was held outside the United States for the first time last year, attracting over 30,000 visitors.
  <br>
  <br>
  The organiser said it expects visitor numbers to hit 35,000 this year, as it has a stronger live concert lineup that includes American record producer Metro Boomin and the well-known K-pop group NJZ.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, a Seoul district court ruled on Friday against NJZ in its attempt to leave the ADOR label and prohibited the group from "pursuing independent endeavours."
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement made hours after the ruling, NJZ said the group will be participating in ComplexCon.
  <br>
  <br>
  This year’s festival also features a marketplace for trendy products, with fans queuing for limited-edition goods of the Labubu toy created by Hong Kong artist Kasing Lung.
  <br>
  <br>
  A tourist from the United States said he had been to ComplexCon in Las Vegas before and it was different with that in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The one in Las Vegas was really big, but this one still is really nice. We got the VIP ticket, so we can get in early and see what's here,” he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I'm here for some Labubu stuff. We've been all over Hong Kong looking for Labubu things. We went to all the Pop Marts. Everything was sold out. So it's really nice that this is open right now.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The ComplexCon marketplace is also a platform for NJZ to release their first-ever merchandise following a name change from NewJeans.
  <br>
  <br>
  A 15-year-old Hong Kong fan of the group said he arrived early to get the goods as they are very limited.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I have already queued for like 40 minutes already. I really want the keychain and the T-shirt,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I've been really liking them for a long time, [since] I was 12 or 13. I already wanted to come before they said NJZ is coming. So it's like a bonus for the event.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The festival, which opens on Friday, ends on Sunday at the AsiaWorld-Expo in Chek Lap Kok.

    Cathay Pacific cancels flights to London

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Cathay Pacific said on Friday it cancelled two flights from Hong Kong to London, due to the temporary closure of Heathrow Airport.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Cathay Pacific flights CX239 and CX253 from Hong Kong to London on 21 March have been cancelled," a statement by the airline said.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, CX251 and CX255, due to depart Hong Kong for London late Friday, will operate normally.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, all flights from London to Hong Kong operated by the airline have also been cancelled.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are assessing the situation and will keep our customers informed with the latest updates," the statement said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some affected passengers at the Hong Kong International Airport were left frustrated with the airline's arrangements.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsie Slade, who is returning home to London, said it was "chaos" with Cathay staff members giving her different instructions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I can't understand why they can't just say: 'wait here and we will sort it out for you'," she told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another passenger surnamed Choi said he understood it was a rare incident, but noted there's room for improvement in the airline's response.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I have travelled for 40 years and never had this experience," he said. "They said it's not their problem. That triggered us."
  <br>
  <br>
  Others, including a passenger surnamed Siu, decided to look for alternative ways of getting to London.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I used about 25 minutes to finish booking another flight [that is] a week later... I have plenty of time," he said.

 Chief Executive John Lee on Friday said the city will soon launch a HK$3 billion scheme to support local academic and scientific research, as authorities ramp up efforts to transition Hong Kong into a global innovation and technology centre.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lee made the remarks at the opening of the International Academicians Hong Kong Forum in Wan Chai, where he noted that the role of scholars and scientists is critical in aiding Hong Kong's technological transition, amid evolving and unprecedented global challenges.
  <br>
  <br>
  The forum also marked the founding of the International Alliance of Academicians (IAA).
  <br>
  <br>
  "Knowledge knows no borders, our shared challenges require shared solutions. The government is committed to cultivating a dynamic environment, one that champions innovation and technology, in every sector and industry, every institution and corner of our community," he told participants.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will soon launch a Frontier Technology Research Support Scheme, worth HK$3 billion, or nearly US$400 million. It will help fund groundbreaking basic research driven by world-class researchers and academics," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that the completion of the first three buildings in the Hong Kong-Shenzhen Innovation and Technology Park will also help provide the "hardware" for local I&T development, and that the alliance could serve as the "soft power".
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, Nancy Ip, President of the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, who chairs the IAA, said that Hong Kong is an ideal base for the alliance.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Given its international status and dynamic academic and research sectors, Hong Kong is ideally positioned to foster scientific cooperation among leading scholars from around the world. This global alliance will also solidify Hong Kong's reputation as an international innovation and technology centre," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The IAA alliance is made up of 100 academics from around the world, and aims to enhance global collaboration among scientists and academics.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Transport chief Mable Chan said on Friday most pilot projects in Hong Kong's first-ever low-altitude economy test run will be operated manually and within the line of sight.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Low-altitude Economy Regulatory Sandbox trials will test airspace management, flight operations and emergency responses to support the use of unmanned aircraft.
  <br>
  <br>
  The initial phase, comprising 38 projects, is set to begin next month at Science Park, Cyberport and on some outlying islands.
  <br>
  <br>
  One project will be a food delivery test run between Science Park and Ma On Shan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan told an RTHK radio programme that safety is the top priority, noting that drones are equipped with propellers and backup systems.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Based on safety and risk-based principles, we will begin by operating gradually within visual range," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For future beyond line-of-sight flights covering longer distances, we aim to advance further based on flight data collected from line-of-sight runs and assessments of safety considerations.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In terms of tech and innovation research, some laboratories at universities are currently developing safety features for these drones.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They've developed various self-defence mechanisms for the drones.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Also, when one drone is in operation, another drone will monitor it nearby at the same time."
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on another radio programme, Chan said officials will study the possibility of developing a low-altitude economy in the Northern Metropolis.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government plans to amend regulations to increase drone weight limits from 25 kilogrammes to 150kg to allow more advanced drones to carry heavier loads.

 Hong Kong has seen its winding-up orders hitting the highest level in more than 15 years.
 <br>
  <br>
  Data released by the Official Receiver's Office on Friday showed that 66 winding-up orders were made by the court in February, up 83 percent from a year earlier and an increase of 14 percent on a monthly basis.
  <br>
  <br>
  That's the highest monthly figure since September 2009.
  <br>
  <br>
  As for bankruptcy petitions, the figure stood at 787 in February, an increase of 21.5 percent year on year but a 3.9 percent drop from January.
  <br>
  <br>
  For the first two months of the year taken together, the number of bankruptcy petitions reached 1,606, 15 percent higher from the same period a year earlier.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong has the full support from the central government in maintaining its unique status and advantages, a senior Beijing official told a visiting business delegation from the SAR on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Xia Baolong, the director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, made the comment during a meeting with representatives of the European Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong (EuroCham) in the capital.
  <br>
  <br>
  He appreciated EuroCham's positive assessment of China and the SAR, and praised its contributions in promoting long-term investment from European enterprises in Hong Kong, as well as cooperation between the city and the European business sector.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Chinese government firmly supports the accurate and resolute implementation of 'one country, two systems'...and solidify Hong Kong's role as an international financial, shipping and trade centre, while maintaining a free, open and rule-based business environment," an article published by the office read.
  <br>
  <br>
  In return, EuroCham told Xia that it has full confidence in Hong Kong, and pledged to bring in more investments, companies and talent from Europe to the SAR.

<img alt="Hong Kong retains its spot as Asia's top financial centre, having only reclaimed it from Singapore in September 2024. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796664_1_20250320203327.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong remains Asia's top financial hub, and third in the world behind New York and London, according to a half-yearly index of global financial centres.
 <br>
  <br>
  Singapore is ranked fourth, while Shanghai, Shenzhen and Seoul round up the top 10 spots in the 37th edition of the Global Financial Centres Index.
  <br>
  <br>
  The list is jointly compiled by think tanks Z/Yen Group in London and the Shenzhen-based China Development Institute. It is published every March and September.
  <br>
  <br>
  Researchers ranked 119 financial centres based on 140 instrumental factors, as well as assessments from nearly 5,000 questionnaire respondents.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SAR took top honours in the areas of investment management, insurance and finance, and was second in human capital and infrastructure.
  <br>
  <br>
  A government spokesman said the report fully recognises Hong Kong's "leading status and strengths" as an international financial centre.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With the staunch support of our country, Hong Kong will continue to leverage the advantages under 'one country, two systems', actively integrate into national development, and deepen international exchanges and co-operation, with a view to fulfilling our roles as a 'super connector' and a 'super value-adder'," a statement said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The spokesman also noted the latest budget has rolled out a series of policy initiatives to create new growth areas for the city's financial market.

 Drones will be tasked with carrying out services ranging from power line inspections to emergency medical deliveries in Hong Kong’s first-ever low-altitude economy test run.
 <br>
  <br>
  The trial programme comprises 38 projects under the Low-altitude Economy Regulatory Sandbox, which will act as a secure testing environment and incubator for drone tech in the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  Here are some of the projects that will soon take off.
  <br>
  <br>
  <b>
   Remote inspections of electrical lines and towers

   <br>
   As part of the pilot project, drones will be used to survey vast areas under CLP Power’s coverage. They will be checking 17,000 kilometres worth of overhead lines and cables as well as the electric towers that are powering their extensive distribution network.
   <br>
   <br>
   Eric Cheung, senior director of power systems at CLP, said these remote-controlled devices can swiftly gather real-time data, rapidly identify external risks, pinpoint fault locations, and expedite assessments and maintenance.
   <br>
   <br>
   Engineering staff will also be able to operate drones from safe distances, he added.
   <br>

    Fully automated: AI powers infrastructure checks

    <br>
    <br>
    Desmond Ho, the founder of local startup Alpha AI says the pilot programme’s regulatory sandbox gives his firm the chance to test their fully-automated drones’ ability to check structures and other infrastructure.
    <br>
    <br>
    The drones – equipped with high-definition cameras – would use AI to detect defects and analyse any damage they find.
    <br>
    <br>
    Ho said that previously, legal restrictions meant their drones had to be controlled manually, adding the use of automated drones will greatly boost efficiency.
    <br>
    <br>
    "We believe that could save over 50 percent of the cost or time for the people, but most importantly, we can reduce the accident rate that could happen in remote areas or outdoors.”
    <br>
    <br>
    He added that this technology can also monitor the condition of buildings during the rainy season and even before and after the passage of typhoons.
    <br>
    <br>
    Alpha AI is already working with the Housing Authority to conduct external wall inspections of public housing estates.

     The pilot project will also make life easier for residents in remote areas, who could soon benefit from unmanned delivery services.
     <br>
     <br>
     Lalamove and Yixin Smart Technologies will be looking to test the delivery of medicine, healthcare products and documents to the farthest of locations, including the outlying islands.
     <br>
     <br>
     Barry Cheung, founder and chairman of the Low-altitude Economy Association of Hong Kong, China, said drones can carry out deliveries when land travel is not an option.
     <br>
     <br>
     "Our core mindset is to use this project to operate the flight between Hong Kong Island to other islands like Cheung Chau," he said.
     <br>
     <br>
     "We use the drone to [make deliveries] to Cheung Chau. This is very efficient, requires [less] time and also [can] provide an immediate response to those needy people especially for the elders in Cheung Chau."

      Drones will be used to save lives at the mountaintop Princess Margaret Hospital.
      <br>
      <br>
      China Mobile plans to use them to speed up deliveries of medicine, blood and other supplies between buildings at the hospital campus.
      <br>
      <br>
      "They are located on Lai King Hill and their buildings are quite [far] apart. [Currently], they have a third-party logistics company to arrange transportation once per hour to send the specimen and the medical amount to different buildings," said the telecommunication firm’s Becky Lui.
      <br>
      <br>
      "But if we are applying our drone solution to them, then they can arrange the delivery at any time when they need. This will greatly enhance the efficiency of the delivery services."
      <br>
      <br>
      China Mobile also said they hope to expand their drone delivery services to other hospitals.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A Hong Kong Airlines flight was forced to make an emergency landing in Fuzhou after a fire broke out in the cabin on Thursday afternoon.
 <br>
  <br>
  Flight HX115 was en route to Hong Kong from Hangzhou when the incident happened.
  <br>

  Passengers on board the flight shared videos on social media, showing cabin crew and passengers pouring bottles of water onto a bag in an overhead compartment, from where smoke was billowing.
  <br>
  <br>
  It's believed a portable charging device had triggered the fire.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong Airlines said in a statement that the blaze has been put out, and that its providing assistance to passengers and crew members.

    Ride-hailing drivers 'should face cabbie-style test'

<div class="itemFullText">
 The government should draw up "an appropriate level" of regulations for ride-hailing platforms, such as by making it mandatory for drivers to take a licensing exam similar to that for cabbies, a lawmaker said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Legislator Hoey Simon Lee also said ride-hailing drivers should be subject to legal restrictions because they are not simply operating a private vehicle.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We should have an appropriate level of regulations – not too tight but not too loose," said Lee, who conducted a study on online-hailing services.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If it's too tight, it will affect the sharing economy. But if it's too loose, it will not be protective enough for passengers and also not fair to or healthy for the whole sector."
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong is seeking to regulate platforms offering ride-hailing services with a proposed framework expected to be unveiled this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee urged the administration to require operators to ensure the vehicles providing services are safe and that personal data stored on such platforms are handled properly.
  <br>
  <br>
  Such vehicles should be required to install dash cameras too, he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other than suggestions to regulate ride-hailing services, Lee called on the authorities to consider making changes to policies affecting the taxi trade such as in the design of driving exams and their operations.

    Local rates to be at high level for some time: HKMA

<div class="itemFullText">
 The city's de facto central bank has cautioned that local borrowing costs will remain at a relatively high level for some time as it kept its key interest rate unchanged at 4.75 percent.
 <br>
  <br>
  The move by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) on Thursday came in lockstep with the US Federal Reserve, which also left its target rate steady overnight in a range between 4.25 and 4.5 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  In response to the US rate policy decision, the HKMA said the move by the Fed was in line with market expectations and that the latest released "dot plot," a data chart providing a snapshot of the Fed's thinking, suggests that the Fed might reduce target rates by a total of 50 basis points by the end of the year.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, it cautioned that the pace of US interest rate cuts remain quite uncertain due to recent changes in economic indicators and volatility in market expectations.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Interest rates in Hong Kong might still remain at relatively high levels for some time, and the extent and pace of future US interest rate cuts are subject to considerable uncertainty," it said in a statement, adding that future rate cuts depend on factors such as US inflation and labour market data, as well as fiscal and trade policies.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The public should carefully assess and continue to manage the interest rate risk when making property purchase, mortgage or other borrowing decisions," it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, it noted that Hong Kong's financial and monetary markets have continued to operate in a smooth and orderly manner with the liquidity condition remaining stable.
  <br>
  <br>
  The HKMA added that it will continue to closely monitor market developments.
  <br>
  <br>
  The city's major commercial banks have also followed suit, with HSBC and Bank of China (Hong Kong) keeping their rates at 5.25 percent and Standard Chartered maintaining its rate at 5.5 percent.

    Complete eHealth database 'key for treating patients'

 Healthcare officials said on Thursday that patients should not get to pick the medical record to be stored on a government-run electronic platform.
 <br>
  <br>
  The administration is proposing legal changes to make it mandatory for all healthcare workers to upload important patient information onto its eHealth platform.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under the proposal, Deputy Secretary for Health Sam Hui said, patients would still get to decide whether to use the system at all, as well as whether they consent to healthcare providers' access to their records.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We hope patients understand that a complete medical record is very important for the standard and level of safety of the healthcare services they receive," he said on an RTHK programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The public shouldn't have too much of a choice when it comes to what information they put or not put into the eHealth account."
  <br>
  <br>
  Hui said if patients do have concerns about joining the electronic system, they can bring them up with healthcare professionals.
  <br>
  <br>
  He stressed that the government respects the personal nature of patients' medical records.
  <br>
  <br>
  The medical sector, he said, agrees that records such as drug allergies, jabs received and past diagnoses are very important to reach up-to-date diagnoses.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said officials are working on getting an outsourced provider to sync electronic record platforms that better connect the eHealth system with others.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on the same programme, family doctor Lam Wing-wo said he agrees that the trend is to have big data, which can help with the public health situation.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government has said 60 percent of private doctors currently access records stored on eHealth but that basically all information in the system is provided by the public sector.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lam said that from what he understands, it's not very accurate for the administration to say that private doctors aren't being proactive enough to upload records.
  <br>
  <br>
  Doctors, he pointed out, simply cannot submit data to eHealth because the electronic medical record systems used by the public and private sectors are different.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bill to amend the Electronic Health Record Sharing System Ordinance will be tabled to the legislature for first reading on Wednesday.

    Low-altitude economy a new growth engine: CE

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Thursday said the low-altitude economy will be a new growth engine, with a trial programme on drone operations set to help such activities take off and "fly steadily and far".
 <br>
  <br>
  Under the Low-altitude Economy Regulatory Sandbox, pilot projects would be conducted to test airspace management, flight operations, and emergency response to support the use of unmanned aircraft. The initial phase, which involves 38 projects, is expected to begin next month.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The low-altitude economy not only brings about a number of industries, but also has very extensive application scenarios and huge potential," Lee said at the sandbox's launch ceremony.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In addition to improving urban management and business efficiency, it can also bring new experiences of smart living to the public and become a new growth engine for the economy."
  <br>
  <br>
  The sandbox serves as a safe testing ground and an incubator for technologies to develop an environment suitable for the SAR in developing the low-altitude economy, Lee added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Transport minister Mable Chan, for her part, said the first phase of the trial programme is expected to last for half a year and will test take-off and landing points of drones as well as their routes in places such as Cyberport and the Hong Kong Science Park.
  <br>
  <br>
  The trial of the sandbox projects would help the authorities to "accumulate experience and data" in devising "comprehensive infrastructure support for the execution of the various low-altitude economic activities", according to the minister.
  <br>
  <br>
  She also said the authorities are looking to introduce legislative amendments on regulating small unmanned aircraft to Legco in the second quarter of this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We would like to increase the existing weight limit, so as to facilitate heavier and more sophisticated drones to be flying," Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "On the other hand, we would also introduce a special provision enabling the Director-General of Civil Aviation to allow trials of even more sophisticated and heavier low-altitude equipment, so as to facilitate our trial of the state-of-the-art models, including those models which can carry passengers."

    Temporary e-permit to assist HKers on the mainland

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hongkongers who are travelling and living in mainland China can now apply for a temporary digital permit to travel by air and train within mainland cities if they lose, damage, or forget their permit.
 <br>
  <br>
  Under the policy announced by the National Immigration Administration (NIA) on Thursday, the temporary digital mainland travel permit will be valid for seven days after application.
  <br>
  <br>
  Residents can apply for the temporary permit via the NIA’s 12367 mobile app.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Under the new policy, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan residents who lose, damage, or forget to carry their travel permits can apply for a temporary electronic permit valid for seven days, allowing them to board flights and trains within mainland cities.” the NIA said in a statement via Xinhua News Agency.
  <br>
  <br>
  The NIA has also launched a verification service linking travel and residence permits. People can also access this service via the 12367 app.
  <br>
  <br>
  The linkage proof between the permits is for those who are trying to access finance or internet services on the mainland.
  <br>
  <br>
  The NIA said they will continue to improve relevant measures to provide "accurate and equally convenient" services for SAR residents.
  <br>
  <br>
  A Federation of Trade Unions lawmaker Kingsley Wong welcomed the NIA announcement, but pointed out the arrangement only allows travellers to use two modes of transport.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I hope temporary electronic permits can be used for immigration in the future," he told reporters at Legco.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If Hong Kong residents lose their permit on the mainland, I hope they can also apply for a temporary electronic permit, allowing them to return to the city, instead of wasting their time waiting at border control points."
  <br>
  <br>
  And Hong Kong's delegate to the National People's Congress Standing Committee Starry Lee said the arrangement helps facilitate travel between mainland cities.
  <br>
  <br>
  But she hopes central authorities could consider permanent electronic permits for Hong Kong residents in the long run.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This will make it more convenient for people with travel permits who reside and live on the mainland," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The numbers of a mainland travel permit and a mainland identity card are different, and sometimes it may be inconvenient and time costly to deal with different situations."

<div class="itemFullText">
 Medical sector lawmaker David Lam on Thursday welcomed the government's plans to amend the law to boost the development of its “eHealth” platform, but hoped authorities would be flexible when implementing any changes.
 <br>
  <br>
  The government-developed platform, launched in 2016, enables the sharing of electronic health records among healthcare providers in both the public and private sectors, while also letting people access their own records.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under proposed changes to the Electronic Health Record Sharing System Ordinance, the secretary for health will be empowered to require all healthcare providers to enter important data into their patients' eHealth accounts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Healthcare providers failing to meet such requirements could face a fixed fine of HK$1,500 and be prosecuted for a fine of up to HK$50,000.

  </a>
  , Lam said authorities should take into account the pressure that frontline medical workers face when considering what action to take if records weren't uploaded in a timely fashion.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There are still relatively elderly doctors who do not use computer systems, they are still using paper records. I think we have to assist these colleagues in changing to computer systems, or helping them in other ways, so that their records can be uploaded."

    Price adjustment can help those most in need: HA

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hospital Authority said it hopes an increase in the Accident and Emergency (A&E) service fee would ensure resources are reserved for those most in need.
 <br>
  <br>
  A&E services are heavily subsidised by taxpayers' money. The average cost per case stood at HK$2,070 in 2023-24, but each patient is only charged HK$180.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sticking to the current five-category triage system, the fee could be waived or reduced for the most critical patients, while less urgent ones - or those in categories four and five - may soon have to pay more, sources told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  A government review is under way and results could be announced as early as the end of this month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hospital Authority director Michael Wong, who works on quality and safety, insists a price adjustment can change people's habits when seeking medical attention.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In 2017, the price increased from HK$100 to HK$180. The next year, the accident and emergency department attendance has dropped five percent. This drop is mainly contributed by category four and five patients," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "From then on, we noted that the ratio of category four and five patients has remained lower than the previous year. It actually has some persistent effect on these patients seeking medical help. So we hope that in our coming fee adjustment, we'll have some persistent effects for our patients."
  <br>
  <br>
  Almost two million patients attended A&E services at the city's 18 public hospitals in 2024, with more than half of them deemed as semi-urgent or non-urgent.
  <br>
  <br>
  With manpower and resources stretched thin, the authority said around 77 percent of urgent patients were attended to within half an hour, lower than its service target of 90 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  By bumping up the service charge, the authority hoped patients with milder symptoms can seek alternative treatment options, such as general out-patient clinics.
  <br>
  <br>
  Non-urgent patients faced an average waiting time of 190 minutes last year, up from 129 minutes in 2015.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Wednesday said the King's Park site, currently home to Queen Elizabeth Hospital, will be retained for healthcare purposes despite a relocation plan.
 <br>
  <br>
  Most clinical inpatient services at Queen Elizabeth Hospital, including the accident and emergency department, will gradually move to the New Acute Hospital in Kai Tak starting early 2026.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Ambulatory Care Centre will remain at the current King's Park site.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, a government spokesman said officials have no plan to convert the site for purposes other than healthcare at this stage.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Given the convenient geographical location, it will be a feasible option to consider the expansion of the ambulatory care services at the King's Park site based on the demand of the population in Kowloon," the statement said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The spokesman added that health officials will consider the future use and development plan of the King's Park site when they review the Second Hospital Development Plan.

<img alt="Authorities say none of the penalised taxi drivers under the demerit system have racked up enough points to be disqualified. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796466_1_20250319184126.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Sixty-six taxi drivers have been slapped with demerit points for overcharging, refusing passengers and not taking the most direct route under a new penalty points system that was implemented around half a year ago.
 <br>
  <br>
  But none of them have racked up the 15 penalty points or more needed to be disqualified from working.
  <br>
  <br>
  The system – aimed at targeting taxi driver malpractice – came into effect on September 22 and covers 11 offences including overcharging and driving an indirect route. Penalty points are meted out to taxi drivers who commit any of the offences.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cabbies would also be ordered to take a driver improvement course if they get 10 points or more within two years.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Until March 9, 2025, 66 taxi drivers incurred points under the [taxi-driver-offence points] system," said transport chief Mable Chan in a written response to the Legislative Council on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The relevant offences committed include overcharging, refusing to accept a hire or driving to a destination other than by the most direct practicable route."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan revealed that five taxi drivers incurred three points, 12 received five points and 49 accumulated 10 points since the system came into effect.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So far, no taxi driver is liable to disqualification from driving a taxi due to incurrence of 15 or more points," Chan added.
  <br>
  <br>
  To further improve taxi services in Hong Kong, the minister said officials are looking to introduce the proposed legislative amendments in the second quarter of this year on requiring taxis to install in-vehicle cameras, dash cams and global navigation satellite systems.

    New law passed to protect infrastructure cybersecurity

<img alt="Chris Tang stressed the new law won't affect people's personal information or confidential business information." src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796453_1_20250319181710.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lawmakers on Wednesday passed a bill that aims to protect the cybersecurity of critical infrastructure in several sectors.
 <br>
  <br>
  The new law will cover facilities delivering "essential services" in banking, financial and healthcare services, information technology as well as communications and broadcasting.
  <br>
  <br>
  It will also apply to important equipment for the energy, land transport, air transport and maritime sectors.
  <br>
  <br>
  Operators of important socioeconomic facilities, such as major sports and performance venues and science parks, are also subject to the new legislation, which is due to come into effect at the start of next year.
  <br>
  <br>
  A new commissioner's office under the Security Bureau will be set up to monitor operators and follow up on non-compliance.
  <br>
  <br>
  The operators need to set up units protecting cybersecurity, regularly conduct drills and risk assessments, and report incidents within a designated time frame.
  <br>
  <br>
  Those who fail to fulfil their responsibilities are subject to a fine of up to HK$5 million if convicted after trial, and a daily penalty of up to HK$100,000 if the lapses continue.
  <br>
  <br>
  Security chief Chris Tang sought to reassure the public that the law won't affect people's personal information or confidential business information.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said it is there to protect infrastructure that are essential for people to live their normal, everyday life.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Regulated operators are those that are necessary for the continuous delivery of essential services or maintaining important societal and economic activities in Hong Kong," Tang told lawmakers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They are mostly large organisations and small and medium enterprises, and the general public will not be regulated or affected."
  <br>
  <br>
  Commerce-sector lawmaker Martin Liao said the bill should be regarded as an indispensable part of local laws.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Cybersecurity is a key part of national security. For our national security, this bill is crucial," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Keeping the computer systems of critical infrastructure safe will strengthen Hong Kong's resilience and safety, and that will enhance our international image."
  <br>
  <br>
  The chairwoman of the bill's committee, Election Committee sector councillor Carmen Kan, said the frequent number of cybersecurity issues in recent years show the law's necessity.

    Shau Kei Wan community living room opens

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Authorities on Wednesday launched its first community living room on Hong Kong Island, with the Shau Kei Wan facility expected to serve households from more than 300 subdivided flats.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chief Secretary Eric Chan said the new space – the fifth such facility in the territory – is fully equipped with amenities such as a kitchen and massage chairs. He also pointed out that social workers will provide homework assistance there.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officiating at the opening ceremony, Chan expressed the hope that families would visit the community living room regularly.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I hope this additional living space can become a second home for our friends living in subdivided flats, transforming their homes into just bedrooms," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Through spending their daily lives here, I believe it will greatly help both their living needs and emotional well-being."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said the 2,700-square-foot area is expected to serve 330 subdivided unit tenants and attract around 50,000 visits a year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The new space along with the four existing community living rooms, will support more than 2,000 subdivided flat households and handle 320,000 visits annually.
  <br>
  <br>
  The chief secretary added that the success of community living rooms is based on cooperation between the government, the business sector and non-profit organisations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters after the ceremony, Chan revealed that another community living room will open next month on Ko Shan Road, with three more being planned in Prince Edward, Sham Shui Po, and Kowloon City.
  <br>
  <br>
  The chief secretary also said officials will report the consultation results on the proposed regulatory regime for Basic Housing Units to the Legislative Council at the end of this month. They hope to table the bill by the middle of the year and pass it within 2025.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sources say authorities plan to require those who want to register for Basic Housing Units to avoid signing new leases for a specified period until their flats are renovated and certified.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan brushed aside questions on whether the move would leave some subdivided flat tenants homeless, saying that the government aims to provide a suitable living environment for residents.

    Ocean Park swings back into full action

<img alt="Some visitors are disappointed with the temporary suspension of cable car services and upper section facilities. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796433_1_20250319164747.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ocean Park said on Wednesday cable car services and facilities in its upper section resumed operations at about 4 pm after they had to be closed down for more than half a day.
 <br>
  <br>
  Earlier, the park said the cable car services had been suspended due to signalling problems.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said there were no transport services between the upper and lower sections as the Ocean Express was undergoing an annual inspection.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the park announced in a statement later in the day that all services resumed at 4.15 pm and called for understanding from visitors.
  <br>
  <br>
  A tourist from Guangzhou who said he had high expectations of Ocean Park was a bit disappointed by the closure.
  <br>
  <br>
  He told RTHK he decided to go elsewhere due to the suspension of cable car services and upper park facilities.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We wanted to go in. But staff told us many facilities are closed. There are no cable cars, and some rollercoaster rides are suspended. We will go to another attraction, the Peak," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another visitor said he and his family decided to enter the park because it was his son's birthday, and he hopes there will be compensation for visitors.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's his birthday and I don't want him to be disappointed. We're just unlucky. We hope Ocean Park will provide us with cash coupons, maybe worth about HK$100, because we cannot enjoy some of the facilities," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the Electrical and Mechanical Services Department has asked Ocean Park to submit a report on the incident.
  <br>
  <br>
  The department said it sent staff to the scene after receiving a report from the park at about 12.30pm.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said the park found problems with the cable car's rollers during a routine check, which led to the service shutdown.

    More local companies planning to hire than cut staff

<img alt="Lancy Chui says that while the local healthcare industry showed the strongest hiring demand, the logistics sector could face a challenging hiring outlook due to global trade frictions. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796421_1_20250319154853.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An employment survey has found that about 30 percent of Hong Kong companies are planning to hire more staff in the coming three months, while about 20 percent of them are expected to have personnel cuts.
 <br>
  <br>
  The survey, conducted by global employment agency ManpowerGroup, took in 525 local employers among the 39,449 surveyed globally in 42 countries and regions.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also showed that half of the surveyed local firms do not have plans to change their total employee numbers, but notable was a gauge measuring Hong Kong's hiring outlook that was significantly lower than that of the global average.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Net Employment Outlook (NEO) for the SAR stood at plus 11 percent for the coming quarter, up 0.5 percent from the previous quarter but notably lower compared with the plus 25 percent seen for the global job market.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking in an interview with RTHK, Lancy Chui, ManpowerGroup Greater China's senior vice president, said the local healthcare and life science industries have shown the strongest hiring demand, with its NEO index standing at plus 31 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The outstanding performance was mainly driven by government-led healthcare reforms and [increased] public health awareness. Smart medical technologies are [also] driving the industry's transformation, creating strong demand for biotechnology researchers, health management specialists and medical technology professionals," she told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  The human resources veteran also noted that the information and technology (I&T) sector also showed strong interest in hiring, with the industry's NEO gauge standing at plus 27 percent, boosted by rapid developments in the artificial intelligence technology.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our global data shows that 48 percent of employers are already using AI tools and another 21 of them are planning to adopt them in the next 12 months. These technologies not only enhance efficiency and productivity but also create a sharp rise in demand for AI professionals, especially data scientists and cyber security experts," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, Chui warned about the increased challenges facing the logistics industry, as the NEO gauge for the sector stood at minus 25 percent, caused by the global trade frictions and US tariff hikes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Looking ahead, the firm noted that local firms are "cautiously optimistic" about their salary offerings amid expectations that pay rises for staff will only be around three percent for this year, 0.3 percentage points lower compared with last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  While professionals in the tech and healthcare sectors could get a handsome pay rise, the construction, retail, and catering sectors could face a slower wage growth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Workers who switch jobs could get a pay rise between 10 to 15 percent, but about one fifth of surveyed employers noted they might consider pay freezes or pay cuts.
  <br>
  <br>
  The city's jobless rate, meanwhile, is expected to stay in a range of about 3.1 to 3.3 percent, Chui added.

    Snooker tournament slips spur Rugby Sevens resolve

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Sports chief Rosanna Law said on Wednesday that parties involved in the Hong Kong Rugby Sevens tournament to be held later this month have to liaise and communicate closely for the Kai Tak event to be considered a success.
 <br>
  <br>
  The annual extravaganza is moving to the Kai Tak Sports Park for the first time, having been held at the Hong Kong Stadium for decades.
  <br>
  <br>
  Law's reassurance came after lawmakers in a Legislative Council meeting asked why officials, the sports park and organisers of a snooker tournament earlier this month had come up with different versions about wrong information given out to people at the event.
  <br>
  <br>
  Paul Tse cited incidents where spectators were told they had to leave before midnight and a sign wrongly showed that there was a "curfew" in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  Describing the tournament as "a Cinderella event," Tse said it's important for authorities to clean up their act at the Sevens for a better fan experience.
  <br>
  <br>
  For his part, Roundtable lawmaker Michael Tien expressed concern over whether the government could get the sports park to have a designated spokesperson in time for the Sevens, which will kick off in less than 10 days.
  <br>
  <br>
  In response, Law said the park is actively looking into this and that officials are paying close attention in a bid to minimise the risks of problems popping up.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The organisers and government departments will have to work hand in hand. This is no exception. On top of that, this is a new venue. We need enhanced communications," she told the lawmakers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The sports commissioner, permanent secretaries and I myself are all involved. We have been in close communication with the operator. We want the Rugby Sevens to be a successful event."
  <br>
  <br>
  The sports minister also responded to lawmaker Yang Wing-kit's concern over transportation measures for spectators when events end late or overrun, saying arrangements will be in place to tackle these scenarios.
  <br>
  <br>
  A catering association had earlier complained that it was unable to host a bar culture festival in Kai Tak during the tournament, saying it didn't have enough time to obtain licences.
  <br>
  <br>
  Law said the administration is willing to streamline procedures and offer as much help to different parties as possible when it comes to hosting mega events.
  <br>
  <br>
  She stressed the authorities never received a formal application, and that she personally checked and found that had the association applied, there would have been enough time for a licence to be approved.

 Polytechnic University (PolyU) on Wednesday said it will shoulder the cost of developing Hong Kong's third medical school when necessary.
 <br>
  <br>
  The publicly-funded university in Hung Hom is among three candidates that have submitted proposals to the government.
  <br>
  <br>
  The planned medical school, along with a teaching and research hospital, is expected to be located in the Northern Metropolis.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lam Tai-fai, the university's council chairman, said in a press conference that PolyU could shoulder all expenses of the new medical school before it opens in the new development area.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will go hand in hand with the government to develop this third medical school... Regarding the detailed figure, we will let everybody know once it's ready," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  President Teng Jin-guang noted PolyU has been offering a number of healthcare programmes in almost half of a century that produced more than 50,000 graduates, which he described as a key strength of the university.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added artificial intelligence will feature prominently.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The future medical service will rely heavily on AI-powered devices and systems," he said. "The design of the new medical school, particularly its pedagogy, will make full use of AI, so students will be able to pursue their studies more independently."
  <br>
  <br>
  The university has pulled in a number of outside advisors to help with its bid, including leading Chinese infectious disease expert Zhong Nanshan, former health chief York Chow and Nobel laureate Barry Marshall.
  <br>
  <br>
  Baptist University and the University of Science and Technology have also expressed their interest in running the city's third medical school.
  <br>
  <br>
  Interviews with the three universities are planned for the second quarter, with the evaluation process expected to conclude within the year.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Eleven people including the driver were injured when a bus hit an exit ramp road divider on Tolo Highway on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Police received a report around noon that a KMB bus heading towards Sheung Shui hit the divider in Tai Po.
  <br>
  <br>
  An officer said the driver sustained injuries in the leg and was sent to North District Hospital in a semi-conscious state, while 10 passengers also sustained injuries.
  <br>
  <br>
  KMB said the driver was scheduled for a rest day on Tuesday, adding that the company will assist the police with the investigation.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Transport Department said it will review and follow up on the findings by the bus company.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Motor Transport Workers General Union Kowloon Bus Branch alleged that the driver was overworked because of poor scheduling by KMB, adding that many other bus drivers have had similar complaints.
  <br>
  <br>
  The union will meet with KMB's management on Thursday to discuss these problems and ask for better working conditions.

    Govt moves to boost healthcare data sharing

<img alt="The government hopes healthcare providers will proactively upload their patients' records onto the " src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796401_2_20250319135402.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government said it plans to amend the law to help boost the development of its one-stop “eHealth” platform.
 <br>
  <br>
  The government-developed platform, launched in 2016, enables the sharing of electronic health records among healthcare providers in both the public and private sectors, while also letting people access their own records.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the Health Bureau said almost all data in the system currently comes from the public sector, and some private healthcare providers struggle to link their internal system with the eHealth system. Officials also said some private clinics believe patients' records are their personal assets, and are reluctant to share their data.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under proposed changes to the Electronic Health Record Sharing System Ordinance, the secretary for health will be empowered to require all healthcare providers to enter important data into their patients' eHealth accounts.
  <br>
  <br>
  These include prescription, diagnosis, allergies and adverse drug reactions, immunisation records, as well as laboratory and radiology reports.
  <br>
  <br>
  Healthcare providers failing to meet such requirements could face a fixed fine of HK$1,500 and be prosecuted for a fine of up to HK$50,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bureau also proposed simplifying the consent mechanism, so when individuals open an eHealth account, they automatically grant healthcare providers the right to upload their health records to the system.
  <br>
  <br>
  But to access the records, healthcare providers must still obtain a separate approval from the individuals.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bureau is also looking into allowing some recognised healthcare providers on the mainland to provide and receive data across the border.
  <br>
  <br>
  But these non-Hong Kong healthcare providers would only have temporary access, and must obtain explicit consent from their patients.
  <br>
  <br>
  The administration also hopes to expand access to eHealth to more healthcare professionals, including speech therapists and dietitians as well as those working in facilities managed by the government.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a closed-door media briefing, Deputy Secretary for Health Sam Hui explained that the government hopes to establish a proper legal framework through the amendment bill and that the changes won't take effect until the market is ready.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also said the government is working closely with healthcare groups and third-party service providers, to help with the integration of electronic systems.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bill will be gazetted on Friday and brought to the Legislative Council for a first reading next Wednesday.

    Two EMSD staff, supplier charged with fraud

<img alt="The trio are charged with conspiracy to defraud, and the ICAC said more charges could be laid against the trio. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796388_1_20250319122707.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The ICAC said on Wednesday two frontline staff from the Electrical and Mechanical Services Department and a supplier have been charged with conspiracy to defraud.
 <br>
  <br>
  The three are two EMSD works supervisors, Tsang Tak-keung, 57, and Yip Wai-ho, 51, and Cheung Chun-kit, 66, who is the sole operator of three suppliers, namely Leader Med Technology, Hi Quali Trading and Smartechnique Services.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tsang and Yip were responsible for contacting suppliers to get quotations for machinery parts and compiling internal quotation vetting documents for maintenance services to Queen Elizabeth Hospital and Yau Ma Tei Jockey Club Polyclinic.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Independent Commission Against Corruption said investigations revealed that Tsang allegedly accepted over 80 gifts worth a total of over HK$500,000 from Cheung, while Yip allegedly took more than 20 gifts worth about HK$800,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  The gifts included luxurious watches, handbags, jewelry, household appliances and digital products.
  <br>
  <br>
  In return, Tsang and Yip allegedly placed HK$13 million worth of purchase orders with the suppliers over a seven-year period from 2017 to 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  One of the cases took place between January 2020 and June 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tsang and Cheung are alleged to have conspired to get the EMSD to make payments to the three companies by falsely claiming they were the lowest bidders.
  <br>
  <br>
  That ended with the EMSD awarding around 180 purchase orders worth more than HK$8 million to Cheung’s companies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yip and Cheung are also alleged to have conspired in this case with defrauding the EMSD between January 2017 and last June in a similar manner, allowing Cheung’s companies to secure around 140 purchase orders worth about HK$5.6 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The trio had allegedly inflated the quantity and the price of the machinery parts in some of the purchase orders, while some other purchase orders were fabricated,” the ICAC said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The trio will appear in the West Kowloon Magistrates’ Courts this afternoon for mention.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ICAC said more charges could be laid against the trio.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Ocean Park said on Wednesday its cable car services were suspended due to signal issues, and facilities at its upper park were closed temporarily.
 <br>
  <br>
  With the Ocean Express already suspended from Monday to Friday this week due to annual maintenance, there was no transport service between the lower and upper parks.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Visitors can continue to enjoy park facilities at The Waterfront. We apologise for any inconvenience caused," Ocean Park wrote in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  To ensure visitor safety, the park said the cable car system will be thoroughly inspected before resuming.

    'Joint property management key for older buildings'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Secretary for Home and Youth Affairs said the joint property management scheme will help homeowners to better manage and maintain their assets.
 <br>
  <br>
  The one-year pilot scheme, which was unveiled in last year's Policy Address, will commence as soon as June in four districts: Yau Tsim Mong, Sham Shui Po, Kowloon City and Tsuen Wan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under the scheme, a number of companies will handle the property management for clusters of aged buildings, with the minimum requirement of two, so that the so-called "three nil buildings," which do not have owners' corporation, property management services or resident organisations, can enjoy basic services at affordable prices.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on RTHK's Overview Policy programme, Alice Mak pointed out that now's the right time to kick start the scheme.
  <br>
  <br>
  This is because the building management professional service scheme, which aims to allow "three-nil buildings" to set up owners' corporations with the help of NGOs, has been regularised and expanded to cover all districts in the SAR, she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mak pointed out that a property management firm will help homeowners tackle a lot of minor problems.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If there's an owners' corporation, and we look for a professional property management firm through the scheme to help with building management, and deal with minor issues to prevent delays and things getting worse, homeowners can save a lot of time and money," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, care teams will get 50 percent more funding in their next term of service.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mak noted that the government will review their service scope, as well as offer training to the members.
  <br>
  <br>
  But no matter how we train them, they cannot replace professional departments to offer services, she stressed.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Five primary school pupils who took part in an exchange tour on the mainland have fallen ill with gastroenteritis, adding to a string of similar cases in the past few weeks.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Centre for Health Protection said on Tuesday it was investigating the latest cluster involving pupils from SKH St Michael's Primary School in North Point.
  <br>
  <br>
  The five were part of a group of 70 students and teachers who visited Xi'an between March 11 and 14.
  <br>
  <br>
  Health authorities said one of the five developed symptoms of acute gastroenteritis such as vomiting on the last day of the tour. Four others sitting nearby the pupil who first fell ill began showing similar symptoms two days later.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two sought medical attention but none required hospitalisation, officials said, adding their symptoms matched that of a norovirus infection.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The centre's preliminary investigation results show that the cases are likely to be infected through person-to-person transmission or an environment contaminated by vomit," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  A number of secondary school pupils have come down with gastroenteritis after visiting the mainland on exchange tours, with the government forming a task force to look into the recent outbreak.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Education Bureau has reminded schools that have upcoming exchange tours to learn about the latest information on disease prevention and control, a spokesperson said.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to the bureau's website on national education activities, it has urged schools to "avoid providing higher-risk food such as raw and cold food, siu mei and shellfish seafood when organising student exchange activities [on] the mainland".
  <br>
  <br>
  It has also asked contactors of exchange programmes across the border who help to organise trips to stop supplying such dishes.

    'Funding cut won't affect non-local student tuition'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Education authorities on Tuesday stressed that plans to slash funding for universities does not translate to a rise in tuition fees for non-local students as a source of income.
 <br>
  <br>
  The government had announced plans to reduce public university funding by HK$2.8 billion over the next three academic years.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a Legislative Council panel meeting, education minister Christine Choi was asked if universities would raise fees for non-local students because of the cut.
  <br>
  <br>
  Choi said non-local students' tuition fee adjustments are not linked with the income of a university.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Even if we increase the funding for universities, they will not lower the tuition for non-local students, so when non-local students come to Hong Kong to study – regardless of the change in our funding for universities – the tuition level is decided based on the cost of individual programmes," Choi said.
  <br>
  <br>
  As part of funding changes to publicly-financed universities, the institutions need to return HK$4 billion from their General and Development Reserve Fund to the government in a one-off special arrangement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Universities would not be seriously affected with the move leaving them with around four months worth of reserves, Choi said.

 Hong Kong's jobless rate has increased slightly as authorities warned about the "uncertainties" caused by US trade protection measures going forward.
 <br>
  <br>
  Data released by the Census and Statistics Department on Tuesday showed that the city's unemployment rate increased  by 0.1 percentage point to 3.2 percent in the three-month period ending February.
  <br>
  <br>
  The underemployment rate, however, stood steady at 1.1 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another 1,600 people lost their jobs, taking the total to 111,700 in the December-February period, while the total number of those underemployed dropped by some 2,300 to stand at 40,700.
  <br>
  <br>
  The jobless rate rises were mostly seen in the food and beverages, transport, construction and professional and business service sectors, excluding cleaning.
  <br>
  <br>
  Commenting on the latest data, Secretary for Labour and Welfare Chris Sun noted there were "diverse movements" in terms of the jobless rates in various sectors but that the rates "generally stayed low."
  <br>
  <br>
  He cautioned that "the labour market should remain largely stable in the near term amidst continued economic expansion, though some businesses would be affected by the uncertainties stemming from US trade protection measure."
  <br>
  <br>
  Sun's remarks came as the city's total employment number dropped by about 7,100 to more than 3.7 million, and total labour force decreased by about 5,400 to stand at 3.82 million last month.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Observatory on Tuesday said residents can expect hotter weather this year due to the continuing impact of climate change.
 <br>
  <br>
  It predicted that up to eight tropical cyclones will enter the city’s 500-kilometre warning radius from June or earlier.
  <br>
  <br>
  The forecaster also said Hong Kong will be affected by rainstorms and localised heavy rain, despite predicting annual rainfall to be within the normal range.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In general, the temperatures in Hong Kong are on a rising trend in the past few years. In fact, in the last year, we have the highest wind temperature in Hong Kong. And it's a result of urbanisation and also the effect of climate change," said observatory director Chan Pak-wai.
  <br>
  <br>
  Looking back at 2024, the observatory noted that it was the warmest year recorded globally, and that Hong Kong also recorded 11 months that were warmer than usual.
  <br>
  <br>
  The annual mean maximum and minimum temperatures were 27.3 and 22.8 degrees Celsius respectively, which were the highest and second highest on record.
  <br>
  <br>
  The forecaster also pointed out that sudden changes in the weather like on March 15, when it issued a hail warning and the first Amber rainstorm warning signal this year, are common in spring.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said people should take note of push notifications from the observatory's mobile app to get immediate weather updates.

    ERB to offer new courses to highly educated trainees

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Employees Retraining Board (ERB) on Tuesday said it will step up collaboration with tertiary institutions this year to provide advanced courses for people with a higher education level.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Chief Executive announced in his Policy Address last year plans to reform the ERB, and the board has since January expanded its service targets to include the entire local labour workforce, disregarding their education level.
  <br>
  <br>
  The board said since it expanded its coverage, about 4,000 people with a bachelor's or a higher-level degree have applied for ERB courses, making up about 12 percent of the total number of applications it received over the first two months of the year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Its chairman Yu Pang-chun said the ERB has been actively promoting skills-based training to help people acquire new skills.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[The ERB] strengthens its collaboration with tertiary institutions, broadens its network of training bodies to include institutions with extensive training experience, thereby supporting trainees with different educational attainments and background to pursue lifelong learning," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The board said it will work with the Hang Seng University, the University of Hong Kong's School of Professional and Continuing Education, and the Education University's Institute of Professional and Vocational Education and Lifelong Learning this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Its executive director Byron Ng said the advanced courses may include the application of artificial intelligence models in various industries.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With the expansion of our service targets, including the higher educated working population, more higher educated trainees can benefit from our courses, which include, of course, digital and technological courses," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The board also revealed it expects to provide about 165,000 training places in 2025-26, and that it will submit its long-term plan to the government in the fourth quarter.

    22 arrested over alleged mortgage referral bribes

<img alt="Grace Yee says she believes the case only involves a few bad apples at individual banks. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796247_1_20250318162219.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The ICAC on Tuesday said 22 people have been arrested on suspicion of accepting bribes and helping intermediaries defraud banks of mortgage referral fees.
 <br>
  <br>
  The case involved over 200 mortgage applications and more than HK$2 million in bribes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Those arrested, aged between 31 and 58, include 18 frontline staff from 10 local banks.
  <br>
  <br>
  In one of the cases, a married couple who worked at banks allegedly received HK$600,000 in bribes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Grace Yee, a principal investigator with the Independent Commission Against Corruption, explained how the fraud scheme worked.
  <br>
  <br>
  "During the investigation, the ICAC found that frontline bank staff had accepted bribes from intermediaries by secretly slipping referral forms into the mortgage loan documents that borrowers needed to sign," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This made it appear as if customers who were directly applying for mortgage loans had come through intermediary referrals, allowing the intermediaries to fraudulently obtain referral fees from the banks."
  <br>
  <br>
  However, Yee said she believes the case only involves a few bad apples at individual banks and that Hong Kong's banking sector as a whole remains clean.

    Vaping devices ban sought to stop space oil drug use

<div class="itemFullText">
 The chairman of the Hong Kong Council on Smoking and Health on Tuesday called on the government to ban the possession of e-cigarettes devices.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on an RTHK radio programme, Henry Tong said the situation with teenagers taking the space oil drug is worrying.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said teachers and parents find it hard to spot students taking the drug, which is usually inhaled through vaping devices.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tong noted that e-cigarettes make it easy to easy to hide abuse of the drug as, unlike with the distinctive smell of traditional cigarettes, the space oil drug offers different flavours such as fruit and chocolate.
  <br>
  <br>
  He emphasised that the government should proceed with all haste in implementing the ban.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Security Bureau said 300 people reportedly took the drug last year, with 75 percent of them aged below 21.
  <br>
  <br>
  There was a greater incidence of the cases in North district, Yuen Long and Tuen Mun.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ng Sing-chin, chairman of Tuen Mun District Secondary School Heads Association, said on the same show that the number of reported space oil cases in these places might be due to their higher number of students.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also said the participation rate for the "Healthy School Programme," an anti-drug education initiative that comes with voluntary drug testing, varies among districts.
  <br>
  <br>
  For instance, while more than 90 percent of the schools in Tai Po have already signed up for the scheme, only a few schools among the dozens in other districts have done so.
  <br>
  <br>
  He told RTHK there might be a reason why some schools decided not to join the programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think that maybe for schools, anti-drug education might not be a high priority. Because actually there were only a very low number of students taking drugs. It's a minority. Therefore, teachers' time and efforts might be on education," he said
  <br>
  <br>
  "In recent years, we care a lot about students' mental health and emotions, and they might focus more on these areas."
  <br>
  <br>
  Ng emphasised that rather than mainly relying on tests to tell if a student is on drug, the priority should be on teachers' observation and peer support.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Shares in Chinese EV giant BYD surged to a record high on Tuesday after it unveiled new battery technology it says can charge a vehicle in the same time it takes to fill up a petrol car.
 <br>
  <br>
  The company said the battery and charging system, called "Super e-Platform," boasted peak speeds of 1,000 kW, allowing cars to travel up to 470 kilometres after being plugged in for just five minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The new technology aims to "fundamentally solve users' charging anxiety," according to founder Wang Chuanfu.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our pursuit is to make the charging time of electric vehicles as short as the refuelling time of fuel vehicles," he said at the launch.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong-listed shares in BYD jumped more than six percent to hit a fresh peak at one point on Tuesday before paring some of the gains.
  <br>
  <br>
  The announcement positions BYD ahead of arch-rival Tesla, whose Superchargers currently offer charging speeds of 500 kW.
  <br>
  <br>
  BYD introduced the Super e-Platform alongside two new EV models that will be the first to feature the system: the Han L sedan and the Tang L SUV.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Shenzhen-based company also unveiled plans to build more than 4,000 ultra-fast charging stations nationwide to support the new technology.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ambitious expansion comes on the heels of remarkable growth, with February sales soaring 161 percent to more than 318,000 electric vehicles.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Tesla experienced a steep 49 percent sales decline in the Chinese market during the same period. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee announced on Tuesday that the Legislative Council general election will be held on December 7.
 <br>
  <br>
  He also said three months prior to the poll, a by-election would be held for the Election Committee tasked with nominating and electing 40 Legco members.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee noted that of the 967 elected members in the 1,500-strong committee, there are 90 vacancies and there's a need to fill them in a by-election set for September 7.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CE said electoral officials will provide more details later, such as the nomination periods.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I have directed the Constitutional and Mainland Affairs Bureau to prepare for the elections, and collaborate closely with the Electoral Affairs Commission," Lee said ahead of the weekly Executive Council meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the Constitutional and Mainland Affairs Bureau and the Electoral Affairs Commission will work on vote counting, data systems and security, among other tasks, to ensure everything goes smoothly.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Legco election will return 90 lawmakers for the eighth legislature since the SAR's establishment, and it's the second poll since the national legislature passed a decision to improve Hong Kong's electoral system four years ago.
