 RTHK has been granted free broadcasting rights for a documentary that explores the world of giant pandas and the nation's dedicated conservation efforts to protect these beloved creatures.
 <br>
  <br>
  As part of a forum at the Hong Kong International Film and TV Market (FILMART), RTHK received the rights for "The Panda Adventure" from Sichuan Radio and Television and Beijing Radio and Television Station.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The programme premiered in the mainland last December, garnering widespread attention," an RTHK spokesperson said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Professionally produced, the documentary features various locations across Giant Panda Bases and major areas of the Giant Panda National Park, showcasing the evolution and survival wisdom of giant pandas as well as the achievements of national conservation efforts."
  <br>
  <br>
  RTHK is set to show the documentary in April.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) is investigating a gastroenteritis cluster among secondary students who participated in an exchange tour to Xiamen last week.
 <br>
  <br>
  The latest cluster involves six secondary students who were part of a group of 36 teachers and students from a secondary school in the Kwun Tong district.
  <br>
  <br>
  The exchange tour took place between March 13 and 15, during which the six students started developing symptoms.
  <br>
  <br>
  Five of them sought medical attention in Xiamen, and none were hospitalised.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Preliminary epidemiological investigations revealed that all six affected persons had not consumed any common food items other than the group meals and had no other common exposure history in Hong Kong prior to their departure," the statement said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hence, at this stage, the CHP could not rule out the possibility that the cases were infected by consuming contaminated food."
  <br>
  <br>
  The CHP is investigating the source of the outbreak and has collected stool specimens for testing, while also coordinating with mainland health authorities regarding the implicated restaurants.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Education Bureau said it has instructed organising institutions to stop using the affected dining venues.
  <br>
  <br>
  It has also reminded all organisers to immediately request that restaurants serving group meals refrain from offering high-risk foods like raw foods as well as cooked shellfish.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bureau also said that that all participants of the tour have returned to Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, CHP said that three more students have developed gastroenteritis symptoms following an exchange tour to Shaoguan earlier this month, raising the total number of students and teachers affected to 55.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The government said on Monday it received three proposals for establishing the city’s third medical institution.
 <br>
  <br>
  The proposals were submitted by Baptist University, Polytechnic University and the University of Science and Technology.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, the government said that the Task Group on New Medical School will evaluate the proposals according to the devised parameters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Task Group earlier agreed to adopt a holistic and comprehensive approach for evaluating the proposals submitted by universities from various perspectives, in accordance with the 10 key parameters set (including innovative strategic positioning, curriculum structure and assessment methodologies, and financial sustainability)," the statement said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The expert advisors and other members of the Task Group will conduct an in-depth evaluation of the proposals in their respective areas of expertise."
  <br>
  <br>
  The group added that interviews with the three universities are planned for the second quarter of this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also said that the evaluation process is expected to conclude within the year, with a recommendation to the government on the proposal best suited to train medical professionals and support Hong Kong’s development as an international hub for medical training, research and innovation.

 Police said three people have been arrested for their alleged involvement in a murder case in Fo Tan on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Officers said a 52-year-old man was attacked by two men on Lai Wo Lane. He was later certified dead at the Prince of Wales Hospital.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police raided a residential building in Mong Kok on Monday afternoon looking for the two assailants, but no arrests were made.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters later in the day, superintendent Li Muk-yik said a 76-year-old man and his 47-year-old son were arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to commit murder.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police said the pair planned the attack.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Both of them have a triad background. Police believe that the victim had serious disputes with the two over money," Li said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police are also looking for a suspected lookout at the scene, who is believed to have fled to the mainland.
  <br>
  <br>
  His 28-year-old girlfriend was taken into custody for allegedly assisting offenders and misleading officers.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 One of Hong Kong's richest people, Henderson Land founder Lee Shau-kee, has died at the age of 97.
 <br>
  <br>
  The property firm announced that Lee passed away peacefully on Monday evening surrounded by his family.
  <br>
  <br>
  Born into a small merchant's family in Guangdong province in 1928, he moved to Hong Kong after the end of the Second World War as a youngster where he built his business empire and became one of the city's property tycoons.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee started his career in currency and gold trading.
  <br>
  <br>
  He became friends with prominent businessmen Kwok Tak-seng and Fung King-hey. Dubbed the "Three Musketeers", they founded Sun Hung Kai Properties in 1963.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee later left Sun Hung Kai Properties and founded Henderson Land in 1976.
  <br>
  <br>
  Henderson grew quickly to become one of Hong Kong's biggest developers, with a land bank currently totalling about 20 million square feet.
  <br>
  <br>
  His business empire also expanded beyond real estate, which includes Hong Kong and China Gas Company, or Towngas, and the Hong Kong Ferry Company.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee headed Henderson Land until 2019, when he handed over the reins to his sons Peter and Martin, as joint chairmen and managing directors.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to Forbes, the tycoon had a net worth of about US$30 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Affectionately known as "Uncle Four" for being the fourth child in his family, Lee was also renowned for his philanthropy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Through the Lee Shau Kee Foundation, he donated huge sums for scholarships as well as capital and education projects in Hong Kong and across China.
  <br>
  <br>
  One of his best-known mottos was "success isn't just about making money, but knowing how to spend."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chief Executive John Lee offered his condolences.
  <br>
  <br>
  He called Lee Shau-kee an outstanding business leader and entrepreneur who made significant contributions to Hong Kong's economic development, as well as its prosperity and stability.
  <br>
  <br>
  Henderson Land said announcements on funeral arrangements will be made later.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Triathletes from the SAR will try to book a spot in this year's National Games by competing in a selection race next month along Victoria Harbour.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Asia Triathlon Sprint Championships will take place on April 5 and 6.
  <br>
  <br>
  The race will start with a swim at the Central-Wan Chai Waterfront Promenade, followed by cycling around Lung Wo Road and the IFC, before ending the running portion at Tamar Park.
  <br>
  <br>
  This is the first time the SAR is hosting the Asia Championships and Mixed Relay Championships for adult athletes.
  <br>
  <br>
  SAR athlete Jason Ng said he hopes to take advantage of home turf to challenge a strong field of competitors.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think the Hong Kong team, as a generalisation, we have raced on this course for a handful of times now in the last of couple years, and I think we are beginning to know it quite well now, so I think just the experience on the course will give us a bit of an advantage," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other local athletes such as Oscar Coggins, Wong Tsz-to and Hilda Choi will be competing against international contenders from 13 Asian countries and regions.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Animal welfare groups on Monday held talks with MTR Corporation officials as the railway company looks into allowing pets on trains.
 <br>
  <br>
  Twenty groups under the Animal Welfare Advocacy Alliance, together with DAB lawmaker Edward Lau, made suggestions, such as a requirement for carrier bags for pets to be used.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other suggestions include allowing pets on board only during non-peak hours in the initial stage.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Most of them are concerned about odour issues. We also told the MTR officials to discuss and obtain advice from veterinarians and other professionals because they need to carry out investigations on the suitability of the ventilation system in Hong Kong," said Animal Rights And Welfare Association founder Susan Lai.
  <br>
  <br>
  "After all, the MTRC also needs to explore the need for stronger ventilation systems within the platforms," she said, citing the importance of balancing the rights of pets and their owners on the one hand and other commuters on the other.
  <br>
  <br>
  District councillor Corey Lau said regulations were also needed for pets and their owners using the trains.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There are some penalties we have suggested, not just fines but also the possibility of whether pet owners who do not follow regulations may be banned," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lau added that allowing pets on trains will be a milestone in turning Hong Kong into a pet-friendly city.
  <br>
  <br>
  In response, the railway company said it is committed to providing safe, reliable and comfortable railway services, and will consider and balance different factors.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said it will further communicate with various stakeholders.

 Police on Monday raided a building in Mong Kok, with sources saying the operation was linked to a murder case in Fo Tan the day before.

  A 52-year-old man was killed on Sunday after he was attacked by two knife-wielding men on Lai Wo Lane.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A think tank on Monday urged the government to give full play to undeveloped land along the planned elevated mass transit system in Kai Tak to connect the line "seamlessly" with buildings in the neighbourhood.
 <br>
  <br>
  Ryan Ip, vice-president and executive director of Our Hong Kong Foundation's public policy institute, also acknowledged it would be difficult to further reduce construction time, after the government said the system could be up and running three years earlier than expected.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I understand there are procedures on tendering, and there will be construction time... I think it is hard to push even ahead of 2031," Ip told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  The authorities recently revised their plan on building the 3.5-kilometre system between Kai Tak MTR Station and the Kai Tak Cruise Terminal, with a target for the route to be in service by 2031.
  <br>
  <br>
  Changes include adding one more stop and making it a six-station line, which Ip said provides an opportunity to improve the system's design.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There are two [plots of] commercial land that are still to be sold at that new station area, and I urge the government to take reference on what Singapore has done on its [Light Rail Transit] system to seamlessly connect or integrate the new stations with the commercial buildings nearby," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another revision put forward by officials was to keep the system at least 20 metres away from residential properties, instead of the 10 metres initially proposed.
  <br>
  <br>
  But according to Kowloon City District Councillor Jimmy Lam, privacy concerns still linger.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lam also urged authorities to look for ways to connect the Hong Kong Children's Hospital and the incoming New Acute Hospital with the proposed route.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said officials could take reference from the escalators and walkway system between Central and Mid-Levels.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Consumer Council on Monday warned that some makeup bases can affect hormone levels, and people who are pregnant or are breastfeeding should avoid such products.
 <br>
  <br>
  Among the 37 primers it reviewed, 17 of them that claimed to offer protection against ultraviolet rays contained potential endocrine disruptors.
  <br>
  <br>
  The watchdog pointed out that aside from pregnant women and those who are breastfeeding, adolescents and children should also avoid using these products.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[Potential endocrine disruptors] will affect your hormone levels, your sex hormones, maybe possibly it will impair your fertility," the council’s chief executive Gilly Wong said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And also for newborns, it may [cause] genital malformation; for the young adolescents, possibly premature puberty as well."
  <br>
  <br>
  The watchdog found that only products that protect users from the sun made by Guerlain, Hourglass, and MAC are free from potential endocrine disruptors.
  <br>
  <br>
  The council also noted that 15 products it examined contained BHT, a type of antioxidant that helps to improve product stability.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said the substance could potentially lead to skin and eye irritation, according to studies conducted on animals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, the watchdog called on the public to be aware of alcohol concentrations and fragrance allergens in cosmetics, as they could lead to dryness and irritation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Users should test products by applying them on the inner wrist, it added.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Innovation and technology secretary Sun Dong said on Monday Hong Kong's I&T development was so rapid that the sector is already "in the fast lane."
 <br>
  <br>
  He made the comment in Beijing at a press conference on Monday about the upcoming two-day World Internet Conference Asia-Pacific Summit to be held in Wan Chai starting on April 14.
  <br>
  <br>
  It will mark the first time the summit is held outside mainland China.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sun said the hosting of the summit in Hong Kong shows that the SAR is, apart from being a hub for finance, trading and aviation, also making the mark in becoming a centre for global IT cooperation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In fact, for the future innovation and technology industry, Hong Kong has entered the fast lane. We have clearly stated that there is a need to focus on several advantageous areas, and they're related to digital economy," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted that in Hong Kong's IT development policy blueprint, areas such as artificial intelligence, data and robots have been earmarked as focal points for development.
  <br>
  <br>
  For his part, the conference's secretary general, Ren Xianliang, says the summit will discuss topics such as the development of AI models, lower costs and technological innovation.
  <br>
  <br>
  He described the introduction of AI model DeepSeek in January as changing the world's understanding of AI, saying it has provided different professions with unprecedented development momentum and room for creativity.

    Experts weigh in on extending cryopreservation storage

<img alt="Extending the storage of embryos and gamets could raise new issues for patients according to some fertility doctors. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796041_1_20250317124547.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A specialist in obstetrics and gynaecology said it remains uncertain whether patients will return for tailored counselling after storing their embryos or gametes for a certain period of time.
 <br>
  <br>
  The government is looking to make it a requirement for licensed centres under its proposal to lift the storage period restriction for frozen eggs, sperm or embryos.
  <br>
  <br>
  In an interview broadcast on
  <a href="https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/news-programmes/this-episode.htm?cmsid=77" target="_blank">
   <u>
    <b>
     RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme
    </b>
   </u>
  </a>
  ,
  <br>
  Dr Alice Wong, a council member of the Hong Kong Society for Reproductive Medicine, pointed out that present freezing technique allows embryos and gametes to be stored longer than the current limit of a decade.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Theoretically, with our present freezing technique we can freeze the embryos and eggs for much longer than 10 years... of course the problem is whether it is feasible for the woman to bear the pregnancy 17 years after [she freezes her eggs] so there are still other limitations," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  With the changes possible in the future, Wong believes people will consider freezing the embryos or gametes at an earlier age to harvest eggs with higher quality.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said this means that patients can undergo fewer harvest and thus, save money from carrying out the procedure.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under the proposed amendments, the government is also planing to make it mandatory for centres to provide patients information such as the risks of egg retrieval.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong, who's also the Vice President of the Obstetrical and Gynaecological Society of Hong Kong, pointed out that centres have already been doing so.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A local education concern group on Monday welcomed the government's decision to form a task force to look into a recent gastroenteritis outbreak among students who went on a mainland study tour in Guangdong.
 <br>
  <br>
  Education minister Christine Choi said the task force would review the arrangements of such trips, and liaise with their mainland counterparts.

  </a>
  , Mervyn Cheung, who chairs the Hong Kong Education Policy Concern Organisation, said the task force was necessary to ensure future school trips did not encounter similar problems.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The task force is badly needed... because these kinds of exchanges or study tours for students are becoming more and more frequent and, at the same time, they are quite important in the curriculum for schools," Cheung said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cheung said the task force must look at existing regulations to see if they need to be changed or improved to ensure the health and safety of students on school trips.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They need to review all the guidelines that are set for these kinds of study tours. And especially in relation to the vigilant maintenance of hygiene and safety standards for students during the tours... whether or not the existing provisions have already safeguarded the hygienic standards and the safety standards of the travel agencies that have been hired... all this should come under very strict scrutiny."

    Healthcare co-payment levels 'should be capped'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A former senior Hospital Authority official has called for caution in setting co-payment levels for healthcare services after the government said it'll consider charging patients separately for certain check-ups.
 <br>
  <br>
  Luk Che-chung, a former chief executive of the authority's Hong Kong East Cluster, also said on Monday that the authorities should cap medical expenses paid by patients.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Some medical services do cost a lot, especially self-financed items that often involve new drugs. They are expensive. If patients need financial assistance... there'll be procedures to undergo and thresholds to meet," Luk told an RTHK programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If there is a capping mechanism in the future – not only on the number of check-ups but also medical fees – I believe it will be a good thing for the public."
  <br>
  <br>
  The administration has said it's reviewing fees and charges for public hospital services, including charging for such services as CT scans and MRIs to prevent abuse. But emergency and hospitalised patients would be exempted.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials said they were hoping to adjust hospital fees to a level where there would be a "reasonable co-payment."
  <br>
  <br>
  Alex Lam, chairman of Hong Kong Patients' Voices, expressed concerns that some people might not be able to cope if a co-payment were to be introduced.
  <br>
  <br>
  “For people who are not eligible for the Comprehensive Social Security Assistance scheme or are not qualified as a result of means tests, they would rather not pay the several hundred or thousand dollars out of their own pocket even if it means they won't receive such services. In the end, their condition may get worse," Lam told the same programme.

    Nap on beds before purchasing: consumer watchdog

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Consumer Council on Monday encouraged people to nap on mattresses – some of which were found to provide inadequate support – before making a purchase.
 <br>
  <br>
  The watchdog made the advice after testing double mattresses from 14 brands that make pocket spring, interlocking spring, and foam models.
  <br>
  <br>
  It found one was too hard and could not conform to a person’s back, and more than half of them were unable to support side-sleepers effectively.
  <br>
  <br>
  The council's chief executive Gilly Wong said taking a trial nap on mattresses at stores could help people make smarter purchases.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We highly recommend don't be shy. [Do] try out different mattresses to test out how you feel after you sleep on it. We recommend at least ten to 15 minutes. Frankly speaking, the longer the better," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So if the shop allows you to sleep longer, sleep as long as you could so that you can get a good sense according to your sleeping pattern, no matter it's back sleeping or side sleeping," she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The council also revealed that pocket spring mattresses offered more stability than interlocking spring models, allowing two people to rest with fewer disturbances.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Choose [mattresses] according to your own and partner’s body shape, sleeping habits and posture," the council's report said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The watchdog also noted that prices do not necessarily reflect the quality of the mattress, as they found a more than double price difference for two pocket spring models of the same rating.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the watchdog reminded consumers to pay attention to their mattresses' warranty terms, after finding over half of them were eligible for free maintenance for the first one or two years of purchase.
  <br>
  <br>
  It urged sellers to clearly explain any post-purchase costs and warranty registration procedures.

<div class="itemFullText">
 An NGO on Sunday said many parents are still unclear about an incoming law which makes it mandatory to report child abuse, adding that authorities should step up efforts to explain the legislation which comes into effect next year.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Chinese YMCA of Hong Kong polled over 2,500 parents from last July to November in a survey which found that two-thirds of them did not fully understand the Mandatory Reporting of Child Abuse Ordinance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Albert So, a lawyer who has been assisting the YMCA in holding activities regarding the legislation, said parents may not have had the chance to read up on the changes.
  <br>
  <br>
  “There are also lots of parents that are not local. They may be coming from the other jurisdictions, for example, some overseas ethnic minorities or people coming from mainland China,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Due to the cultural difference, [non-local parents] may not know about the situation of current legislation of Hong Kong," he said, adding more explanatory work, such as holding seminars and relevant activities, would improve the situation.
  <br>
  <br>
  The survey also revealed that almost 80 percent of the parents polled experienced mood swings when disciplining their children, and that about 30 percent of them believed a certain level of physical punishment could change their children’s behaviour.
  <br>
  <br>
  YMCA’s coordinating secretary Phoebe Sze says punishment has serious impacts on child development and should be discouraged.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We don't agree about using punishment to our children. It will harm their self-image in building their self-confidence, and may discourage their relationship with others. This would [also] discourage the children's exploration abilities.
  <br>
  <br>
  It called on parents to be more aware of their own emotions when taking care of their children and to seek help when needed.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's sole delegate to the country's top legislature on Sunday said all Chinese people should do their part to help the nation’s development, and business exchanges are only sustainable if it is a win-win situation.
 <br>
  <br>
  Starry Lee made the comment when asked on a TVB programme about Beijing officials reposting articles criticising CK Hutchison's sale of its Panama Canal ports – and dozens of other ports across the globe – to a US consortium.
  <br>
  <br>
  She added that businesspeople and Hong Kong residents have always been able to create win-win situations for all parties.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The best way to approach matters is to create win-win situations. Because no matter if you're talking about doing business or having an exchange with other people, it's only sustainable if it's win-win and benefits both parties," the member of the National People's Congress Standing Committee said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We think Hong Kong people are always flexible. We've always been able to grasp the idea of creating win-win situations."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee, a former chairwoman of the DAB party, also said the Northern Metropolis development has been too slow, and the Hong Kong government can speed things up by creating what she called "an SAR within an SAR".
  <br>
  <br>
  She said such a development mode has been adopted on the mainland where officials would cut red tape and adopt a different set of vetting procedures for projects.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Sunday said the success of mainland film Ne Zha 2 has inspired his administration to continue breaking barriers and forging its own path.
 <br>
  <br>
  Writing on his Facebook page after watching the highest-grossing film in national box office history, Lee said the movie showcased the rapid advancement of the nation's animation technology.
  <br>
  <br>
  Citing a line from the movie, "If there is no path ahead, I will make one", Lee drew parallels between Ne Zha's determination and Hong Kong's approach to tackling long-standing issues.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This mirrors Hong Kong's recent vigorous reforms, as we continue to resolve long-standing issues one after another," he wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Similarly, my team and I tackle each challenge fearlessly, demonstrating breakthrough thinking."
  <br>
  <br>
  The chief executive concluded by expressing optimism about the city's film industry, citing the success of recent local productions and expressed the hope they would reach more viewers outside Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  The sequel to the 2019 blockbuster Ne Zha premiered in Hong Kong last month, topping the local box office for several days.

    3,000 compete in inaugural Kai Tak Run

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 More than 3,000 runners took part in the inaugural Kai Tak Run at the Kai Tak Sports Ground on Sunday morning.
 <br>
  <br>
  Runners jogged past major facilities of the new sports ground, such as the Kai Tak Arena, with organisers saying participants were able to admire the design of the new venues and take in the nearby scenery.
  <br>
  <br>
  The event featured over eight races, including an elite, and open category.
  <br>
  <br>
  Matthew Yu, who competed at the event said he enjoyed the route. "It's very innovative, and it's something new."
  <br>
  <br>
  "We usually [race] through the streets during marathons, Tolo Harbour, or along cycling tracks in Tai Po. It's the first time for me to [race] in a large sports facility, and seeing the view from inside is a new experience for me," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Yu, who was competing in a wheelchair, also expressed the hope organisers could look into the possibility of allowing those in wheelchairs to compete alongside other groups.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think it would be better to allow us to participate alongside people in the other races, such as by having both groups start together. We could then enjoy the atmosphere together. I also think this would help promote disability inclusion," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yiu Hong-lai, the winner of the five-kilometre elite category race also said she enjoyed the race track.
  <br>
  <br>
  The runner said the route offered some challenges, such as slopes and U-turns, which tested runners' strength and ability to change directions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Also at the event was lawmaker Vincent Cheng. Speaking to reporters, Cheng expressed the hope that officials can promote the Kai Tak community ahead of international events.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Rugby Sevens is happening later this month. I hope organisers can provide more information to tourists on where to visit and the tourist spots nearby, so they could consume more [in Hong Kong]," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cheng also said the new sports ground can host more school sports competitions.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan said grooming local tech talent and attracting people in the field from outside Hong Kong are both important for the development of innovation and technology in the city.
 <br>
  <br>
  Writing on his weekly blog, he noted that local tech hubs have been offering thousands of jobs in recent weeks.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister said about 500 firms will host a job fair at Cyberport later this week offering more than two thousand jobs, more than half of them related to artificial intelligence.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last month, companies from the Science and Technology Park offered a thousand jobs in the industry.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan noted that in his budget last month, he asked more companies in the field to go to local schools to share their experience and inspire students.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister then said that the government's Hong Kong Investment Corporation will promote the development of AI technology, including hosting a forum on AI for global youth scientists.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It will promote the technical exchange of AI and its industrial development, including open source technology. Among them, the design and application of the Risc-V open source computer chip is an important part of strategic development going forward," Chan wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the firm will announce this week its partnership with a group focusing on Risc-V.

    'National Games test events show room for improvement'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The local official who heads the National Games Coordination Office on Sunday said test runs for cross-border sports events have shown there is room for improvement.
 <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong is set to co-host the November Games with Guangdong and Macau for the first time, and will host events for eight sports, including fencing and basketball.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeung Tak-keung told a radio programme that organisers are working to improve cross-border marathon and road cycling events, particularly in supporting athletes who lag behind the leading group.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We found that for some of the arrangements we can make further improvements, like how to support our athletes, and how to monitor [them]," he told reporters after the radio show.
  <br>
  <br>
  "During the road cycling and marathon [events], sometimes there may be a distance [between] the leading group and the other athletes – they may be not so close together. So how we can provide better support to them, that is one area that we think we can further improve."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Games will also feature 23 mass participation events, including bowling which will be hosted by the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  Local selections will take place in April and successful candidates can compete with bowlers from other Greater Bay Area cities in the finals in August.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeung added that officials are still working out the pricing for tickets but promised they will be affordable.

 Nobody was reported injured after three workers became trapped on a gondola platform in Tin Shui Wai on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The incident happened at the Tin Shui Estate as Hong Kong saw its first amber rainstorm warning of the year at around 3 pm.
  <br>
  <br>
  A video circulating online showed the platform swaying from side to side amid high wind gusts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Firefighters rescued the workers shortly after.

    HK$2 tweaks can save govt nearly HK$700 million a year

<img alt="Chris Sun says changes to the HK$2 scheme will make the beneficiaries choose cheaper transportation. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795864_1_20250315174901.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Labour and welfare minister Chris Sun on Saturday said changes to the HK$2 fare scheme could save the government about HK$680 million a year.
 <br>
  <br>
  As Financial Secretary Paul Chan announced in the budget last month, instead of a flat HK$2 fare, citizens aged 60 or above will have to pay 20 percent of any standard fare costing more than HK$10.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters after an event, Sun said the HK$680 million saving is “not a small amount,” and it accounts for more than 10 percent of the expenditure on the scheme.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sun also said the amended scheme would encourage the elderly to take short-haul buses instead of long-haul ones for short journeys, which will save the government even more money.
  <br>
  <br>
  “This nearly HK$700 million saving is based on the assumption that the travel habits and patterns of the beneficiaries remain unchanged. However, implementing the changes means they will choose cheaper transportation,” Sun said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the amended scheme would not lose its original purpose, while its financial sustainability would be enhanced.

    Deliveroo urged to spell out arrangements to consumers

<img alt="The consumer watchdog is calling on the delivery platform to inform its customers about the handling of their personal data. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795857_1_20250315160814.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Consumer Council has so far received 12 complaints involving around HK$5,000 in relation to the shutdown of the online food delivery platform, Deliveroo, in Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  It announced earlier that it will run until April 7, and part of its assets will be sold to rival Foodpanda.
  <br>
  <br>
  Consumer Council chief executive Gilly Wong pointed out that the biggest complaint involved about HK$600.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong said Deliveroo has to make it clear whether its subscribers are still entitled to a complimentary half-year membership at its rival, Foodpanda, if they have already subscribed to that platform.
  <br>
  <br>
  She also called on Deliveroo to inform its customers about the handling of their data.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If customers have a membership on both platforms, or they do not want to switch to another platform to enjoy their services, can they ask for a refund for the subscription that they've purchased?" Wong called on the platform to spell out the arrangement.
  <br>
  <br>
  She noted that members will have their subscriptions renewed automatically when the complimentary subscription ends, but said the platform should allow members to decide for themselves instead.
  <br>
  <br>
  She added that the watchdog is maintaining close contact with Foodpanda, which is taking over part of Deliveroo's business, and the council will offer more details later.

 Executive Councillor Lam Ching-choi sounded the alarm on youth mental health in Hong Kong on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at an event, Lam, who chairs the Advisory Committee on Mental Health, said previous studies by the committee had found that one-fourth of primary students and one-sixth of secondary and university students faced mental health challenges.
  <br>
  <br>
  He underscored that the issue must be addressed early in life.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The reason to allocate a lot of resources to youth work is simple, and it is evidence-based, that 90 percent of mental illnesses are developed before 21 years old,” Lam said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “If we do a good job in addressing the needs of young people, the psychological burden for adults can be relieved,” he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lam said it is important for the medical sector, teachers and social workers, to coordinate and provide mental support to students in school, as there were a lot of unsuccessful referrals to other institutions in the past.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also said people from all walks of life can take part in mental health training to help themselves and others, as people may face mental health issues in their lives.

    'Rugby Sevens tourists opting for HK Island hotels'

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Rugby Sevens, one of the city's most popular and highly anticipated events, will be hosted at a brand new location this year, but the retail and tourism sectors are still expecting a boost in spending.
 <br>
  <br>
  The three-day event kicks off on March 28 and will be staged at the newly opened Kai Tak Sports Park - after three decades of being held at the Hong Kong Stadium in Causeway Bay.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tourism sector lawmaker Perry Yiu told a Commercial Radio programme on Saturday that many tourists coming for the tournament have opted for hotels on Hong Kong Island despite the change in venue.
  <br>
  <br>
  He pointed out that it will take time for visitors to adjust to the new location.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Because they used to live in areas like Causeway Bay and they are used to the area, so they would continue to stay there," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They also know that transportation is convenient on Hong Kong island side, so maybe during the first year, they will adopt a wait-and-see approach."
  <br>
  <br>
  Yiu was also pleased to see that around 80 percent of the three-day tickets have been sold.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fellow lawmaker Peter Shiu from the retail sector believes Lan Kwai Fong in Central will remain a hotspot for revellers, on top of the new attractions in Kai Tak.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Timothy Chui, executive director of the Hong Kong Tourism Association, said the so-called "Hong Kong Super March", which features a series of world-class events such as LIV Golf, and the Coldplay concert next month, will attract long-haul visitors to the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the sector still lacks manpower, particularly coach drivers, he added.

 Hong Kong’s sole delegate to the nation’s top legislature, Starry Lee, on Saturday called on the government to continue to coordinate with other major cities around the world to further strengthen the SAR's position across fields.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters after an RTHK programme, Lee said Hong Kong should make use of its unique system and further strengthen international cooperation, citing it as one of the key takeaways from this year’s “Two Sessions” meetings.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee suggested the government to invite various sectors to deliberate over how to boost international cooperation.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Apart from economic ties with different cities, we have to think about, for example, other areas politically, or make use of culture, sport, education, technology, all these other areas we can further develop various ties with different cities around the world,” Lee said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on the radio programme, Lee said Hong Kong should expand its network with the Global South and Asean countries, aside from just looking at traditional markets in Europe and North America.

    'New private sector law must be rolled out gradually'

<img alt="Last week, legislators tabled the private economy promotion law, which is aimed at creating a fairer business environment. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795827_2_20250315105255.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An economist has said that the new law proposed by Beijing to protect and enhance the country's private sector could help address "grey areas" facing private business, but cautioned that it should be gradually rolled out to avoid stifling opportunities.
 <br>
  <br>
  Last week, the nation’s top legislators tabled the private economy promotion law, which is designed to ensure private firms receive clear legal protection and create a fairer business environment.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bill was first introduced to the public via a consultation last October, subsequently reviewed twice by national lawmakers since last December, and was signalled by the country's top legislature - the National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee - to be hammered out in parliament.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the bill was not passed at the annual session of the NPC, as lawmakers redrafted the bill to add more detailed measures.
  <br>
  <br>
  Analysts expect more tweaks to come.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Ever since President Xi Jinping met some leading tech entrepreneurs last month, it has become a pretty clear signal that the government is very keen on promoting the private sector," Dan Wang, a director at the Eurasia Group's China team, told RTHK's Trending China programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang said the new bill is necessary, but cautioned that it should be rolled out gradually.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Previously, there were too many grey areas, including violations of intellectual property rights and people taking advantage of a symmetry information, so the government wants to address that. But precisely because regulations were added very fast, it stifled opportunities that could have existed for private entities."
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang, who's a seasoned economist, noted that while measures from the new law, such as prohibiting local governments to exclude private firms when launching government tenders, could give a boost for small and medium-sized private enterprises, authorities must come up with new ways to provide financial assistance for them.
  <br>
  <br>
  "How they can provide affordable and accessible financing is a problem. And how those private businesses can compete with their SOE (state-owned enterprise) competitors in the market, that's also a difficult issue," she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, another distinctive measure that was proposed by Premier Li Qiang in his report to the NPC aimed to crackdown on the so-called "996" work culture and "neijuan" practices.
  <br>
  <br>
  The "996" work culture refers to the practice by some firms to illegally make employees work from 9am to 9pm, six days a week, while "neijuan" refers to a self-defeating cycle of competition where firms feel forced to compete with one another excessively.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang noted the intention and necessity of the policy, but has questions on how it can be implemented practically.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Actually, China was in this vicious circle that everybody was racing, competing with each other to see who can come up with the longest working hours and who can be more competitive within the company. But it's quite damaging to the morale of the whole labour force," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For a young, fresh graduate, they don't really have negotiating power in the labour market. They probably prefer to hold on to a job rather than negotiating the work life balance."
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang added that fresh policies from Beijing during the "Two Sessions" showed a more "pro-labour" approach as part efforts to stablise the country's private sector and job market.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) on Friday called on members of the public to exercise caution when travelling to the Middle East.
 <br>
  <br>
  The reminder came as the World Health Organisation reported four new cases of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in Saudi Arabia, involving chronically-ill men aged between 27 and 78.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two of the patients have passed away.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, the CHP said one of the infected patients has had indirect contact with dromedary camels and their raw milk.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The CHP also recommends travel agents organising tours to the Middle East to refrain from arranging for visitors to ride dromedary camels or to participate in any activities involving direct contact with dromedary camels, which are known risk factors for acquiring MERS-CoV," the statement read.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials also reminded people to maintain good personal hygiene.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A male visitor at Kwong Wah Hospital has been arrested for allegedly assaulting a nurse.
 <br>
  <br>
  The hospital revealed that the nurse's arm was injured in the incident that happened in a ward on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said other medical staff and security officers were alerted, and reported the case to the police.
  <br>
  <br>
  The nurse was sent to the Accident and Emergency Department for treatment, and has since been discharged.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The hospital is highly concerned about the incident, expressed sympathy and rendered necessary support to the nurse," a Hospital Authority statement read.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The hospital resolutely adopts a zero-tolerance attitude to any workplace violence and strongly condemns the violent act."

    Drop in pupil numbers 'structural and would worsen'

<img alt="Christine Choi says measures are needed to ensure the stable and sustainable development of the education sector. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795759_1_20250314180708.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Education minister Christine Choi said on Friday the government was left with little choice but to change rules on how local schools can continue to operate, as Hong Kong faces a dwindling pupil population.
 <br>
  <br>
  She described the drop in student numbers as a "structural" rather than a "transitional" issue, and that it would only exacerbate in the coming years.
  <br>
  <br>
  This week, the Education Bureau announced tighter restrictions on how schools can continue to receive government funding, which effectively increased the risk of them closing down if they don't enrol enough students.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under current policy, schools can operate a class on private money for a year, and resume receiving government funding once they can meet the minimum intake of 16 pupils.
  <br>
  <br>
  From September, such classes cannot revert to private funding again for six years.
  <br>
  <br>
  And schools that are allowed to go private must ensure their pupils complete their primary education using private funds.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the past few years, we have lowered the class formation requirement. But today, we think basically all possible methods, all adjustments have been exhausted," Choi told reporters after attending an event.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We must face this problem squarely. We need to implement measures for the education sector's stable and sustainable development in a timely manner."
  <br>
  <br>
  She noted that there had been fears more than 10 schools could face closure this year, but it turned out that only two were affected.
  <br>
  <br>
  The secretary for education also said early next month, officials will reach out to parents whose children are due to attend Price Memorial Catholic Primary School in Wong Tai Sin and Southern District's Aplichau Kaifong Primary School, two schools that won't receive government grants to operate primary one classes in the coming academic year.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said the two schools, which are left with the options of running the primary one class with private funds, merging with other schools or facing an eventual closure, have to decide the way forward themselves.
  <br>
  <br>
  Only pupils who applied for the spots under the discretionary scheme would be affected, Choi said, because no pupils had been sent there through central allocation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Choi said students going on mainland study tours are reminded not to consume cold dishes, after dozens of students and teachers on such tours from three schools were said to have contracted gastroenteritis.
  <br>
  <br>
  Health officials said they all went to eat at the same location in Shaoguan in Guangdong province, but the education chief stressed there's no evidence their illnesses had to do with food served during the tours.
  <br>
  <br>
  She added that to be on the safe side, operators of mainland study tours have stopped providing cold dishes.

<img alt="HKGCC chair Agnes Chan says that the AI-empowered tool will support small businesses to develop ESG audit without significant costs.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong businesses, specially small and medium-sized ones, are set to receive a boost to enhance their environmental, social and governance practices with the launch of a new AI tool to help them comply with rules.
 <br>
  <br>
  Green360 was launched by The Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce (HKGCC) on Friday, and it is an online learning platform aimed at helping small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to start and develop their environmental, social and governance (ESG) audit and reporting processes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a launch ceremony, Algernon Yau, Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development, said the platform represents a pivotal step in Hong Kong's push forward as part of its sustainability agenda.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The introduction of Green360 comes at a crucial time as we navigate the complexities of environmental challenges for sustainable practices that are urgently needed. This innovative platform not only aligns with the global movement towards a greener economy but also emphasizes Hong Kong's role as a leader in integrating advanced technology commercial development," Yau said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since January 25, all companies are required by the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing to disclose their direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions.
  <br>
  <br>
  The move also came as the government rolled out a road map in December to align its sustainability disclosure requirements with International Financial Reporting Standards – Sustainability Disclosure (ISSB) Standards by 2028.
  <br>
  <br>
  Echoing Yau, HKGCC chairwoman Agnes Chan noted that the tool, which is empowered by artificial intelligence technology, will help speed up the city's green transition.
  <br>
  <br>
  "AI is emerging as a crucial driver for integrating green and just transitions, digital platforms and data analytics pivotal in accelerating the de-carbonisation of both the economy and the capital markets," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Many companies are uncertain about where to begin or lack the resources to pursue such initiatives. So Green360 alleviates these concerns by helping them to identify areas for improvement and achieve accreditation without incurring significant costs," she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fillippo Addarri, senior advisor for the United Nations Development Programme and project lead for the European Union Social Impact Score, said at the same event that Hong Kong and the European members could cooperate over green finance following increased economic ties between Europe and China.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said that Chinese green investments in Europe, such as in the battery and electric vehicle fields, have seen a 50 percent increase year on year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And as a global financial hub, Hong Kong is poised to become a key partner of the European Union. Your advanced regulatory framework and culture of innovation sets your leadership in the driving seat," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Touching on the question of support from Beijing, Xin Bingxian, executive secretary of the World Development Foundation, said at the event that the move is in line with the direction signalled from the Two Sessions meetings this year that carbon reduction requirements are shifting from voluntary to mandatory.
  <br>
  <br>
  But she suggested the SAR government cooperate with mainland authorities to also align on ESG disclosure rules as there are notable differences in regulations.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Shares of CK Hutchison shed more than 6 percent on Friday, after the Beijing office in charge of Hong Kong affairs reposted a newspaper commentary slamming the firm's sale of its Panama Canal ports.
 <br>
  <br>
  Last week, the conglomerate controlled by tycoon Li Ka-shing agreed to sell its interests in a key Panama Canal port operator to a consortium led by US asset management firm BlackRock.
  <br>
  <br>
  The deal worth US$22.8 billion followed intense pressure from US President Donald Trump, who vowed to take back control of the canal, using force if necessary.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office shared on its website an opinion piece published by Ta Kung Pao on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The commentary noted reports suggesting BlackRock chief executive Larry Fink had a "close relationship" with Trump, and described the deal as an act of American hegemony.
  <br>
  <br>
  For CK Hutchison, "Critics say this is an act of kneeling down... and one which disregards national interests, betrays and sells out Chinese people," the article read.
  <br>
  <br>
  The commentary also told the company to think twice and decide "which position and side it wants to be on".
  <br>
  <br>
  The article was also shared by Beijing's liaison office in Hong Kong on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Andrew Leung, an independent China strategist, told RTHK that while he understood why Beijing was upset with the deal, CK Hutchison had to act with its business interests in mind.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[CK Hutchison] still has a great deal of businesses tied to mainland China and to Hong Kong. So I don't think that this is anything other than, if you like, a self-centered business strategy," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Beijing is fully aware of [CK Hutchison's] importance to Hong Kong. But on the other hand, it has to balance its national interests and perceived threats from the Trump administration - a hostile Trump administration bent on scuttling China's rise - and also send a signal to other businesses tied to China to be more aware of these national strategic priorities."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hang Seng Index, meanwhile, snapped a five-day losing streak, climbing more than 2 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The index had surged past 24,000 before giving up some of the gains.
  <br>
  <br>
  It ended 497 points or 2.1 percent higher at 23,959.

    Hospitals may start charging for CT and MRI scans

<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Health Lo Chung-mau said on Friday the government is reviewing fees and charges for public hospital services, including charging for such services as CT scans and MRIs to prevent abuse.
 <br>
  <br>
  However, he said that emergency and hospitalised patients would be exempted.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The demand for some complicated imaging services such as CT scans and MRIs keeps increasing, and prolongs the waiting time. We will consider having a co-payment on such services,” Lo said after a health services panel meeting in the Legislative Council.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We have to stress that these items are completely free now, as they are fully funded by the government, and that has led to an excessive use of services,” he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lo said the adjustment of fees and charges is needed to reduce waste in such areas as medication so that resources can be utilised accurately and directed towards helping patients whose conditions are more serious or who need more urgent treatment.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the government will take affordability into account when changing the fees and charges.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lo said the adjustment in public hospital fees is an important step in primary healthcare development, and people are encouraged to consult their family doctors instead when their symptoms are mild.

 Tourist arrivals hit 8.4 million in the first two months of the year, a seven percent increase year on year, the Hong Kong Tourism Board said on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  More than three-quarters of them – or 6.5 million – were from the mainland, an uptick of four percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arrivals from other short-haul markets also rose, with those from the Philippines, Indonesia, Japan and South Korea each surging more than 30 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Visitor numbers from long-haul markets grew as well, up 20 percent to 500,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arrivals from Australia, for example, saw a 34 percent increase.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong celebrated the start of the Year of the Snake on January 29, hosting a series of events such as the Lunar New Year parade and a fireworks display.

    Parents express concern over possible school closures

<div class="itemFullText">
 Some parents at a primary school that won't get public funding to operate first-year classes in the next academic year said on Friday they're shocked by the development.
 <br>
  <br>
  Price Memorial Catholic Primary School in Wong Tai Sin is one of two schools left with the options of running the primary one class with private funds, merging with other schools or facing an eventual closure.
  <br>
  <br>
  The other one is Southern's Aplichau Kaifong Primary School.
  <br>
  <br>
  Outside the Wong Tai Sin school, a mother said that all three of her children attend the school or had done so, and she's among parents who're concerned it may ultimately be forced to close.
  <br>
  <br>
  "My children and pupils like the school a lot, they like the teachers here," she said. "When our children learned of the news, they were like, 'oh why? I don't want this,'"
  <br>
  <br>
  "But we hope the school can continue and persist."
  <br>
  <br>
  School principal Maureen Ho said it notified parents of the news on Thursday night once the government announced the funding decision.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said it's early days still as to what will happen, but the school will discuss a way forward in an attempt to come up with the best arrangement for the pupils.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When we got the news we found it regrettable and weren't too happy. But it's a decision made by the Education Bureau so we have to respect that," Ho said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We care a lot about our pupils, so our management will discuss different plans with our council and sponsoring body, as well as education officials, to help them."
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho noted that the lack of pupils is a territory-wide issue, adding that the school particularly had trouble attracting new pupils because it is hard to get to.
  <br>
  <br>
  In recent years, schools that faced the same problem could go private for a year and, once they were able to meet the minimum class intake of more than 16 pupils, resume receiving government funding.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the government changed the rule this week, requiring schools to operate a class with private funds for six years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Education officials also said if schools take in less than 16 pupils again within that period, they won't be allowed to go private again.
  <br>
  <br>
  They said the change was made because the number of pupils projected to enter primary schools in the coming years is expected to drop by just over 11,000 to around 37,500 in 2031.

 People around the globe marked World Sleep Day on Friday, an annual event that serves as a reminder of the importance of sleep to one's well-being and health.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a pre-recorded interview broadcast on
  <a href="https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/news-programmes/this-episode.htm?cmsid=77" target="_blank">
   <u>
    <b>

    </b>
   </u>
  </a>
  , Julia Sun, a clinical psychologist at the Chinese University's Department of Psychiatry, said people should not underestimate the importance of a good night's sleep.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Sleep is really important and it is related to the physical and mental well-being. Physically, chronic sleep depravation will lead to reduced immune function and hormonal imbalance. And also we can see that when people sleep less, they tend to gain more weight. Sleep depravation is also linked to increased cardiovascular risk," Sun said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In terms of mental well-being, insomnia, or sleeping less, leads to increased irritability... it also leads to more mood swings and also difficulty in managing stress."
  <br>
  <br>
  Sun recommended that people get into a routine before bed, to ensure a good night's sleep.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think that regularity is important - try to have a regular sleep-wake schedule no matter in weekdays or weekends... try to limit the screen use before sleep, for example like 15 to 30 minutes before bedtime. And also you can dim your light before you go to sleep."

<img alt="DAB lawmaker Nixie Lam welcomed government proposals to extend the storage time for eggs, sperm and embryos in Hong Kong. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795688_1_20250314110717.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 DAB lawmaker Nixie Lam on Friday welcomed the government's initiative on lifting the storage period limitation for frozen eggs, sperm or embryos.
 <br>
  <br>
  The government on Thursday announced it would launch a public consultation on issue.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on
  <a href="https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/news-programmes/this-episode.htm?cmsid=77" target="_blank">
   <u>
    <b>
     RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme
    </b>
   </u>
  </a>
  , Lam said many people were starting families later in life which is why an adjustment to current regulations was needed.
  <br>
  <br>
  "More and more couples are getting married late and planning their families late... and if you look at some of the restrictions to current [regulations] we're having such as this 10-year period, it's pretty much outdated. We do need a full-on upgrade of a lot of the rules and regulations around this to ensure that it fits with current trends."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lam said easing restrictions on non-married couples or single people, allowing them to use their frozen embryos to start a family, would also help.
  <br>
  <br>
  "At the moment it might be a little bit tricky, but we do need to do more persuasive discussions in Hong Kong," Lam said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Medical sector lawmaker David Lam, speaking on an RTHK programme, said the proposed measure was helpful, but people also needed to understand that, if possible, it is better to start a family sooner rather than later.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We need to let people know that this option is not for everyone, it is a choice for those with a unique problem. It should not become an option for people to delay childbearing. We should have children as early as possible.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Lam added that pregnancy difficulties and health risks would increase as women get older which was another reason not to delay starting a family.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Two primary schools will not receive grants from the Education Bureau to operate primary one classes in the coming academic year, because they failed to enrol the minimum 16 pupils required to form a class.
 <br>
  <br>
  They are Price Memorial Catholic Primary School in Wong Tai Sin and Aplichau Kaifong Primary School in Southern District.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bureau sent a letter to all government and subsidised primary schools on Thursday regarding the approval of classes and manpower planning for the 2025-26 school year.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said if schools have any comments over the proposed class structure, they can submit feedback by March 27.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bureau noted schools that don't receive grants can still request to run primary one classes with private funds, merge with other schools or close altogether.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said such schools can join the Primary One allocation a year later with special approval from the bureau.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bureau added that no schools that faced bans on enrolling primary one students over the past six years are facing the same issue again.

    Civil service job cuts won't save much: Legco

<img alt="The Legislative Council Secretariat says civil service job cuts may not save much money. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795601_1_20250313190933.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government's plan to cut 10,000 civil service positions over two years may not translate into substantial manpower savings, according to a research brief released by the Legislative Council Secretariat on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  According to the report, the size of the civil service establishment exceeded the actual number of workers employed by 18,900 last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Coupled with a vacancy rate in civil service of around 10 percent right now, most of the 10,000 posts would not have been filled anyway, with or without the post deletion policy," the report read.
  <br>
  <br>
  Researchers also examined the civil service pay freeze for the upcoming fiscal year. They projected potential savings of HK$8.7 billion, assuming a 3 percent market wage increase.
  <br>
  <br>
  Comparing Hong Kong with other advanced economies in the Asia-Pacific region, the brief noted that civil servants made up 4.7 percent of the local workforce in 2023, higher than Singapore's 3.7 percent, and 4.2 percent for South Korea.
  <br>
  <br>
  The report also concluded the HK$2 fare concessionary scheme for the elderly remains competitive, even after putting a cap on the number of trips and changing the formula for long-haul journeys.
  <br>
  <br>
  It compared the measure to similar schemes in 12 other cities worldwide, and noted only London, Paris, Guangzhou and Singapore offer concessionary fares for commuters between 60 and 64.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the secretariat conceded the proposed tweaks will bring insignificant relief to public coffers, estimating savings of only HK$680 million each year.

<img alt="An expert has expressed doubts on whether the proposed amendments on cryopreservation can help lift Hong Kong's declining birth rate.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A population expert on Thursday welcomed the government's proposed amendments to lift the storage period limits for frozen gametes and embryos, saying it would be helpful for those who are infertile.
 <br>
  <br>
  Professor Paul Yip from the University of Hong Kong's Department of Social Work and Social Administration said the plan would ease concerns of people who have difficulty conceiving, but he expressed doubts over whether the plan will help lift the city's declining birth rate.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For those people who [have] gone through these exercises, we are not expecting to have a lot of people, and it is also quite expensive. So if we bet on…this measure [to] increase the total number of births substantially, I think it's a bit over-optimistic."
  <br>
  <br>
  He emphasised that the proposal is not a "panacea" to tackle the birth rate issue, and called on people who wish to have children to do so earlier.
  <br>
  <br>
  DAB lawmaker Nixie Lam pointed out that the proposal marks a pivotal moment in the city's approach to reproductive healthcare.
  <br>
  <br>
  She believes the move can help boost the success rate for in vitro fertilisation (IVF) treatments.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Currently, the pressure to use stored eggs within a decade often leads to a rush and costly treatment," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With an indefinite storage period, patients can take their time and potentially lead to a higher success rate and fewer IVF cycles needed."
  <br>
  <br>
  She added that the proposed amendments will allow people to conduct family planning on their own terms.

<div class="itemFullText">
 An upcoming exhibition dedicated to Spanish artist Pablo Picasso is set to bring a vibrant intercultural and intergenerational experience to Hong Kong as part of this year's French May Arts Festival.
 <br>
  <br>
  Titled "Picasso for Asia - A Conversation," the exhibition showcases over 60 of the maestro's masterpieces, alongside around 130 works from 30 Asian artists, including four from Hong Kong, who wish to pay tribute to or be linked with his legacy.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There are connections that are clear expressions of admiration or homage when certain painters, very preeminent painters from our part of the world, paint images of Picasso based on photographs. I think that's a clear and active homage," said Doryun Chong, artistic director and chief curator at M+ museum.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But then we can also have more indirect conversations that can be sometimes commentary, tongue-in-cheek commentary, but then it can also be a subtle critique because Picasso was from a different time, and then society and our understanding of art's role and gender dynamics have changed.
  <br>
  <br>
  "By putting the more recent artworks by contemporary Asian artists next to Picasso's, we can also see continued relevance as well as passage of time."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chong also said the exhibition marks the first major showcase of Picasso's masterpieces here in over a decade, so he hopes visitors will get to see the late artist in a new way, despite how much they know about his legacy.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's as much about revealing Picasso as putting a lot of questions around the myth surrounding Picasso. I really hope that our audiences will also see in new light art that is made more recently from our part of the world," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The kinds of art that they would feel more familiar with because they're from here, but by being next to Picasso, I hope that they will also see something new about modern and contemporary art from our part of the world."
  <br>
  <br>
  The exhibition will be open to the public at the M+ West Gallery from March 15 to July 13.

<img alt="The Council on Human Reproductive Technology is suggesting people be allowed to store gametes or embryos for as long as they want. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795575_2_20250313170514.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government launched on Thursday a consultation on lifting the storage period limitation for frozen eggs, sperm or embryos.
 <br>
  <br>
  Currently, people can store their gametes or embryos for up to 10 years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cancer patients or people who are infertile because of chemotherapy, radiotherapy, surgery or other medical treatments can have their gametes stored for 10 years or until they are 55 years old, whichever is longer, while the storage period for embryos is 10 years at the most.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Council on Human Reproductive Technology is proposing to amend the existing code of practice on reproductive technology and embryo research to allow them to arrange storage for as long as they want.
  <br>
  <br>
  The council said it "will amend the operational measures in the code accordingly to ensure that the public is fully aware of the associated medical risks before engaging in unnecessary and prolonged storage of gametes or embryos without medical reasons.”
  <br>
  <br>
  It also suggested that licensed centres must inform patients on the risks of egg-retrieval procedures, rapid decline in fertility or pregnancy rate associated with ageing of women, the risks of geriatric pregnancy, as well as the social impacts of delayed childbearing. Patients must sign a consent form of acknowledgement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The centres also have to provide counselling based on individual circumstances and seek written consent before extending the storage period.
  <br>
  <br>
  And they will need to provide statistical data to authorities for regulatory purposes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The council is seeking opinions from stakeholders, including licensed centres and organisations, on the proposed changes until April 13.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A driver, who was behind the wheel of a light goods vehicle travelling along the West Kowloon Highway on Thursday, died after crashing into a fire engine in Tai Kok Tsui.
 <br>
  <br>
  The fatal accident occurred at about 2pm, near Olympian City.
  <br>
  <br>
  The driver had initially been stuck in the van, which was severely damaged, before being brought to Kwong Wah Hospital, where he was pronounced dead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Videos circulating online showed that there was also a white dump truck near the site of the collision.
  <br>
  <br>
  Media reports said the dump truck had earlier crashed into safety barriers along the road after a bird hit the vehicle's windshield.
  <br>
  <br>
  They added the light van crashed into the fire engine which was responding to the dump truck driver's call for assistance.

<img alt="The Office of the Ombudsman says it has found long-term cases of illegal parking in some public estates. Photo courtesy of Information Services Department" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795562_1_20250313152553.jpg&q=60">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Office of the Ombudsman on Thursday urged the Housing Department to step up efforts to tackle illegal parking in public housing estates.
 <br>
  <br>
  The watchdog’s call to action comes after it inspected four estates that do not have vehicle gates installed at all entrances because of geographical constraints.
  <br>
  <br>
  These are Yau Oi Estate, Cheung Hong Estate, Lai Yiu Estate and Queen's Hill Estate.
  <br>
  <br>
  The watchdog said inspectors had found cases of long-term illegal parking in three of the estates apart from Yau Oi Estate, adding that some vehicles are even blocking emergency vehicle access in Lai Yiu Estate.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said the situation of illegal parking in Yau Oi Estate has improved after the department implemented enhancement measures, including the installation of an additional CCTV system, as well as the deployment of more patrols.
  <br>
  <br>
  “As the case of Yau Oi Estate has shown, strengthening enforcement is indeed conducive to alleviating illegal parking. Overall, we urge the Housing Department to improve its handling of parking violations, especially to step up combating illegal parking along emergency vehicular access to minimise potential safety hazards,” Ombudsman Jack Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The watchdog asked the department to step up enforcement against illegal parking blackspots, and to take immediate enforcement action against cars blocking emergency vehicle access.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also urged the department to set up key performance indicators for security service contractors, as well as to work more closely with the police.
  <br>
  <br>
  In response, the Housing Department said it accepts the Ombudsman's suggestions, and promised to improve existing measures.
  <br>
  <br>
  It added that it will work with other government departments to conduct joint operations to resolve the issue.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Nearly 70 percent of local university courses have seen their global rankings rise, compared to last year’s results.
 <br>
  <br>
  UK-based higher education analytics firm QS announced on Thursday that among them, six courses offered by two universities in the SAR have been listed in the global top 10 in their respective fields, two more compared with the results in 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among them is the University of Hong Kong’s dentistry course, which sits at the number-two spot when compared with its global peers.
  <br>
  <br>
  The university's education course, meanwhile, rose to number three globally, and its linguistics and geography courses ranked ninth and tenth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the Chinese University’s nursing course rose to number five on the global table, with its linguistics course coming in at number 10.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other than HKU and CUHK, seven courses from the Polytechnic University (PolyU) were ranked among the global top 30, while four courses from the City University (CityU) entered the global top 50 list.
  <br>
  <br>
  CityU's veterinary science, meanwhile, entered the global top 100 ranking for the first time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, QS highlighted that the city is one of the top higher education centres in the world for data science and artificial intelligence, as five universities that offer such subjects were ranked among the top 50.
  <br>
  <br>
  But it expressed concerns over the SAR’s decision to cut education funding.
  <br>
  <br>
  “This remarkable progress marks a strong resurgence, reaffirming Hong Kong’s position as a leading hub for academic excellence – though planned cuts to higher education funding raise concerns about the sector’s ability to maintain its current momentum and global competitiveness,” the firm said.
  <br>
  <br>
  It added that the survey this year is the largest in terms of scale, involving over 175,000 academics and over 100,000 employers, and covering over 18,300 subjects at over 1,700 universities in the world.

    Cancer devices donated by Li require clinical trials

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Health officials said medical devices donated by a tycoon for treating liver cancer are still under clinical trials and require careful evaluation before wider use in public healthcare.
 <br>
  <br>
  Last year, the Li Ka Shing Foundation announced it would donate histotripsy machines for liver cancer treatment to the Chinese University and University of Hong Kong (HKU), as well as the Hong Kong Sanatorium & Hospital.
  <br>
  <br>
  One of these devices will be relocated from HKU's medical school to Gleneagles Hospital to treat the private facility's patients.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a joint response, the Health Bureau, the Department of Health and the Hospital Authority said they expect data from the clinical trials to provide scientific evidence for broader applications in the future.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Clinical trials should be distinguished from clinical services. No clinical service may be provided when a clinical trial is still unfinished," officials wrote in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  When introducing new medical devices, the authority looks at safety and therapeutic effectiveness and the decisions are not influenced by whether treatments are provided or sponsored by manufacturers, officials said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The application in the public healthcare system of new drugs and medical devices, and methods for treatment that are still in the clinical trial phase without sufficient clinical data, should be handled in a very careful and prudent manner," they said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The donated devices have to be listed under the voluntary Medical Device Administrative Control System to ensure medical devices meet safety and quality requirements, officials added.
  <br>
  <br>
  In response to RTHK inquiries, HKU said 40 patients have been treated over the past six months with the device it has been given and that it is still in the research phase.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The chairman of the Hong Kong Society for Infectious Diseases on Thursday said it would "not be surprising" if some students might have already caught norovirus – which can cause gastroenteritis – before departing for an exchange trip on the mainland.
 <br>
  <br>
  More than 50 secondary students and teachers from three local schools who had eaten meals at the same restaurants on an exchange trip to Shaoguan, Guangdong, were reported to have contracted gastroenteritis on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on an RTHK radio show, Dr Wilson Lam revealed that norovirus activity has significantly increased globally compared to last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  He pointed out that the virus can be spread if there is vomit present.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For example, if there's a confined space in school buses or coaches, if a student vomited, it can absolutely cause students nearby to be infected," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Or by having contact with areas where the virus has landed can also result in indirect contact transmission."
  <br>
  <br>
  He also revealed that hand sanitisers are ineffective against norovirus, and advised the public to wash their hands with soap instead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong Subsidised Secondary Schools Council chairman Lee Yi-ying revealed to the same programme that travel agencies will not allow schools to postpone tours if they suspect there may be infectious diseases at the destination.
  <br>
  <br>
  But schools can talk to agencies about visiting different attractions or restaurants, she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee added that if a student feels unwell, teachers will take them to the doctor after they obtain their parents' consent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lawmaker Tang Fei told the same show that there are sufficient guidelines for schools to follow during study tours.
  <br>
  <br>
  For instance, at least one participating staff should have a first aid licence, he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Schools should activate the crisis management mechanism if they encounter similar cases, he added.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Education Bureau on Wednesday said it has ordered tour group service providers to stop using restaurants linked to the gastroenteritis cluster involving dozens of teachers and students.
 <br>
  <br>
  More than 50 students and teachers from three local secondary schools contracted gastroenteritis after dining at the same restaurants during an exchange trip to Shaoguan in Guangdong province.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the bureau said preliminary investigations by mainland authorities showed no proof that the infections were caused by the arranged meals during the tour.
  <br>
  <br>
  It added that the investigations revealed that the outbreak was likely spread through daily contact between tour members or exposure to vomit.
  <br>
  <br>
  As a precaution, the bureau said it has also ordered all restaurants serving mainland study tours to temporarily stop serving raw and cold food.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bureau stressed that it has strict rules for meal safety and restaurant hygiene, and has been working closely with mainland officials to make sure all safety measures are followed.

 Police on Wednesday said they arrested five people on suspicion of stealing more than HK$1 million worth of copper pipes across Hong Kong since January.
 <br>
  <br>
  The three men and two women arrested, aged between 51 and 97, allegedly stole a total of around 2.5 kilometres of copper pipes in 22 different cases between January and March.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officers said the suspects took the pipes from parks and back alleys and sold them for money. They were arrested at a recycling shop in Tai Kok Tsui on suspicion of theft and handling stolen goods on Tuesday night.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police called on recycling shop owners to watch out for suspicious sellers.

<img alt="The privacy watchdog says a total of 109,002 people may have been affected by a Companies Registry data leak in April. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795447_1_20250312193702.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The privacy watchdog said on Wednesday it completed an investigation on last April's Companies Registry data leak, which affected nearly 110,000 people.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data (PCPD) said there is insufficient evidence to show that the registry contravened Hong Kong’s data protection guidelines.
  <br>
  <br>
  It launched the probe after the registry discovered that people might be able to see extra personal details, such as ID card numbers, on its e-Search services if they tapped a certain key.
  <br>
  <br>
  In its report, the PCPD said the risk of “unauthorised or accidental access” to personal data of the affected people is “relatively low”, and that security measures were enhanced when the registry revamped its system.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The PCPD noted that the additional personal data involved was not directly displayed on the search result pages. Searchers needed to take additional steps or procedures through tools such as web developer tools or [a] robotic search to access the relevant data,” the watchdog said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Furthermore, there is also no evidence to suggest that any additional personal data had been subject to improper access,” it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The PCPD also noted that the registry had appointed an independent third party to review the relevant system.

    'Price hike for medication should be less than 10 pc'

<img alt="Ivan Lin hopes any price increment for 16 weeks worth of medication at public hospitals could be less than 10 percent, saying that would hurt members of the grassroots. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795440_1_20250312174458.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A community group on Wednesday welcomed the Hospital Authority’s new arrangement to cut the amount of medication distributed to patients.
 <br>
  <br>
  It also said any possible fee increase should be limited to 10 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Starting March 24, patients discharged from hospitals and those at specialist outpatient and general clinics will only get up to 24 weeks of medication each time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ivan Lin, a community organiser from the Society for Community Organisation (SoCO), noted that there are various reasons causing drug wastage.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said, for instance, the long gap between each consultation meant patients didn't have the opportunity to talk to medical professionals if they suffer from unexpected side effects.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hospital Authority also said it was reviewing the HK$15 charge for 16 weeks of medication.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lin hopes any increase would be below 10 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  “For grassroots patients, it’s very difficult to get a fee waiver,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “And also for, perhaps, lower middle class patients, it’s an ongoing expense, and some of the specific drugs are more expensive, way more than HK$15. So it’s still financial pressure for the lower middle class.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Lin suggested expanding the fee waiver to cover Old Age Living Allowance recipients aged 65 or above, rather than the current threshold of 75 or above, and to also include recipients of the Working Family Allowance Scheme.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lin also pointed out that the move to deliver medicine to patients' doorsteps since the service was implemented two years ago was "a good policy".
  <br>
  <br>
  But he said the delivery fee of HK$65 poses a burden for grassroots patients.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, medical sector lawmaker Dr David Lam has suggested the authority should set up a multidisciplinary team comprising of public hospital doctors and pharmacists from community pharmacies.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The pharmacist will give [the patients] a more detailed explanation on how to use the drugs," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And there should also be an opportunity for the patient to go back and see the pharmacist after taking the new medicine...[when they] can ask the pharmacist about some worries [they] might have after taking that medicine."

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong’s privacy watchdog said on Wednesday it launched a compliance check on Deliveroo to ensure the personal data of its customers and food couriers will not be leaked.
 <br>
  <br>
  The online food delivery firm on Monday announced it will quit the Hong Kong market, and sell some of its assets to rival foodpanda.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Privacy Commissioner’s Office said in a statement that Deliveroo’s closure may affect the personal data of its customers and riders.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The compliance check has been commenced to ensure that the personal data concerned would not be misused, leaked or fall into the hands of fraudsters for fraudulent activities,” it said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  It added it will assist relevant merchants, including foodpanda, in handling, deleting or transferring the personal data in compliance with data protection laws.

 Police on Wednesday said they arrested three men who are suspected of stealing electronic devices from a Hong Kong Disneyland warehouse, and handling stolen goods.
 <br>
  <br>
  Sources told RTHK the items included computer routers and TV remote controls stored in 18 boxes, and are worth about HK$3 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  RTHK understands that when officers went through surveillance footage, they found that a man had been to the warehouse earlier this month and he was driving a car registered under a warehouse staff member.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sources said police suspect that the electronic goods were taken away in several rounds, and later sold to a recycling company in Sham Shui Po.
  <br>
  <br>
  They also said the arrestees are aged between 23 and 28, and that two of them are connected to the recycling firm, while the remaining person works at the warehouse.
  <br>
  <br>
  In response, Hong Kong Disneyland said that none of the suspects are its employees, and it would fully cooperate with the police investigation.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The convenor of the Path of Democracy, Ronny Tong, on Wednesday said people are confident about the One Country, Two Systems principle, despite Hong Kong facing a deficit and geopolitical tensions.
 <br>
  <br>
  Tong made the remarks as his organisation unveiled the latest figures from its One Country, Two Systems Index – based on a local survey conducted by the Chinese University of Hong Kong, as well as data from international think tanks – which covered the last six months of 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  The index found that people generally have a positive view on the SAR’s governance model, with a score of 6.14 out of 10, a 0.5 percent drop from the previous round.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I think despite the rather negative news about the deficit, about a general economic situation, in particular the geopolitical situation, Hong Kong people are still rather confident that One Country, Two Systems would continue beyond 2047, and I think that itself is rather reassuring”, Tong said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I think the index speaks volumes about how they look at One Country, Two Systems, that although there is a slight decline, they still think the future is good.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The index also found that people’s sense of belonging to Hong Kong generally held steady.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nearly 84 percent of respondents said they have no plans to emigrate, slightly down from last round’s 84.1 percent.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Wednesday hinted that the city could double the funds raised for its initial public offering (IPO) market this year compared to that of last year, as optimism over the nation’s tech sector grows.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chan made the remarks in a speech, during which he noted that the SAR will ramp up efforts to woo leading firms to list here.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm pleased to report that our IPO market has regained momentum. Last year, we raised some US$11 billion, ranking fourth globally," he told participants.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This year, we are benefiting from optimism in the tech sector, and the continued support from the central authorities in encouraging leading mainland companies to list on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. We are expecting to raise some US$17 to $20 billion this year."
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, Chan noted that Hong Kong is on track to become a leading global technological and innovation centre.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said while the city's innovation and technology sectors are growing, the transition to become a leading tech hub will not be complete without the development of the Northern Metropolis, which will link the SAR with the "innovation powerhouse" that is the Greater Bay Area.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Shenzhen-Hong Kong-Guangzhou science and technology cluster has been ranked second globally in innovation by the World Intellectual Property Organization for each of the past five years," Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Northern Metropolis will support Hong Kong's synergistic development with our sister cities in the GBA. Bordering Shenzhen and spanning nearly one third of the total landmass of Hong Kong, it comprises a 300-hectare I&T cluster that will be home to many strategic tech enterprises," he added.

 The government is optimistic about the number of people who will stay under the Top Talent Pass Scheme, labour chief Chris Sun said on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  More than 90,000 people have been granted visas of up to three years under the scheme since its launch at the end of 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sun said the government is currently handling visa-renewal requests by more than 300 people who are here under the talent scheme.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that about 10,000 visas are going to expire by the middle of the year.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We will analyse the situation by then." Sun said. "We think things will be more accurate and provide a much clearer picture regarding the situation about the talent's visa renewal, jobs and contributions to Hong Kong. There will be more data. But even with such small number of renewals at the moment, we are still satisfied with how things are going,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The scheme allows successful applicants to stay in the SAR without proof of employment during their first visa granted under the talent scheme.
  <br>
  <br>
  For renewals, top talents also don't need to show a work contract, although they have to demonstrate their contributions to the city, such as by showing their income or other forms of economic benefits that their work brought.

 Cathay Pacific Airways on Wednesday reported marginal full-year profit growth as airfares fell amid intense competition at a time when Asia's airlines are continuing to get back to pre-pandemic seat capacity.
 <br>
  <br>
  The city’s flagship airline posted a one percent rise in its group net profit of HK$9.89 billion for the year ended December 31, supported by elevated cargo demand, more passengers, lower fuel prices and cost efficiencies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shares in the Hong Kong-listed airline jumped almost four percent to their highest since May 2019 just after the results were announced.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cathay Pacific's full-service airline, however, saw its annual yield, a proxy for airfares, fall 12 percent, while yields at the group's fully owned low-cost carrier HK Express fell 23 percent year on year.
  <br>
  <br>
  HK Express reported a full-year loss of HK$400 million compared to a profit of HK$433 million in 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cathay attributed the drops at HK Express to intense competition on regional routes pushing airfares down and industry-wide issues with the Pratt & Whitney engines that power its Airbus A320neo planes, which grounded some aircraft in 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A path to sustained profitability can be expected as [HK Express] continues to grow and increase its efficiencies," Cathay said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The airline's cargo yields, meanwhile, rose three percent year on year and the airline carried 11 percent more cargo tonnage, although Cathay warned that developing global trade conflicts could pose challenges to its freight business.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Given the global geopolitical situation, we are cautiously monitoring any short-term impacts on air cargo demand," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a press conference, Cathay's chief customer and commercial officer,  Lavinia Lau, noted that shifts in global trade policies, such as de minimis changes, have increased uncertainties over the cargo market.
  <br>
  <br>
  She pointed out that the airline has contingency plans to handle unexpected changes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have always built in flexibility in our business, meaning that if we see demand from a certain country or region having changes, we can always shift our network and flights to other parts of the world," she said. (Additional reporting by Reuters)

    'Measures to cut construction costs to come this year'

<div class="itemFullText">
 Development secretary Bernadette Linn said reviewing construction standards and centralising procurement of materials are among concrete measures that the government will take to lower costs.
 <br>
  <br>
  Her bureau had conducted research last year on why construction costs are high by comparing projects here with those in other major cities around the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on RTHK's Overview Policy programme on Wednesday, Linn said it's been quite some time since officials had taken a look at local construction standards, such as those on design and use of materials.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the past, our standards tended to be closer to those in the UK or the European Union. But  construction industries in many places in the world now have their own development," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We can take reference from more places, including the mainland of course, and the advantage of this is that we can then turn them into our own standards and possibly open up more markets and sources [of materials] for ourselves."
  <br>
  <br>
  Linn stressed that suppressing local wages is not a way to lower costs, describing it as a hot potato social issue.
  <br>
  <br>
  But she added that by this year, officials will start on the central procurement of certain construction materials, as well as cutting red tape for project approvals.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The government uses a similar bunch of construction materials for a project, or a series of projects, such as steel. So we can centralise the procurement and buy in bulk at cheaper prices," Linn said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As for streamlining the project approval process, we don't give empty promises, we'll look to come up with concrete measures to streamline the administrative process in the coming months."
  <br>
  <br>
  She said the time-saving move for administrative procedures comes after legal changes in 2023 to compress the statutory time needed for project approvals.
