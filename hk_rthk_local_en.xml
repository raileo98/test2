<div class="itemFullText">
 Cathay Pacific on Thursday said it was unlikely that meals provided by the carrier had caused food poisoning among passengers travelling on its Nepal-to-Hong Kong route.
 <br>
  <br>
  At least 25 passengers who took two separate Cathay flights from Kathmandu to the SAR earlier in the week had fallen ill, reporting symptoms like vomiting, nausea, abdominal pain and fever.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Centre for Health Protection noted that it has conducted a preliminary investigation on the first flight that arrived on Tuesday, saying the chicken sandwiches that many of the sick passengers ate before the journey might be to blame.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fifteen other passengers on the same route that arrived in the SAR early Thursday also reported similar symptoms, but it’s so far uncertain whether they too consumed chicken sandwiches before their flight.
  <br>
  <br>
  As a precautionary measure, the CHP said it has collected samples from Cathay’s in-flight meals for testing.
  <br>
  <br>
  The carrier, for its part, said it takes food safety and hygiene very seriously.
  <br>
  <br>
  "At this stage, it appears that the likely source of any food contamination was outside the airline's operation. However, should this not be the case we will report the incident transparently and will take all necessary corrective actions," a spokesperson said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cathay stressed it has reminded its crew members to observe general food safety guidelines and maintain good personal hygiene, and is advising passengers to do the same.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will continue to work closely with the relevant authorities throughout the investigation and provide necessary support to the affected passengers," the spokesperson added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The safety and well-being of our staff and passengers guide every decision we make. We sincerely apologise to the affected passengers for any inconvenience caused."

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Environmental Protection Department on Thursday announced changes to Hong Kong’s plastic waste collection system as a pilot scheme for housing estates ends soon.
 <br>
  <br>
  Under the pilot scheme rolled out in 2020, three contractors collected plastic from housing estates in Eastern, Kwun Tong and Sha Tin districts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials said there was an overlap of resources as GREEN@COMMUNITY operators gathered other types of recyclables from the same estates.
  <br>
  <br>
  From January 19, GREEN@COMMUNITY will handle plastic collection from housing estates across all 18 districts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Steve Wong, an assistant director with the department, said the new arrangement will reduce costs by 24 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We consider this is a situation of resource duplication and it is an opportunity to unify the arrangement to enhance the [scheme's] cost effectiveness," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The completion of the pilot scheme and taking over by GREEN@COMMUNITY station for the collection service will not only solve the resource duplication problem, but enhance the cost-effectiveness of the overall waste and recyclable collection services."
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong also brushed aside concerns from green groups that some low-value mixed plastic waste will be left unprocessed after the pilot scheme ends.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We understand that every plastic has its value. They can be turned into useful resources. Not only bottles, for example, plastic containers, they could be transformed into high-value eco-bricks or soundproofing facilities," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Regardless of the pilot scheme, or the future GREEN@COMMUNITY operation, every waste plastic is sought after and we will continue to enhance the plastic recycling rate."
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong added that residents will not be affected and can continue to use recycling bins at housing estates or GREEN@COMMUNITY stations as before.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Senior leadership at the West Kowloon arts hub on Thursday said they would retain some managing rights of its housing development when it is completed, vowing to incorporate arts and cultural elements into the residential project.
 <br>
  <br>
  The West Kowloon Cultural District Authority had proposed a residential project to build nearly 2,000 homes, which would sit on top of a three-storey podium for retail, food and beverages, and leisure facilities.
  <br>
  <br>
  Questions were raised during a Yau Tsim Mong District Council meeting on whether the housing development would weaken the district's cultural position, with the authority's deputy chief executive Wendy Gan saying it would oversee commercial facilities in the project.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The residential flats of this project will be sold to the public by the developer with a successful tender bid,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “But for the shopping mall, the plan right now is to be managed by the West Kowloon Cultural District Authority. With this, we could have a certain level of influence, while continuing to hold arts and culture events in the entire district.”
  <br>
  <br>
  On concerns about the proposed housing project affecting the price of property nearby, Gan said people should take into account the fact that the precinct has become a world-class cultural landmark.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Let’s say for a residence in Paris next to the Louvre, there's a discrepancy in value compared to a home [which is] not next to the Louvre... I hope we are comprehensive in considering something's value," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was also "too early” to give an estimate on the revenue generated from the proposed development with the residential project likely being put up for tender in more than a year's time, Gan added.

    Security and development both key: Xia Baolong

<div class="itemFullText">
 Beijing’s top official on Hong Kong affairs on Thursday stressed that safeguarding national security goes hand in hand with development as he laid out Beijing’s expectations for Hong Kong and Macau to make pragmatic contributions to the overall development of the Greater Bay Area.
 <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office director Xia Baolong was speaking in at a seminar in Beijing on the spirit of a key speech by President Xi Jinping in Macau last month to mark 25 years since its return to the motherland.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xia said both SARs need to be unwavering both in maintaining security and in focusing on development, and that Hong Kong and Macau need to fully demonstrate the benefits of the One country, two systems principle as they connect the country with the world, and “polish” their brands internationally.
  <br>
  <br>
  The director noted that the President had spoken about how the values of peace, inclusiveness and openness are all embodied in One country, two systems.
  <br>
  <br>
  He highlighted President Xi’s directive for the SARs to adopt the necessary changes to make greater contributions to the Greater Bay Area, adding that the president's expectations and hopes for Macau also apply to Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xia also stressed the need for unity under the banner of patriotism.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In implementing the One Country, Two Systems principle, not only do [the two SARs] need to promote the core value of patriotism and loving Hong Kong and Macau, they also need to seek common ground and allow for differences," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a response, Chief Executive John Lee said the SAR government would better integrate with the nation with a highly efficient market, and be steadfast in leading and promoting socio-economic development here.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a social media post, he added that his administration would maintain peace, stability and unity within society, while acting as a bridge between the nation and the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CE was among many who watched in the seminar via video-link in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  The event was organised by the think tank Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macau Studies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Its vice president, Tam Yiu-chung, added that Xia had expressed hopes that the business sector would continue to be proactive in taking part in the development of both the country and the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He thinks businesses have always been very supportive in the country's development. A high ratio of investments on the mainland came from Hong Kong companies," Tam said in Beijing.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So Director Xia expressed hope that going forward, Hong Kong's business sector continues to be proactive."
  <br>
  <br>
  A consultant for the think tank, Lau Siu-kai, quoted Xia as saying that Hong Kong needs to change its mindset and be more innovative on economic development.

    More tax concessions needed despite budget deficit: EY

<img alt="Paul Ho (left) says the estimated budget deficit would be around HK$98 billion for this financial year. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1786813_1_20250109165740.jpg&q=65">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Consulting firm EY on Thursday called on the government to roll out more tax concessions, although it expected the budget deficit would double.
 <br>
  <br>
  The firm estimated that Hong Kong’s budget deficit would be HK$98 billion, while accountancy firm PriceWaterhouseCoopers (PwC) forecast the gap at HK$95 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last month, government officials said the deficit would be near HK$100 billion, more than double the original estimate of HK$48 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  EY noted that governemnt revenue from land premiums and stamp duty fell short of expectations, despite the easing of property cooling measures last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the consultancy's financial services tax leader for Hong Kong, Paul Ho, said authorities should cut tax for real estate investors and commodity traders to boost the economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Providing those concessions will actually attract more businesses and investors and capital to Hong Kong," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Tax concessions or some kind of tax measures that could benefit and attract investors will actually overall help the growth of the Hong Kong economy."
  <br>
  <br>
  PwC also called for similar moves, suggesting the government reduce tax for research and development activities in the Greater Bay Area.

    Govt can reduce fiscal deficit through bonds: HKU

<img alt="The HKU Business School has released its latest green paper on Hong Kong's economic policy. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1786814_1_20250109165822.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A scholar from the University of Hong Kong's business school suggested the government issue bonds and spend its fiscal reserves, to reduce the nearly HK$100 billion deficit.
 <br>
  <br>
  Associate professor Liu Yang, along with other professors from the business school, released the “Hong Kong Economic Policy Green Paper 2025” on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liu felt the SAR cannot rely on a natural economic recovery to resolve its fiscal challenges, adding the government should fully utilise its fiscal reserves.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Fiscal deficit can be short-term and the debt can absorb it. So we don't have to right away next year get a fiscal surplus. Fiscal deficit can last and there's not a problem to have a few years of a fiscal deficit as long as we have a good average condition for the long term,” Liu said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “According to the government, they're going to try to solve the problem and get back to surplus by 2027, which I think is a very good agenda. And apart from that, I think the easiest way of paying the deficit is actually to run down the reserves. So you don't have to issue debt, but as long as you have reserves, you pay out directly and that's going to cover the deficit."
  <br>
  <br>
  Liu also said the government can raise funds by issuing bonds.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said there is room for the SAR government to raise its debt-to-GDP ratio from currently around 10 percent, to 20 or 30 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Reserve and debt, they are just two sides of the same coin. Suppose nothing happened and we issue lots of debt and we keep the money in our account, then that becomes our reserve. So you can let the reserve down and not issue in debt. That's one way to just basically to pay your deficit. You can also keep your reserve and issue some debt to directly pay your deficit. The actual question is how much reserve we want to have, how much is enough and how much debt we are comfortable with,” Liu said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The green paper also stressed the importance for Hong Kong to undergo an economic transformation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Associate dean Tang Heiwai said Hong Kong should find a new strategic role and strive to become a global supply chain management centre.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the SAR should not only act as a bridge to the West, it should also become a gateway between China and other emerging economies.

    HK acting as super-connector to Asean: HKTDC

<img alt="The HKTDC says companies in the GBA are looking to build up their supply chain resilience closer to home with Asean seen as a safe alternative for firms looking to secure supply chain resiliency. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1786806_1_20250109163605.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A joint research report published by the Hong Kong Trade Development Council (HKTDC) and United Overseas Bank found that the SAR has been successful in carving out a role as a super-connector between the Greater Bay Area (GBA) and countries within the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean).
 <br>
  <br>
  The study surveyed more than 600 GBA based companies over the last three months of 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  Irina Fan, the HKTDC's Director of Research, talked about how the trade development council could help Hong Kong deepen this role as a super-connector.
  <br>
  <br>
  "From here [the fairs held by HKTDC] all the executors, they are from the Greater Bay Area mostly, and then even from international market, be able to meet up and make the business deals with the target market in Asean and other markets in the region."
  <br>
  <br>
  The data also showed that more than 90 percent of manufacturing businesses in the GBA had either completed their supply chain transformation or were in the process of doing so, with a majority focused on boosting their supply chain resilience.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fan explained that Covid and natural disasters had exposed the fragility of supply chains when one country's production had stopped, showing the need for parallel or alternative supply chains.
  <br>
  <br>
  Moreover, to achieve sustainability, supply chains are being shortened and built around major markets that specifically serve regional markets.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fan also said that geopolitical reasons are one of the factors affecting the stability of such supply chains, adding it would likely continue to affect how investors choose where to invest in.
  <br>
  <br>
  Good relations between China and Asean was helping Hong Kong businesses tap into the Asean market.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to the survey, of the individual Asean markets, Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia were the preferred choices for current and future business activities.

    URA gets warning letter for data leak

<img alt="The Privacy Commissioner issued the Urban Renewal Authority a warning letter for a data breach last May. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1786773_1_20250109130529.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The privacy watchdog on Thursday said it had given the Urban Renewal Authority (URA) a warning letter for breaching data protection laws in May last year.
 <br>
  <br>
  It comes after the Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data (PCPD) completed its investigation into the incident and released its findings in a report on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to the PCPD, the phone numbers, names and addresses of nearly 200 people, affected by the redevelopment plan for Nga Tsin Wai and Carpenter roads in Kowloon City, were leaked and exposed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Privacy Commissioner Ada Chung said the leak covered the data of owners and tenants who registered for briefing sessions about the project and who filled out online registration forms stored on a cloud platform.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said her office's probe found the URA and its contractor had failed to update a piece of software, generating the forms, to its latest version, which would have offered stronger protection.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chung said the URA also did not have a thorough understanding of the software, and therefore she ruled the development body had violated a legal clause on the security of data.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Privacy Commissioner found that the URA had not taken all practicable steps to ensure that the personal data involved was protected against unauthorised or accidental access, processing, erasure, loss or use," she said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The commissioner also updated her office's guide on the use of online cloud services as they become more popular.
  <br>
  <br>
  These include encrypting the personal data stored on cloud, ensuring that only authorised persons can access the data, and ensuring that service providers delete or return the data held when the service contract is over.
  <br>
  <br>
  The URA said in response it would study the commissioner's report in detail, adding that it had implemented a series of measures to strengthen data protection.
  <br>
  <br>
  These include asking the contractor to give timely notifications on product updates, optimising the work flow on handling personal data and appointing a firm to conduct an information security audit.
  <br>
  <br>
  The authority added it would seek to minimise the chances of a repeat of similar incidents.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[The URA will] strive to establish a more robust privacy security framework and a corporate culture that values the protection of personal data," it said in a statement.

    'Obey law while investigating public housing misuse'

<div class="itemFullText">
 People who want to report illegal public housing use must gather information on their own and ensure their own safety as well as comply with the law, Secretary for Housing Winnie Ho said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Report Public Housing Abuse Award scheme kicks off on Wednesday and informants can get rewards of up to HK$3,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  The housing minister said authorities expect to receive 2,600 reports each year, with half of them having concrete evidence to back up their claims.
  <br>
  <br>
  She was also asked on an RTHK radio programme whether she supports people making audio or video recordings as part of their investigations.
  <br>
  <br>
  “In any event we have to ensure our own safety and follow the law, before we use our observations or other methods to get the information. A working group will follow up on the submitted information and see if such materials are useful. We have an assembly panel chaired by a directorate-ranked colleague, and government officials on the panel will make the final decision,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho stressed that existing Well-off Tenants Policies have been effective in tackling public housing abuse, as about 480,000 voluntary declarations were made since October 2023, with almost 6,000 tenants handing back their units.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I think overall we just want people to stay alert. We don’t [want to] solely rely on the reward scheme [to tackle public housing misuse]. But we hope people understand public housing is a public resource. Many are on the wait list,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Ho also disagreed the informant scheme would be a detriment to neighbourly relations, saying those who use public housing inappropriately, like subletting their units, should bear the responsibility for any disharmony.
  <br>
  <br>
  She added that people have to provide their real name when reporting cases and be interviewed to avoid abusing the system.
  <br>
  <br>
  Those who don’t want a cash reward can stay anonymous.

    Rare Eurasian Otter 'rediscovered' in Lantau waters

<div class="itemFullText">
 Scientists have found new evidence of an ‘extremely rare’ type of otter in waters north of Lantau – an area where they were previously believed to have been locally extinct since the 1960s.
 <br>
  <br>
  Conservationists didn’t directly spot the Eurasian Otter – thought to be one of the rarest mammals in Hong Kong – but instead confirmed their presence in the area via genetic tests on a one-dollar-coin-sized pile of dried faeces found on East Brother Island.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a
  <a href="https://iucnosgbull.org/Volume41/Hui_et_al_2024.html" target="_blank">
   paper
  </a>
  published last month, researchers from the Kadoorie Farm and Botanic Garden said the finding expands the known range of the mammals in the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  The otters have have previously been found in coastal wetlands and rivers mostly in the northwestern part of the New Territories, but now the new data suggests they're also active in offshore islands and the marine environment.
  <br>
  <br>
  “In this study,” the scientists wrote, “We present the first verifiable evidence of Eurasian Otter in Lantau waters, supporting the possibility that they may inhabit a wider area in Hong Kong and bringing new hope for this locally extremely rare species.”
  <br>
  <br>
  They say as Eurasian Otters depend on freshwater for drinking and washing, it’s likely they live along the northern coast of Lantau, and only use offshore islets as part of their hunting and nesting grounds.
  <br>
  <br>
  The researchers added that the importance of marine habitats to local otters has "long been neglected”, and their findings highlight the importance of carefully evaluating the impact of future development projects in North Lantau on the otters.

    HK$3,000 for reporting public housing abuse

<div class="itemFullText">
 People who report illegal public housing use can earn up to HK$3,000 starting from January 15 if their information helps authorities evict tenants who break the rules, the Housing Authority announced on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, the authority said the Report Public Housing Abuse Award scheme aims to safeguard the use of public housing resources.
  <br>
  <br>
  People aged 16 or above can report any misuse through multiple channels, including online forms, hotlines, email and estate offices.
  <br>
  <br>
  An assessment panel will review cases and make final decisions, especially for complicated situations.
  <br>
  <br>
  The authority said the identities of informants will be kept confidential, though they must provide their real name when reporting and be interviewed.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Since the HA [Housing Authority] implemented new measures to enhance combating tenancy abuse, cases that are relatively easy to detect have been discovered. To identify remaining hidden cases, more investigative clues from the public are needed," the statement read.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's panda craze is picking up speed, thanks to the launch of a panda-themed high-speed rail train by the MTR Corporation.
 <br>
  <br>
  Starting from Saturday, passengers travelling to Shenzhen or Guangzhou will be treated to cartoon illustrations of pandas striking playful poses and indulging in Hong Kong delicacies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Many of the furry creatures are set against iconic Hong Kong landmarks, including the Big Buddha and the Convention and Exhibition Centre.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The [pandas] will act as travel ambassadors," MTR general manager Annie Leung told a media briefing on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[They will] showcase some rich and unique aspects of Hong Kong to the travellers," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The launch of the panda-themed high-speed train followed the debut of similar trains on the South Island Line and Airport Express in recent weeks.
  <br>
  <br>
  The trains are part of a broader citywide celebration tied to Ocean Park's giant pandas, which aims to promote local tourism.
  <br>
  <br>
  The newly-adorned train will run for 12 weeks until April 4.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The head of the Travel Industry Council has expressed mixed views towards inbound and outbound tourism for the upcoming Lunar New Year break.
 <br>
  <br>
  Tommy Tam, who was elected as the council’s new chairman last month, described the prospects of inbound tourism during the holiday period as "good".
  <br>
  <br>
  He said Hong Kong can expect an influx of individual mainland visitors and travellers from Southeast Asian countries, courtesy of the high-speed rail link and short-haul flights.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm confident it will be better than before," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Tam is less upbeat with outbound tourism.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said some Hong Kong people may not be able to book high-speed train tickets due to the Spring Festival rush on the mainland, contributing to a drop in outbound tour groups.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tam also said some may have trouble securing flights.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The long-haul flight resumption is still under progress, so if there are not sufficient long-haul flights, this may cause high fares and the limited seats supply.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Overall, the council expressed confidence in the tourism sector in the coming year, saying that the industry will have more opportunities, such as mega events and large-scale sports activities held in the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said it will continue to attract more new blood to the trade, especially young people, in order to reach the goal of having 210,000 workers in five years’ time.

    HK to send 74 athletes to Asian Winter Games in Harbin

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The SAR will send its largest-ever delegation of 74 athletes to compete at the Asian Winter Games, which will be held in Harbin from the 7th to the 14th of next month.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a flag presentation ceremony on Wednesday, cultural and sports minister Rosanna Law said the Hong Kong, China team demonstrates the vitality and passion of the Games.
  <br>
  <br>
  Law said the government has been making continuous efforts to train elite athletes, with the Sports Institute providing funding and support services.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kenneth Fok, who will lead the 100-strong local delegation, said the youngest athlete is just 15 and Hong Kong will compete in curling for the very first time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters after the ceremony, the lawmaker said preparation hasn't been easy for the SAR athletes due to weather conditions and venue limitations.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have our natural constraints. No matter with the hardware, software, and also our weather. It's very hard for an athlete to persistently do high-level training within Hong Kong itself. So we can already see their determination. Being able to represent Hong Kong is already a feat in itself," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fok added that mainland provinces have provided strong support for athletes who need to train overseas or on the mainland.

    'Govt mulling further curbs against ticket scalping'

<img alt="Rosanna Law called on the public to buy tickets through official channels. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1786639_1_20250108163000.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Wednesday said it’s considering further ways to combat ticket scalping, including possible legislation to ban the practice at government-owned venues.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a written response to a question from lawmaker Chan Kin-por, culture, sports and tourism minister Rosanna Law said legislative options would be considered “in a prudent manner” – noting that such a move has both pros and cons, “given the multiple causes of ticket scalping, which involve various factors including supply and demand, market structure, regulation.”
  <br>
  <br>
  She added that although real-name registration for ticket buyers has helped, not all organisers want to adopt this measure.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We need to communicate with stakeholders, because different organisers have their different ticketing considerations," Law said during a Legislative Council session.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Even though I think real-name registration for tickets is the most effective way to tackle the issue of scalpers, the organisers often don't consider this to be their first option. We have to respect such business operations."
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister also called on spectators to buy tickets through official channels, saying it's risky to buy through unauthorised means, especially at heightened prices.
  <br>
  <br>
  Official records show that no one was convicted of ticket scalping near concert venues between 2022 and the first half of last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lawmakers have expressed concern that scalping has become more rampant, saying Hong Kong's image could be at stake when tourists buy problematic tickets.

 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Wednesday said Hong Kong's doors are wide open to professionals and businesses from Indonesia, adding the SAR has a lot to offer as a "super connector" between the mainland and the world.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a symposium in Jakarta, Chan said Hong Kong and Indonesia are "ideal partners" and Indonesian companies are welcome to set up headquarters in the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong plays a pivotal role in facilitating foreign investment into the Chinese mainland, serving as the largest source of overseas direct investment in the whole of China and a crucial gateway for channelling foreign capital into the Chinese economy," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The finance chief noted that Hong Kong's securities market has a capitalisation of over US$4.4 trillion, and pools both mainland and international capital.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In other words, any Indonesian company listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange will be able to tap into both mainland and international capital," Chan said.

    'Plan to build homes gave arts hub a lifeline'

<img alt="Bernard Chan, vice-chairman of the West Kowloon Cultural District Authority, says the proposed housing project will be crucial to maintain the arts hub's operations. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1786632_1_20250108160319.jpg&q=50">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A government decision last year allowing the sale of commercial and residential facilities at the West Kowloon arts hub gave the cash-strapped project a shot in the arm, the vice-chairman of its managing authority said.
 <br>
  <br>
  As part of a funding proposal, the West Kowloon Cultural District Authority on Wednesday said it plans to build seven residential blocks south of Austin Road West that could offer nearly 2,000 flats.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last year, the government endorsed the sale of residential developments within Zone 2 of the site by the authority.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That news itself already helped us a great deal," Bernard Chan, the authority's vice-chairman, told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It allowed us to talk to the bankers... The fact that we now potentially have a future income stream coming from the sale of these residential units, we're able to get refinancing and we can generate the necessary funding... to allow the authority to continue to operate."
  <br>
  <br>
  That, Chan said, helped to overcome a "timing mismatch" with the development of arts and culture facilities outpacing that of commercial and residential sites.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The faster we open our new [arts and culture] facilities, the more losses we will incur. In the meantime, our income has yet to materialise, because we haven't really been able to generate any income from our commercial sites," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was always, from day one, the plan to use the commercial, residential area to subsidise the arts and culture offerings. This residential [area] is actually going to help us to finance the investment that we put in the arts and culture sites."
  <br>
  <br>
  The government has said the residential project will help the arts hub stay afloat for at least a decade.

    'Boost tourism at cruise terminal, Sports Park'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism Rosanna Law said officials are exploring ways to enhance the operation of the cruise terminal and optimise the use of Kai Tak Sports Park to boost tourism in Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  During the first antechamber exchange session of the year, Law said she received valuable feedback and suggestions regarding the new tourism blueprint, with officials and members in attendance including Deputy Chief Secretary Warner Cheuk and Legco President Andrew Leung.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said her expectations for the new operator of the terminal would significantly improve its performance, adding that she also hopes to improve the use of the shoreline.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There is no 'the best situation', there is only better operation. So this is my constant expectation, and in the new tendering exercise, of course we will be reviewing the criteria imposed so far. After all, the cruise terminal has been in operation for more than 10 years and the same operator has been operating the terminal," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I know that society and, of course, myself and my colleagues in the CSTB (Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau) have different views on the operation of the cruise terminal and how it might be improved."
  <br>
  <br>
  Law also noted that she had received insights and suggestions on how to enhance Kai Tak Sports Park's potential as a world-class venue for mega events.
  <br>
  <br>
  New People's Party lawmaker Adrian Ho told RTHK it is necessary for greater collaboration with local investment groups interested in funding sporting events at Kai Tak Sports Park.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The infrastructure, the hardware is fantastic. I've been to that already. Right now, I think that it all comes down to kind of software, what kind of events are we going to be hosting, the frequency of the event that we'll be hosting, the quality of it, and also how do we maintain this kind of standard throughout the years," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We've got the big stadium, 50,000 people capable, and the smaller arena, you can have 10,000 plus people. So obviously, the scale of it is huge. In hosting this kind of scale of events, we need to engage local sports community to have athletes, organisers and all that, but more at the same time, sponsors as well as sort of investors too. I think that we need to ramp that up in a very near future."
  <br>
  <br>
  DAB lawmaker Vincent Cheng, who is also vice-chairman of the Hong Kong Sports Institute, praised the transportation arrangements and crowd management during the recent test events at the Sports Park, but noted the importance of addressing additional issues, such as dining options, to maximise the potential of the local sports economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another DAB member, Brave Chan, suggested that officials should permit more private vehicles from the mainland to enter Hong Kong during holidays. He also recommended extending docking times for international and mainland private yachts and cruise ships to attract more tourists to the SAR.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Former lawmaker Chim Pui-chung and his son Ricky Chim will be sentenced on February 3 over a fraud case.
 <br>
  <br>
  The District Court heard their mitigation on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  They were found guilty of conspiracy to defraud more than HK$42 million in transactions linked to a listed company.
  <br>
  <br>
  The court earlier convicted Chim Pui-chung, who was the largest shareholder of Asia Resources, and his 55-year-old son, who was the chairman, for conspiring with mainland businessman Ma Zhonghong to defraud the company, its board and shareholders between July 2013 and November 2015.
  <br>
  <br>
  A woman, Wong Poe-lai, was convicted of money laundering in connection with the case.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chim Pui-chung, 78, submitted more than 10 mitigation letters to the court, including letters from former Legco president Jasper Tsang Yok-sing and former financial secretary John Tsang.
  <br>
  <br>
  His defence lawyer also said his client is in poor health. He had suffered from throat cancer, heart disease and a stroke.
  <br>
  <br>
  Judge Ernest Lin adjourned the case to February 3 for sentencing.
  <br>
  <br>
  All three defendants were remanded in custody until sentencing next month.

    West Kowloon arts hub outlines residential development

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The managing authority of the West Kowloon arts hub has outlined plans to build seven residential blocks that could offer nearly 2,000 private sector flats.
 <br>
  <br>
  Located south of Austin Road West, the proposed development also includes three multi-purpose basement levels and three other storeys above ground for retail, catering and entertainment, according to a document submitted to the Yau Tsim Mong District Council.
  <br>
  <br>
  The West Kowloon Cultural District Authority said the development plan would take up roughly 20,000 square metres of land.
  <br>
  <br>
  The plan would have a total gross floor area of 134,500 square metres, with some 80 percent coming from the residential project that's expected to provide up to 1,995 housing units.
  <br>
  <br>
  The housing blocks would create a stepped profile to "maintain the decent views looking out from Hong Kong Island" to the waterfront in West Kowloon, it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Footbridges and walkways would be part of the plan, connecting the project with Kowloon MTR Station and Elements, the shopping mall nearby.
  <br>
  <br>
  The authority is planning to apply to the Town Planning Board for planning permission in the first quarter of this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  In July last year, the Executive Council conditionally agreed to a funding proposal to allow the authority to sell some of its land parcels and keep all proceeds received from tenders to private developers to ease a financial shortfall.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Professor Dennis Lo, the ninth Vice-Chancellor and President of the Chinese University of Hong Kong, said he will strive to enhance the institution's international status.
 <br>
  <br>
  Assuming office on Wednesday, Lo said he was honoured to take up the role, and would work hard to enhance quality in teaching, research, services, and innovation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lo, who's also a molecular biologist, revealed he would meet with his team this week, and arrange meetings with staff, students and alumni later.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lo said he would strengthen exchanges with the governing council that was reformed two years ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  The number of members were reduced from 55 to 34, while the ratio of external to internal members was changed to 2:1 from 1:1 in the past.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think communication is very important. Therefore, our management team will have frequent and regular exchanges with the governing council," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The most important thing is that all of us know that both the management team and governing council want CUHK to be better, and to enhance CHUK's international status."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lo noted that a documentary by the university's student publication on district-level care teams had caught the attention of society.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the publication offered a chance for students to obtain hands-on experience, adding it was also a learning opportunity for them given their story had generated so many different opinions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Succeeding Rocky Tuan, Lo's term will run for five years.

    Govt urges changes to tap into silver economy

<div class="itemFullText">
 Deputy Chief Secretary Warner Cheuk has called for changes to cater to the city's ageing population, saying the rising number of elderly individuals offers “tremendous" market potential.
 <br>
  <br>
  Cheuk is leading a working group on promoting the silver economy to address the growing needs of the elderly population.
  <br>
  <br>
  On RTHK's Overview Policy programme, the minister said Hong Kong could reference measures in other places, such as the mainland, Japan, and South Korea, to support those aged 65 and above.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also urged businesses to "find their niche" and tap into the potential that the silver economy offers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Seniors are a very huge market. For people selling goods or services, they must cater to their customers' preferences... If businesses want to sell products to the elderly, they must make changes," Cheuk said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the future, there should naturally be a designated area for a silver economy, for people to find food, healthcare products, and things that are suitable for the elderly. This is bound to happen, so I'm not worried whether the industry would cooperate on this or not."
  <br>
  <br>
  In the latest Policy Address, Chief Executive John Lee outlined plans for the silver economy with measures to boost consumption among the elderly, promote industrialisation of products, and encourage seniors to return to the labour force.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Breast Milk Bank said on Tuesday it is making good progress in recruiting donors.
 <br>
  <br>
  The milk bank's director, Rosanna Wong, said it has received more than 100 calls from potential donors since the launch of the facility's website in November.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Since the opening of our website, we have actually received a lot of phone calls. More than 100 potential moms have already contacted us. So after today, we are going to contact them, actively support them, hopefully they could be donors at the end," Wong said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The facility, located at the Hong Kong Children's Hospital, started operation on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  It aims to collect 1,000 litres of milk a year, which Wong said would require 150 to 200 donors, each contributing at least 5 litres.
  <br>
  <br>
  If the annual target is met, it can be supplied to 450 to 600 premature babies born before 32 weeks, or critically-ill newborns in nine public hospitals.
  <br>
  <br>
  A donor, Yoyo Chan, who has an eight-month-old daughter, said she wants to help other premature babies after two previous miscarriages.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When I know that there's a breast milk bank, I decided to do it because I want to bless and contribute to the premature babies. At least I can do something to help them," Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The facility's advanced practice nurse Christine Lam said a face-to-face interview will be conducted with prospective donors.
  <br>
  <br>
  To qualify as donors, the mothers must be healthy, must not smoke nor drink alcohol, and are currently breastfeeding a baby under one year old.
  <br>
  <br>
  They will also have to take a blood test once every three months, and to inform staff of the facility whether they are taking medicines.
  <br>
  <br>
  The milk bank will offer milk bottles and pouches to donors and arrange couriers to collect their milk.

    Govt to put up Tung Chung residential site for tender

<div class="itemFullText">
 Development Secretary Bernadette Linn on Tuesday said she is reasonably optimistic that a residential site put up for tender this quarter will be successful, adding it is too early to predict whether the annual land sales income target can be met.
 <br>
  <br>
  The parcel earmarked for sale in Tung Chung, which will provide around 745 flats, was first put up for tender in September 2023 but was unsuccessful.
  <br>
  <br>
  Announcing the last land sale programme for the 2024/25 fiscal year, Linn said the government had been listening to the market.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have heard views from the real estate industry, suggesting that the government should roll out simpler, smaller-sized [plots] with fewer requirements on site formation and government facilities," Linn said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[The tender] is in line with such market expectations as it attaches very simple tender conditions and no requirement to construct government facilities. Moreover, as the site sits on reclaimed land, the development is not required to conduct any further site formation works, which may help reduce the development cost."
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister said the parcel was originally not part of the land sale programme for this fiscal year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked if she was confident the annual land sales revenue target of HK$33 billion could be met, Linn said it was still too early to make a conclusion.
  <br>
  <br>
  The development chief said the administration had been listening to developers about the type of site that was in demand.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We remain pragmatic and prudent in selecting the kind of land that we would like to roll out. When we know that the appetite of the market is for smaller sites, simpler sites, we are exactly moving along that direction, and that would help enliven the market and rekindle their interest in coming forward to bid for sites," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Taking into account various land sources, Linn said the land supply for the fourth quarter can provide around 1,100 new private residential units.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Various local attractions such as the giant panda will feature prominently in the upcoming Lunar New Year parade.
 <br>
  <br>
  The parade will be held on the evening of January 29, the first day of the Year of the Snake.
  <br>
  <br>
  Organised by the Hong Kong Tourism Board and sponsored by Cathay Pacific, it will feature nine floats and 46 performing groups from 14 countries and regions.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Many floats will even act as Hong Kong tourism ambassadors, featuring authentic elements of the city, such as the giant pandas. They will make an impressive appearance together with local famous food, such as milk tea,” Tourism Board chairman Pang Yiu-kai told a press conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  The K-pop girl group Kep1er and Thai boy band LYKN are among those invited to perform at the parade.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cathay’s chief executive officer Ronald Lam said the city's flagship carrier is committed to promoting mega events in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  “This parade is a platform for international cultural exchange. We have groups from different countries, gathering here and performing for local people and tourists, allowing everyone to experience the festive atmosphere with the characteristics of Hong Kong,” Lam said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The parade will start at 8pm at the Hong Kong Cultural Centre in Tsim Sha Tsui, proceeding along Canton Road, Haiphong Road and Nathan Road.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tickets will be on sale from January 11.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Tourism Board said the parade will kick off a series of festive celebrations across Hong Kong, including a fireworks display on January 30, Lunar New Year horse racing on January 31 and the Chinese New Year Cup football match on February 1.

    Govt enhances New Capital Investment Entrant Scheme

<img alt="Applicants of the New Capital Investment Entrant Scheme will only need to prove they have a minimum net worth of HK$30 million in the six months before they apply.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Tuesday said its enhancement measures to the New Capital Investment Entrant Scheme will attract more people, as well as promote the development of family offices.
 <br>
  <br>
  Starting in March, applicants will only need to prove they have a minimum net worth of HK$30 million in the six months before applying, rather than the original period of two years.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government will also consider the total amount of net assets that applicants are absolutely beneficially entitled to within their family.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under the scheme, applicants must invest a minimum of HK$30 million within the six-month time limit.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government will also recognise investments made by private enterprises that are wholly owned by applicants as eligible investment, but the companies must be incorporated or registered in the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We believe these measures will encourage more investors to join the scheme and can create synergy with the tax concession regime for family offices, thereby promoting the development of family office businesses in Hong Kong," the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury Christopher Hui said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are committed to providing comprehensive support for family office decision-makers to establish themselves in Hong Kong, further attracting global asset owners and reinforcing Hong Kong's leading position as an international asset and wealth management hub."
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 800 applications have been received since the scheme was implemented last March, and the government expects over HK$24 billion of investment will be brought into the region.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alpha Lau, Director-General of Investment Promotion, pointed out that the number of applications in the first 10 months since the implementation has surpassed the same period under the previous Capital Investment Entrant Scheme that was launched in 2003.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I trust that these measures will enhance the attractiveness of the scheme. We will continue to work closely with professionals and service providers to further promote the scheme to high-net-worth families around the globe," she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lawmaker Shang Hailong was confident the new measures would attract more wealthy people to Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I hope that Hong Kong would attract more than 5,000 applications, bring in more than HK$150 billion of investment, set up more and more companies or family offices here,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The investors from all over the world, who expect Hong Kong's advantages, for example, safety, low tax, and [connectivity] to the mainland market - those investors will get benefits in the near future.”
  <br>
  <br>
  But the founder of the Hong Kong Top Talent Services Association added the scheme had room to grow in terms of attracting more applicants.
  <br>
  <br>
  “There's room for improvement. For example, HK$24 billion is a lot of money, but I noticed that this is only a forecast number. We hope the government help these investors complete their investments as soon as possible. We know there is still a long way to go from waiting for investment to completing the investment. I think 800 applications is not ideal,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shang said the government should provide more assistance to help investors settle in the SAR and expand into the mainland.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police said they are investigating a fatal traffic accident in Tai Po on Monday, in which a pedestrian was killed.
 <br>
  <br>
  At about 6pm, a coach was travelling along Kwong Wang Street towards Kwong Fuk Estate, when it reportedly hit a 65-year-old man while approaching a bus stop.
  <br>
  <br>
  The pedestrian sustained chest injuries and was sent to Prince of Wales Hospital in a conscious state, but was certified dead at about 7.30pm.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police said the force of the impact caused the man to knock over another pedestrian - a 67-year-old woman - who sustained limb injuries.
  <br>
  <br>
  She was sent to Alice Ho Miu Ling Nethersole Hospital in a conscious state.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 66-year-old coach driver was arrested on suspicion of dangerous driving causing death and remains in custody.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Transport Department on Monday said it had approved the conversion of two red minibus routes into the more regulated green minibus routes, under its conversion scheme.
 <br>
  <br>
  The routes are from Hiu Kwong Street in Sau Mau Ping to Pak Hoi Street in Jordan; and a circular route running between Park Yoho in Yuen Long and Yuen Long Station.
  <br>
  <br>
  Services are expected to begin in March.
  <br>
  <br>
  A spokesman for the Transport Department said the two operators have started the preparation work, including drawing up the service schedules, buying stop signs, repainting the minibus bodies, as well as recruiting drivers.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added it has been the government’s established policy to encourage the conversion of red minibus routes for more effective monitoring and better service quality.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The Transport Department will consider the way forward of the Scheme, taking into account the implementation of these routes in the first batch of the Scheme as well as the views and feedback from the trades,” he said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The department had previously invited the operators of 11 selected red minibus routes to convert into green minibus routes, but only received two applications.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Sources said an off-duty customs officer was arrested on suspicion of tampering with a vehicle last Friday, when a motorcyclist died in a traffic accident in Ngau Tau Kok.
 <br>
  <br>
  Police said a 40-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of tampering with a motor vehicle on the day of the fatal traffic accident.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officers said they were still investigating and would seek advice from the Department of Justice. The arrested man has been released on bail.
  <br>
  <br>
  Customs said it would not comment on the case as it is still under investigation.
  <br>
  <br>
  The accident happened at around 5.46pm last Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police said the deceased 27-year-old man was riding his motorcycle along Wang Kee Street towards Lam Hing Street.
  <br>
  <br>
  He reportedly lost control of his vehicle and rammed into a roadside iron pole near Central Mail Centre.
  <br>
  <br>
  The motorcyclist, who had sustained serious injuries, was declared dead at the scene.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police also said a 40-year-old male passerby was knocked down by the motorcycle.
  <br>
  <br>
  He sustained injuries to his hand and was sent to United Christian Hospital for treatment.

    Trio appointed to oversee trustee of Nina Wang estate

<img alt="A new trustee will administer the estate of the late tycoon Nina Wang. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1786295_1_20250106132329.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Secretary for Justice (SJ) has appointed three people to a body supervising a new trustee of the estate of the late tycoon Nina Wang.
 <br>
  <br>
  Former Monetary Authority chief Joseph Yam, former Legislative Council president Rita Fan and former Baptist University Council chairman Cheng Yan-kee were named members of the supervisory managing organisation (SMO) responsible for supervising the operation of the trustee that was appointed by the High Court.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang, who chaired developer Chinachem, died in 2007, and the legal battles for her HK$141 billion estate ensued for years.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2023, the High Court ruled that a charitable foundation founded by the firm was not suitable to be the trustee of her estate. The court later agreed with the SJ's plan to set up a new trust.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Department of Justice said it firmly believes that after the trustee's board is formed, it will do its best in managing the charitable trust, "including charity projects and a 'fund and a Chinese prize of worldwide significance similar to that of the Nobel Prize', to fulfil Mrs Wang's testamentary wishes and bring benefits to the country, including different sectors of Hong Kong society."
  <br>
  <br>
  The department stressed that local laws state that the SJ has a role in protecting charitable interests, and it therefore intervened in the estate's legal proceedings in view of significant public interest.

    'Waitlisted dental patients will be handled flexibly'

<img alt="" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1786281_1_20250106113802.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Department of Health has assured residents that public dental clinics will handle patients under a new online system with flexibility.
 <br>
  <br>
  The department on Monday began operating an oversubscription mechanism as well as a wait-list mechanism for online bookings. People who are allocated a spot for dental services are required to arrive at the clinic by 8.30am for registration. If they fail to do so, staff will reach out to people on the waiting list.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dr Kitty Hse, the consultant in-charge of the department's dental services, said on an RTHK radio programme that staff will contact patients on the waiting list from 9:30am, and they have to arrive by 11:30am.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The people on the waiting list have mainly put that clinic as their first preference, and are 65 or over, so they get the highest priority. That means they should be living nearby or not too far from the clinic. So we expect them to come in within two hours," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But they don't have to worry... if they confirm that they'll show up but may be slightly late, our colleagues will handle it flexibly and will still offer dental services to them."
  <br>
  <br>
  Hse also pointed out the no-show rate of patients dropped from 31 percent at the start of the online registration programme last Monday to 20 percent later in the week.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on the same programme, Ivan Lin, a community organiser at the Society for Community Organisation, said some elderly people struggled with the new system.
  <br>

  "Since registration moved online, many elderly people say they don't know if they'll be able to get a slot. In the past, they could queue overnight for one or two days and find out if they could get a spot, but now they really don't know. They don't know how many attempts it will take before they're allocated a slot," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lin urged the government to fast-track implementation of the Community Dental Support Programme which targets the underprivileged. The scheme was unveiled in last year's policy address.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong China Rugby on Monday said the first Rugby Sevens tournament to be held at the new stadium in Kai Tak will be a next-level event.
 <br>
  <br>
  James Farndon, Hong Kong China Rugby CEO, made the comments after authorities said the first test event at the main stadium of the Kai Tak Sports Park went well.
  <br>
  <br>
  Farndon said his operations team is now busy with debriefing and reviewing with stakeholders ahead of the Rugby Sevens, which will be held at the end of March.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong Sevens is famous around the world, of course, as the event that every Sevens player wants to play in. And I think the first tournament in the new stadium is going to take that to an even higher level," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said athletes and fans are excited about the new state-of-the-art venue.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The players will be able to enjoy [the experience] in the much better surroundings of Kai Tak which is also more conducive to enhancing their performance slightly on the pitch, so that'll be great for the players," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Farndon noted that the stadium in Kai Tak was at 20 percent capacity during Sunday's test.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Based on the atmosphere we had, I think the fans are in for something really incredible" during the Rugby Sevens, he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also pointed out that the new South Stand will be bigger and would overlook the Hong Kong skyline.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Probably the most unique feature in the stadium is the window looking out on the Hong Kong skyline on the South Stand terrace, and that's going to make the experience even more memorable for fans."

 A 36-year-old man died on Sunday after reportedly fainting and falling backwards while on an escalator in Sha Tin.
 <br>
  <br>
  Officers said the victim's mother reported the incident at Sha Kok Estate at around 2pm.
  <br>
  <br>
  The man was reportedly going up on the escalator connecting a wet market and a shopping mall.
  <br>
  <br>
  And as he fell backwards, he hit a 65-year-old woman who suffered a minor injury.
  <br>
  <br>

    'HK Coliseum can focus even more on entertainment'

<img alt="Rosanna Law says the Hong Kong Coliseum could be repositioned for entertainment. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1786214_1_20250105172615.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government said some of its venues could focus on entertainment after the opening of more sports facilities.
 <br>
  <br>
  Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism Rosanna Law said on a TVB programme that the positioning of the existing public venues can be different after new facilities such as Kai Tak Sports Park and the East Kowloon Cultural Centre are opened.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some venues, like the Hong Kong Coliseum, could focus on holding entertainment shows instead of sports events in future, Law said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “In the past, some people would say the Hong Kong Coliseum should give sports events priority. But now we have Kai Tak Sports Parks and other new facilities. Can we think of different positioning on venues, such as some places are mainly for sports events while some for entertainment?” Law said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last year, nearly 60 percent of events held at the Hong Kong Coliseum were concerts, more than 20 percent were sports events, while the rest were activities like graduation ceremonies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Law also said the government will finalise the recommendations on stage construction regulation in the first quarter of this year, after a giant LED screen fell and injured dancers during the MIRROR concert in July 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said the recommendations will mainly apply to the Hong Kong Coliseum and Queen Elizabeth Stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some rules will also apply to Kai Tak Sports Park.

    First test event held at Kai Tak main stadium 'smooth'

<div class="itemFullText">
 A rugby tournament featuring university students was held at the Kai Tak Sports Park on Sunday, the first test event at the main stadium there.
 <br>
  <br>
  Officials described the test event as generally smooth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Around 10,000 spectators were expected inside the 50,000-strong venue, with free seating and multiple entry and exit allowed.
  <br>
  <br>
  A number of spectators were unaware of the rule that water bottles were not allowed inside the venue, and had to put them away for temporary storage.
  <br>
  <br>
  A player from Hang Seng University said he's happy with the experience both on and off the pitch.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's good because this is a standard-sized pitch with real grass. We always play on artificial grass, which hurts more when you fall," he told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The facilities are also much better at Kai Tak. Say at Kings Park Sports Ground, the changing rooms aren't as big. Here, every team has its own changing room. There's ice for cold therapy, and there's an area for each team member."
  <br>
  <br>
  A spectator, who works in public relations, said he's glad to make his first visit to the state-of-the-art venue along with many other members of the public, even though the atmosphere at the test event may not be as good as that at the Rugby Sevens.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is a really nice venue, different from the Hong Kong Stadium. When you come inside Kai Tak Stadium, you feel that Hong Kong has a world-class stadium. I've been to similar stadiums in other major cities, and now we have our very own," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Security minister Chris Tang and Sports Commissioner George Choi were among the officials on hand to inspect the operations, and they found the arrangements generally smooth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Going forward, Tang said the authorities will host three more tests involving at least 65,000 people for the main stadium and other venues at the Sports Park.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said various scenarios will be simulated to get officials ready.
  <br>
  <br>
  The rugby tournament involved 17 teams, with the games lasting for the whole day.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Kai Tak main stadium will host the Rugby Sevens in late March.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Runners who took part in this year’s Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge Half Marathon said they were happy with the arrangements after issues were raised in the event’s inaugural edition in 2023.
 <br>
  <br>
  Around 7,000 people took part in Sunday's race, which covered the local section of the 55-kilometre mega-bridge.
  <br>
  <br>
  The race for the challenge group of runners started at 7.15am, and the remaining three non-challenge groups began in batches about half an hour later.
  <br>
  <br>
  A runner from Yunnan, surnamed Jian, said she previously ran in the plateau and wanted to experience something different.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Running here is totally different. You're on the bridge and over the sea, while elsewhere it's just road running. I think the arrangement is pretty good. The volunteers are really enthusiastic and there are clear signs,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some runners who participated in the November 2023 race complained about not being offered enough sports drinks or snacks, as well as the lack of toilets.
  <br>
  <br>
  This year’s race is designated a Gold Label Road Race by World Athletics.
  <br>
  <br>
  Many elite marathon runners took part, including Japan’s Yuki Kawauchi, who won the 2018 Boston Marathon as an amateur runner. “I'm happy to see so many runners cheering for me,” he spoke through an interpreter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ethiopian Milkesa Mengesha came first in the challenge group in just over an hour, while Grace Nawowuna from Kenya took the women’s title.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chong See-yeung and Virginia Lo were the first SAR man and woman to finish the race.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chong, who also ran in 2023, said the facilities, including the toilets, were much better compared with the previous race.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that he was thrilled and honoured to be able to run alongside Kawauchi.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I feel very inspired because he is a role model for me. As an Asian athlete with a larger build similar to mine, he resonates with me. He started as a recreational runner and has achieved results comparable to, or even better than, professional athletes. This serves as a great motivation for us,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lo, meanwhile, was about 40 seconds off her personal best. She said the overall experience was great, though the uphill tunnel section was the toughest part.
  <br>
  <br>
  Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism Rosanna Law called the start of the challenge group race.
  <br>
  <br>
  She and other officials, including justice chief Paul Lam and security minister Chris Tang, took part in a special 2-kilometre race.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Midway through the race I noticed the sunrise is magnificent. So, it’s really half sports, half tourism,” Law said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The Hong Kong, China Association of Athletics Affiliates also told me that for future large-scale events, they plan to invite not just elite runners from abroad but also those who are overseas travellers. When they come, there’s no reason to just run the marathon – they'll likely stay a night and spend money. I totally support this idea.”
  <br>
  <br>
  According to the Hong Kong, China Association of Athletics Affiliates, 19 runners said they felt unwell and suffered injuries and three were sent to hospital for treatment as of 11am.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government will focus on cutting expenditure to tackle a fiscal deficit, Financial Secretary Paul Chan said.
 <br>
  <br>
  As the deficit for the current fiscal year is expected to reach just under HK$100 billion, Chan wrote in his weekly blog that public works projects will be prioritised, with the Northern Metropolis as well as housing and economic development projects getting resources first.
  <br>
  <br>
  For other infrastructure projects, the government will raise capital by issuing bonds and through public-private partnership, he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Apart from further controlling the spending of various departments, Chan said the government will review certain funding schemes that could affect the public coffers.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It is inevitable for us to look into some funding schemes as their expenditure growth will bring significant long-term impact to the public finance,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The finance chief said various departments will be asked to further control their spending, including reallocating resources and prioritising works to better meet the needs of society.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Increasing revenue and reducing expenditure is the key to improve public finance,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Our strategy will focus on cost-cutting, in which we will control the increase in recurrent expenditures, under the premise of maintaining and improving public service.”
  <br>
  <br>
  On ways to boost revenue, Chan stressed the need for the government to stick to a low and simple tax system to order to maintain Hong Kong's competitive edge.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also said officials will follow the user pays principle, so as to minimise the impact to the average people.

 The Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Christopher Hui, said on Sunday that the user pays principle is among the factors at play when officials consider ways to widen the tax base.
 <br>
  <br>
  Amid a multi-year budget deficit, Financial Secretary Paul Chan said on Saturday that officials were considering having high-income earners pay more tax, in line with the principle of having people pay more if they can afford to.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hui stressed after attending a Commercial Radio programme that officials are considering ways to find new sources of revenue and cut expenses at the same time.
  <br>
  <br>
  "On the one hand, we'll consider how these measures affect the people. And we'll also look at adopting the principle of user pays, such that we can achieve a stable fiscal management in a sustainable manner," the minister said.
  <br>
  <br>
  During the show, Hui noted that Hong Kong is capable of embracing the world as shown in the government's drive to expand into new markets.
  <br>
  <br>
  For example, he said Indonesia and other countries have said they plan to issue bonds in the SAR, while some firms had expressed interest in setting up family offices.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hui said Hong Kong's status as the country's international financial centre will become more prominent going forward, thanks to an increase in cross-border trading of financial products.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister added that as mainland firms become more competitive globally, the SAR can help them expand overseas by providing them with professional services and serving as a fund-raising platform.

 Police on Sunday said they smashed a syndicate that allegedly made use of deepfake technology to conduct investment scams.
 <br>
  <br>
  Officers raided two locations in neighbouring industrial buildings in Kowloon Bay last week and arrested 31 people, aged between 20 and 34.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police said the total amount of losses exceeded HK$34 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  They said the syndicate had been operating for more than a year, and the victims were mainly from outside of Hong Kong, such as Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia and the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fung Pui-kei, superintendent with the Commercial Crime Bureau, said the syndicate made use of deepfake technology to build relationships online.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They also make use of the new technology, like AI face-swapping technology, to [pretend] to be some good-looking ladies and gentlemen to induce potential victims, gain their trust and develop into romance relationships in order to commence the romance scams," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Once gaining their trust, the syndicate persuaded people to send money to a fake investment platform, police said.
  <br>
  <br>
  During the raids, officers seized HK$10 million worth of suspected criminal gains, including cash, handbags and luxury watches.
  <br>
  <br>
  Most of those arrested said they were unemployed, while some were university students.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officers said five of those held, among them core syndicate members, have been charged with conspiracy to defraud. They'll appear at Eastern Court on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The other suspects were released on bail.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last October, the force took down a syndicate operating in a similar way, and police are trying to determine if the two cases were connected.

    'Only buy concert tickets through official channels'

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police are advising people to refrain from buying concert tickets through unofficial channels, following the arrest of five men for allegedly selling counterfeit tickets.
 <br>
  <br>
  Tai Kwong-fai, an inspector with the Kowloon City District Crime Squad, said on Saturday that officers have received more than 20 reports of suspected scams in the past few weeks.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said victims claimed they purchased concert tickets from various online platforms and social media at inflated prices through unofficial sources, only to find out at the venue that their tickets were fake.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The counterfeit concert tickets we seized look authentic, whether it was the font or paper quality, so it is challenging for the average person to tell the difference," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The scammers also arranged for in-person meetings with the victims and provided ticket verification methods in order to convince them."
  <br>
  <br>
  Tai said the five men, aged between 18 and 45, have been arrested on suspicion of obtaining property by deception.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Tourism chief Rosanna Law has vowed to make visitors "fall back in love" with Hong Kong, stressing that she would not dwell on tourist numbers.
 <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong saw 45 million tourist arrivals in total last year, falling slightly short of the previous estimate of 46 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We don't necessarily have to strive for very high numbers," Law said in a television interview on Saturday when asked if she hoped tourist numbers this year would return to pre-pandemic levels.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said there was a time before Covid when some suggested Hong Kong might be welcoming too many tourists and there could be room for improvement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I feel that now we should gradually make people fall in love with Hong Kong, or love Hong Kong again, and feel that they will always want to come back to visit. This is my biggest goal for the coming year," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the development of the city's cruise terminal set out in a recent tourism blueprint, Law said authorities could require future operators to make a pledge to bring in vessels.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials earlier said they would put the managing rights of the terminal up for tender in 2025, three years before the existing contract expires, while reviewing the terms and conditions to make the port more attractive and competitive.
  <br>
  <br>
  Law said authorities could make firms hoping to join the tender exercise commit to having cruise ships dock at the terminal for a certain number of days.

    Legco was fast but diligent, says Andrew Leung

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Legco President Andrew Leung on Saturday brushed off suggestions that the legislature had sacrificed diligence for speed, after passing 34 bills over the past year.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on an RTHK programme, Leung said every bill is comprehensively reviewed from start to finish, with lawmakers working with officials in a pragmatic and collaborative manner.
  <br>
  <br>
  He highlighted the enactment of homegrown national security legislation under Article 23 of the Basic Law as a pivotal accomplishment in 2024, stressing that councillors had been anything but sloppy in the legislative process.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We held meetings for seven days, from nine in the morning to seven at night, and asked about 2,000 questions,” Leung said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “There are 182 sections [in the bill], and we revised 91 of them – which is an unprecedented number. So, were we careless and simply raising our hands in support because that's what the authorities wanted? No, we put a lot of effort into this.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Responding to concerns about the cost of a Legco duty visit to Japan at the end of last year, Leung said that discussions during the visit were productive and covered many practical issues, including Hong Kong's considerations regarding food imports from Japan.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that the expenses were in accordance with guidelines.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We followed the guidelines and did not spend more than necessary. In fact, we were very frugal. We were there for an official visit, not to indulge," he said.

    Economic boost amid deficit 'main challenge': FS

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Saturday warned that promoting economic development amid a fiscal deficit would be Hong Kong's "main challenge", saying the government is studying how to boost income and cut costs to achieve a balance.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on RTHK's "Voices from the Hall", where he gathered public feedback ahead of the upcoming budget, Chan said Hong Kong's economy grew steadily in the first three quarters of 2024 but not as strongly as expected due to high interest rates and geopolitical factors.
  <br>
  <br>
  The finance chief said the government is focusing on cost-cutting to tackle a deficit estimated to be just below HK$100 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Although we need to move forward with public works projects and develop the Northern Metropolis, we have to prioritise developments according to their urgency," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "At the same time, we need to study how to increase revenue, based on the principle that people who can afford to pay more do pay more, to minimise the impact on Hongkongers."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan dismissed suggestions that Hong Kong's property slump would drop in the future.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our property market has been experiencing an adjustment period, due to external factors and the high interest rate environment, among other reasons," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[But] property prices in Hong Kong have stabilised and transaction volume has increased."
  <br>
  <br>
  He also insisted the government will not restore a land-sale mechanism, which was scrapped more than a decade ago, in response to an attendee's call.
  <br>
  <br>
  Abolished in 2013, the application-based mechanism had allowed developers to apply for, and then offer a price for sites listed by the government, before authorities put the plot up for sale.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We hope that the government takes the lead with every quarterly land sale. We can assess the situation to see how many plots of land we're putting up for sale, what type of land is being sold, and how we're going to put those parcels out to market," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  After some attendees wanted to discuss the government's HK$2 transport subsidy scheme, the financial chief said labour and welfare officials are studying different views on the matter.
  <br>
  <br>
  The financial secretary is set to deliver his next budget speech on February 26.

    Expert calls for children to get flu jabs early

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Infectious diseases expert Ivan Hung said on Saturday that children should get their influenza vaccinations ahead of the Lunar New Year to anticipate an expected flu spike in kindergartens and primary schools.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a radio programme, the University of Hong Kong professor said children as young as six months old can get the flu jab.
  <br>
  <br>
  While getting vaccinated is highly recommended, he also reminded the public of the need for personal hygiene.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Children at school should wash their hands frequently and, of course, if they have symptoms of influenza or flu, then they should not be going to school, they should be staying at home. Of course, if they have minor symptoms, then they could wear a mask and still go to school," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think these are the important measures, but most important of all is still getting the influenza vaccine for children. There's still enough time to get the vaccine before the Chinese New Year."
  <br>
  <br>
  Hung also said a significant number of people returning to Hong Kong from Japan have exhibited flu symptoms, possibly due to the colder winter temperatures in Japan.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For those who are just coming back from overseas, then of course, if they have symptoms of influenza or flu, then they should be seeing doctors. They should do a rapid test and they could see a doctor and get treatment," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's usually quite minor for children, so they could get a Panadol, paracetamol, some nasal decongestants, some medication for that. I would recommend staying at home until they fully recover before going to school."

    Dental clinics to amend booking system over no-shows

<img alt="The Department of Health says some people simply forgot to show up for their dental appointments or have other commitments. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1786058_1_20250103214911.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Health authorities on Friday said an oversubscription arrangement for online public dental bookings and a waiting-list mechanism will be introduced next week in a bid to prevent no-shows.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Department of Health earlier launched its online registration for public dental services in a bid to avoid residents queuing overnight, but some people failed to show up for the appointments.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Upon initial enquiry, they said that they were unable to attend due to other commitments or had forgotten their appointment, while others said that they were unaware that the scope of the service was limited to emergency dental services," a department spokesperson said.
  <br>
  <br>
  From January 6, public dental clinics will "suitably increase the number of successful applicants to a level exceeding the actual service quotas", and introduce a waiting list to fill possible vacancies.
  <br>
  <br>
  People who register successfully will be asked to confirm their attendance. If they are not able to do this, the slot will be assigned to someone on the waiting list.
  <br>
  <br>
  Those aged 65 or above who have registered but failed to secure a spot will be given priority on the waiting list.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities also said people allocated a spot must arrive at designated dental clinics by 8.30am on the day of the appointment. Staff members will begin reaching out to people on the waiting list to fill vacancies from 9.30am.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Depending on the absence rate at each clinic, the [Department of Health] will suitably increase the quota of successful applicants and set up a waiting list to fill vacancies without compromising the overall quality of service, which remains the top priority," the spokesperson said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The [Department of Health] will continue to monitor the operation of the new system and keep in view the utilisation and attendance rates. If the situation warrants, a mechanism to deter absenteeism and abuse may be introduced."

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Friday said they launched an investigation into a suspected murder case, after a man was found slashed in the back in Tuen Mun.
 <br>
  <br>
  Officers received a report at about 10pm on Thursday saying a man was found lying unconscious outside the entrance of block seven at Po Tin Estate.
  <br>
  <br>
  The man, 33, was then rushed to Tuen Mun Hospital where he was pronounced dead.
  <br>
  <br>
  After initial investigations, the force said they suspect the deceased was attacked by a man with a sharp object, and that he fled afterwards.
  <br>
  <br>
  A post-mortem examination will be conducted later to determine the cause of death.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police also said that a 44-year-old woman was arrested on suspicion of misleading police officers during their investigation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officers from the Tuen Mun district crime squad are investigating the case, the force added.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Organisers of this year's Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge Half Marathon have vowed to address issues raised by runners in the inaugural edition in 2023.
 <br>
  <br>
  The race, which has been designated a Gold Label Road Race by World Athletics, will see 8,000 runners traversing the 55-kilometre bridge's Hong Kong stretch on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some participants of the event's first edition, which took place in November 2023, were left frustrated by a lack of sports drinks and snacks, as well as a shortage of toilets.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This time, we have increased the number of portable toilets. We have prepared 70 of them at the start and finish line, and we have 130 in total along the entire course... We believe this should be able to address the needs of runners," said Simon Yeung, who chairs the organising committee.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have responded to the issues raised by some runners. We heard them and have followed up, and we hope to do better this year."
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeung also said some of the six water stations would provide sports drinks and bananas.
  <br>
  <br>
  The event will be divided into the "challenge" and "non-challenge" groups, with the first batch of runners expected to start at 7.15am.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among participants in the "challenge" group will be 16 runners specially invited from abroad, including Ethiopian track and field athlete Milkesa Mengesha, who won the latest Berlin Marathon.
  <br>
  <br>
  Parts of the bridge will be gradually closed to traffic from Saturday until after all races are completed.

    First test event at Kai Tak Stadium ahead of Sevens

<div class="itemFullText">
 A rugby competition on Sunday will serve as the first test event at Kai Tak Stadium, paving the way for the Hong Kong Sevens in March.
 <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong China Rugby will be hosting the concluding day of the University Sports Federation of Hong Kong, China’s rugby sevens tournament, which features 17 men's and women's teams.
  <br>
  <br>
  The first match is scheduled to kick off at 11.15am, with the final expected to conclude at 6.30pm. Ticket holders can enter the venue as early as 10am, but there will be no on-site ticket sales on the day.
  <br>
  <br>
  James Farndon, CEO of Hong Kong China Rugby, said the event will test various things needed for the Hong Kong Sevens.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our event operations team is obviously very experienced in running the main events, but here in particular, having the first opportunity to test, for instance, the full event control room in terms of the stadium operations, the media centre being open, broadcast teams, getting a look around the stadium," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In terms of some of our entertainment, some of our sport experiences and entertainments that we're looking at for the main event. We'll have the opportunity to test and plan some of these event presentations. Equally we'll bring in some of our DJ and match announcers for the event which allows  us to test some of the sound systems that are used."
  <br>
  <br>
  Sports Commissioner George Tsoi anticipates around 10,000 spectators for the test event, saying it will be the first of many at the stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The infrastructure has by and large been completed and every little part of the operations has been tested. What's more important is that... we put together every element into practice, into one single event so that we can have a certainty or we can have a more realistic test on the performance when all these elements are put together," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will be progressively increasing the complications, the scale, as well as the number of spectators of all of our test events."

    Officials mull mass transit station in Lam Tin North

<img alt="Mable Chan says officials may add a station in Lam Tin North to the proposed mass transit system in East Kowloon. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1785977_1_20250103111010.jpg&q=70">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Officials are considering adding a ninth station to a planned elevated mass transit system in East Kowloon, to serve people living in the northern part of Lam Tin.
 <br>
  <br>
  The system, which is expected to be completed in 2033, will run from Choi Hung East to Yau Tong East.
  <br>
  <br>
  Transport Secretary Mable Chan told the Ta Kung Pao and Wen Wei Po newspapers in an interview published on Friday that the route could be changed to enable the creation of a "Lam Tin North Station".
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Lam Tin to Yau Tong route would require extensive excavation through mountains and rocks to build a very long tunnel, which would be both complex and costly. Many Lam Tin residents would be unable to benefit from the system," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "However, we found that shifting the route slightly leftward would bring it closer to the Lam Tin North area, where three housing estates with over 30,000 residents are located. We have identified potential locations in this area to build a station."
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Chan said the first of the city's new taxi fleets could start running from March.
  <br>
  <br>
  Five fleet licences have been granted as part of efforts to improve the sector's service quality.

    'Dental patients arriving earlier can tackle no-shows'
   </title>

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A lawmaker on Friday suggested that public dental clinics should require patients to arrive at least an hour in advance to deal with no-shows.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Department of Health launched its online registration for public dental services on Monday in a bid to avoid residents queuing overnight.
  <br>
  <br>
  With 151 slots available, it recorded an overall absentee rate of 26.5 percent during the first two working days since the service was launched.
  <br>
  <br>
  A majority of them were residents aged 65 or above.
  <br>
  <br>
  The department said it would keep monitoring the operation and effectiveness of the new system and carry out suitable remedial measures, such as setting up a waiting list mechanism.
  <br>
  <br>
  Election Committee lawmaker Chan Hoi-yan said patients might not show up due to various reasons, including illness or they simply forgot about the appointment.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think that - for instance - we can ask them to come in for registration an hour or so before the appointment. I think the public understands that the government has tried its best to avoid long queues," she told an RTHK radio programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Coming in earlier to make sure you'll show up enables medical workers, or the Department of Health, to contact people on the waiting list and ask them to come in."
  <br>
  <br>
  She said absentees should not be penalised.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on the same programme, Tsuen Wan District Councillor Ng Chun-yu suggested that officials should also phone elderly patients to notify them they have been allocated a spot at a public dental clinic.
  <br>
  <br>
  The no-show rate at the Tsuen Wan clinic was 33.3 percent - the highest among all surveyed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ng suspected this was because some older people living outside the area were reluctant to travel a long distance for dental appointments.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Apart from notifying elderly by SMS, the government could also use pre-recorded phone calls and can call the elderly twice," said Ng.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If they don't pick up both calls, then it's likely that they won't show up, right? If half of the 40 people who've been allocated a slot aren't picking up the phone, maybe there's a high number of people not showing up? At least [health workers] can be prepared."
  <br>
  <br>
  Responding to media enquiries, the health department said some patients did not show up due to other engagements, or they forgot about the appointment.
  <br>
  <br>
  It added that some residents were not aware that the clinics only provide emergency dental services.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) has apologised over the suspected theft of files that contained the personal data of about 100 people.
 <br>
  <br>
  Officials said the incident involved two internal document files stored at the Kowloon City District Environmental Hygiene Office.
  <br>
  <br>
  The FEHD said the files contained records of public complaints against environmental nuisances in the district, including the names and contact information of about 100 complainants.
  <br>
  <br>
  The department has reported the case to the police and notified the Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data as well as affected complainants.
  <br>
  <br>
  "While the case is believed to be an isolated incident, the department will take stringent action should the investigation reveal any negligence or mishandling by any officer," a spokesman said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The FEHD will also review the current personal data security measures to ensure effective protection of the personal data it collects."

<img alt="Retail sales have declined for nine months in a row. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1785893_2_20250102183155.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's retail sales were down 7.3 percent in November on a year-on-year basis, according to official figures released on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  It marked the ninth consecutive month of year-on-year declines, following a 2.8 percent skid in October and 6.9 percent drop in September.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sales of motor vehicles and parts saw the most dramatic drop in November, at 34.4 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Total retail sales plunged 7.1 percent in the first 11 months of last year, compared to the same period in 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government said the declines continued because of a change in people's consumption patterns and the relatively strong Hong Kong dollar.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Nevertheless, the introduction of various measures by the Central Government to boost the mainland economy and benefit Hong Kong, including the resumption and expansion of the multiple-entry Individual Visit Scheme for Shenzhen since December, together with the SAR Government's various initiatives to boost market sentiment, as well as increasing employment earnings, would be conducive to spending by both visitors and residents in the local market," a spokesman said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The executive director of the Retail Management Association, Bond Law, said he is hopeful sales will rebound this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The resumption of multiple-entry visas for Shenzhen is a good start to drive foot traffic, and the positive impact on the market starting December will take time to take effect," he said in an online press call.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Looking forward to 2025, the positive impact of various supportive measures are expected to gradually materialise to benefit all retail categories."

<div class="itemFullText">
 The annual Toys and Games Fair, together with two other fairs, will kick off on Monday, featuring more eco-friendly products.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Toys and Games Fair, the Baby Products Fair and the International Stationery and School Supplies Fair will be held at the Convention and Exhibition Centre in Wan Chai from January 6 to 9.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong Trade Development Council (HKTDC), which is the main organiser, said the three fairs, themed “New Play for All”, attracted more than 2,500 exhibitors from different countries and regions.
  <br>
  <br>
  HKTDC’s deputy executive director Sophia Chong said the Green Toys Zone will return for a second year, featuring toys made with eco-friendly or recycled materials.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said the fair will also present the first ESG (Environment, Social and Governance) Pavilion, as going green is a global trend.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The materials, the production process and also the standard of entering these import markets outside of Hong Kong, are placing more and more importance on environmentally friendly requirements and standards,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It's not only applying in the toys and games and baby product sectors, but also across sectors in the fashion, lifestyle, as well as the electronics industry, so we think this will be a definite worldwide trend which cannot be missed.”
  <br>

 The Transport Department has announced that authorities are now handling up to 500 applications each working day from car owners who want to drive to the mainland via the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge, up from 400 previously.
 <br>
  <br>
  The department said the move will allow it to better cope with the number of applications being received under the Northbound Travel for Hong Kong Vehicles scheme.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The eligibility, procedures and balloting of applications of the scheme remain unchanged," a spokesman said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The governments of Guangdong and Hong Kong will continue to monitor the operation of Northbound Travel for Hong Kong Vehicles and maintain close liaison with relevant departments to review and enhance the arrangements of the scheme in a timely manner."
  <br>
  <br>
  The scheme began in June 2023 and more than 60,000 applications had been submitted by the middle of last year.

    Cage homes won't be under new regulations: Winnie Ho

<img alt="Winnie Ho said officials would implement new regulations over future basic housing units with care. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1785862_1_20250102132347.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Housing minister Winnie Ho on Thursday said the government was not including cage homes and cubicle units under the planned new regulatory regime for subdivided flats, because those are already subject to an existing licensing system.
 <br>
  <br>
  There have been calls for the government to put these so-called bed space units under the future basic housing unit regime, which would subject flats to requirements such as a minimum size.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the housing chief said there's a public misconception about this.
  <br>
  <br>
  "'Bed space' units in various forms – including 'cage homes', 'coffin homes' and 'space capsule' units – are already regulated by the licensing regime under the Bedspace Apartments Ordinance," Ho wrote in an SCMP opinion piece.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Regulation under the regime for basic housing units would only duplicate regulations and is therefore unnecessary."
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho said the government estimates that around 80,000 basic housing units would still be available in the market after the new laws are introduced.
  <br>
  <br>
  Coupled with the fact that more public housing will be available in the coming years, she said there shouldn't be much room for rents to rise significantly for subdivided flats.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho added that as tackling subdivided flats is her bureau's top priority, the government is striving to pass legal changes by the end of the year and would then implement new regulations in a gradual and careful manner.
  <br>
  <br>
  Landlords would be given up to a year and a half to register the flats, followed by a grace period of up to two years for working things out with tenants before flat conversion.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister said after the completion of registration, officials would decide on the time frame for law enforcement.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said enforcement would be carried out in an orderly manner, to avoid displacing affected households.

    HK breast milk bank to commence operations on Jan 6

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The city's first breast milk bank – located at the Hong Kong Children's Hospital in Kowloon Bay – will start services on January 6, the Hospital Authority said.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on an RTHK programme on Thursday, the director of the Hong Kong Breast Milk Bank, Rosanna Wong, said the facility aims to collect 50 to 100 litres of breast milk in its first stage of service, so it can start supplying the milk to premature or critically-ill newborns in nine public hospitals in March when the second stage begins.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We will ensure the quality of the breast milk. We will conduct checks including screening, microbiological testing, pasteurisation, and nutritional analysis, all under precise temperature control. The processed breast milk will then be eligible to supply to the newborns,” Wong said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong said breast milk is easier for premature newborns to digest, and can reduce the chance of them developing complications due to their early birth.
  <br>
  <br>
  She hoped the bank could collect around 1,000 litres of breast milk a year in future, benefiting 450 to 600 newborns.
  <br>
  <br>
  To donate breast milk, Wong said the donor must be healthy, must not smoke nor drink alcohol, and is currently breastfeeding a baby under one year old.
  <br>
  <br>
  The donor will also have to take a blood test once every three months.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong said the facility will provide milk bottles and pouches to the donors.
  <br>
  <br>
  Donors can store their breast milk in a refrigerator at home before a courier arranged by the facility collects the milk.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong Breastfeeding Mothers’ Association welcomed the launch of the facility, with chairwoman Jacy Chan calling it "a good start".
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's very helpful for premature or critically-ill newborns because often mothers cannot breastfeed them because of the separation, so having donated breast milk to help these babies would be very good to help with their recovery," she told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan also said many women are interested in donating breast milk, so it's important to make things easier for prospective donors.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For mothers who are giving birth or have given birth at private hospitals, they have to go to the Children's Hospital in Kai Tak, so it's a little bit inconvenient sometimes for these mothers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Also, the questionnaire and the blood test used to be done from Monday to Thursday during working hours, which means I think for mothers on maternity leave it may not be as difficult, but for mothers who have returned to work it would mean they have to take a day off to go to the place specifically for this.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If they can have a bit more different points for which the mothers can do the blood test, that would be helpful."

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Transport and Logistics Mable Chan said on Thursday that imported talent can help with maintenance of the C919 aircraft in the SAR.
 <br>
  <br>
  China Eastern is now using the domestically made jet on flights between Hong Kong and Shanghai.
  <br>
  <br>
  On a radio programme, Chan was asked whether Hong Kong has a sufficient number of engineers able to carry out maintenance work on the aircraft.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Civil Aviation Department has been participating in the certification work of the C919 on the mainland since 2012, and the department has also deployed workers to the mainland to join related training courses," Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If we need more people to offer short-term support, we can also make use of existing schemes to import talents, as well as work visas to cater for the need."
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the transport chief also said flight movements at the airport returned to pre-pandemic levels over Christmas, with a daily peak of about 1,150.
  <br>
  <br>
  The average daily number of passengers exceeded 180,000 during the holiday, with a peak of 190,000 on December 21, Chan said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A man who has been charged with murder and attempted robbery, in connection with an incident in Sham Shui Po more than three decades ago, appeared in Eastern Court on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Wen Wenye, 59, was arrested last November when he entered Hong Kong via the Shenzhen Bay Port.
  <br>
  <br>
  He is alleged to be one of three people who robbed a second-hand watch store on Pei Ho Street before fleeing in a car in 1991.
  <br>
  <br>
  A 56-year-old male shopkeeper died after being shot in the head.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Eastern Magistrates’ Court has adjourned the case pending transfer to the High Court.
  <br>
  <br>
  The defendant was again remanded in custody.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police are still searching for the two other suspects.
