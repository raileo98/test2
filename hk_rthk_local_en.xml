<div class="itemFullText">
 There were winning starts for the Hong Kong, China men's and women's squads on Friday as the Rugby Sevens got underway to much fanfare at the Kai Tak Sports Park.
 <br>
  <br>
  The SAR men's representatives - who are looking to defend their Melrose Claymores title - cruised to a 31-7 victory over the national team.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[We're] feeling pretty good, we went down early there, so we [had] good composure, good fightback to score some good tries out there," men's captain James Christie told RTHK after the win, who also credited the support of home fans at the stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You have to be here to witness it. It's nothing like I've seen before before. Obviously [the fans are] the eighth man on the pitch, so it really helps us, inspires us."
  <br>
  <br>
  They will look to keep their winning momentum going when they take on Japan on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The women's side, meanwhile, held on for a 29-14 win over Kazakhstan in the opener. They will next face Thailand.
  <br>
  <br>
  Co-captain Chloe Chan was confident that the squad can clinch the top prize, having finished as runners-up last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We trained hard in and out every day," Chan said. "Once we're on there, it's all the same stuff – if we all do our job well, then we'll be okay."
  <br>
  <br>
  The two matches were separated by an official opening ceremony featuring a dragon and lion dance, a performance by cheerleaders of South Korean baseball team Kia Tigers, and a laser show on the pitch.
  <br>
  <br>
  Irish rugby legend Brian O'Driscoll and former Hong Kong winger Salom Yiu also made an appearance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Outside the Melrose Claymores, 12 teams in the men's - and another 12 for the women's - fought to reach the knockout round.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both the New Zealand men's and women's are aiming to defend their Hong Kong Sevens titles for a third successive year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The women's squad, who are 12-time champions in the SAR, began the day with a 45-0 demolition of the national team.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was a really good game, and I thought we played pretty well," captain Sarah Hirini said after the match.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[We] did some pretty cool things out there, and obviously very stoked to get a win like that against China who are a very quality team."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Kiwis men's, meanwhile, also took care of business by beating Australia 21-12 in the opener.
  <br>
  <br>
  Argentina, which fielded only a men's team, are also emerging as favourites. They were dominant on Friday, with big wins over Ireland and the United States.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A Cathay Pacific flight to Bangkok was forced to return to Hong Kong after take-off on Friday after a deadly earthquake that hit Thailand and Myanmar.
 <br>
  <br>
  The powerful tremor left at least several people dead and dozens wounded in the two Southeast Asian countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to flight tracking websites, CX751 took off at Hong Kong International Airport just after 3pm, and was near Hainan island when it made a u-turn. It landed at Chek Lap Kok just before 5pm.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Airport Authority's website suggested the flight will set off again at 8.15pm on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Other Cathay Pacific flights to and from Bangkok today (Friday) are expected to experience delays," the SAR flag carrier said. "We are assessing the situation and will keep our customers informed with the latest updates."
  <br>
  <br>
  Another Bangkok-bound Cathay flight CX630 also returned to Singapore after take-off.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other flights on Friday between the SAR and Thailand were unaffected, according to the Airport Authority.
  <br>
  <br>
  Greater Bay Airlines said in a statement that services remain normal, while offering to change flights for passengers who have booked trips to and from Bangkok between Friday and Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, the Travel Industry Council said there are around six Hong Kong tour groups in Thailand, consisting less than 100 people. All of them are safe, the council confirmed.

<img alt="Fans gathered for day one of the Hong Kong Sevens. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797906_2_20250328181344.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Rugby fans from around the world showered praise on the brand new stadium in Kai Tak as this year's Hong Kong Sevens got underway on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  After decades at the Hong Kong Stadium in Causeway Bay, the three-day tournament has moved to Kai Tak Stadium, which can accommodate a larger crowd.
  <br>
  <br>
  People in the South Stand told RTHK that the new stadium modernises the tournament with new facilities and a large variety of food and drinks, all while preserving the event's rich traditions, including vibrant costumes, lively music and a passionate crowd.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zwelethu Kala from South Africa said he loves the new venue and that the fans have brought the same energy from the old stadium to Kai Tak Sporks Park.
  <br>
  <br>
  "What a beautiful stadium, wow! Biggest thing is, one, it now has a roof so it can close, get full-running rugby. And two, outside, the village, wow," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You also have a DJ outside, nice space for the kids to play in as well. It's just awesome. It's looking really, really good."
  <br>
  <br>
  Alexane, who travelled from Belgium with friends for her second Sevens, said Hong Kong is the ultimate destination for international rugby.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong is the main place. It's so interesting. It's the main city to go for rugby. I don't know anything about rugby, but Hong Kong is like the best place," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[The stadium is filled with] amazing colours. I really like the colours and everything is so practical. Honestly, there's so much room for tourists, and it's really nice."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Larger crowds. More cosy because we have aircon. I would like them to open [the roof], so the atmosphere would be better," said local fan Damon Wong, who was sporting a headpiece from the Japanese manga Chiikawa.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another fan from the SAR, Matt Grange, highlighted the improved amenities, praising the stadium's additional toilets and impressive food and drink outlets, including one of Asia's longest bars.

    MTR fares to freeze under adjustment mechanism
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<div>
<img alt="While MTR fares will freeze for 2025-26, commuters could face a steep hike next year after 3.36 percent of adjustments are brought forward. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797892_1_20250328173801.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 There is relief for MTR passengers after the fare adjustment formula – which takes into account factors such as inflation and median household income – showed that fares would freeze for the coming year.
 <br>
  <br>
  Under its operating agreement with the government, the MTR Corporation (MTRC) is entitled to an annual fare review using figures published by the Census and Statistics Department.
  <br>
  <br>
  Based on the department's latest figures on Friday, transportation sector wages rose 3.1 percent year on year, while inflation stood at 1.4 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The mean value of 2.25 percent is then curtailed by a so-called "productivity factor" linked to the MTRC’s profit from property development. The more it earns in a particular year, the higher the productivity factor.
  <br>
  <br>
  This year the productivity factor amounted to a deduction of 0.8 percent, bringing the increase down from 2.25 percent to 1.45 percent, below the threshold of 1.5 percent required to trigger an actual adjustment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Even if it exceeds the threshold, there is still another "affordability cap" where the actual fare adjustment cannot be higher than the change in median monthly household income, which recorded a slight drop last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  As a result of these constraints, fares will be frozen for the first time since 2022-23.
  <br>
  <br>
  The intended 1.45 percent increase, together with another 1.91 percent rise supposedly brought forward from last year, will both be rolled over to 2026-27, which means commuters could face a steep hike next year.

 The Hong Kong Sevens tournament kicked off with a bang at Kai Tak Stadium on Friday, as the Canadian and Japanese women's squads faced off.
 <br>
  <br>
  More than 1,000 spectators watched the inaugural Hong Kong Sevens match played at the new venue at 10:30am.

    ICAC chief lays down law on calls for invalid votes

<img alt="Danny Woo says the ICAC has started using an AI system to improve work efficiency. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797856_2_20250328151239.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The city's top graft-buster, Danny Woo, on Friday warned that authorities will take tough action against those who call for invalid votes to be cast during the upcoming election for the city's legislature at the end of the year.
 <br>
  <br>
  His remarks came after Chief Executive John Lee last week announced that the general election for the Legislative Council will be held on December 7, with a by-election to be held on September 7.
  <br>
  <br>
  In an interview with local media, Woo, who heads the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC), reminded the public that disrupting the electoral process is a legal offence.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Never ever try to challenge the law because it's clearly written that it's an offence for any person to incite others not to vote or to cast invalid votes through any public activities during the election period," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And also do not share or repost these remarks as there is a chance of breaking the law as well."
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, Woo noted that the number of complaints reported to the ICAC rose to 2,058 last year, three percent higher.
  <br>
  <br>
  Forty-four of the cases were made against the Hong Kong Correctional Services, and that was more than double that of a year earlier.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, Woo pointed out, only a small number of the cases reached the prosecution phase.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ICAC, he said, is seeking to use artificial intelligence to improve work efficiency and has launched an AI system, Dr Deep, based on mainland firm DeepSeek's AI models, to help combat corruption.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I want to emphasise that many of our own systems are developed by ourselves because many of them contain confidential and sensitive information," Woo said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So our computer systems are studied and maintained in-house and not operated on by outsiders.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This means our development of AI is also done by ourselves.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Since DeepSeek unveiled its large AI models, it's been a real eye-opener," Woo said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He hinted that the Dr Deep system could be available for public use in the future and that residents could search for corruption-related information on the system.

 Public transport operators are boosting services to accommodate the large crowds of passengers expected during the Hong Kong Sevens tournament.
 <br>
  <br>
  The three-day event at the new Kai Tak Stadium started on Friday.

  The MTR said it was increasing the frequency of trains on the Tuen Ma Line and deploying more staff than usual at Kai Tak and Sung Wong Toi stations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Citybus and KMB, meanwhile, said 11 special routes would be in operation at the end of each day of the tournament.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A patients' rights group says it hopes the government can use AI chatbots in its triage system at public hospitals to help patients gain a better understanding of their conditions and symptoms.
 <br>
  <br>
  “I have used the UK emergency service as well,” WeCareBill Foundation co-founder Kelly Yim said in RTHK's Backchat programme on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I find it quite useful when they have the AI chatbot to do the challenging bits, like differentiating the level of emergency of a patient.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I'm just thinking maybe we can do this with nurse consultations or triages, and try with more advanced technology so that maybe this risk [of misjudgements] can be mitigated.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Some people have expressed worries about being charged more because of being categorised wrongly during triages when the revamped healthcare charges come into effect from January 1.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under the changes, "critical" and "emergency" patients being treated at  accident and emergency (A&E) wards will have their charges exempted, while fees for “urgent”, “semi-urgent” and “non-urgent” patients will be raised to HK$400 from HK$180.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government has relaxed income and asset limits to expand eligibility for medical fee waivers and said about 1.4 million people are expected to benefit from the tweaks, up from 300,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the same programme, an official from the Hospital Authority reiterated that the revamp is aimed at focusing resources on serving those in need.
  <br>
  <br>
  “With all these measures, we are trying to reserve our healthcare resources [in order to help, in particular, acute, serious and critical patients]," the authority’s chief manager in allied health,  Priscilla Poon, said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “But at the same time, we won't forget [the less well-off sections of the public].
  <br>
  <br>
  “So that's the reason why we need ... balance.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We need to impose some kind of relaxation of our waiver mechanisms and safety net in order to help ... the poor, who are not really actually supported by other, say, private services.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, a former A&E doctor also urged the government to prioritise the implementation of advanced technology to help cope with a manpower shortage.
  <br>
  <br>
  Aaron Lee, who’s now a clinical assistant professor at the University of Hong Kong, said the new fees planned for emergency wards at public hospitals could reduce the burden on staff.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he stressed that the effect may only be short-term.
  <br>
  <br>
  “This effect will tail off," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We saw it with previous increases in fees in the departments before,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “So there must be some implementation of more important measures in the departments...
  <br>
  <br>
  "There may be implementation of the AI system, not only in the A&E departments, but also maybe at the primary-care level.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee said a big burden would be lifted from the public healthcare system if patients were able to conduct some sort of tests themselves before deciding whether to seek medical attention at hospitals.

    'Kowloon City won't be congested during the Sevens'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A Kowloon City district councillor believes the area will not be congested when Hong Kong Rugby Sevens tournament games end every evening.
 <br>
  <br>
  The three-day tournament that kicks off today will be staged at Kai Tak Sports Park for the first time ever, having been held at Hong Kong Stadium in Causeway Bay for decades.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on an RTHK radio programme on Friday, Vivian Wong, who also chairs a working group on boosting the local economy in the district, said previous test events at the new grounds had gone smoothly.
  <br>
  <br>
  "During the Hong Kong Sevens, spectators will be coming in and out at all times," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They won't enter or leave at the same time.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Therefore, it's kind of different than, say, the opening ceremony on March the first when they could test out what problems would arise if people left the venue all at once."
  <br>
  <br>
  Apart from visiting nearby malls and Kowloon City, Wong expects spectators will also head for the new Sevens fan village for live music, meet-and-greet opportunities with rugby teams, as well as drinks and food booths.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said the inaugural Kai Tak Dining Cove Carnival next to the Kai Tak Stadium will also be a lure for revellers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, a Kowloon City restaurant owner revealed on the same show that businesses near the stadium are already seeing a boom in business.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mark Lam pointed out that business in the area had gone up 20 percent whenever tests events were held, as well as during the stadium's opening ceremony.
  <br>
  <br>
  His eatery has been flexible with its opening hours whenever events are scheduled at the city's largest sports venue.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the past, before the pandemic, our restaurant closed at 3am," Lam said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Business was booming at that time.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But after and during the pandemic, the catering business was sluggish. We had to close by 10:30 or 11pm.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With the Kai Tak Sports Park opening, now we close around 1 o'clock in the morning, and we open at 11:30am, with no breaks during the day.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So customers can come during lunch, tea, or after shows at the venue."
  <br>
  <br>
  Pedestrian traffic in the district had surged by 20 to 30 percent during the stress tests and the opening ceremony, Lam added.

<div class="itemFullText">
 When Hong Kong artist Movana Chen moved to Lisbon in 2021, she started knitting together maps collected during Covid isolation in an attempt to unravel physical boundaries.
 <br>
  <br>
  She transformed the maps into large pieces of garment donned by herself and her partner, dancer Francisco Borges, as part of a performance art piece at Art Basel Hong Kong.
  <br>

   <div class="image-title-1">
    <span>
    </span>
   </div>
   <br>
   The inspiration for the performance – which sees the pair cocooned in the weaved-together maps – came from Chen’s time living near the Portuguese seaside, when she experienced pandemic-induced solitude.
   <br>
   <br>
   "[The act of weaving together] the maps is like inviting people and my friends during the lockdown period. So like in 2020, people can't send me the maps during that time. Everything was closed," she said.
   <br>
   <br>
   Chen said their performance, titled "Questioning the Line", also explores the entanglement between human and nature and the roles of borders and nationality.
   <br>
   <br>
   "For us it has different layers of lines, different lines to question. For example, one of the lines is this, between human and nature. Where is that line really?" Chen's partner, Borges told RTHK.
   <br>
   <br>
   "We are born from the land, we eat the food from the land, we drink the water from the land. And when we poison the land, and we poison the water, we poison ourselves. So where is really that barrier, that clear line?" he said.
   <br>

    <div class="image-title-1">
     <span>
     </span>
    </div>
    <br>
    To show human unity and interdependence, Chen also collects expired passports and gives them new life by knitting them together in a separate project called "Beyond the Surface".
    <br>
    <br>
    She is not the only artist exploring humanity and nature at this year's Art Basel.
    <br>
    <br>
    American painter and writer Alec Egan lost his home and studio to the Los Angeles fire in January. Despite the devastation, he created five new paintings to depict LA coastal scenes in a temporary studio provided by Anat Egbi Gallery, which is showcasing his works at Art Basel.
    <br>
    <br>
    Egan's new works – which reflects both disaster and nature – pays homage to his lost work and captures the eerie beauty of ash-filled skies.
    <br>
    <img src="https://rthk-s3-nps-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/mfile_1797813_3_L_20250328104141.jpg">
     <div class="image-title-1">
      <span>
      </span>
     </div>
     <br>
     "In the face of something really traumatic, he continues to focus on beauty and there is quiet solitude. So I hope that [audiences will take away] hopefulness," said the gallery's sales director Amanda McMorran.
     <br>
     <br>
     Adding another compelling voice to the fair is first-time exhibitor Shin Min from Seoul's P21 studio.
     <br>
     <img src="https://rthk-s3-nps-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/mfile_1797813_4_L_20250328104141.jpg">

      </div>
      <br>
      Drawing from her experience working in the service industry, her "Ew! There is hair in the food!!" exhibition highlights misogyny in Korea, and challenges the notion of never saying no to customers.
      <br>
      <br>
      "I talk about workers' hair because we are not robots. We are human and we are not machines. We have hair. We have spit," Shin said in explaining the central message of her work.
      <br>
      <br>
      Art Basel, the SAR's largest international art fair, brings together more than 240 galleries from around the world this year.

    Government strongly condemns UK report on HK

<img alt='The SAR government urged the UK to "respect international law" and "immediately stop interfering in Hong Kong matters." File photo: RTHK' src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797769_1_20250328093204.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Thursday said it strongly disapproved of and must resolutely refute the untruthful remarks, slanders and smears against various aspects of the SAR in the UK's six-monthly report on Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  "The HKSAR Government strongly condemns and rejects the UK's attempt through a so-called six-monthly report to make misleading and irresponsible remarks about Hong Kong matters, wantonly put politics above the rule of law and attempt to interfere in Hong Kong's law-based governance by despicable political manoeuvres," a government statement said.
  <br>
  <br>
  It urged the UK to discern facts from fallacies, respect international law and basic norms governing international relations, and stop interfering in Hong Kong matters.
  <br>
  <br>
  The statement said Hong Kong enjoyed a high degree of autonomy under the 'one country, two systems' principle, pointing out that the Sino-British Joint Declaration did not authorise the UK to interfere in Hong Kong's affairs after its return to the motherland.
  <br>
  <br>
  The statement also rejected UK criticism that laws safeguarding national security in the SAR had eroded rights and freedoms.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With at least 14 pieces of laws safeguarding national security in the UK, those remarks by the UK are not only totally distorting and confounding right and wrong, but they also entirely disregard the constitutional duty and practical needs of the HKSAR to legislate, and the positive effects brought by the enactment of the relevant national security legislation on economic development and protection of human rights," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government statement highlighted Hong Kong's number one ranking in the Economic Freedom of the World 2024 Annual Report, among 165 economies. It said it was evident that international funds and investments were confident in Hong Kong's development.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government spokesman stressed that "the rule of law in Hong Kong is strong and robust, and withstands the test of time", while human rights in the city have always been guaranteed constitutionally by both the Constitution and the Basic Law.

    Work under way to boost night-time services: HA

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hospital Authority (HA) has stressed that decisions on how and where to beef up public healthcare services will "depend on the actual situation", amid calls to offer more general outpatient services at night.
 <br>
  <br>
  Tony Ko, the authority's chief executive, also said on Thursday reforms to the city's public healthcare system should be looked at "in totality".
  <br>
  <br>
  At present, less than one-third of 74 government general outpatient clinics offer evening consultations, with services running until 10pm.
  <br>
  <br>
  During a Legislative Council meeting on Wednesday, health chief Lo Chung-mau was asked if authorities were planning to boost evening services so people need not seek help at accident and emergency wards.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lo responded by saying that work is being done to increase capacity.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked about offering more night-time services, Ko said that the HA is working to expand general outpatient clinic capacity.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We work closely with not only our primary healthcare colleagues to provide more sessions both during daytime, holidays, weekends as well as night time, and at the same time, we have close liaison with our private medical practitioner counterparts, encouraging them to do more sessions during holidays, during weekends, giving more general support to patients," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  With the administration facing a budget deficit, chairman Henry Fan said the HA is looking at ways to trim its expenditure. The body is set to receive some HK$100 billion in government subvention for 2025/26.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fan said the authority should focus on boosting productivity, including cutting administrative work for frontline staff, further using technology and simplifying procurement procedures.
  <br>
  <br>
  The most painless way to save money is to reduce waste, he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, public hospitals recorded a turnover rate of 5 percent for full-time doctors in the 12 months ending in January. Nearly 340 doctors left the public workforce, while some 7,200 doctors remain.
  <br>
  <br>
  There are now over 29,500 nurses, with a departure rate of 7.2 percent during the same period.

 The chairman of Polytechnic University (PolyU)'s governing council on Thursday said Hong Kong must make use of its super-connector role under One Country, Two Systems to support the nation's diplomatic efforts.
 <br>
  <br>
  At a seminar focusing on China's diplomacy in the new era, Lam Tai-fai said Western countries such as the United States are creating problems through unfair practices like sanctions and protectionism.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the other hand, Lam added, Beijing continued to promote peace and cooperation through building friendships with countries. He said one of PolyU's missions is to nurture patriotic students with a global perspective.
  <br>
  <br>
  Also at the seminar was Huo Yuzhen, former Chinese ambassador to the Czech Republic and Romania.
  <br>
  <br>
  The veteran diplomat was involved in a Foreign Ministry initiative aimed at fostering cooperation between China and Central and Eastern European nations, such as Poland, Greece and Serbia.
  <br>
  <br>
  She described the initiative, which began in 2012, as a success, pointing to achievements in many areas which benefitted the people of both sides.
  <br>
  <br>
  Looking ahead, Huo suggested focusing on new areas of cooperation, such as green energy, advanced technology, and artificial intelligence.
  <br>
  <br>
  At the same event, former Chinese ambassador to Georgia and Tajikistan Yue Bin spoke about the development of Sino-Russian relations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yue described how the bond between the two neighbours has grown stronger over time, evolving into a comprehensive strategic partnership building on mutual trust.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong will continue to deepen international co-operation and integrate into national development despite a complex external environment, Chief Executive John Lee said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Writing on his Facebook page after attending the opening ceremony of the Boao Forum in Hainan, Lee said he was encouraged by Vice Premier Ding Xuexiang's remarks.
  <br>
  <br>
  In his speech, Ding pointed out four suggestions for Asia and the world's future and "three perspectives" on China's economic development.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee said the SAR must move forward steadily by leveraging its unique position of supporting the country's development while connecting with the rest of the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Under One Country, Two Systems, Hong Kong is the world's only open economy that simultaneously enjoys both Chinese and international advantages," he wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  The chief executive outlined plans to continue pursuing reforms with breakthrough thinking, including advancing projects like the Northern Metropolis and Greater Bay Area development.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee met the director-general of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, Qu Dongyu, earlier in the morning.
  <br>
  <br>
  During the meeting, Lee discussed the city's potential for developing its fisheries and agricultural sector with diverse food industries.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also expressed interest in working with the organisation on water quality simulation systems and sustainable aquaculture development, according to his Facebook page.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Thursday said they are investigating a suspected assault at a flat in Sham Shui Po after a video shared online appeared to show an elderly woman being physically abused by a helper.
 <br>
  <br>
  Officers said a woman reported last week that her mother, 81, had been abused in a flat at Lai On Estate.
  <br>
  <br>
  Footage reportedly from a surveillance camera appeared to show the elderly woman tied up in bed and being gagged with a towel.
  <br>
  <br>
  She was later taken to hospital with injuries to her face and hands, police said.
  <br>
  <br>
  No arrests have been made over the alleged incident.

    Thais give green light to draft law for casinos

<img alt="Protesters rally near Government House in Bangkok against the casino-entertainment complex bill. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797665_1_20250327133509.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Thailand's cabinet on Thursday approved a draft law for casinos and entertainment complexes, as the government looks to attract more tourists and build a major gaming industry.
 <br>
  <br>
  Gambling is mostly banned in Thailand apart from state-controlled horse racing, the lottery and on some sports but successive governments have pressed the case for allowing casinos to draw in more foreign visitors and create more jobs and state revenue.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the latest draft approved by cabinet will significantly limit how many Thai punters can go to casinos, with an entry fee of 5,000 baht and proof of at least 50 million baht in bank deposits, effectively blocking large swathes of the population, where per capita gross domestic product is about US$7,300.
  <br>
  <br>
  A deputy finance minister said this month the assets requirement for Thai nationals would be dropped because it would exclude too many people.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another restriction is that the casino area may only occupy up to 10 percent of the entire space of an entertainment complex, according to a government statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The draft law will be sent to parliament, and if passed, will also need approval from the Senate and the king.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra said details of the law were not final as parliament would have the final say.
  <br>
  <br>
  A Citi report late last year estimated that about half of people aged 20 and more in Thailand could be casino players, providing a base for the country to potentially become the world's third-largest gambling destination.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government, led by the populist Pheu Thai party, hopes to attract at least 100 billion baht in new investment in casinos and entertainment complexes and see an annual boost to foreign arrivals of 5 to 10 percent, while generating revenue of more than 12 billion baht a year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite most betting and gambling being outlawed in Thailand, illicit operations have operated for years.
  <br>
  <br>
  A January opinion poll in Thailand indicated there was opposition to the plan, however, and some political parties have argued that building a gambling industry would worsen social problems.
  <br>
  <br>
  Several countries in Southeast Asia have legalised casinos, but only a few like Singapore has been successful in drawing global giants such as Las Vegas Sands Corp on the back of robust regulations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tourism is a key driver of Thailand, Southeast Asia's second-largest economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  This year, the government expects 38 million foreign arrivals, closing in on its pre-pandemic record of nearly 40 million tourists. (Reuters)

<img alt='Irina Fan, director of research at the Trade Development Council, says the impact of US tariffs on Hong Kong is "relatively mild". File photo: RTHK' src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797662_1_20250327132129.jpg&q=60">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Trade Development Council said Hong Kong exporters are well-prepared for the new round of US tariffs set to take effect on April 2.
 <br>
  <br>
  The council's export confidence index for the first quarter stood at 51, up 1.8 points from the fourth quarter of 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  The expectation index, which shows exporters’ expectations for the next quarter, also rose. It climbed one point to 51.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on RTHK’s
  <i>
   Backchat
  </i>
  programme on Thursday, the council’s director of research Irina Fan said the city’s export performance is driven by strong sales and procurement, as well as higher prices.
  <br>
  <br>
  Regarding the impact of US tariffs on local exports, Fan described it as “relatively mild” compared with some of Washington's major trading partners, including China, Canada and Mexico.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Hong Kong's exporters are quite well-prepared for higher US tariffs," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Our exporters took a very agile and flexible business strategy also actually in the past few years to mitigate the risk from higher US tariffs, which actually started in the year of 2018.
  <br>
  <br>
  “They already adopted strategies like diversifying their sourcing, engaging with new partners and new markets, relocating some of their production lines, and also continuing to reduce their reliance, the selling to the US markets."
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite trade tensions, Fan said 75 percent of exporters expect their profits to remain stable or grow, and that industries such as jewellery, equipment and materials, timepieces, electronics and toys remained positive in their outlook.

    'Art Basel, Art Central a barometer for art market'

<img alt="Daniel Kwok, an independent art consultant, says that art fairs and auctions will give the city's art market a boost. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797660_1_20250327130541.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An expert has said that ongoing art shows and upcoming auctions will give the mainland and Hong Kong art scene a boost, and serve as a barometer for future market performance.
 <br>
  <br>
  Last year, the broader art market suffered a notable hit, with sales of modern and contemporary works declining by about 40 percent year on year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sales of traditional Chinese artworks also fared poorly, with transactions for Chinese painting and calligraphy auctions dropping by more than 20 percent year on year to 12.6 billion yuan last year, according to independent consultant Daniel Kwok.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I would say the traditional Chinese art market remained depressed last year, as the weak performance of the real economy and financial markets has clearly reduced buyers’ interest in the art market," he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Even though stock markets in mainland China and Hong Kong seem to be recovering, collectors and buyers still need time to rebuild their confidence," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, Kwok said that events such as Art Basel and Art Central, as well as auctions next month, will offer more clues on whether sentiment in the art market has improved, and if Beijing’s recent stimulus measures have had any effect on collectors.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I believe Art Basel and Art Central will create an exciting weekend for Hong Kong, providing a direct boost to both our cultural and tourism industries. These events also showcase the strength of the Hong Kong art market," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, the art specialist noted that despite the economic downturn, interest in Chinese porcelain antiques have been growing.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Because those imperial porcelain made for the emperors are all produced with exceptional craftsmanship, so even by today's standards, these pieces remain stunning to us," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kwok said another hot trend is Ming-style wood furniture famous for its intricate designs and Huanghuali wood – which comes from a rare species of rosewood. He noted that a Huanghuali wood table was sold for more than 45 million yuan on the mainland last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Looking ahead, Kwok cautioned that the heightened tension between China and the US might weigh on the art market.
  <br>
  <br>
  He pointed out that US tariff hikes may affect art shipments between the two countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I believe the unstable international climate will make buyers more cautious and conservative,” he explained.

    Govt 'pays almost all drug costs despite fee hike'
   </title>

<img alt="" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797648_1_20250327115415.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hospital Authority's chief pharmacist said on Thursday the upcoming hike in medication fees will help to subsidise the purchase of new drugs, as well as those used to fight cancer or rare diseases.
 <br>
  <br>
  Starting January, patients have to pay HK$20 for a four-week supply of drugs, up from the current HK$15 for a 16-week supply.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on an RTHK radio programme, William Chui pointed out that the government is still covering nearly all healthcare costs even with the hike.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The government now subsidises 92 to 93 percent of the cost of a drug," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Even after increasing the fees, 90 percent of the cost is still covered.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Therefore, we cannot actually recover the cost of the drug, we can only hope to reduce waste.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We hope patients will understand that – when there is medicine they do not need or when they have a lot of drugs left over at home, they can let their doctors know."
  <br>
  <br>
  He emphasised that even though each prescription is set to be for a maximum for four weeks, this does not mean patients have to return to hospitals and clinics for another prescription after the period.
  <br>
  <br>
  Otherwise, the workload of pharmacies will be much heavier, he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chui added that patients can still be dispensed a maximum supply of 24 weeks each time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the consultant of the accident and emergency wards of the New Territories East cluster believes higher fees for A&E wards will not discourage patients from turning up.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If you ask whether the higher charge will cause patients to not come, I believe it won't," Cheng Chi-hung said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Because they will gradually know how to assess the situation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Sometimes patients might not be clear about their condition.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Obviously, for a cold, they will turn to primary healthcare.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But when it comes to cases like a sprain after exercising, or a suspected bone fracture, I believe patients will still choose to head to accident and emergency wards."
  <br>
  <br>
  Non-critical and non-emergency cases, or those deemed as category three to five patients, will need to pay HK$400 per visit – up from the present flat rate of HK$180 – starting next year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hung noted that it is difficult to predict that there will be a decline in the number of A&E patients, even though the figure dropped by five percent after the previous fee increment in 2017.

 The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) says the winter influenza season has come to an end after about 11 weeks, but people should next get jabs to protect themselves against a possible summer flu season.
 <br>
  <br>
  Around 800 severe and fatal cases were recorded among adults over winter, while 10 children became seriously ill after catching the virus, the centre said on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a press briefing, CHP controller Edwin Tsui said the predominant strain of the virus during winter, A (H1), was also prevalent in 2018/19, but the number of severe and fatal cases among adults this time decreased by 15 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tsui said severe cases involving children dropped by 60 percent when compared with six years ago, thanks to a higher vaccination rate.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said people should also get vaccinated in case flu strikes again this summer.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think the risk or the probability of having a summer influenza season in Hong Kong is still present, and usually the summer influenza season will come in July and August," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "After this winter influenza season, we have to guard against any respiratory infections, especially the summer influenza activities and seasons. So what members of the public should do is to get vaccinated."
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the Hospital Authority said it will increase manpower around Easter.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For Easter, according to previous experience, the attendance will slowly grow along the four days of the public holidays. After that, there will be the peak in the following weekend," chief manager Larry Lee said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The good thing about this year is we don't bundle the Easter holiday together with the Ching Ming Festival."

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 People who have financial difficulties would be able to apply online for waivers of healthcare charges in a few months' time.
 <br>
  <br>
  The online applications will be possible under an expansion of waiver mechanism for healthcare charges as part of reforms to the city’s healthcare sector, the Hospital Authority said on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  To apply, patients must at present submit documents at public hospitals or social service centres for assessment.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, Priscilla Poon, the authority’s chief manager of allied health, said officials are looking to utilise technology.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We are thinking that at about the end of this year we would be able to release a simple version of this waiver app, that the patients are able to access [via] ‘HA Go’ to see how long their waiver period is and what the validity period is,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “By around the second quarter of next year, we should be able to launch this online application.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Under the reforms, the government will relax the income and asset requirements for people to qualify for a fee waiver, meaning an extra 1.1 million people will be eligible.
  <br>
  <br>
  The validity period of each waiver application will be extended from 12 to 18 months, which Poon said is a way to alleviate the workload of medical social workers.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It reduces the frequency of visits of patients to the medical social worker department,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among other changes to the fee waiver mechanism are the inclusion of people aged under 65 who use general outpatient services occasionally and the revision of the definition of “family” to exclude members living with the patient who have no direct financial ties from asset reviews.

<img alt="Christopher Hui says more than 900 capital investment migrant applications have been received. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797505_1_20250326155229.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Wednesday said a renewed capital investment migrant scheme could bring investments worth HK$27 billion to Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  The New Capital Investment Entrant Scheme was launched in March last year, with the minimum amount of investment for applicants tripled to HK$30 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a written reply to Legco, financial services minister Christopher Hui said more than 900 applications have been received for the scheme.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said about 750 applications have been approved in principle, and some 340 cases have been officially greenlit.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister said HK$27 billion of investments will be brought into the SAR if all cases are approved.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hui said none of the applicants have invested in residential flats so far, and that among the more than HK$10 billion of approved investments, some HK$5.1 billion have been made in collective investment schemes, HK$3.6 billion were put into equities, and HK$1.8 billion were made in debt securities.

    HK, Hainan to cooperate in promoting trade ties

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee said on Wednesday a cooperation deal between Hong Kong and Hainan will contribute to the nation further opening up on the back of the free-trade advantages from the two regions.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lee made the remarks as he signed a memorandum of understanding with officials from the southern island province to boost trade and economic ties between the two sides.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee, who is attending the annual Boao Forum for Asia on Hainan, said Hong Kong has been the region's major source of foreign investment and that Hainan has also invested heavily in the SAR with the issuances of more than 13 billion yuan worth of offshore bonds.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the cooperation deal will make use of the free-trade advantages to be found on both sides and covers five key areas – trade and investment, finance, data flow, tourism and personnel exchange.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We very much welcome Hainan to expand the scope of recognition of Hong Kong professionals in Hainan, so as to provide more development opportunities for Hong Kong's professional services sector in the region, and to complement the advantages of Hainan's international level of its professional services, while serving the vigorous development of Hainan Free Trade Port," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee also said the cooperation deal will help the two regions to create new synergies in their supply chain expansions and explore the Asean markets together.
  <br>
  <br>
  Specifically, the deal offers support for Hong Kong firms in setting up processing factories in Hainan for premium consumer brands and also encourages Hainan to open up its finance, law, accounting, consulting, exhibition and construction sectors to professionals from the SAR.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Housing Society on Wednesday announced two subsidised flat projects in Fanling and Kwun Tong, with units to be sold at 70 percent of market value, will go on sale in April.
 <br>
  <br>
  The "Hemma Fab" project on Jockey Club Road in Fanling offers about 650 units with saleable areas ranging from 302 to 616 square feet, and prices from HK$2.3 million to HK$5.4 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the "Hemma Emerald" project on Anderson Road offers 960 units with saleable areas ranging from 302 to 664 square feet, and prices from about HK$2.5 million to HK$6.3 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  And although the Housing Authority will change the ratio for quota allocation between Green Form and White Form applicants under the Home Ownership Scheme from 40:60 to 50:50 in October, the ratio for the two projects will remain at 40:60.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will take reference to [the Housing Authority's] implementation, and we may add these new arrangements in the next phase," the Housing Society's development and marketing director Monita Ko said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ko added that about 40 percent of units will be reserved for families with elderly members or newborns.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eligible people can apply for the two projects from April 1 to 14.

    Certify your subdivided flat early or pay more: govt

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Discounts will be offered to landlords who get their subdivided homes certified early under a proposed certification system, according to housing minister Winnie Ho.
 <br>
  <br>
  The government announced last year a regulatory regime to manage the city's subdivided units and hope to kick-start the process by the end of this year or early 2026, depending on the legislation process.
  <br>
  <br>
  Landlords will first have 12 months to declare their dwellings as "basic housing units". A grace period of 36 months will follow, not just to help owners complete certification, but also give tenants ample time to relocate if their flat is deemed unsuitable for living.
  <br>
  <br>
  To certify as a basic housing unit, owners must hire a building professional who checks if the flat meets a set of prescribed requirements. If not, modifications will have to be made.
  <br>
  <br>
  A fee is also payable to the government, and Ho explained why this was necessary in an interview with RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The administrative fees generated by this exercise should not be borne by all taxpayers. We expect to fix the problems involving around 110,000 units within 36 months. There will be a lot of documents for my colleagues to go through. This is the duty of affected landlords, so we’re merely trying to recoup the costs," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The housing chief said landlords who complete the certification in the first 12 months of the grace period will pay the least – or even nothing.
  <br>
  <br>
  The fee then goes up in the second year, and rises again in the final year.
  <br>
  <br>
  She expected the fee to be "a few thousand" dollars, with a final decision to be made later.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked about the likelihood that landlords will offload such costs to tenants, Ho pointed out they could turn to public housing units.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There will be a lot of options for tenants. We have 20,000 transitional homes and 30,000 light public housing units. As for traditional public rental housing, 158,000 units will be completed in the next five years… If the rents (for basic housing units) become unreasonable, tenants will have a choice of moving elsewhere," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government has announced that each basic housing unit must also have a window facing the street or semi-enclosed light well for ventilation and lighting reasons. But after hearing views from stakeholders and conducting site visits, Ho confirmed officials may also consider accepting windows facing fully-enclosed light wells, citing constraints of old buildings.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said there are about 2,000 such units around the city, and believes they won't constitute a hygiene issue as long as the light wells are kept clean.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lawmakers will discuss the proposal at a Legislative Council panel next Monday, and Ho said she looks forward to any feedback to fine-tune the arrangements.

    GBA cities need to maximise tourism synergy: survey

<img alt="The study, led by the Polytechnic University, suggests cities in the Greater Bay Area work together to grow the tourism market together. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797477_1_20250326142939.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Findings from a study led by the Polytechnic University’s School of Hotel and Tourism Management have indicated there’s great potential for cities within the Greater Bay Area (GBA) to collaborate further in their tourism strategies.
 <br>
  <br>
  The project, which also involved the University of Macau and Sun Yat-sen University, started about two years ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  Researchers conducted site visits to Hong Kong, Macau and nine other GBA cities on the mainland to look at their tourism resources.
  <br>
  <br>
  They also analysed 200,000 comments from popular online platforms and interviewed 182 residents, tourism officials and business owners in local communities to better understand travel experiences in the GBA.
  <br>
  <br>
  The study found that GBA cities share many similarities in their tourism strengths, such as food, cultural heritage and natural resources.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Professor Tony Tse from the study team said the region has failed to take advantage of them, noting that there is a dearth of long-haul travellers in many GBA cities.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The 11 cities have all their attractions, they have their own unique points about tourism... I think they can work together in a very complementary way to attract visitors from both within and outside the region," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Professor Hung Kam, the principal investigator, said GBA cities should build a "regional tourism brand," such as by coming up with travel itineraries that include multiple destinations.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong has a very unique cuisine with its [cha chaan teng] and others, such as Michelin restaurants," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Macau has a very unique cuisine with Portuguese cuisine fusioned with Chinese.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Zhongshan has its famous roast pigeon, and Guangzhou has double-skinned milk dessert.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So every destination has its uniqueness," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And we can organise this gastronomy tour, not only to explore cuisines in Hong Kong but across the region.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And that could be more appealing to those who only offered Hong Kong cuisine, for example."
  <br>
  <br>
  The PolyU professor said that even though Hong Kong is a well-developed tourism destination, there are still many opportunities for growth through working more closely with others in the GBA.
  <br>
  <br>
  She proposed authorities in different cities establish a central unit to coordinate regional branding efforts and set up a one-stop online platform to distribute travel information to travellers.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The organiser of Art Basel Hong Kong said on Wednesday this year's edition aims to strengthen Hong Kong's position as an arts and cultural hub while connecting creative ecosystems across the globe.
 <br>
  <br>
  In an exclusive interview with RTHK, director Angelle Siyang-Le said the event brings together 240 galleries from 42 countries and places, including 23 newcomers.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, "it's not only about the number of galleries, what we focus on is the content of what the gallery is bringing," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think our galleries continue to bring top quality artworks to our regions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That also shows how much the galleries really value the support from the collectors in Asia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Siyang-Le said she expects a good turnout especially from Southeast Asia, noting that collectors from the region were showing strong interest.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Apart from Hong Kong and mainland China, which remain the [biggest groups of people attending], people from the Philippines and Singapore are definitely on the rise," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under moves unveiled in the Budget this year, Art Basel is also partnering with the Tourism Board to create "immersive experience zones" and promote local culture and tourism.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We want to make sure that locally people understand the importance of culture, but more importantly we want to [take the Hong Kong brand international] through all our Basel shows," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We want to promote the living culture of Hong Kong and most importantly to remind people outside of Hong Kong constantly and regularly that Hong Kong is such an amazing place to visit."
  <br>
  <br>
  The premium art fair will run from Friday to Sunday at the Convention and Exhibition Centre in Wan Chai.
  <br>
  <br>
  With the fair expanding into public spaces like M+ Museum and Tai Kwun, Siyang-Le said the moves are happening because she wants to make art accessible beyond just the convention centre.

 Secretary for Home and Youth Affairs Alice Mak said there has been a strong response to various government youth programmes.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on RTHK’s
  <i>
   Overview Policy
  </i>
  programme, Mak said application numbers for various activities, such as internships and exchange programmes, have gone up in recent years.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister cited a 16-week internship scheme in Dunhuang, Gansu province, during which students learnt the history of the ancient city and trained as tour guides to welcome tourists from all over the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said the overall positive response is due to the proactive outreach by officials in the past two years.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We have introduced various measures during this term of government. Therefore, we have to get into the schools to introduce all these measures so students are aware of the programmes that they can participate in,” Mak said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The youth affairs chief also said the government encourages students who have taken part in these programmes to join “Youth Link”, a network established last September and is part of the Youth Development Blueprint.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said the network already has more than 10,000 members.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mak said youngsters can share their experience with fellow students through the “Youth Link”.
  <br>
  <br>
  She added that one of the floors in Youth Square in Chai Wan will be renovated and a studio will be set up, so young people can share their stories through videos.

    'All systems go at Kai Tak for rugby showcase'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Kai Tak Sports Park said it's ready to host the Hong Kong Rugby Sevens tournament later this week.
 <br>
  <br>
  “We are fine-tuning our arrangements, and we learn from our past experiences. We adjust our operations and enhance communication with various parties and maintain continuous improvement,” Tang King-shing, a Kai Tak Sports Park director, told reporters on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We are confident that we are ready for the Rugby Sevens.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The venue experienced mishaps earlier. In one incident, fans at the World Snooker Grand Prix were told to leave while a match was still in progress.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Rugby Sevens will take place from Friday to Sunday at the new Kai Tak Stadium, having moved from Hong Kong Stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  Security checks will be conducted outside the venue, with spectators asked not to bring long umbrellas.
  <br>
  <br>
  Organisers also said they have retained the iconic South Stand – a ground for rugby fans donning elaborate outfits – which will have a “complete upgrade” in its new home.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We are very pleased to see our fans in fancy dress enjoying themselves in the South Stand,” said Hong Kong China Rugby executive director Bryan Rennie.
  <br>
  <br>
  “They have a good idea of what is appropriate and what is not. We have a list of prohibited items… We encourage all of our fans to follow that list, to ensure that they’re not bringing in any props that won’t be allowed into the stadium.“
  <br>
  <br>
  A fan village outside the stadium will hold various activities such as live stage performances, and all matches will be shown live on a big screen.
  <br>
  <br>
  But organisers said the opening hours at the village will be shorter than previously announced “to make egress as smooth as possible”.
  <br>
  <br>
  “There’s still plenty of time for people to enjoy themselves. We don’t view this as a negative, this is a positive response,” said Rennie.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also said about 43,000 tickets have been snapped up, and is optimistic that the three-day event would be sold out.

    Malls set to get more room for business

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Development Bernadette Linn said on Wednesday officials will soon come up with measures to allow shopping malls to host more business activities within their public open spaces.
 <br>
  <br>
  That came after a revamped ante-chamber meeting at the Legislative Council, where officials bounce ideas off lawmakers based on their membership in specific panels, rather than a more general group.
  <br>
  <br>
  Linn said lawmakers generally welcomed the government's idea for malls, which is meant to give the economy a shot in the arm.
  <br>
  <br>
  "How can we remove barriers and allow owners to make good use of spaces to host activities, to drive up the economic environment in the community?" she told lawmakers after the meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  "How can we streamline our vetting?"
  <br>
  <br>
  Linn also said officials are studying whether to give floor-area concessions to developers for building carparks above ground and not just for underground facilities.
  <br>
  <br>
  For her part, Secretary for Housing Winnie Ho said she gave an update to lawmakers about how officials have lowered the construction cost to date for building light public housing flats by around HK$6 billion to HK$21 billion mainly through the improved use of modular integrated construction.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both Deputy Financial Secretary Michael Wong and development panel chairman Lo Wai-kwok hailed the revamped meeting prodedure, saying it allows more frank and free exchange of ideas between the two sides.

    New A&amp;E fee to bring timely treatment in urgent cases
   </title>
   <link>
    https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1797455-20250326.htm

    <![CDATA[<div>
<img alt="" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797455_1_20250326115900.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Secretary for Health says the new fee for people seeking help at accident and emergency wards in public hospitals can result in quicker treatment for more serious cases.
 <br>
  <br>
  Starting January 1 next year, non-critical and non-emergency patients will have to pay HK$400 per visit, up from the present flat fee of HK$180.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on an RTHK programme on Wednesday, Lo Chung-mau pointed out that the new fee is reasonable, saying that charges for similar services in other places can exceed US$1,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted that category four and five patients, or those deemed as "semi-urgent" and "non-urgent" respectively, now account for 60 percent of the cases.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lo said this has led to urgent patients – or category three cases – not getting treated in time sometimes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have not met the target of treating 90 percent of [category three] patients within 30 minutes," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have only managed to treat about 70 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Now we think we should be able to improve on that.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Through the fee adjustments, we hope to help more category three patients and meet our service targets, allowing them to be treated sooner."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lo said the government has taken into account public affordability, how to better utilise services, as well as cost sharing when coming up with the adjustments.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lo emphasised that while evening outpatient services have been stepped up, patients will not opt for that if A&E fees remain at a low level.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Hospital Authority chief executive Tony Ko pointed out that the decision not to exempt category three A&E patients from the fee rise helps to avoid unnecessary arguments.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have talked to a lot of colleagues, especially those from A&E," he told a Commercial Radio show.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In terms of triage, it's very clear for category one and two patients because we will look at their vital signs.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But sometimes, when it comes to category three and four, it's not that easy to differentiate between the two.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Most of the time, it's clear.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But to avoid unnecessary argument and taking into consideration day-to-day operations, we think that the charge of HK$400 is suitable."
  <br>
  <br>
  Under the revamp, each drug prescription will be for up to a maximum of four weeks, down from up to 16 weeks at present.
  <br>
  <br>
  Drugs will cost HK$20 per four-week supply at specialist outpatient clinics and HK$5 at general outpatient clinics.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ko pointed out that patients can still be dispersed a maximum of 24 weeks drug supply each time, depending on the doctor's prescription.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added public education will be stepped up to ensure that people are aware of the adjustments.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hospital Authority has suspended the use of about 200 examination lights of the same model as that involved in a recent incident that saw a surgical lamp fall at Hong Kong Adventist Hospital in Tsuen Wan.
 <br>
  <br>
  The authority said late on Tuesday that it has been notified of the incident, which saw the lamp hit a doctor and a healthcare staff while a patient was under examination, by the Department of Health and the manufacturer.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As a precautionary measure, the Hospital Authority has immediately halted the use of all ceiling-mounted examination lights of the relevant model," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Temporary replacements from other manufacturers or using different models have been carried out to ensure that clinical services remain unaffected.
  <br>
  <br>
  The authority urged the manufacturer to complete thorough inspections as soon as possible and to guarantee the safety of the examination lights.
  <br>
  <br>
  Until then, it said, hospitals and clinics will not use the model.
  <br>
  <br>
  It stressed that all ceiling-mounted medical equipment in hospitals and clinics undergo regular maintenance and servicing.
  <br>
  <br>
  The authority will closely monitor the manufacturer to ensure proper inspection, maintenance and servicing of medical equipment, safeguarding the safety of both patients and staff.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong, China and hosts Singapore battled to a goalless draw on Tuesday night as they began the final round of their AFC Asian Cup football qualifying campaign.
 <br>
  <br>
  This extended Hong Kong’s unbeaten run against Singapore to seven games, of which the SAR had secured victories on three occasions.
  <br>
  <br>
  But it was the hosts who dominated the first half, forcing the SAR squad to sub out attacking midfielder Wong Wai for defender Yue Tze-nam in the 34th minute to withstand the pressure.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SAR squad had a much better performance after the break, building a more structured offence, but could not catch a break.
  <br>
  <br>
  The hosts had two goals disallowed, including a lovely chip shot by Shawal Anuar in the 77th minute that was ruled offside.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong will be back to play at Kai Tak Sports Park on June 10 against India for their next qualifying match.
  <br>
  <br>
  To earn a spot in the 2027 Asian Cup finals in Saudi Arabia, the SAR will need to come out on top of Group C, which also features Bangladesh.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Coleman Wong’s history-making performance at the Miami Open will serve as a huge morale boost for the SAR’s next generation of tennis players, Hong Kong, China’s tennis chief said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 20-year-old became the first-ever player from the SAR to get a win at a Masters 1000 match, and reached the event’s round of 32.
  <br>
  <br>
  Michael Cheng, president of Hong Kong China Tennis Association, said it was a remarkable achievement.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The draw size of a 1000 event is actually 96, which means that we're putting him inside the top 100 players in the world and he is able to get through a couple of rounds,” he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  “He's done something which no one has done before in Hong Kong.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The city’s tennis boss said Wong’s groundbreaking result would inspire a lot of young players in the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  “What we're looking at in the tennis generation here overall is to make sure that one generation is better than the last one,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, tennis has retained its "Tier A" sport status for two more years, avoiding a significant funding cut.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cheng said the decision is vital to the development of the sport in the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It's not just about the funding, but it's also about the coaching and the technical support and the strength and conditioning support and the sports science support coming from the Sports Institute.
  <br>
  <br>
  “If you put it all together, it's the complete package,” he said.

<img alt="Experts say family doctors should educate patients about whether a visit to the accident and emergency unit is necessary. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797359_1_20250325203807.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A family physician said on Tuesday that the government's overhaul of healthcare charges could motivate people to prioritise their overall health instead of only focusing on treating a disease.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lau Ho-lim, vice president of general affairs at the Hong Kong College of Family Physicians, said it is important for family doctors to educate patients about urgent and non-urgent symptoms so they could decide whether a visit to the accident and emergency unit is necessary.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If we promote health – and with a healthy lifestyle and with a very good management of chronic diseases – a lot of complications and a lot of acute conditions can be prevented," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In turn, it will reduce the attendance to specialist operations departments or the A&E department."
  <br>
  <br>
  Dr Lau pointed out that the cost of advanced pathology and non-urgent imaging tests in the public sector remain significantly lower than those in the private sector.
  <br>
  <br>
  Head of healthcare and social innovation at Our Hong Kong Foundation, Dicky Chow, welcomed the government's review of the public healthcare fee structure.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chow believes it will enhance the healthcare system’s sustainability and ensure that public funds are used more effectively.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, Chow urged the government to enhance the capacity of outpatient and primary care services.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also suggested that authorities should establish more evening clinics and better utilise community pharmacies to help meet demand.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the Society for Community Organisation (SoCo) expressed the concern that the proposed fee adjustments could add significant financial burden to grassroots and lower-middle class patients with chronic illnesses.
  <br>
  <br>
  They emphasised the need for a more comprehensive medical fee waiver system to prevent these groups from missing out on necessary treatments due to financial constraints.
  <br>
  <br>
  SoCo also suggested that the government should clarify how increased fees would enhance public healthcare services.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Tuesday said that artificial intelligence is a game changer for Hong Kong in its goal to become a more sustainable society, as the city goes all out to achieve its carbon emission goals.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chan made the remarks on the second day of the "2025 Hong Kong Climate Forum" in Kowloon, where he also noted that there is an urgency to speed up the green transition in the face of more frequent extreme weather events, record-breaking heat, rising sea levels, as well as increasing stress on the public health system.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said that Hong Kong is dedicated to reaching carbon neutrality by 2050, and is especially focusing on net-zero electricity generation, green transport, buildings, and waste reduction.
  <br>
  <br>
  The financial secretary said that not only can AI empower specific green tech but it can act as a catalyst for encouraging behaviourial changes, while transforming various sectors and businesses.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Clearly, AI has vast potential in optimising energy production and consumption," he told participants.
  <br>
  <br>
  "AI can also accelerate the invention of new materials. It can improve climate modelling and forecasting, enhancing our preparedness in the face of natural disasters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "From energy-saving tech for home appliances and vehicles to smarter traffic management, these innovations are spreading across our country and the world at large," he said, adding that AI could also help optimise capital arrangements to achieve sustainable returns.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan also pointed out that Hong Kong is now developing AI on five fronts, including in super-computing capabilities, algorithms, data, capital, and talent.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The annual Art Central fair is returning to Central Harbourfront from Wednesday with works from more than 100 galleries around the world.
 <br>
  <br>
  Corey Andrew Barr, the fair director, said he expects a good turnout for the event, which features workshops, installations and art performances.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Last year we had over 40,000 people here and we expect to see something similar this year, if not greater,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  To mark its 10th anniversary, the fair debuts the "Legend" gallery to highlight lesser-known artists from earlier generations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among the works on show is a collection by Japanese “rainbow artist” Ay-O as presented by Whitestone Gallery.
  <br>
  <br>
  “So the Legend section is a new thing for us,” said Inessa Li, art adviser at Whitestone Gallery.
  <br>
  <br>
  “For the art fair, we are just very honoured to participate in it and get more people to know this excellent talented artist.”
  <br>
  <br>
  In partnership with the Tourism Board, the fair presents three artists who explored and created works inspired by Central and Sheung Wan, Yau Ma Tei and Sham Shui Po neighbourhoods.
  <br>
  <br>
  Visitors can experience the creative process in a transformed art booth.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Because they all have their own stories that are related to the neighbourhood through their artistic approach, we want to show what's the art related to the neighbourhood and what's the significance of Hong Kong's different areas,” said curator Shirky Chan.
  <br>
  <br>
  The cornerstone art fair runs until Sunday.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A deputy at Beijing's top office on Hong Kong affairs has called on the SAR to roll out a blueprint to further drive its capital market development, seizing on opportunities brought about by the revitalisation of the city's stock market this year.
 <br>
  <br>
  The remarks were made by Qi Bin, deputy director of the central government's liaison office, who noted that Hong Kong's stock market is one of the best outperforming markets in the world this year, with average daily turnover reaching nearly HK$300 billion since last month, indicating a strong return of global capital to the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  Qi, a former vice-president of China's sovereign wealth fund China Investment Corporation, said the SAR should roll out more reforms to drive the city's capital market growth, including a blueprint that offers the market medium to long-term expectations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at the HSBC Global Investment Summit, he pointed out that a blueprint made by the Chinese Securities Regulatory Commission in 2008 helped make the country's capital market the second largest in the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  The blueprint offered a comprehensive analysis of the country's capital market, a slate of reform measures and clear timetables.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This blueprint [in Hong Kong] will provide suggestions for improvements to Hong Kong's capital markets," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A dedicated task force will solicit feedback from leading global investors and financial institutions for the coordinated growth of both Hong Kong and Asia's capital market."
  <br>
  <br>
  Other proposed measures, he added, include "accelerated integration between the city's capital markets and mainland's high-tech enterprises," such as emerging artificial intelligence and robotics firms, while ramping up market supervision to fend off systemic risks and introducing extra long-term funds, including foreign exchange reserves and social security funds.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also noted that Beijing will offer strong support for the city's upcoming inaugural "Hong Kong Global Financial and Industry Summit" in June, when more than 1,000 chief executives from around the world will gather and discuss new projects in the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  Acting Chief Executive Eric Chan said at the same event that there are signs that global capital is returning as the city's total deposits rose by 7.1 percent last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan added that the SAR will also continue to strengthen its position as an offshore yuan centre.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong's role as a super connector has never been more vital," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We remain the world's largest offshore renminbi business hub, each day processing close to 80 percent of cross border renminbi payments outside the mainland.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are now working to enable multi-currency settlements and enrich renminbi products, offering REITs under Stock Connect and exploring new initiatives with mainland regulators," Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  For his part, Alibaba chairman Joe Tsai warned about a potential "bubble" from the over-construction of data centres in the world, following the rapid growth of artificial intelligence technology.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said that some projects were being built without clear customers in mind.
  <br>
  <br>
  "My question to them is, has Microsoft or Google or Amazon or even Alibaba agreed to start using your data centres once it's built? Do you have any agreements? And they said 'no.' So I start to see the beginning of some kind of bubble,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tsai also said that private enterprise confidence had increased on the mainland after President Xi Jinping met a group of entrepreneurs in Beijing last month.

    Non-urgent A&amp;E visits to cost more in fee revamp
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<div>
<img alt="Health minister Lo Chung-mau (middle) says the fee reform is aimed at directing public resources to patients most in need. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797291_1_20250325131640.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Non-urgent patients seeking help at the city's public accident and emergency wards are set to pay more than double the current rate as part of the government's revamp on healthcare charges, with the new fees taking effect over three phases starting on January 1, 2026.
 <br>
  <br>
  The comprehensive reform will also see fee adjustments for other services, such as hospital stays and consultations at specialist and family medicine outpatient clinics.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the administration is planning to cap charges at HK$10,000 for each patient every year. It also pledged to make it easier for eligible people to apply for a fee waiver.
  <br>
  <br>
  Health minister Lo Chung-mau said the fee reform was meant to offer more help for the underprivileged and those with severe illnesses.
  <br>
  <br>
  He stressed that the extra revenue - estimated at some HK$3 billion each year for the initial phase - will go back into public hospital services.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under the proposal, public A&E departments will charge patients depending on their condition, instead of the current flat rate of HK$180.
  <br>
  <br>
  Critical and emergency cases will be treated for free, while the rest will have to pay HK$400 per visit.
  <br>
  <br>
  The authorities are also introducing a "co-payment model" to charge patients between HK$50 and HK$500 for advanced and highly complicated pathology and non-urgent imaging tests.
  <br>
  <br>
  But basic check-ups with high demand will remain free.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fees for medicine from specialist and family medicine outpatient clinics will also be adjusted, while patients will be prescribed no more than four weeks' worth of drugs each time.
  <br>
  <br>
  The changes are expected to lower the government's subsidy ratio for public hospital services from 97.6 percent to about 90 percent, which officials said remains a high level.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Past experience showed that after this kind of structure review, a certain percentage of patients…they are more inclined to see alternative methods of care," said Hospital Authority chief executive Tony Ko.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This enables us to have more capability to reserve our manpower resources to take care of the patients who really need emergency and accidents, and urgent care."
  <br>
  <br>
  At the same time, the government will relax the income and asset requirements to qualify for a fee waiver. About 1.4 million people are expected to benefit after the tweak, up from 300,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  The HK$10,000 annual fee cap, meanwhile, is estimated to help about 70,000 chronic or severely-ill patients who visit hospitals frequently.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thomas Chan, permanent secretary for health, is confident that the government is able to shoulder the financial burden.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is to provide another protection for all Hong Kong citizens who may or may not be eligible to apply for medical waivers, but we will assure them that under this public subsidisation reform, they would not be required to pay an amount that is unaffordable," Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The $10,000 from our estimate is less than half of the median monthly household income. So we try to maintain it to an affordable level."
  <br>
  <br>
  A Health Bureau spokesperson said while the HK$10,000 ceiling applies to all patients, it will not kick in automatically and an application must be made.
  <br>
  <br>
  All surplus fees will be refunded once the application is approved, while subsequent charges for the remainder of that calendar year will be waived, the spokesperson added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials aimed to complete the fee reform within five years, and conduct reviews every two years.

    Relief as billiards keep Tier A status
   </title>

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The chairman of the Billiard Sports Council of Hong Kong China welcomes the government's decision to retain the sport's Tier A status, saying the impact would have been devastating had the sport been downgraded.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on an RTHK radio programme on Tuesday, Vincent Law said the retention announcement, made a day ago, comes as a relief to both athletes and coaches, as it allows them to focus on training.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, he stressed that athletes would still face the pressure of having to perform well for the sport to retain the status in the next review, which will be held in two years' time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Law pointed out that billiard has been an elite sport since 2009.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If we had dropped to Tier B this year, our funding would have been cut by about 80 percent," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Therefore, if we just look at it from a funding standpoint, it would already have been a great loss.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But a more severe blow would be the billiards' sector having to quit the Sports Institute.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There would no longer be a billiard sports department, meaning that our training facilities, coaches – as well as the support that players get, such as accommodation – would all go."
  <br>
  <br>
  Law also said the move to retain the sport's status will allow the public to get to know more about billiards, and he believes more children will also try out the sport.
  <br>
  <br>
  If there are more venues in the SAR that allow us to stage competitions, that will also help promote the sport, he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the minimum monthly grant for full-time athletes will increase from HK$7,130 to HK$10,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vincent Cheng, vice-chairman of the Hong Kong Sports Institute and a Sports Commission member, said he hopes the increment can offer more stable lifestyles for athletes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cheng, who's also a DAB lawmaker, said the commission took reference from the salaries given to management trainees at various organisations before coming up with the figure.

    Cats and dogs allowed on light rail from May
   </title>

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Cat and dog owners will soon be able to bring pets on board the light rail on weekends and public holidays once the MTR Corporation rolls out a HK$99 monthly pet pass from May as part of a trial scheme.
 <br>
  <br>
  Under current regulations, only guide dogs are allowed on trains.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two-month pilot scheme will require owners to board the light rail with pets as long as they are kept in a bag that complies with luggage restrictions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bags with a single side that exceeds 130 centimetres or having a total dimension of more than 170cm would not be allowed.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Passengers also need to board or get off from a specific location of the train,” said Cheris Lee, who heads the corporation's operating and metro segment, on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That's the last train door of the light rail car.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Please stay within that area... so that we can also maintain a proper, comfortable environment for other passengers as well,” she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA) advised owners to take extra care of their pets to minimise stimulation and stress.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We have to introduce the bag to the pet in advance,” said Lily Leung, senior behavioural support technician at SPCA.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We advise the pet owner to do more introductory exercises at home so that your pet likes, or even loves, staying in the bag."
  <br>
  <br>
  She added that a container with good ventilation and a size large enough for pets to turn around without restrictions is needed for a comfortable journey.
  <br>
  <br>
  Leung also said owners should be alert for any signs of heatstroke in pets such as vomiting, panting and excessive drooling.
  <br>
  <br>
  The MTR Corporation said the scheme is aimed at promoting an inclusive community.
  <br>
  <br>
  It called for pet owners and other passengers to be considerate of each other so the scheme can run smoothly.
  <br>
  <br>
  The trial period, it added, might be extended to collect more data, namely the number of pet passes sold, passenger behaviour and impact on the railway system.

 In a first, M+ Museum is using artificial intelligence to transform its facade into a canvas celebrating Hong Kong's golden age of film during Art Basel.
 <br>
  <br>
  The "Night Charades" animation works like a fun guessing game, with the AI performing scenes for audiences to guess which films they reference.
  <br>
  <br>
  Created by Singaporean artist Ho Tzu-nyen, the installation features AI-generated characters performing scenes inspired by local cinema icons including Leslie Cheung and Anita Mui.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho told RTHK that he sees the project as a homage to the city's cinema heritage and a way to transform this legacy.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's also a work in many ways dedicated to people across Asia who also grew up with these films and these images," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For sure we have many Hongkongers who know these films and who have their own memories connected to these films that Night Charades is a homage to," Ho said.
  <br>
  <br>
  This marks the fourth year of collaboration between M+ and Art Basel, joining other public art installations across the city such as at Pacific Place and Starstreet Precinct.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We take a lot of pride in having the only screen in Hong Kong of that size that is an exhibition space," said Silke Schmickl, lead curator of moving image with the museum.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Here it's really an expansion of what all other commissions can offer. It is of course a high peak season in Hong Kong during Art Basel."
  <br>
  <br>
  The nighttime display runs from March 22 to June 29 at M+ Facade.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Civil Aviation Department on Monday announced that local airlines will no longer let passengers use or recharge their portable chargers during flights, while storing power banks in the overhead compartments is also banned.
 <br>
  <br>
  The new rules will come into effect on April 7.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, the department said it is highly concerned about recent safety incidents linked to passengers using lithium battery power banks.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said the decision was made after meeting representatives from local airlines last Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last Thursday, a Hong Kong Airlines flight en route to the SAR was forced to make an emergency landing in Fuzhou after a fire, believed to be triggered by a portable charging device, broke out in the cabin. In January, an Air Busan plane that was about to take off for Hong Kong went up in flames at Busan Airport after a charger caught fire.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Sources say new fees for public hospital services will be rolled out in three phases starting as early as January next year.
 <br>
  <br>
  The fee at the accident and emergency unit will be raised from the current HK$180 to no more than HK$400, with exemptions for patients who need urgent care or are critically ill.
  <br>
  <br>
  It's expected that higher A&E charges will allocate more resources to treat the critically ill and reduce the number of non-urgent cases.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials hope the new fee system will be in place in five years, with reviews every two years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sources added that there will be a cap on inpatient and outpatient fees, likely set at HK$10,000 per person per year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The overall funding rate for public healthcare will be maintained at 90 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The reform aims to enhance patient protection, optimise the medical fee waiver mechanism to provide assistance to needy patients, and strengthen support for critical illness medications and equipment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sources also said the Samaritan Fund could be relaxing its application requirements so middle-class patients facing severe illness who cannot afford expensive treatment costs could receive assistance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Health Secretary Lo Chung-mau is set to announce the details on Tuesday.

    Billiards, tennis retain Tier A status
   </title>

<img alt="" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797192_1_20250324223333.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government announced on Monday that tennis and billiards have retained their Tier A sport status for two years, avoiding a downgrade that would result in significant funding cuts.
 <br>
  <br>
  Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism Rosanna Law also announced the promotion of golf as a Tier A sport, and canoeing and para swimming to Tier B status, effective from April 1.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Elite Sports Committee, overseen by the Sports Commission, reviews athlete performances at major international competitions biennially to determine the amount of support each sport gets from the Hong Kong Sports Institute.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sports are classified into three levels of Tier A*, Tier A, and Tier B.
  <br>
  <br>
  Swimming, cycling and table tennis are among the disciplines in the top tier and classified as the ones with the best chances to do well at the Olympic Games, and athletes receive the strongest resources as a result.
  <br>
  <br>
  Currently, to be classified as Tier A, a sport is required to be included in at least three of the past four or the next two Olympic or Asian Games, which billiards failed to meet.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters after chairing a Sports Commission meeting, Law said adjustments were made to accommodate sports with unique strengths, including billiards, to stay in the city's elite sports training system.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We will count from 1997, the year that we started to compete in the name of Hong Kong, China, from then till now at least three times a sport will have to be included in either Olympic or Asian Games," she said. "Billiard sports will meet the criteria upon this adjustment."
  <br>
  <br>
  As for tennis, the sports minister said officials would also consider results of other major tournaments apart from the Olympics or Asian Games, such as the Grand Slam events.
  <br>
  <br>
  Law cited the performance of local tennis star Coleman Wong, who is making history at the Miami Open as the first player from Hong Kong to ever record a Masters 1000 win.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is an adjustment that is fitting for tennis in which we are also making good performances recently.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Of course this is a system that is ever-evolving in light of the latest development of the sports sector. And we will continue to see if adjustment is necessary in the future times to come,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Sports Commission also agreed to give all elite athletes an 8.3 percent increase in direct government grants starting next month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Additionally, the minimum monthly grant for full-time athletes will go up from HK$7,130 to HK$10,000.

    Cityline 'must explain Coldplay ticket errors'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The secretary for culture, sports and tourism has called on the ticketing platform Cityline to explain misprints on Coldplay concert tickets.
 <br>
  <br>
  According to the platform's website, the inaccurate information is printed on HK$1,399 "Coldplay: Music Of The Spheres World Tour – delivered by DHL" standing tickets.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rosanna Law pointed out that the platform has to apologise over the matter.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Cityline must explain why it went wrong," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Because it's the platform that is in charge of receiving the instructions on how to print the tickets, what tickets were to be printed, as well as the matching afterwards.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Therefore, they have to explain it."
  <br>
  <br>
  She noted that once the government learnt of the incident, it requested the platform make clear remedial and ticket-exchange arrangements swiftly to those who are affected.
  <br>
  <br>
  Law said Cityline and organisers need to have a contingency plan in place in the event that ticket holders do not manage to exchange the misprinted tickets in time for the concerts.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government will closely monitor the situation and make requests and provide guidance when necessary, she added.

    Health officials to help pharmas register new drugs

<img alt="Assistant Director of Health Frank Chan, centre, hopes the new arrangements can speed up the registration of new drugs in Hong Kong.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Pharmaceutical firms wishing to register new drugs in Hong Kong will soon be able to consult health officials before filing an actual application, saving both sides time and effort.
 <br>
  <br>
  Since November 2023, the Department of Health has made it easier for new drugs to be registered.
  <br>
  <br>
  Called the "1+" mechanism, pharmaceutical products would only need a single registration issued by an existing reference drug regulatory authority, down from two.
  <br>
  <br>
  Initially open to drugs used to treat life-threatening or severely debilitating diseases, the rule was further extended last year to all new drugs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eleven new drugs have so far been registered under the regime, five of which have already been added to the Hospital Authority's formulary.
  <br>
  <br>
  The department added that as of mid-March, it has received 400 enquiries from more than 110 pharmaceutical companies on drug registration matters.
  <br>
  <br>
  To better help the industry understand the regulatory requirements, it will launch a consultation service starting with an online briefing seminar next Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Assistant Director of Health Frank Chan noted that some overseas or mainland firms are not familiar with the new rules.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They are not quite sure or quite understand our registration requirements," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Once they got the information, they may discuss with their company to see whether they want to go ahead with the applications...  so that we [don't have] to go back and forth to ask them to provide the supplementary information.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That will enhance our efficiency for the approval of the application," Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added the department is planning to hold workshops in June and meet potential applicants face to face later in the year to further expedite the process.

    Subsidy level for public healthcare 'unsustainable'

<img alt="Public Doctors' Association chairman Christopher Lung is calling for clear guidelines for frontline medics to handle future fee-related arguments with patients.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 There's no way Hong Kong's public healthcare system will be sustainable in the long term if the government continues to subsidise nearly all of the expenses, according to an adviser tasked with reforming the body managing the hospitals.
 <br>
  <br>
  The government is currently reviewing fees and charges for public hospital services, with details to be announced by Health Secretary Lo Chung-mau on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Franklin Lam, who sits on the Hospital Authority's Governance and Structure Reform Committee, stressed the need for patients to shoulder more of their expenses.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Currently the government covers more than 97 percent of public healthcare expenses," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For every HK$100 spent, the patient only pays around HK$2.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That is the lowest in the world," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  By comparison, Lam pointed out that Singapore subsidises around 80 percent of healthcare costs for the underprivileged and less for those who earn more.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to the latest budget in Hong Kong, healthcare expenditure for 2025/26 will reach HK$115 billion, a 5.6 percent increase from the previous fiscal year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If you divide that expenditure by the labour force of 3.8 million, each worker receives around HK$30,000 [in subsidies]," Lam added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Public health expenditure is also 1.4 times the revenue from salaries' tax," Lam added.
  <br>
  <br>
  But while fees and charges for public services could go up, he suggested it was "quite likely" there would be a cap for patients.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Say, there is annual cap of HK$10,000 for each patient...," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That's about 2 percent of median family income.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Would people decide not to see a doctor just because they have to spend HK$10,000? I don't think so," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong Public Doctors' Association also agreed on the need to adjust public hospital charges and called for understanding from all parties.
  <br>
  <br>
  One of the possible adjustments could come from the accident and emergency department, with patients triaged into less urgent categories paying more than the current flat fee of HK$180.
  <br>
  <br>
  Association chairman Christopher Lung said he hopes authorities can clearly explain the fee schedule to the public, while providing adequate guidelines for medics.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Patients are triaged based on objective data such as symptoms and vital signs. But sometimes they are not satisfied and get into confrontations with frontline medics," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lung also suggested the new fee levels align with those in the private sector so as to ease the strain on public hospitals.

 The Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury Christopher Hui said on Monday he is confident that the government will be able to beat the target of bringing in over 200 large family offices by the end of the year.

  The goal was set by Chief Executive John Lee in his Policy Address in 2022 as part of measures to cement the city's status as a global wealth management hub by attracting investment and capital.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking in an interview with a local newspaper, Hui noted that the government's investment promotion arm, InvestHK, has already assisted more than 160 family offices in setting up shop or expanding in the SAR and that another 150 are planning to follow suit.
  <br>
  <br>
  While over 80 percent of the new family offices are from across the Taiwan Strait, others are from the Asia Pacific, Europe, the Americas and Oceania, he added, noting that the total number of new family offices could be much higher than the government data as some might have set up shop via other agencies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hui also noted that the authorities plan to turn the upcoming "Wealth for Good in Hong Kong Summit" into an annual flagship event as one fourth of the family offices that had set up here had done so partly due to the event.
  <br>
  <br>
  The third edition of the event is set to take place on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  So far, more than 2,700 single family offices have chosen Hong Kong as their base.
  <br>
  <br>
  Looking ahead, Hui noted that there are opportunities for growth in the city's family office business as global investors might "prioritise stability" amid the uncertain policy environment in the United States. He said the city provides a stable, sustainable and predictable business environment.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also said the government has introduced a bill to the Legislative Council to set up a "company relocation mechanism" to assist businesses in their relocations and that the legislative process of the bill could be completed in the first half.

<img alt="The Housing Authority's Cleresa Wong expects at least a few hundred flats could be released after rules are tightened. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797127_1_20250324121128.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Housing Authority on Monday said well-off public housing tenants will be given sufficient time to move out of their flats once rules are tightened.
 <br>
  <br>
  Under the new rules, some tenants will be required to pay 2.5 to 4.5 times the standard rent starting from October.
  <br>
  <br>
  In addition, if a tenant's income is between four to five times the limit after two declaration cycles, they will have to move out.
  <br>
  <br>
  The chairperson of the authority’s subsidised housing committee Cleresa Wong said she expects at least a few hundred flats to be released after the rules are tightened, but she offered assurances that tenants will not be forced to move out immediately.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Tenants will only have to move out after they surrender their public flat and get another property," she told a radio programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They don't have to worry about moving and residing elsewhere temporarily, before being able to purchase a flat under the 'white form' status or a first-hand private housing unit."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lawmaker Lo Wai-kwok, who is also a member of the committee, said well-off public housing tenants would be able to afford the higher rents, adding that new policies can also encourage them to buy a flat.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Residential prices in the private market have gradually stabilised, and we have policies like the Home Ownership Scheme, and the 'green form' status. More tenants who can afford [it] may consider purchasing a flat," he told an RTHK radio programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  The chairman of the Federation of Public Housing Estates Man Yu-ming, meanwhile, said it may be hard for some tenants to pay more rent, but he believes the changes could encourage upward mobility.

    Coldplay ticket fixes 'could be dealt with by post'

<img alt="" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797121_1_20250324115705.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A lawmaker suggested on Monday that the ticketing platform Cityline deal with exchanges necessitated by printing errors on some Coldplay concert tickets by post.
 <br>
  <br>
  The inaccurate information is printed on HK$1,399 "Coldplay: Music Of The Spheres World Tour – delivered by DHL" standing tickets, according to Cityline's website.
  <br>
  <br>
  On top of the seven ticket-exchange locations in Hong Kong, the platform has also added similar facilities in Guangzhou and Shenzhen.
  <br>
  <br>
  All booths will run from today until April 7.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on an RTHK radio programme, Yang Wing-kit noted that the two booths on the mainland are insufficient even though they are better than nothing.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There will be people coming from the mainland, or even Southeast Asia to see the concerts. If you only set up booths in Guangzhou and Shenzhen, maybe people in Shanghai will have to spend a lot of time travelling to Guangzhou or Shenzhen to exchange their tickets," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That will be an inconvenience. Couldn't we come up with other ways, such as mailing the tickets by post? That would be much more convenient."
  <br>
  <br>
  He pointed out that Cityline should come up with ways to compensate those who are affected, such as by waiving the handling fee and offering priority bookings in the future.
  <br>
  <br>
  Exchanges could only be carried out in the SAR, before Cityline announced late on Saturday that booths would also be set up on the mainland.
  <br>
  <br>
  Aryan Sethi, a local ticket holder, was among those who headed to the Tsim Sha Tsui booth.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said he was satisfied with the exchange arrangements.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They've given us until April 7, which is at least one day before the show I booked for, so I think it's ok," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm happy they informed us as early as they could, instead of at least one week before, so I think it was ok."
  <br>
  <br>
  Some people, meanwhile, told RTHK that they only found out about the ticketing error on social media.
  <br>
  <br>
  This is because they either did not get the email or only found it in the spam folder.
  <br>
  <br>
  The British rock band will play at the Kai Tak Sports Park next month.
  <br>
  <br>
  As of 11am on Sunday, the Consumer Council has received 25 complaints over the incident.

    Local art space takes Art Basel on vampire adventure

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Want to see vampires travelling through time and space? Local art space Para Site is turning Art Basel's film section into a sci-fi wonderland.
 <br>
  <br>
  Breaking from tradition, the SAR’s premier art show has handed over its film programming reins to Para Site – marking the first time an organisation will be in charge of curating the section.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're almost thinking of this programme like a film festival," said Para Site's executive director Billy Tang.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There's something about that gesture that is very collective and collaborative. So we really wanted to use that to mark the difference of our approach as well."
  <br>
  <br>
  Tang and three others curated the film programme themed "In Space, It's Always Night", which includes feature films, videos and moving images by 30 artists from around the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  The centrepiece is "Vampires in Space" by Portuguese filmmaker Isadora Neves Marques, which tells the story of a family of vampires travelling through the cosmos.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tang told RTHK that he wants to bring new perspectives and create dialogue between local and international artists.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For an outsider, maybe people think a lot about Wong Kar-wai, and it's such a powerful legacy and becomes synonymous with the city," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When we chose Isadora's film, we thought long and hard about that as well, because I think they represent a potential of something that could potentially in the future speak a lot about Hong Kong issues."
  <br>
  <br>
  One of the videos in the programme titled "The Pixelated You" also features works by six Hong Kong-based artists, exploring the act of imagining others through imagery.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tang said the project aims to support the local art ecosystem.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're trying to think within the visibility of the art fair, how to channel that to focus on different communities that represent the city, how also it can draw attention to the wider city as well," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Art enthusiasts can experience these otherworldly screenings at the Convention and Exhibition Centre in Wan Chai from March 27 to 30.

    HK strives to attain carbon neutrality: Tse Chin-wan

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Environment minister Tse Chin-wan said on Monday that Hong Kong will continue to strive for carbon neutrality by 2050, highlighting the SAR’s multi-pronged plan to achieve this goal.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a climate forum organised by the Environment and Ecology Bureau and University of Hong Kong, the minister said the city's efforts to achieve carbon neutrality have been bearing fruit.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We stopped the building of coal-fired power plants in 1997 and have been gradually shifting to natural gas and nuclear power. Due to the efforts made, Hong Kong reached the carbon peak in 2014. Comparing to the peak, our carbon emissions have been reduced by about a quarter now," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our per capita carbon emissions in 2023 were about 4.4 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent, which is about 30 percent of that of the United States and 60 percent of that of the European Union," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2021, the government announced its Climate Action Plan 2050 which outlined measures for the SAR to combat climate change and achieve carbon neutrality.
  <br>
  <br>
  It consists of four major decarbonisation strategies, such as net zero electricity generation, green transport and waste reduction.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tse said a new facility will be built to increase the proportion of zero carbon electricity to around 70 percent by 2035, along with an upgrade for the current cross-border electricity transmission infrastructure.
  <br>
  <br>
  On transport, he said the government is expanding the city's electric vehicle charging network, and will stop selling private cars that run on gasoline or diesel by 2035.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added Hong Kong will stop using landfills to handle municipal waste by the same year to cut the eight percent carbon emission from waste disposal.
  <br>
  <br>
  The environment minister also said Hong Kong’s first waste-to-energy incinerator facility will start operations by the end of the year.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The chair of the European Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong on Monday welcomed last week's remarks from the director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, who praised EuroCham's work in the SAR.
 <br>
  <br>
  Xia Baolong told a visiting EuroCham delegation to Beijing that Hong Kong had the full support from the central government in maintaining its unique status and advantages.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on
  <a href="https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/news-programmes/this-episode.htm?cmsid=77" target="_blank">
   <u>
    <b>
     RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme
    </b>
   </u>
  </a>
  , EuroCham chairman Inaki Amate said the most important takeaway from the meeting was the central government's commitment to the long-term stability and prosperity of the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We had an opportunity to express our commitment to the Hong Kong SAR and to the measures that the Hong Kong and Chinese government are putting forward to ensure the long term stability that we need in the business community."
  <br>
  <br>
  Amate also said the European Chamber of Commerce was working hard to encourage companies from Europe to set up operations in the city and contribute to its success.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They [firms] see that the potential of Hong Kong has not vanished. That there is still a lot that Hong Kong can offer to international firms in the way they can penetrate back into China but also can consider Hong Kong as a regional headquarters."

    Rugby Sevens tickets selling like hotcakes: organiser

<div class="itemFullText">
 Ticket sales for the Hong Kong Rugby Sevens are breaking records less than one week before the event kicks off at the Kai Tak Sports Park, according to the event's organiser.
 <br>
  <br>
  The highly-anticipated mega event will take place from March 28 to 30 at the brand new Kai Tak Stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong, China Rugby said 43,000 tickets have been sold, including 8,000 in the past week alone.
  <br>
  <br>
  With a capacity of 47,000, that means over 90 percent of all tickets have been snapped up. Only three-day passes remain, with each adult ticket costing HK$1,950.
  <br>
  <br>
  The organiser expects a total attendance of 138,000 over three days, a new record for the tournament.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chris Brooke, chairman of Hong Kong, China Rugby said the SAR squad is ready to compete, and is excited to be entering a new era of rugby history with the move away from Hong Kong Stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our Hong Kong, China teams have reached great heights both on the world stage and in the neighborhoods across the city. We look forward to together capitalising on the new opportunities presented by Kai Tak for our community," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SAR men's and women's squads will be competing in the Melrose Claymores, a tournament which runs in parallel to the main Sevens competition.
  <br>
  <br>
  The men's team will be aiming to defend their Melrose title, facing China on Friday and Japan on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the women's team, who finished as runners-up to China last year, will play Kazakhstan on the opening day and Thailand next.

 Customs have arrested an inbound traveller at the airport for allegedly smuggling cannabis buds into Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 47-year-old man arrived at the SAR on Saturday on a flight from Bangkok.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was subsequently stopped at customs clearance, when officers said they found around 10kg of suspected cannabis buds in his suitcase.
  <br>
  <br>
  The suspected drugs are worth HK$2.2 million in market value.
  <br>
  <br>
  An investigation is still ongoing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Customs also reminded the public that drug trafficking is a serious offence, and offenders upon conviction face a maximum fine of HK$5 million and life imprisonment.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Breast Milk Bank has begun serving premature or critically-ill newborns across the city, just two months after it came into operation in January.
 <br>
  <br>
  The city's first milk bank, located at the Children's Hospital in Kai Tak, has so far recruited more than 100 eligible donors and collected more than 300 litres of milk.
  <br>
  <br>
  Paediatrician Rosanna Wong, the milk bank's director, said the numbers were "more than expected".
  <br>
  <br>
  She revealed the bank began distributing donor milk to the city's nine public neonatal intensive care units starting this month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Priority is currently given to babies born under 32 weeks of gestation, or weigh less than 1.5kg.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Other babies who require the milk will be those who have severe diseases like congenital heart disease, or after a gastrointestinal operation," she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong called for additional donations from lactating mothers, saying they could help the bank extend its free service to less premature babies or full-term infants with special needs.

    'Organ donor sign-ups hit record, but more needed'

 The Secretary for Health Lo Chung-mau has urged more individuals to register as organ donors, as many patients continue to wait for life-saving transplants.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a ceremony honouring organ donors on Sunday, Lo noted that over 2,600 patients in Hong Kong are currently on the waiting list for organ transplants.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said that while nearly 400,000 people have signed up on the Centralised Organ Donation Register - an all-time high - there still remains considerable potential for growth.
  <br>
  <br>
  "While the number 400,000 is commendable, it still represents less than 6 percent of Hong Kong's 7.5 million population, and less than 10 percent if we consider those over 18 years old. I have always been ambitious. 400,000 is an excellent figure, but history is meant to be broken," Lo said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I hope to report an even greater number next year at this gathering, not just a modest increase. I hope we can see a significant rise in organ donation numbers."
  <br>
  <br>
  The health minister also highlighted two cross-border organ donation cases from recent years, benefitting a then four-month-old baby girl in 2022, and an eight-month-old infant earlier this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  He expressed admiration for families who, even in their saddest moments, turn their loss into a gift for others, describing it as an act of great generosity that helps complete another family.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, James Fung, president of the Hong Kong Society of Transplantation, said that in the past two years, there were 54 deceased organ donors who saved 138 patients suffering from organ failure.
  <br>
  <br>
  Additionally, there were 56 living organ donors, who benefited 56 patients suffering from kidney or liver failure.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fung pointed out that there were fewer than 30 deceased organ donors in each of the past two years, making Hong Kong among places in the world with the lowest organ donation rates.

<img alt="Financial Secretary Paul Chan said Hong Kong will continue to help mainland companies enter international markets. Photo courtesy of Paul Chan's blog" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797020_1_20250323141446.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan pledged his support for Hong Kong's cultural and creative industries, saying they will thrive under the city's unique east-meets-west and inclusive environment.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chan, who's currently in Beijing, revealed in his weekly article on Sunday that he had visited a leading pop cultural entertainment firm to learn more about the incubation of cultural and creative intellectual property (IP) products.
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted the enormous potential of the creative industry, saying IP rights holders can ride on the popularity of their products to develop toys, theme parks and even catering services.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Apart from meeting actual needs of the consumers, these IP products also focus on giving them a joyful experience," he wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan believed Hong Kong remains the ideal location for mainland companies looking to expand abroad, citing the city's advantages in sourcing capital, abundance of talent and professional services, and free flow of information.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Developing IP and extending it to different industries, this creates tremendous value. The mainland has a very rich culture, and is highly creative. Hong Kong can be a platform, and help mainland companies go global. We are very willing to do that," he told the company in Beijing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong's creative industry workers, he added, not only understand the mainland market, but also possess global vision and are able to create content which resonates with the public.
  <br>
  <br>
  Citing his latest budget, the finance chief said the SAR government will support over 30 cultural IP projects in the next five years.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Office for Attracting Strategic Enterprises, meanwhile, will expand the scope of its target companies to bring in more creative firms that integrate innovation and technology, he said.
