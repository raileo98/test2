 Consumer prices rose 1.4 percent year-on-year in October, according to the official figure released on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  It was the smallest increase in five months, after the city recorded a rate of 2.2 percent in September.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alcoholic drinks and tobacco saw the biggest increases at 21.8 percent, followed by electricity, gas and water at 8.5 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, the government said food prices continued to record mild increases, while energy-related items saw a slow-down in price declines.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Looking ahead, overall inflation should stay mild in the near term," a government spokesman said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Domestic costs may see some mild upward pressures as the Hong Kong economy continues to grow. External price pressures should ease further, though uncertainties from the external environment remain."

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Thursday said they have arrested 65 people over various alleged offences linked to a suspected prostitution ring.
 <br>
  <br>
  Officers said they believe a syndicate arranged for sex workers to come to the SAR from countries including Japan, Thailand, Laos and Vietnam.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chief Inspector Tang Hoi-tung said the 65 were arrested on suspicion of living on earnings of prostitution, controlling prostitution, money laundering, keeping a vice establishment and breaching conditions of stay in Hong Kong.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The MTR Corporation on Thursday said its has finished installing platform screen doors at nine stations along the East Rail Line.
 <br>
  <br>
  The rail operator said it expects to finish putting doors in at three more stations, Lo Wu, Mong Kok East and University Station, next year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chief engineering manager for system integration Maggie Chan said the gap between trains and the platform is relatively wide at these three stations.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said the rail operator will reduce the gap when the automatic platform gates (APG) are installed, to ensure passenger safety.
  <br>
  <br>
  "At the platform edge, there are the platform gap fillers. We will also widen the platform gap fillers to reduce the platform gap," Chan told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will also have extra, additional broadcasting, so as to remind the passengers they have to pay attention to the platform gap after the APG opens."

    Enterprises improving defences against cyber attacks

<img alt="The PCPD and the HKPC says that there is still room for further improvement for enterprises' ability to handle cyber attacks." src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1780253_1_20241121171623.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An index measuring local enterprises' ability to respond to cybersecurity attacks has recorded the biggest jump to date, up by 5.8 points from last year to 52.8.
 <br>
  <br>
  442 companies were measured under the "Hong Kong Enterprise Cyber Security Readiness Index" compiled by the Hong Kong Productivity Council (HKPC) and the Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data (PCPD).
  <br>
  <br>
  Among the four areas covered in the index, "Human Awareness Building" has the most urgent need for improvement, the bodies said. The category refers to how aware and cautious employees are regarding potential cyber attacks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Privacy Commissioner Ada Chung said this awareness has remained relatively low over the years.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We also encourage enterprises to conduct training regularly, and this will include for example cyber security drill exercises as well," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chung said many hackers have been using AI to carry out their attacks, and deepfake videos used to fake identities can be made in under 20 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alex Chan, General Manager of Digital Transformation at the HKPC, said enterprises are encouraged to adopt AI for defence, such as detecting the voice prints of videos to check if they show a real person.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will always say that AI is a double-edged sword. So that means attackers or bad actors are using AI to do attack, at the same time we should also use AI to uplift our defence," Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  To help enterprises better equip themselves against cyber attacks, the PCPD and the HKPC will be introducing a series of training packages, including a "data security training series for Small-and-Medium Enterprises" in 2025 and one on "Phishing Defence Services".

<div class="itemFullText">
 Under Secretary for Innovation, Technology and Industry Lillian Cheong on Thursday said Hong Kong has a big role to play in the innovation development of the Greater Bay Area.
 <br>
  <br>
  Addressing a panel at the World Internet Conference in Wuzhen, Cheong said the SAR can act as a hub for global innovative resources and a data port.
  <br>
  <br>
  “For us to seek new developments, we should rely on the interaction and usage of data. Hong Kong has unique advantages. It can be the hub for global innovative resources,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It can connect both mainland data and overseas data. It can be a data port. Hong Kong can also allow the orderly flow of data and facilitate the overall development of the Greater Bay Area.”
  <br>
  <br>
  She added that the administration has signed a cross-border data flow MOU with the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC).
  <br>
  <br>
  Sun Weimin, chief engineer of the CAC, told the same forum that the digital economy has become a crucial force reshaping the world’s innovation landscape.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sun called for innovation-led and secure development to create a bright future for the GBA’s internet industry.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The Greater Bay Area has a highly developed economy and a high degree of digitalisation, facing more urgent security threats. It is necessary to strengthen cooperation in aspects such as information sharing and incident handling,” she said.

    Rental bikes blocking paths 'common': Ombudsman

<img alt='The Ombudsman says the LCSD should take "decisive enforcement action" against any violations. Photo courtesy of the Office of the Ombudsman' src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1780238_1_20241121155817.jpg&q=30">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An investigation by the city's Ombudsman has found it is common for rental bike service operators to leave their bicycles where they block paths, saying the situation "invites doubts" as to whether the Leisure and Cultural Services Department (LCSD) has taken action against offenders.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Office of the Ombudsman on Thursday said business permits issued by the department to the operators explicitly forbid them from allowing rental bicycles to take up space outside designated areas.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Operators placing their bicycles outside the permit area in violation of regulations not only causes an obstruction to passageways and affects members of the public to access and use recreational facilities, but may also pose safety hazards," said Ombudsman Jack Chan.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our multiple site inspections found that it seems to be a common practice for operators to leave bicycles lying around in contravention of the regulations, and this has invited doubts as to whether the LCSD had reminded the operators of the irregularities or has taken enforcement action against them in the past."
  <br>
  <br>
  The office noted that LCSD staff issue reminders or warning letters depending on the severity of a situation, and can consider suspending an operator's business or terminating the contract if there's no evident improvement after a third warning.
  <br>
  <br>
  But guidelines do not clearly stipulate the number of verbal and written reminders to warrant a warning, the office said, or whether the notices have any validity period.
  <br>
  <br>
  The office said the department should take "decisive enforcement action" if any operator violates the contract terms, and look into enhancing the current enforcement regime and guidelines, among other suggestions.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Ombudsman added that the LCSD has accepted all of its recommendations.

 Two of the nation's navy battleships, a destroyer and an amphibious assault ship,  arrived in Hong Kong on Thursday for a five-day visit.
 <br>
  <br>
  Members of the public can board the vessels for a look around.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Changsha and the Hainan were greeted by boats from the Fire Services Department, with the Hainan moored at China Merchants Wharf in Western.
  <br>
  <br>
  Soldiers on board raised the national flag and waved to people on shore.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Ministry of Defence said the visit was approved by the Central Military Commission and is part of an annual plan.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said the visit is aimed at demonstrating the People's Liberation Army's determination and ability to defend the country's sovereignty and safety.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[The visit also] further enhances the national identity and pride for compatriots in Hong Kong and Macau, and for them to learn more about national defence and the achievements of the army's modernisation," the ministry said.
  <br>
  <br>
  It added that the vessels will be open to the public and soldiers based in the two SARs, and there will be seminars on national defence as well as cultural exchange activities.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A senior Beijing official has stressed that Hong Kong is playing a larger part in the Belt and Road Initiative, saying the city's dispute resolution mechanism and an abundance of legal professionals provide services under the country's infrastructure development plan.
 <br>
  <br>
  Liu Guangyuan, a deputy director of Beijing's liaison office, on Thursday said the SAR is "standing at the forefront" of the nation's opening up as an important functional platform for the initiative.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a Belt and Road conference in Hong Kong, the official said the One Country, Two Systems principle makes the territory a bridge connecting the mainland with the rest of the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is the only jurisdiction in the world with a bilingual common law system, and has a bigger role to play in facilitating Belt and Road cooperation," Liu said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong has a complete dispute resolution mechanism, and serves as a preferred seat for resolving disputes among countries along the Belt and Road... The abundant legal talent reservoir in the city may be further tapped into to provide legal services under the Belt and Road Initiative."
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that stability is a "prerequisite" for prosperity in Hong Kong and a safeguard for the city's role in the development initiative.
  <br>
  <br>
  Secretary for Justice Paul Lam, for his part, said at the same conference that Hong Kong has a special role.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong is renowned for having a sound and mature legal system, supported by the independent exercise of judicial power by our courts and a strong rule of law tradition. Hong Kong is uniquely positioned to bridge the gaps between different jurisdictions along the Belt and Road," Lam said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As a super-connector and a super value-adder, Hong Kong provides world-class legal services that facilitate business between China and the rest of the world."
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong has a lot of legal professionals "with a strong Chinese legal and business background" as well as expertise in international law and practice, Lam added.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the government will proactively integrate into the nation's development, maintain a free and open business environment, and serve as a springboard to attract and support enterprises.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The SAR's squash association on Thursday urged the Sports Federation and Olympic Committee (SF&OC) of Hong Kong, China to provide flexibility for the sector over the introduction of a code of practice.
 <br>
  <br>
  The SF&OC on Wednesday held a briefing for its member associations about the new code, which provides guidelines on corporate governance.
  <br>
  <br>
  It states that the term of office for directors of the associations should have a maximum length and recommends they stay for 16 years at most, along with an age limit of 75.
  <br>
  <br>
  Duncan Chiu, chairman of the Squash Association of Hong Kong, China, welcomed the introduction of the code but said he hopes compromises can be made.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There are not too many people participating in squash activities, and our committee consists of about 20 people. It's not easy to find people who can constantly help us... We hope they can provide some flexibility on this," he told an RTHK radio programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  The code also states that sports associations should establish a fair and transparent mechanism for the selection of athletes, to ensure equal opportunities for all those qualified.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chiu, who's also a lawmaker, said his association would follow all the procedures, but he hopes people understand that different sports have different selection criteria.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For running or swimming, it's easier because the standard is based on the time for finishing the race. But it may be more subjective for team sports, like football and basketball, the team chemistry among players is important too. So there are more criteria when selecting athletes," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  New People's Party lawmaker Adrian Ho told the same programme that at next year's National Games, people will be able to see whether sports associations are being fair and transparent when selecting players.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SF&OC will review the implementation of the code after two years, and any sports associations that fail to follow it will face penalties including cuts to government subsidies.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong government on Wednesday said it strongly condemns and opposes some Western governments, anti-China groups and politicians, as well as foreign media for smearing and maliciously attacking the SAR.
 <br>
  <br>
  The SAR’s statement was in response to foreign criticism of court sentences handed down to 45 people on Tuesday in Hong Kong's largest national security trial thus far.
  <br>
  <br>
  A government spokesman stressed the court made the decision following 118 days of open trial, and after going through an extensive amount of evidence presented by both the prosecution and defense.
  <br>
  <br>
  The spokesman added that all of the legal considerations were laid out in an 82-page judgement, which can be downloaded by members of the public.
  <br>
  <br>
  He stressed the case had nothing to do with advocating democracy or freedoms, saying the offenders had engaged in acts that endanger national security.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government stressed it will continue to do all it takes to safeguard national security.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The proposed imposition of the so-called 'visa restrictions' on HKSAR officials by the US Government smack of despicable political manipulation to intimidate People's Republic of China and HKSAR officials who resolutely safeguard national security," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The HKSAR despises such threats and will not be intimidated by such despicable behaviour. The HKSAR will continue to resolutely continue to discharge the duty of safeguarding national security."

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Former media tycoon Jimmy Lai on Wednesday began testifying in his national security trial.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lai said he had made donations to local and overseas groups, including think-tanks and religious organisations in the United States amounting to up to US$50,000 a year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Apple Daily founder added that he donated £20,000 to the UK-based group Hong Kong Watch.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lai also said he asked former top US officials to “voice out” for Hong Kong five years ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  He told the High Court that he met then vice-president Mike Pence and then secretary of state Mike Pompeo during his trip to Washington in July 2019.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lai said he asked Pence to voice support for Hong Kong, adding that it would be “beyond” him to ask Pence to take any concrete action.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lai also acknowledged that he had directed Apple Daily to use news of a meeting between former chief secretary Anson Chan and Pence in 2019 to its “maximum effect”.
  <br>
  <br>
  The former media tycoon has pleaded not guilty to three conspiracy charges relating to collusion with foreign forces and sedition.
  <br>
  <br>
  The questioning is estimated to take 15 days, according to the defence.

    Sports bodies that don't improve face subsidy cuts

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Sports Federation & Olympic Committee (SF&OC) of Hong Kong, China on Wednesday said member associations that fail to meet new standards in terms of governance and operation may face penalties such as subsidy cuts.
 <br>
  <br>
  The body launched a review of the governance and operation of 77 sports associations following a 2020 audit report. It said the review has now been completed and it will hand in a report to the government.
  <br>
  <br>
  Edgar Yang, honorary secretary general of the SF&OC, said associations will be given two years to make improvements set out in the report.
  <br>
  <br>
  The consequences for failing to do so will include cuts to government subsidies, he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “That will be the worst scenario, that we have to step in. In the coming 24 months, we believe that we will be able to lead and offer guidance to the NSAs (national sports associations) where we see there are matters that we need to rectify or enhance,” Yang said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The certificate of compliance will be the last resort. Basically, there will be [different] levels of punishment that we will consider.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Sports minister Kevin Yeung attended a briefing for associations conducted by the SF&OC on Wednesday and said the review marks the start of improvements for the sports sector.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It’s a very important step forward for the further enhancement of our whole sports development in the future. We are positive and we will work with the SF&OC and all the NSAs to make sure that we are all going towards the right direction,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Member associations of the SF&OC expressed support for the report, with chairman of the Hong Kong, China Ice Hockey Association, Sherman Chan, saying it is reasonable for those who fail to comply with the requirements to be hit with penalties.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I think this is quite fair. If any of the NSAs could not meet the requirements, nor try to improve, and their [subsidies] were cut, I think that’s fair,” he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  The report covers areas such as the associations’ board governance, selection of athletes, and management of coaches and umpires.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan says Hong Kong must remain agile and innovative amid evolving global dynamics, adding that countries and businesses are still adapting and transforming to thrive in a changing environment.
 <br>
  <br>
  Giving a speech at the Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit, Chan said there is no reason for pessimism, despite the market bracing for potential headwinds from a changing geopolitical landscape and a new US administration.
  <br>
  <br>
  “China, for example, has been undergoing remarkable economic transformation, marked by a shift towards high-quality economic growth, supported by domestic consumption, technological innovation, green investment, advanced manufacturing and many more. Chinese enterprises are also expanding their global industry and supply chain footprint in response to shifting geopolitics,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “For Hong Kong, our strategy is to continue to engage with traditional markets like the US and Europe, focusing on co-operation in areas of common interests and mutual benefits.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan also said there is still potential and ample room for cooperation across various sectors, including urban planning, infrastructure, ESG (environmental, social and governance) standards and efforts to combat climate change, despite the influence of geopolitics.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the Belt and Road countries, along with the Global South as a whole, offer vast and untapped business opportunities.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The Global South now contributes to about 60 percent of global GDP in terms of purchasing power parity, and accounts for over 40 percent of global imports and exports. If we just look at Asean (Association of Southeast Asian Nations), it is collectively on track to become the fourth largest economy in the world by 2030,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “What characterise these markets are rapid economic growth, young populations and an expanding middle class. And above all, they all share a strong aspiration for progress by pursuing investments in infrastructure, green transformation and technologies.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Amid challenging global landscape, they are also seeking to diversify their investments and asset allocation. We are making significant strides to capitalise on the opportunities presented by the growth of these emerging markets.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said Hong Kong continues to be an attractive partner for investors and businesses globally, given the city’s international outlook and commitment to innovation.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Wednesday unveiled the development outline for the Hong Kong section of the Hetao Shenzhen-Hong Kong Science and Technology Innovation Cooperation Zone, with the gross floor area in phase one doubling from what was initially planned.
 <br>
  <br>
  The tech zone stretches across the Shenzhen River, covering 302 hectares in Shenzhen and 87 hectares in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SAR section will be developed in two five-year phases, with phase one covering 1 million square metres.
  <br>
  <br>
  "After reviewing the future development, in particular the high demand from the market for the Hetao Hong Kong Park, we decided to greatly increase the floor area. And after the hard work and also discussions with the other bureaus and departments, eventually we are able to offer about 1 million square metres for the phase one development," Secretary for Innovation, Technology and Industry Sun Dong said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tech zone will feature three main areas, focusing on life and health technology, artificial intelligence and data science, and advanced manufacturing and new technology.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than two-thirds of the space in phase one is planned for laboratories and research areas, while there will be land set aside for accommodation, visitor lodges and commercial spaces.
  <br>
  <br>
  In addition, a contact-less clearance process will be implemented to link the parks in Shenzhen and Hong Kong to facilitate personnel flow, and to allow people crossing the border to travel to other parts of the SAR as well.
  <br>
  <br>
  Deputy Secretary for Innovation, Technology and Industry Carrie Chang said the government will discuss details with mainland authorities.
  <br>
  <br>
  "At this point in time, our thinking is that those people would have to be pre-registered. In terms of who they are, they should be the employees of the tenants of the two parks (because) they do have the need to commute between the two parks frequently," Chang said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And then the list should be accepted by both authorities because after all, it's cross-boundary travel. When we have further details, after further discussions with the mainland authorities, we will inform the members of the public suitably."
  <br>
  <br>
  The government added that there are plans to build footbridges over the Shenzhen River to link the Shenzhen and Hong Kong parks as well, but details are still being discussed.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 UNICEF Hong Kong on Wednesday said everyone should play a part in living sustainably through environmental protection.
 <br>
  <br>
  This came as it surveyed 256 secondary school students from June to August this year to find out their awareness of environmental policies in the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  It found that almost 80 percent of students value environmental protection, but almost half were unaware of relevant plans by their schools and in the community.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Most of the students would like to learn more about global crises, what is affecting their life, and they want to be more participating, not only to just become a beneficial party, but also involved in voicing out their needs, questions and concerns, and influencing policy making to build a better future,” the organisation’s chair, Judy Chen, said.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 90 percent of the students surveyed had a clear understanding of how to save water and electricity at home, such as turning off unnecessary lights and maintaining air conditioner temperatures at 24 degrees or above.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the school setting, their participation in green activities dropped to 50 percent, and mainly involved helping out with waste recycling and using water dispensers.
  <br>
  <br>
  The participation rate further dropped to around 20 percent in the community, as students were unaware of activities taking place.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chen said schools should expand their policies and arrangements for saving the planet to align with the government’s sustainability goals.
  <br>
  <br>
  “A lot of schools are already very well-established, so their environmental planning may not be that up to date. It would be a good opportunity for schools to work with students, to allow them to feel they are fighting climate change as well,” Chen said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “But this issue is not just limited to schools and students. All stakeholders in the community should also pay attention and be more aware of how to build a more environmentally friendly place for our children,” she added.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Welfare minister Chris Sun on Monday said the government has no plans to raise the age when older people can enjoy trips on public transport for just HK$2.
 <br>
  <br>
  Last month, the Hong Kong Economic Journal cited sources as saying the minimum age could be raised from the current 60, to 65.
  <br>
  <br>
  But in a written reply to a question from lawmaker Peter Koon, Sun said there are no plans to do this.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The government has stated clearly that it will maintain the policy intent of the HK$2 scheme to build a caring and inclusive society by encouraging the beneficiaries to participate more in community activities, and has no intention to cancel the scheme or change the existing beneficiary groups," Sun said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said a review of the scheme is ongoing and the result of this will be announced in due course.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The government would take into account the effectiveness of different options in containing the growth of [the scheme's] expenditure and factors including the practicability of these options in the review," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sun said the scheme is estimated to have cost nearly HK$4 billion in the last financial year, or 0.7 percent of the government's total operating expenditure.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the 2022-23 financial year, the scheme cost a little more than HK$3 billion.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Customs officers on Wednesday said three people charged over a drugs case earlier this year are now also suspected of laundering money to the tune of HK$53 million.
 <br>
  <br>
  A fourth suspect was arrested in Sai Wan Ho on Tuesday over the alleged money laundering. The man, 41, was later released on bail.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two women and a man, aged 23 to 25, continue to be remanded in custody in connection with the HK$28 million dangerous drugs case, officers said, adding that their investigation into the suspected money laundering is still ongoing.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Coordinators of a test event for the 15th National Games’ Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau road cycling race say the trial run on Sunday is to test traffic management and the spectator experience.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong portion of the race will take around 90 minutes, with cyclists entering the SAR via the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge and then going along the North Lantau Highway and Penny’s Bay Highway, before heading back to Zhuhai after passing Hong Kong Disneyland.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeung Tak-keung, the head of the National Games Coordination Office, said RTHK is liaising with the organising committee in Zhuhai to set up live broadcasting online for viewers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Those members of the public who want to watch the competition on site, they can go to the spectator zone in Disneyland, and we expect the area can accommodate up to several hundred spectators," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeung said organisers place a lot of importance on ensuring a smooth and safe competition and will also use the trial to identify areas for improvement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Experts from the mainland cycling association and the Hong Kong cycling association, we have conducted several site visits to go through the whole route. They found the whole current route is safe for high-level competitions for experienced cyclists," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For the Hong Kong section of the route, our high-risk department have conducted very thorough examination of the whole route and they used different technologies to inspect the route and to make sure it will be safe for the cyclists."
  <br>
  <br>
  Principal Transport Officer Ken Wong said the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge will be closed for certain periods on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lanes heading to Macau and Zhuhai will be shut from 7.30am to 12.30pm and lanes in the other direction will be closed between 9am and 12.30pm.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We expect, according to the prior publicity regarding the event, not too many passengers will make use of the bus to go to Zhuhai and Macau on the coming Sunday," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have already asked MTRCL to pay extra attention to the passenger demand during that morning. If there's any passenger demand, MTRCL will increase the services on the Tung Chung Line, Airport Express Line and Disneyland Line."
  <br>
  <br>
  The test event will be a men's individual 230-kilometres race, which is the first national sports event that connects Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macau, and will be the only National Games event next year held in all three places.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Housing minister Winnie Ho said on Wednesday that officials have taken back some 6,400 public flats in the past two and a half years after tenants were found to be abusing housing resources.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a written reply to a question from Heung Yee Kuk lawmaker Kenneth Lau, Ho said nearly 400 tenants were prosecuted during the period.
  <br>
  <br>
  Seven of them were given jail terms or suspended sentences for violating housing laws. In the most serious case, a tenant was given an immediate jail term of 30 days.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government is to launch a reward scheme in January, giving people around HK$3,000 for reports of tenancy abuse.
  <br>
  <br>
  The housing chief said the scheme is generally supported by the community and won't damage relationships between neighbours.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Regarding views that the Award Scheme may be a detriment to neighbourhood relationships, the Housing Authority believes that [public housing] residents would not welcome abusers in their neighbourhood," Ho said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[Tenancy] abuse would bring injustice, or even affect the living environment of public rental housing and bring nuisance."
  <br>
  <br>
  She added that it is believed the scheme will enhance awareness of the need to cherish housing resources.

 The police on Wednesday were investigating a suspected criminal damage case outside Central Government Offices.
 <br>
  <br>
  At around 8.30am, a security patrol found red paint covering an area of three metres by two metres around a planter pot near Harcourt Road.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government strongly condemned the incident, saying the police will thoroughly investigate and hold any offender to account.
  <br>
  <br>
  A government spokesman said police officers have stepped up patrols in the area and the authorities have instructed security staff of the Central Government Offices to remain vigilant.

    Tsuen Wan hosts city's best and worst toilets

 The Hong Kong Toilet Association says the government should increase its ratio of women's toilets to men's and include urinals in its calculation.
 <br>
  <br>
  Henry Hung, the association's chairman, told RTHK that at the moment, there were two female public lavatories for every male one, but women could often be seen lining up outside the public facilities.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the government should increase the ratio to 1:2.5 and include men's urinals in the calculation of toilets.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hung was speaking in an interview with RTHK's
  <a href="https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/news-programmes/this-episode.htm?cmsid=77" target="_blank">
   Hong Kong Today
  </a>
  programme on Wednesday, to announce the results of its annual survey of the city's best and worst public washrooms.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hoi Hing Road public toilet in Tsuen Wan won top recognition, judged according to the association's CASH formula, which measures Comfort, Accessibility, Safety and Hygiene.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's very clean, and also very easy to go in to the toilet, and it's safe - that means the floor is not wet - and very hygienic. Most of the taps, or all of the taps, are using sensor control - no need to touch the toilet or the tap," said Hung.
  <br>
  <br>
  By contrast, Hung said the worst toilet was in Tsuen Wan Market, describing the washroom as dirty, smelly, with rusty facilities and a wet floor.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We asked the government to take action as soon as possible."
  <br>
  <br>
  Hung said over the past 10 years, after the government had injected about HK$6 million into refurbishing some 200 toilets, the image of the public facilities had greatly improved.

    OSC funding improves access to mental health therapy

<img alt="Dr Candice Powell expressed hope that with the help of OSC funding, students at risk of mental health problems could receive their services as soon as possible.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A pioneering initiative, one of the beneficiaries of this year's Operation Santa Claus (OSC), is hoping to improve access to mental health therapies, with practitioners providing free, short-term, and remote support to local citizens.
 <br>
  <br>
  Improving Access to Community Therapies (iACT) was designed and developed by Mind HK - a mental health charity set up in 2017 by Dr Lucy Lord to ensure no one faces a mental health problem alone in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last year, a report by the Chinese University of Hong Kong showed that 1 in 4 students suffered from mental health problems, pointing to the importance of early intervention to prevent student mental health further deteriorating.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dr Candice Powell, CEO of Mind HK, says their goal is to receive funding in order to serve at least 300 students to receive one-on-one psychological support based on the iACT model.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We believe that therapies shouldn't just be in the hospital but actually can happen in the community, so that's why we are launching this programme in secondary schools," said Dr Powell.
  <br>
  <br>
  Project coordinator Coco says she herself also benefited from the iACT short-term emotional support service after graduating from university and feeling anxious about her future.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The well-being practitioner used iACT as the therapy to how we live with our negative emotion and help me to find my life value. We can use another way to live with some negative emotion. We don't always need to fight them or eliminate those negative emotion," Coco said.
  <br>
  <br>
  As part of its pilot phase from 2021 to 2024, Mind HK trained over 100 well-being practitioners to work with youth and adults.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jointly organised by RTHK and South China Morning Post, OSC funds charitable projects that focus on children and youth, the elderly, the community, those with physical and mental disabilities, medical projects, and those concerning the environment.

    HK rejects latest US congressional report

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government said on Wednesday it strongly disapproves of and firmly rejects a US congressional report that criticised the SAR and central governments and the city's national security law.
 <br>
  <br>
  It said the US-China Economic and Security Review Commission (USCC) had used politics to prevail over law-based administration.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The HKSAR Government strongly disapproves of and firmly rejects USCC's wanton manoeuvre with politics prevailing over law-based administration and interference in the affairs of the HKSAR in the so-called report,” the government statement wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US report said changes in the SAR raised questions about Hong Kong’s ability to maintain its position as the financial connector between mainland China and the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  In response, the SAR government said the accusations are groundless attacks, slanders and smears against various aspects of Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The HKSAR Government strongly urges again individual United States politicians to discern facts from fallacies, respect the international law and basic norms governing international relations, and immediately stop interfering in Hong Kong matters, which are purely China's internal affairs," the government said.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said since the implementation of a national security law in 2020, the US had continued to turn a blind eye to the large-scale and incessant rioting which occurred in 2019 that devastated Hong Kong's society, livelihoods and the economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said the US also deliberately neglected the fact that the implementation of the law enabled livelihoods and economic activities to return to normal.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government said Hong Kong's rise in world competitiveness rankings to be among the world's top economies was testament to the fact that high-level security protection underpins high-quality development.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said the US enjoyed economic benefits in Hong Kong, with a trade surplus of some US$270 billion with the SAR over the past 10 years, and there were more than 1,200 US companies operating businesses in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government said all these demonstrated the close and long-standing economic ties between the two places, so a stable and prosperous Hong Kong was of mutual benefit to the US.

 The Hong Kong Observatory cancelled all typhoon signals at 10.10pm on Tuesday as Man-yi continues to weaken and moves away from Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  The T1 signal was issued on Monday morning and had been in force for well over 30 hours.
  <br>
  <br>
  The forecaster also noted that water level is expected to rise on Tuesday night and warned that minor flooding may occur in low-lying coastal areas.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Under the combined effect of spring tide, the northeast monsoon and Man-yi, the water level of the coast of Hong Kong will rise higher than normal tonight," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "From around 10pm tonight to midnight, a high water level of near 3 metres above Chart Datum is expected in Victoria Harbour, and a high water level of about 3.1 metres above Chart Datum is expected at Tai O."
  <br>
  <br>
  People are advised to stay away from the shoreline and remain on the alert.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday warned that anyone who intends to endanger national security will be punished in accordance with the law, after 45 opposition figures were sentenced to up to 10 years in prison for conspiracy to commit subversion.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, Lee said the court decision reflects the severity of the case.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The sentence shows the court confirmed that the offence of the defendants was extremely serious and they should be severely punished,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CE stressed Hong Kong is a society underpinned by the rule of law, and offenders must be held accountable.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Those involved acted under the guise of democracy and freedom to subvert the political regime of the HKSAR… This case shows that anyone who intends to subvert state power and endanger national security will ultimately be punished in accordance with the law.”
  <br>
  <br>
  A government spokesman, meanwhile, called on foreign governments to stop interfering in SAR affairs.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The HKSAR government has noticed that the United States and some Western countries, anti-China organisations, anti-China politicians and foreign media have recently made malicious attacks and smears on various cases,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The HKSAR government has stated on many occasions that like all cases, this case was handled strictly on the basis of evidence and in accordance with the law.”

    Power tariffs to climb by almost one percent in 2025

<img alt="Secretary for Environment Tse Chin-wan says the city's two power firms will raise their electricity tariffs by less than one percent on average next year. Photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1779930_1_20241119185403.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Electricity will cost slightly more for Hongkongers next year, with tariffs rising by 0.9 percent on Hong Kong Island and 0.98 percent in Kowloon and the New Territories.
 <br>
  <br>
  The city's two power firms, CLP and HK Electric, said even though fuel costs stabilised this year, ongoing geopolitical tensions meant they had to take on a more cautious approach.
  <br>
  <br>
  HK Electric noted that it also needs to pump in extra resources to further boost service reliability.
  <br>
  <br>
  "To handle more frequent extreme weather conditions, we need to improve our infrastructure so that we can still deliver reliable electricity to our customers even during bad weather. Also, we need to update our old and outdated facilities. All these investments will put pressure on electricity prices," its managing director Francis Cheng said.
  <br>
  <br>
  CLP's managing director, Joseph Law, pointed out that the company is dealing with challenges like inflation, rising material costs, and a tense labour force -- all of which are driving up its operational expenses.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But we understand that people are concerned about electricity prices, and we will keep working to improve our operating efficiency by managing our finances wisely and controlling expenses," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "While international fuel prices have stabilised somewhat over the past year, geopolitical risks remain, and global fuel costs are still relatively high, so the outlook isn’t too bright. We’ll continue to take a careful approach in managing our expenses."
  <br>
  <br>
  A climate economist said while the increases this time around are in line with estimates, he expects the tariff hikes to exacerbate in the years to come.
  <br>
  <br>
  "From the international perspective, I would say there is still uncertainty about the fuel cost, especially the fluctuation in oil prices that might affect the future natural gas price. I think we should pay more attention," William Yu, CEO of World Green Organisation, told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  Several lawmakers also raised concerns about the SAR's reliance on imported fuels, and urged the administration to speed up plans to find alternative energy supply sources.
  <br>
  <br>
  Environment secretary Tse Chin-wan said in response that the government has been negotiating with mainland officials about boosting its zero-carbon energy supply.
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted that there's land set aside in Tseung Kwan O for receiving nuclear power and the project is scheduled for completion by 2035.

    '50 percent more tourists to join mega events in 2025'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Tuesday said it expects mega events in the first half of next year to attract 840,000 tourists, a 50 percent rise when compared with the same period this year.
 <br>
  <br>
  At a press conference, officials said there will be more than 90 mega events in the first half of 2025, including festivals, conventions and sports events.
  <br>
  <br>
  They said the events are expected to generate total spending of HK$3.3 billion, which would be a 40 percent increase compared to the first half of 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked about the cancellation of events due to poor weather conditions, Deputy Financial Secretary Michael Wong said the government will have better arrangements by learning from the mainland and creating back-up plans for events like drone shows.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For example for some of the shows, the original plan was to have 2,000 drones in a show, and they lowered the density to around 400. This allowed the show to continue to be carried out," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I will learn from them, so for some of the shows in the future, that will be one of the alternative options that we will prepare for."
  <br>
  <br>
  Culture and tourism minister Kevin Yeung, meanwhile, said it is inevitable that outdoor events such as the cross-harbour swim run the risk of being affected by the weather.
  <br>
  <br>
  He admitted that tourists might feel disappointed with the cancellation of events, but dismissed worries that Hong Kong's reputation as a mega events hub could be damaged.

    Subversion case sentencing shows severity: Chris Tang

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Security Chris Tang said the sentences handed down on Tuesday in the city's largest national security case to date reflected the severity of the offence.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking after the High Court court sentenced 45 people for conspiracy to commit subversion, Tang also told reporters that the government will look into individual cases before deciding whether to appeal.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think different people may have different judgements about whether the sentencing is appropriate. But I think the important point is the rule of law," Tang said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, eight others, including former lawmakers James To and Roy Kwong, are currently on bail after they were arrested three years ago for participating in the unsanctioned Legco primary aimed at bringing down the government. They have yet to be charged.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For every case, if we have sufficient evidence, we will arrest and we will prosecute," Tang said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Barrister and Executive Councillor Ronny Tong told RTHK that the sentencing reflected the application of common law principles.
  <br>
  <br>
  "One can see that the sentencing may not be as severe as a lot of people originally think, but it has its basis by reason of the fact that the court is effectively sentencing these defendants according to common law principles," Tong said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "One must still remember that we are talking about serious crimes... A conspiracy crime may simply involve a situation where the crime has yet to be committed. Nevertheless from the sentencing, one can see that the court will treat it seriously and I think people should be aware of this."

<div class="itemFullText">
 Transport Secretary Lam Sai-hung on Tuesday said the government will carefully review fare increase requests from bus operators before making any decisions.
 <br>
  <br>
  KMB and New Lantao Bus are asking for 6.5 percent increases, while Citybus wants to put fares up by 9.5 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We’ll consider several factors, starting with how the public feels about it and the bus companies’ financial figures. We’ll also look at the services the bus operators offer. We will strictly play our gatekeeping role," Lam told reporters after attending a transport event.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lam added that officials will gather opinions from legislators and the general public as well as the Transport Advisory Committee, based on the existing mechanism.
  <br>
  <br>
  Legco's panel on transport is set to begin discussions on the matter on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Lam also said implementing time-varying tolls for the Tai Lam Tunnel would be one of the many viable options when the government takes control of the infrastructure in May.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said he hopes to present Legco the amendments to the tunnel's regulations by the end of this year and promised that the tunnel's tolls will be much lower than they are now.

<img alt="The court hands down jail sentences of at least seven years to Owen Chow, Gordon Ng and Gwyneth Ho." src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1779873_3_20241119164309.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Three of the defendants in Hong Kong's largest national security trial to date received the heaviest sentences among those considered "active participants" in the scheme aimed at bringing down the government.
 <br>
  <br>
  Former activist Owen Chow was given a jail term of seven years and nine months, Gordon Ng was jailed for seven years and three months, and former journalist Gwyneth Ho got seven years.
  <br>
  <br>
  National security judges Andrew Chan, Alex Lee and Johnny Chan pointed out that Chow, 27, was one of the initiators of a pledge relating to the scheme, which "certainly pointed to the fact that [Chow] was putting every effort in binding the participants to ensure its success”.
  <br>
  <br>
  He had pleaded not guilty.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chow was already jailed over a riot case, and Tuesday's sentence will be served consecutively because the judges ruled that they were "separate and distinct incidents".
  <br>
  <br>
  As for Ng, who had also pleaded not guilty, the judges said the 46-year-old "willingly and intentionally" facilitated the scheme.
  <br>
  <br>
  “This was exemplified by the fact that he placed a full-page advertisement in Apple Daily on 3 July 2020 urging candidates who lost in the Primary Election not to participate in the LegCo election and asking people not to vote for anyone who had not participated in the Primary Election,” the judgement said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho, meanwhile, was the only defendant who did not submit mitigation.
  <br>
  <br>
  She had pleaded not guilty as well.

 Cathay Pacific on Tuesday announced that its employees will see average salary increases of 3.8 percent next year.
 <br>
  <br>
  The flagship carrier thanked staff for their contributions to the company and pledged to grasp the growth opportunities provided by the third runway.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With the upcoming opening of the three-runway system, we are confident that we will move to even greater heights together as we strive to become one of the world’s greatest service brands," the airline said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last month, the airline gave employees a bonus equal to one month's salary.

 A stress test will be conducted at the Kai Tak Youth Sports Ground on Saturday, with the police saying the aim is to test communication and trust levels between various departments through scenario-based exercises.
 <br>
  <br>
  Five hundred members of the public will take part, along with 4,500 civil servants.
  <br>
  <br>
  Acting Senior Superintendent Ng Tsz-fai said tests will cover ticket inspections, security checks, designated seating arrangements, emergency response, crowd control and MTR passenger flow management.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The drill team will... test the security inspection procedures and simulate emergencies to evaluate the collaboration capabilities between various departments. This is the first time that there will be five thousand people and designated seating, so we can test the time required for entry and the clarity of instructions," Ng said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that the first exit test will begin at 5pm, with participants divided into groups of 1,000 and walking from the stadium to Sung Wong Toi Station. A second test will follow shortly afterwards, with participants walking to Kai Tak Station.
  <br>
  <br>
  MTR's Chief of Operating and Metro Segment Cheris Lee said trains will operate as usual, but there will be one-way only walking arrangements at the two stations during certain times.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The High Court says the prison sentences it handed out on Tuesday in Hong Kong’s largest national security case so far were based not only on the 2020 National Security Law (NSL), but also on common law principles.
 <br>
  <br>
  Forty-five people were given prison terms ranging from four year and two months to ten years for conspiracy to commit subversion, in relation to their involvement in unauthorised primary polls that were found to be part of a wider plot to seize control of the legislature and ultimately to overthrow the SAR government.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, questions were raised as to whether the defendants should be sentenced according to the penalties laid out under Article 22 of the NSL, which makes no mention of the offence of conspiracy.
  <br>
  <br>
  The article mandates prison sentences of between 10 years to life in prison for those deemed “principal offenders”, three to 10 years for “active” participants, and lesser penalties for “other participants”.
  <br>
  <br>
  The court decided that while the penalty banding is of “reference value, [it] should not be strictly applicable.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The judges said they also made reference to the common law offence of conspiracy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ultimately, the starting points of the custodial sentences the court meted out to all defendants ended up being in line with the penalties mandated under Article 22 of the NSL.
  <br>
  <br>
  “When the court assessed the seriousness of the circumstances of the case, the prime focus was on the offender’s acts, as well as the actual consequences, potential risks and possible influence entailed”, the judges wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  They stressed that the defendants were not sentenced for any acts prior to the enactment of the NSL in 2020, and no mainland sentences were used as a reference.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bench also rejected arguments that the scheme was doomed to fail and the defendants should be given lighter sentences.
  <br>
  <br>
  “In order to succeed, the organisers and participants might have hurdles to overcome, that however was expected in every subversion case where efforts were made to overthrow or paralyse a government,” they wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  “In this case, candidates for the primary election were essential [characters] of the scheme, without them, the scheme simply could not get off the ground. They lent their support to and actively participated in the scheme.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The bench added: “Had the scheme been carried out to the very end, the adverse consequences would be far reaching and no less serious than overthrowing the government of the [Hong Kong SAR].”
  <br>
  <br>
  Besides the four “principal offenders”, 41 other defendants were deemed "active participants” by the court.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among them, jailed activist Owen Chow was jailed for seven years and nine months, Gordon Ng received a jail term of seven years and three months, and former journalist Gwyneth Ho was imprisoned for seven years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Former lawmakers Lam Cheuk-ting and Leung Kwok-hung, as well as ex-hospital worker Winnie Yu, were each sentenced to six years and nine months behind bars.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another defendant, former student activist Joshua Wong, was slapped with a jail term of four years and eight months.
  <br>
  <br>
  The court reduced his sentence by one-third for his guilty plea, but said it “did not consider him to be a person of good character” given his criminal records.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It should be noted that [Wong] committed the present offence while he was on court bail," the court said. “We did not think we should give further reduction because [Wong] could not have all the offences sentenced in the same proceedings. The sentence we passed on [Wong] also would not have a crushing effect on him.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Among those who were given the lightest sentences of four years and two months are former lawmakers Jeremy Tam and Claudia Mo.
  <br>
  <br>
  Regarding Mo, the judges said they were “sympathetic to the ailing health” of her husband, Philip Bowring.
  <br>
  <br>
  “However, the health condition of [Mo’s] husband is not a matter that can militate against the sentence to be passed on [Mo],” the judges said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some defendants were given sentence reductions after saying they didn’t know they were breaking the law when taking part in the scheme.
  <br>
  <br>
  “As to those who pleaded ‘ignorance of the law’ as mitigation, we were satisfied that they might have been misled by [Benny Tai] into thinking that the scheme was not unlawful”, the judges said.

    HK face Mauritius, set sights on third straight win

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong will be looking to record their third straight victory under newly-appointed head coach Ashley Westwood as they take on Mauritius on Tuesday in an international football friendly at Mong Kok Stadium.
 <br>
  <br>
  A win over Mauritius could see the 48-year-old Englishman become the first Hong Kong manager since Kim Pan-gon in 2016 to win three consecutive matches, following a pair of convincing showings over Cambodia and the Philippines.
  <br>
  <br>
  RTHK's Asia football correspondent, Chris KL Lau, says Westwood will look to experiment with his line-up.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he also acknowledged the challenges of facing a competitive, 178th-ranked Mauritius side.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong will want to extend their momentum fresh off their win over the Philippines," Lau noted.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Westwood may use this game to experiment with his line-up, though fans can expect another entertaining, forward-thinking, and attacking Hong Kong team."
  <br>
  <br>
  Mauritius, meanwhile, enter the match-up having recorded away defeats to Syria and India in September.
  <br>
  <br>
  Avoiding defeat also guarantees Hong Kong a place in pot two for December's AFC Asian Cup qualifying draw, following Singapore's loss to Chinese Taipei.

    Tai, three others named 'principal offenders'

<img alt='The four "principal offenders" in the case are jailed from six years and one month to 10 years each.' src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1779855_1_20241119123204.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 In handing down sentences for subversion to 45 opposition figures on Tuesday, the High Court named four of them as "principal offenders", with former legal academic Benny Tai deemed as the initiator of an unofficial legislative primary election in 2020 aimed at overthrowing the government.
 <br>
  <br>
  Tai received the heaviest jail term of 10 years among all defendants.
  <br>
  <br>
  The three presiding national security judges – Andrew Chan, Alex Lee and Johnny Chan – considered a starting point of 15 years behind bars for Tai, and reduced that by one-third after he pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit subversion.
  <br>
  <br>
  “​​In short, [Tai] was not only the initiator of the scheme, but also an organiser of the primary election… He was the mastermind behind, hence could well be placed in the ‘[principal] offender’ category,” the judges wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  “[Tai] might not be the one standing in the primary election or the actual Legco election, he however provided the necessary platform for those who intended to exercise the vetoing power under the scheme.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Three others – former lawmaker Au Nok-hin and former district councillors Andrew Chiu and Ben Chung – were also named “principal offenders”.
  <br>
  <br>
  They had pleaded guilty and become prosecution witnesses in the trial.
  <br>
  <br>
  The trio received jail sentences of six years and one month to seven years each.
  <br>
  <br>
  With starting points of 12 to 15 years in jail, the judges said the three had their sentences reduced for assisting the prosecution in the trial, as well as other mitigation factors.
  <br>
  <br>
  The court heard that the conspiracy in this case was aimed at undermining or overthrowing the political system and structure of the Hong Kong SAR.

    HK must strengthen its role as an IFC: He Lifeng

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Vice Premier He Lifeng says Hong Kong must enhance its status as an international financial centre to fast-track the country's development as a financial powerhouse.
 <br>
  <br>
  Delivering a speech at the Global Financial Leaders' Investment Summit on Tuesday, he said Hong Kong has a pivotal role to play, with its robust financial system, growing appeal to investors and sound capital markets.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will support more quality enterprises to list and issue bonds in Hong Kong. We will continue to expand mutual market access between the mainland and Hong Kong in areas such as stocks, bonds, financial management and interest rate swaps," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will improve the mechanism for the regular issuance of treasury bonds, steadily upscale the issuance in Hong Kong and support Hong Kong in consolidating its position as a global offshore renminbi business hub."
  <br>
  <br>
  He also said the central authorities will continue to support Chinese financial institutions in Hong Kong, enabling them to expand and enhance the city's financial development.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will continue to deepen financial cooperation in the Greater Bay Area, and take forward the interfacing of rules and mechanisms between mainland cities in the GBA, Hong Kong and Macau in order to create more room for financial development in Hong Kong," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The general principle is that so long as it is conducive to the plan of the central authorities, to the financial reform and development of our country and to the development of Hong Kong as an international financial centre, we will explore and implement it."
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that he hopes Hong Kong will continue to leverage its unique advantages, being backed by the motherland while connecting to the world, and will seize opportunities from the country's deepening reforms and Chinese modernisation while dovetailing with the national development strategy.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said this will help Hong Kong contribute to high-quality national development, exemplifying the One Country, Two Systems principle on its journey.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Forty-five people on Tuesday were sentenced from four years and two months to 10 years in prison for conspiracy to commit subversion in the city's largest national security trial to date.
 <br>
  <br>
  Thirty-one of them pleaded guilty and 14 others were convicted in May for taking part in a plot to overthrow the government by securing a majority in the Legislative Council and indiscriminately voting down the administration's budget and spending initiatives to cause a constitutional crisis.
  <br>
  <br>
  The High Court sentenced former legal academic Benny Tai, who it said “advocated for a revolution” and masterminded the scheme, to 10 years in prison as a principal offender under Article 22 of the National Security Law (NSL).
  <br>
  <br>
  Three others who were also deemed to be principal offenders for their roles in organising an unsanctioned Legco primary poll related to the conspiracy – former lawmaker Au Nok-hin, along with ex-district councillors Andrew Chiu and Ben Chung – were given jail terms ranging from six years and one month to seven years each.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 41 others were all ruled to have been "active participants" in the plot, with the heaviest sentences meted out to Owen Chow – who was jailed for seven years and nine months – and Gordon Ng, who got seven years and three months. The lightest sentence given was four years and two months.
  <br>
  <br>
  In handing down the sentences, national security judges Andrew Chan, Alex Lee and Johnny Chan stressed that "had the scheme been carried out to the very end, the adverse consequences would be far reaching and no less serious than overthrowing the Government of the HKSAR."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Whether the scheme would ultimately succeed, it was not for this Court to speculate," they added. "What we were sure was that all the participants had put in every endeavour to make it a success."
  <br>
  <br>
  They also stressed that while the court looked into things that happened before the NSL was enacted on July 1, 2020 to assess the seriousness and extensiveness of the conspiracy, none of the defendants were actually sentenced for any acts they committed during this time.
  <br>
  <br>
  “However, they remained willing parties to that agreement and continued their participation in the scheme after it had been rendered criminal by the NSL”, they noted.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two of the 47 defendants were acquitted earlier.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Observatory on Tuesday said the T1 signal will remain in force until at least 10pm.
 <br>
  <br>
  It said Severe Tropical Storm Man-yi had continued to weaken, and was closest to the SAR, skirting within about 400 kilometres of the city. It issued the T1 on Monday morning.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Observatory warned that under the combined effect of spring tide, the northeast monsoon and Man-yi, coastal water levels would will be higher than normal between 10 pm and midnight on Tuesday, and warned of possible minor flooding in some low-lying coastal areas, and urged the public to take care.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There will be swells," it added. "Members of the public should stay away from the shoreline and not engage in water sports."

<div class="itemFullText">
 The government said three franchised bus operators have asked for fare hikes of between 6.5 and 9.5 percent.
 <br>
  <br>
  In documents submitted to the legislature, the Transport and Logistics Bureau said KMB and New Lantao Bus are seeking hikes of 6.5 percent, while Citybus wants a 9.5 percent increase.
  <br>
  <br>
  The companies made the applications for higher fares earlier in the year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials said the bus operators have averaged around 3.7 million passenger trips a day in the first half of this year, about 90 to 95 percent of what they were before the pandemic.
  <br>
  <br>
  They said the government has been helping the firms boost income and cut costs.
  <br>
  <br>
  "However, with rising salary expenses and volatile fuel costs, as well as continued competition for passengers with other transport modes, the financial situation of franchised bus operators has not been satisfactory," the bureau said in the document.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government said it will strike a balance between the public's affordability and financial sustainability of the operators when considering the applications.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lawmakers are due to discuss the matter on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last year, the bus firms raised fares from between a little less than 4 percent and 7 percent.

    Tai Lam Tunnel to charge time-varying tolls: sources

<img alt="Sources said the authorities plan to charge time-varying tolls for Tai Lam Tunnel from May next year. File photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1779732_1_20241118184742.jpg&q=65">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Sources said on Monday that the government plans to charge cheaper, time-varying tolls for the Tai Lam Tunnel when it takes control of the infrastructure in May.
 <br>
  <br>
  The tolling system would be similar to the ones for the three cross-harbour tunnels brought in last year, with three levels of charges for peak, general and non-peak hours.
  <br>
  <br>
  Currently, private car drivers need to pay HK$58 for using the tunnel connecting Ting Kau with Yuen Long.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sources said in future, it will be HK$45 for peak, HK$30 for general and HK$18 for non-peak hours.
  <br>
  <br>
  An across-the-board charge of HK$28 is being mooted for taxis, down from HK$58 at the moment.
  <br>
  <br>
  And commercial vehicles will pay HK$43, which would be cheaper than current toll levels.
  <br>
  <br>
  DAB lawmaker Ben Chan, who chairs the Legco transport panel, said he finds HK$45 for private cars during peak hours to be on the high side.
  <br>
  <br>
  As for taxis, he said the toll could be set at HK$25, the same as that for the three cross-harbour tunnels.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Compared with the current situation, perhaps some truck drivers using Tuen Mun Road may turn to Tai Lam Tunnel (during peak hours in future), causing further congestion," he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So I believe if the government charges the time-varying tolls, that can allow the spread of traffic in an orderly manner. I think that's a good thing."
  <br>
  <br>
  The tunnel's 30-year franchise began in 1995 and is currently fully-owned by a subsidiary of Sun Hung Kai Properties.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An associate professor of environmental science on Monday said sustainable grazing practices backed by regulations and community involvement are vital for protecting giant wild panda habitats.
 <br>
  <br>
  Binbin Li from Duke Kunshan University led a research project from July 2018 to May 2024 in China, quantifying the damage caused by livestock grazing on bamboo ecosystems and other vital vegetation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The problem is fragmentation. We have agriculture, cropland, linear infrastructure and also residency area, so that makes their habitat fragmented, and then a lot of the populations are so small, and we're worried about the local extinction of some of the small populations," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The key right now is how we can reconnect some of the habitat and also reduce degradation for example from livestock grazing or the other types of natural resource uses."
  <br>
  <br>
  Li said that by assessing the impact of grazing on pandas, the study was able to identify suitable grazing areas and patterns, adding that these findings lay the groundwork for developing effective grazing management policies to safeguard panda habitats.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There is a livestock ban in certain areas but we also provide composition from the government and to the local communities but not just composite them to sell their livestock but also provide some long-time subsidy for example give like job opportunities to hire them as rangers so then they can receive long-term incentives not to have livestock again," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is key for a lot of conservation actions. How you can provide a long-term mechanism to incentivise local communities and to do conservation."
  <br>
  <br>
  Li was speaking to reporters after the kick-off ceremony for the 29th Ocean Park Conservation Day under the theme "Safeguarding Wild Giant Pandas and Their Habitats".
  <br>
  <br>
  In regards to the six pandas living in Hong Kong, she said pandas in captivity need to be given a lot of space and care, adding that she hopes the SAR's enthusiasm for the animals will drive conservation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You need to pay attention to the welfare of pandas in captivity and enough space, and then the air conditioning is good, especially during summer, because they love cool temperatures. I think captive pandas are very important as a window to understand what is going on with the wild pandas. So the key thing for captivity or zoos is to do education," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "These six pandas, maybe they can attract more attention from the public and to conserve pandas in the wild because there are a lot more out there and they are facing more threats than the captive pandas."

    'China to build more Belt and Road transport networks'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Vice Minister of Transport Fu Xuyin said on Monday that the nation will keep building transport networks with Belt and Road countries, while continuing its internal reform of logistics and transport to lower costs.
 <br>
  <br>
  He made the comment while giving a speech at the Asian Logistics, Maritime and Aviation Conference in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  The official said international supply chains are under duress amid global uncertainties, in part arising from geopolitics and trade protectionism.
  <br>
  <br>
  And Hong Kong, Fu said, will continue to play a key role in stabilising global supply chains through its logistics, maritime and aviation developments.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will continue to strengthen the shipping cooperation between the mainland and Hong Kong, consolidating and enhancing the SAR's status as an international shipping centre," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will facilitate Hong Kong's deeper integration into the country's overall development, and better utilise its advantages of having the motherland's backing and its connectivity to the world, so as to contribute globally in trading and shipping."
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at the same event, Acting Chief Executive Eric Chan said the airport's third-runway system to be launched later this month will be a game-changer because it'll bring extra capacity.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that the government envisages Hong Kong rising as a green and smart port, as it outlined in its plans to develop the SAR into a green maritime fuel bunkering centre.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The observatory on Monday said the chances of it issuing a T3 over Severe Tropical Storm Man-yi are not high, because winds across the city are not expected to get so strong.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Unless Man-yi adopts a more northerly track or edges closer to the coast of Guangdong with a higher intensity, the chance of issuing Strong Wind Signal No 3 is relatively low," said the observatory.
  <br>
  <br>
  It added that the T1 issued in the morning will remain in place until at least 10am on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Although Hong Kong is expected to be spared the worst of the storm, showers are likely to become more frequent on Tuesday and some minor flooding is possible in low-lying areas over the next two days, forecasters said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Man-yi is expected to skirt around 400 kilometres to the south of the SAR on Tuesday morning.

    First electric ferry to begin tests in HK waters

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's first electric ferry will arrive in the city this week and will be put into service after tests are completed, the Environmental Protection Department (EPD) said on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The government earlier earmarked HK$350 million for a pilot scheme subsidising operators to introduce a total of four electric ferries.
  <br>
  <br>
  The first of these, operated by Sun Ferry, will conduct its final tests in Hong Kong waters by the end of this year, before it starts running between North Point and Hung Hom.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vanessa Au, an assistant director of the EPD, said the use of electric ferries will improve air quality around Victoria Harbour, and they are also more cost-effective.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We hope that the operating expenses for ferries can be reduced, but we have to test how much the actual reduction can be," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Through this pilot scheme, we hope within 24 months we can compare the electricity consumption and the traditional fuel consumption. Because it's using the motor technology, we hope to cut the maintenance cost as well."
  <br>
  <br>
  Au said charging an electric ferry for about eight hours overnight is enough for a full day's operation.
  <br>
  <br>
  She added that solar panels will be installed on the deck of the ferries to support part of the lighting system.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zheng Cheng-qi, deputy general manager of Sun Ferry, said he hopes to see more electric ferries in Hong Kong, but the industry needs further assistance from the government.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Charging facilities may be an obstacle. If supporting facilities can be refined, ferry services can have a better prospect in Hong Kong," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The EPD said charging facilities have already been installed at North Point, Hung Hom and Kwun Tong ferry piers.

    Hiring all year round boosts civil service recruitment

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Civil Service Secretary Ingrid Yeung on Monday said a year-round recruitment drive is proving effective in tackling a manpower crunch across various departments.
 <br>
  <br>
  The government has been continuously recruiting for some roles since October last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a Legislative Council panel meeting, Yeung said this allows job offers to be made more quickly compared to the previous system of only receiving applications once every one or two years.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We have shortened the time required for approval from 10 months to four months, so there has been a tangible surge in the number of acceptances,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Because in the past, the period was too long, so successful candidates accepted other job offers. With the year-round recruitment process which has been put in place for some 13 months, we do see an increase in recruitment numbers.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeung also told lawmakers that 3,000 civil servants resigned in the 2023/24 period, a rate of 1.8 percent. She said this was a fall from previous years and was “a really low percentage” compared to the private sector.
  <br>
  <br>
  “In the private sector, according to statistics, the resignation rate stands at double-digit figures in most cases. So 1.8 percent is a really low figure. Forty percent of those resigning from the service have done so before the end of their probationary period,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “You could say that perhaps the candidate chosen hasn’t been the right one, and it’s a process for the candidates as well. For the new recruit, early on, if they know that their aspirations and expectations are not met, or if they find themselves unsuited for this post, then they should leave early instead of dragging on.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Election Committee lawmaker So Cheung-wing said that out of hundreds of thousands of applicants, only around 10,000 people had been recruited, questioning whether it was a matter of quality or whether the bureau is trying to control spending.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeung said it was because many of the applicants weren't up to scratch, adding that money is available to plug the gaps in manpower.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A non-governmental organisation says having a hearing impairment should not be an impediment to seeking mental health support.
 <br>
  <br>
  That is why Silence Limited, one of 11 Operation Santa Claus beneficiaries this year, has launched a project titled "Finding a Way to My Heart."
  <br>
  <br>
  The NGO's Operations Director, Ken Ng, said Silence Limited would provide sign language interpretation services via the project for people with hearing loss during their consultations at public hospitals.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Mental health issues [are] not easy to diagnose by equipment or machines. Basically, the psychiatrist or the doctors have to talk or communicate with the patients to find out what the real issue is," he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But many of our clients report that it is not easy to get an in-house sign language interpreter to attend the consultation," said Ng.
  <br>
  <br>
  Established in 2008, Silence Limited aims to bring people with hearing impairments together, promote social inclusion, and foster equal development.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our projects mainly focus on trying to fill up the gaps of existing services, how to improve the mental health situation of our clients. So we will provide or acquire sign language interpreters to participate in the medical consultation sections as well as the workshops or even the activities of our programme," Ng said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jointly organised by RTHK and South China Morning Post, OSC funds charitable projects that focus on children and youth, the elderly, the community, those with physical and mental disabilities, medical projects, and those concerning the environment.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Observatory issued a T1 at 6.40am on Monday as Tropical Cyclone Man-yi moved towards the SAR, and warned that it might issue a higher signal later in the day or early on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  "The Standby Signal, No. 1 will remain in force at least until 6pm," said the weather forecaster in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The storm is forecast to come within 800 kilometres of the city around midnight on Monday, but is expected to weaken.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Observatory said the approach of Man-yi and the northeast monsoon would bring windy conditions on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Depending on the distance between Man-yi and the Pearl River Estuary, its degree of weakening and the change in local wind conditions, the Observatory will assess the need of issuing the Strong Wind Signal, No. 3 tonight to early tomorrow," the Observatory added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Observatory warned that some low-lying areas may see minor flooding in some areas because of the combined effect of the spring tide, the northeast monsoon and Man-yi, and urged the public to take care.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The 31st edition of the Apec Economic Leaders’ Week has wrapped up with host nation Peru saying it has furthered three objectives, including fostering inclusive and sustainable economic growth.
 <br>
  <br>
  The leaders also issued a joint declaration, calling for a concerted effort in tackling issues such as climate change.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to local and international press at the end of the week-long Apec meeting, Peruvian President Dina Boluarte said she was honoured to have hosted the leaders of the bloc’s 20 other economies.
  <br>
  <br>
  She also praised the professional work of her colleagues for the past year, saying it has reaped immense rewards.
  <br>
  <br>
  Those included the signing of a free trade agreement with Hong Kong, and updating the existing one with China, its biggest trading partner.
  <br>
  <br>
  Boluarte also reiterated three thematic priorities - trade and investment for inclusive and interconnected growth; innovation and digitalisation to promote transition to a formal economy; and sustainable growth for resilient development.
  <br>
  <br>
  Just before making her concluding remarks, the Peruvian leader and her counterparts got together one final time for the family photo, a longstanding tradition for the Apec summit.
  <br>
  <br>
  The session offers a chance for the host nation to showcase their traditional attire, but Peru decided to use the occasion to promote their textile products made of alpaca fibre.
  <br>
  <br>
  Each leader was given a vicuna wool scarf from a local luxury brand. The price tag? US$1,415.
  <br>
  <br>
  A few hours after the summit concluded, the customary Leaders’ Declaration was released.
  <br>
  <br>
  The goals were similar to those in past years, including tackling climate change, reforming the World Trade Organisation, and achieving food and energy security.

 The Hong Kong Observatory says it will issue a T1 between 6am and 9am on Monday as Tropical Cyclone Man-yi moves towards the territory.
 <br>
  <br>
  The storm is forecast to come within 800 kilometres of the city around midnight tonight, but is expected to weaken.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, windy conditions are likely by Tuesday, the observatory said, warning that some low-lying areas may see flooding.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There will be a spring tide in the next couple of days. The sea level will be particularly high during the high tide overnight. Under the combined effect of the northeast monsoon and Man-yi, the sea level will generally be about a further 0.3 metres above the spring tide at night on Monday and Tuesday. Minor flooding may occur in individual low-lying areas. Members of the public please take appropriate precautions," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The observatory added that depending on the storm's intensity and distance from the city, it may issue a higher warning signal on Monday night or early Tuesday.

    'Carer hotline should have emergency response team'

<img alt="SoCo urges the government to set up a team offering emergency services under its 24-hour hotline for carers. Photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1779566_1_20241117152725.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A hotline offering assistance to caregivers is failing to address the urgent needs of some callers and a special team is needed to provide emergency support, a community group says.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 182 183 hotline launched last year is staffed 24 hours a day and the government says it offers strong support to callers with a range of enquiries, including those who want counselling or details of community services.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the Society for Community Organisation (SoCo) on Sunday said a joint study with Lingnan University's Asia-Pacific Institute of Ageing Studies (APIAS) has shed light on the difficult situation many carers find themselves in.
  <br>
  <br>
  A survey carried out between March and June this year found that on average, those being looked after suffered from two chronic illnesses – as did the carers themselves.
  <br>
  <br>
  Professor Dickson Chan, the director of APIAS, said the hotline isn't enough to address the needs of some carers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They [hotline staff] may give them another phone number and ask them to call another organisation. This means that actually they cannot receive concrete and immediate support through the hotline," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our proposal is maybe the government can consider setting up a special team and the special team is attached to the hotline. So when the older people are in urgent need... the hotline can maybe pass the needs to a special team and after a brief assessment, the team can offer immediate support services for the older people."
  <br>
  <br>
  SoCo meanwhile called for the government to relax eligibility requirements so more people can get financial support under the Scheme on Living Allowance for Carers of Elderly Persons from Low-income Families.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Plumbers, electricians and specialised construction workers will be among those first invited to Hong Kong under the SAR's next scheme to bring in employees from elsewhere, the government said on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Officials say Hong Kong faces a shortfall of around 180,000 workers by 2028, but plans are already afoot to bring in 30,000 skilled technicians over three years under a new scheme starting in 2025.
  <br>
  <br>
  Labour Secretary Chris Sun told TVB that the administration will first focus on finding new blood for sectors facing the worst manpower crunches.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said their visas will tie them to the occupation they are in when they first move to the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There will surely be special arrangements for these visas, meaning that before they become Hongkongers, they will be required to stay in the job where we had a shortage. This is very clear," the minister said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But after seven years when they obtain permanent residency, you can't have so many requirements. We surely cannot lock workers down to a particular job forever."
  <br>
  <br>
  The labour chief said he believes the workers concerned will mostly choose to stay in their profession after becoming a permanent resident.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also stressed that the government remains committed to encouraging locals into work, adding that subsidies for those re-joining the workforce will remain in place.

    Thousands join 10km races on airport's third runway

<div class="itemFullText">
 Some 12,000 people on Sunday took part in special races on the airport's third runway to celebrate its opening later this month.
 <br>
  <br>
  The other two runways at Chek Lap Kok remained in use as the 10-kilometre events took place, with Hong Kong long-distance runner Virginia Lo among those on the tarmac as planes went up and down nearby.
  <br>
  <br>
  The elite athlete sponsored by the Sports Institute was the first to the finish line among local runners and she said the time was her personal best.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's quite extraordinary. Because when I was running, there was really an aeroplane next to me. Of course it wasn't very close, but when you run, when you see a plane nearby you feel very excited," Lo said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I don't think the weather affected the race much. Luckily the sun wasn't shining, this is good for runners. Also when we started, the rain had stopped. So I find the weather quite acceptable."
  <br>
  <br>
  World-renowned actor Chow Yun-fat also took part in one of the races, and he was happy with the experience.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's very....very special. You can see planes on both sides, taking off and landing, taking off and landing," he told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I was concerned I couldn't run. If it was raining heavily, I wouldn't have taken part. But when I arrived, it stopped. And when we were actually running, the wind was quite good."

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan said on Sunday that a cross-border investment programme linking Shanghai, Shenzhen and Hong Kong has boosted the SAR's attractiveness in global markets.
 <br>
  <br>
  Writing on his weekly blog, Chan said the number of eligible stocks now stands at more than 3,300 – up from about 800 when Stock Connect was launched 10 years ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said daily transactions by mainland investors buying local stocks average about HK$38 billion, or almost 17 percent of total turnover.
  <br>
  <br>
  For overseas investors buying and selling mainland stocks through Hong Kong, the average daily amount is 123 billion renminbi, or 6.7 percent of turnover.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the local stock market has a total market value of HK$35 trillion, which is a 40 percent increase from 10 years ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Chan said the government is fostering links with the Global South and aims to attract high quality companies to list in the city and roll out cross-border investment products.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said this will allow Hong Kong to better make use of its function as a testing ground for the internationalisation of the renminbi.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that the third Global Financial Leaders' Investment Summit to be held this week will involve a few hundred senior members of staff from international financial institutions, and will allow participants to get an accurate understanding of the mainland's economic development and the financial opportunities it offers.

 Chief Executive John Lee says Hong Kong's new free trade agreement with Peru will take effect in about six months or so, as he urged SAR businesses to “understand and appreciate” the pact and join the government’s efforts to explore opportunities in emerging markets.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to the media at the conclusion of his trip to Lima, Lee said that as well as attending the Apec summit, the Hong Kong delegation achieved three key results, the first of which was demonstrating the city’s commitment to promoting regional economic and trade cooperation.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Second, we explored new growth areas for Hong Kong and explored market opportunities in South America,” he continued, citing the pact with Peru.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the agreement will open new doors for businesses, adding that he is confident Hong Kong people can get around the language barrier.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Hong Kong people have been doing business with different parts of the world, including the Middle East, including countries such as Korea and Japan. So obviously, language is an issue, but it's not a barrier,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I believe in the businessmen’s versatility and adaptability.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee said the government will lead promotional efforts so that the city’s businesses can better understand the Peruvian market.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another way to fast-track exchanges between the two sides, Lee said, is to establish chambers of commerce and he has already made this pitch to Peruvian officials.
  <br>
  <br>
  The third and final achievement in Lima, the chief executive went on to say, was enhancing relations with members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean).
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted that he held bilateral meetings with leaders of Malaysia, Vietnam and Singapore, and said there are plans to increase direct flights between Hong Kong and several Asean destinations.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CE had two informal exchanges in Lima with Xi Jinping and Lee expressed gratitude to the president for his "care and guidance"
  <br>
  <br>
  “President Xi has always been caring about Hong Kong. I have reported to him Hong Kong's situation regarding the economy and development. He is well-versed of our development and has given me encouragement,” Lee said.

    Kai Tak hosts rugby match as dummy run for new venue

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Kai Tak Sports Park on Saturday hosted an international rugby match in gloomy weather as another trial event to test the site's smaller outdoor venue, with more signage and faster security checks.
 <br>
  <br>
  The match between Hong Kong and Brazil kicked off at around 4 pm at the Kai Tak Youth Sports Ground.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was the second test event at the 5,000-seat venue, which hosted a local football league game last month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Around 2,500 people turned up to the sports ground in the end, according to the government, fewer than the previous estimate of 3,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  The rugby match, which ended in pouring rain, saw the SAR team claim a 38-17 victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials including sports minister Kevin Yeung and security chief Chris Tang were spotted at the stadium, with the latter saying authorities have made improvements since the previous trial event.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have doubled the number of security screening counters, and set up fast lanes for those who did not bring any bags," Tang told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeung said after the match that the event went more smoothly than the first trial, and that the government would continue to put the sports ground to the test.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will continue to hold a series of trial events and drills until the venue's official opening in the first quarter of next year... Next Saturday, we will conduct a stress test with 5,000 people," Yeung said, adding that more details would be unveiled in the coming week.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chris Brooke, chairman of Hong Kong, China Rugby, hailed the test run's success.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's been a great opportunity for our team to come to operate an event here, in advance of the Hong Kong Sevens next March. As we build up towards the Sevens, it's been a great experience and a very good opportunity for our rugby community to come to the venue to experience the Kai Tak Sports Park, and to see what a great venue it is," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Spectators must purchase their tickets online prior to the event, and they were not allowed to bring in long umbrellas or any food and drink.
  <br>
  <br>
  But a spectator surnamed Mak said the rule was too strict.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A drawback is that we are not allowed to bring our water bottles into the venue. I wish they could be more lenient and let us bring our own water," she told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  For rugby-lover Derek, the cloudy weather posed a bit of a problem.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's quite convenient to get from the MTR station to the venue, but it's troublesome to have to carry an umbrella on rainy days," he said. "I would suggest adding some covers for walkways... My feet were completely soaked."
  <br>
  <br>
  The sports park's indoor stadium is to host a basketball match on December 7, while the first trial run at the main stadium is scheduled for January next year.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee had his most hectic day yet in his week-long visit of Peru, signing a free trade agreement with the nation and meeting with the leaders of Malaysia, Vietnam and Singapore on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) summit.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lee also attended an informal dialogue on Friday, Lima time, briefing regional leaders on the SAR’s strengths as well as its role in China’s Belt and Road initiative and Apec development.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong leader then met Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim for the first time since July last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  He thanked Anwar for supporting the SAR’s plan to establish an Economic and Trade Office in Kuala Lumpur, the fourth in the region known as the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or Asean.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee also congratulated Malaysia for taking the chairmanship of Asean next year, and hoped the nation will continue to support Hong Kong's early accession to the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, or Rcep.
  <br>
  <br>
  After attending another Apec dialogue where he exchanged views Chilean President Gabriel Boric, Lee had two more bilateral meeting with Vietnamese President Luong Cuong and Singaporean Prime Minister Lawrence Wong.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both countries are key trading partners of Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SAR leader’s day culminated in the signing of the FTA between Hong Kong and Peru, and he got to relax by watching cultural performances at an Apec gala dinner.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Saturday, Lima time, Lee will attend the Apec Economic Leaders' meeting retreat and meet with Peruvian business sector representatives.
