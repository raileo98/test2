    Smart system to take effect at Ting Kau Bridge

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Transport Department on Friday said it will implement a smart highway system at Ting Kau Bridge by the end of this month.
 <br>
  <br>
  It said the system has the ability to detect traffic accidents, and make appropriate arrangements to ensure a smooth traffic flow.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on an RTHK programme, Assistant Commissioner for Transport (Strategic Studies) Leung Sai-ho said the Automatic Incident Detection System can notify staff at the Tsing Ma Control Area in 10 seconds if it notices any abnormalities.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In cases in which a car suddenly stops moving, or slows down, or drives in the opposite direction, or objects fall on to the road, the system can analyse footage and deduce that a traffic incident has happened and tell our staff to act," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If we do not have such systems, we will have to detect incidents through the human eye, which would take minutes," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Leung said on-site staff may open up the hard shoulder of Ting Kau Bridge southbound to ease traffic flow, along with lane control signals and variable message signs to allow vehicles to pass by.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added message boards have already been installed along the road, aiming to provide real-time information to drivers.
  <br>
  <br>
  The system will be in place on December 29 for a one-month trial.
  <br>
  <br>
  The department said a mid-term review would be conducted in around six months if the scheme runs smoothly.
  <br>
  <br>
  Leung said the department would analyse traffic data collected and fine tune its implementation of the system.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China's top tennis player Zhang Zhizhen has chosen Hong Kong as his training ground ahead of the new ATP season, saying the move was “deeply personal”.
 <br>
  <br>
  "When I was 15, I played in the ITF Junior Tournament (Grade 4) here," the world number 45 said in an interview with Hong Kong media.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That's why I was really looking forward to coming."
  <br>
  <br>
  Having turned pro in 2012, the 28-year-old Shanghai native had a breakthrough in 2022, by becoming the first Chinese male player in the Open era to reach the top 100.
  <br>
  <br>
  He continued to make steady progress, rising to a career-high world number 31 in July this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  As the new season approaches, Zhang has set his sights on maintaining his momentum.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I want to have a better year (in 2025). Next year, my goal is trying to keep my ranking at around 30," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Still seeking his maiden ATP title, Zhang said it would be extra sweet if he could achieve that feat in front of a home crowd at the Shanghai Masters scheduled for September.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That would be an amazing week for me," he said.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping fully endorsed the work of senior Macau officials during his second day in the SAR, while also meeting Hong Kong Chief Executive John Lee, who visited the neighbouring city on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Meeting the heads of the executive, legislative and judicial branches of Macau, the president said the three organs of government have "comprehensively, accurately and unwaveringly" implemented One Country, Two Systems.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Xi said that under the leadership of Macau SAR Chief Executive Ho Iat-seng, the branches performed their duties pragmatically and effectively over the past five years," a Xinhua report read.
  <br>
  <br>
  The news agency added that Xi expressed appreciation to the representatives across different sectors for contributing to Macau's long-term prosperity and stability, and called on them to "stay united and work for greater achievements".
  <br>
  <br>
  Apart from outgoing leader Ho Iat-seng and his successor Sam Hou-fai, the president also greeted former chief executives Edmund Ho and Fernando Chui.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, Xi received Hong Kong Chief Executive John Lee, who was in Macau to attend celebrations marking the 25th anniversary of the SAR's establishment.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to Xinhua, the president urged Hong Kong and Macau to "strive for greater accomplishments and achieve better development", while declaring One Country, Two Systems has entered a new stage.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The two special administrative regions should learn from each other, strengthen exchanges and cooperation, and create a brighter future," Xi was quoted by the news agency as saying.
  <br>
  <br>
  CCTV quoted Xi as telling Lee that the country has "very high expectations" for Hong Kong, and wished Lee and his administration sound and stable governance and create a brighter future.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee, in response, vowed to work hard to boost Hong Kong's economy, strive for development, improve people's livelihood, proactively participate in building the Greater Bay Area, and better integrate into the national development.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Property consultancy firm Cushman and Wakefield on Thursday said Hong Kong's property market will start to pick up next year, if the rate-cutting cycle continues.
 <br>
  <br>
  The company's executive director, Rosanna Tang, said transactions and prices have stabilised following three rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve since September.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If interest rates continue to stay on a downward cycle and the Fed continue their rate cut policy and at the same time if the stock market could restore some of the momentum, then we expect the transaction volume in the residential market will continue to pick up and recover from this year's level. Then we can see the price rebound to follow in 2025," she told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  Major banks, including HSBC and Bank of China (Hong Kong), have announced they are lowering their prime lending rates for the third time this year, trimming the cost of borrowing to the lowest level in two years.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Customs officers on Thursday said they had arrested 22 people and seized drugs worth over HK$160 million in a series of airport operations ahead of the Christmas holidays.
 <br>
  <br>
  Officers said around 370 kilos of drugs were seized from November to mid-December, including ketamine, methamphetamine and space oil.
  <br>
  <br>
  Traffickers made use of festive decorations to hide the drugs before the holiday season, officers added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "During the long holiday season at year-end, drug traffickers usually take the opportunity to smuggle drugs to the local market," said Wong Ngar-shan, acting divisional commander of Customs' airport investigation group.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Therefore, Hong Kong Customs has adjusted its enforcement strategies accordingly, successfully intercepting cannabis from North America and Thailand, ketamine from Europe, and methamphetamine from North America from entering the market."
  <br>
  <br>
  Officers also said they seized 18 kilos of etomidate powder shipped from India, which can be used to make around 54,000 space oil-infused capsules.
  <br>
  <br>
  Often inhaled through vapes, space oil usually contains etomidate, a regulated sedative that is prescribed by a doctor.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government wants to add etomidate to the Dangerous Drugs Ordinance by the first quarter of next year.

<div class="itemFullText">
 MTR passengers will get the chance to travel on panda-themed trains from Thursday, as part of a wider campaign to welcome the city’s four new pandas.
 <br>
  <br>
  The corporation is one of the many businesses joining the “Come and Enjoy a Pandastic Hong Kong” campaign, organised by the Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau, Hong Kong Tourism Board and Ocean Park.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two trains on the South Island Line and one Airport Express train have been decorated with pandas and will commence service on Thursday evening.
  <br>
  <br>
  “December is the month of the pandas. If we read the news in the last few days we see there’s a lot of new attractions rolled out to celebrate or to share the joy of the pandas with the public,” MTR managing director Jeny Yeung told a media briefing.
  <br>
  <br>
  “So MTR is also launching a series of activities and decorations in our trains so that when our passengers are going to different destinations including when they are visiting the pandas they can have a very joyful experience,” she said
  <br>
  <br>
  People will also be able to see panda decorations at Ocean Park Station and at Admiralty Station, where LED pillars with 3D animations of a giant panda waving its arms will also greet passengers.
  <br>
  <br>
  At Lo Wu Station, Lok Ma Chau Station, West Kowloon Station, as well as stations along the South Island Line and Airport Express, MTR staff will be attaching panda plushies to their uniforms.
  <br>
  <br>
  The campaign will run until mid-February.

    Study finds half of drug users delay seeking help

<img alt='A survey by the Hong Kong Christian Service found that around nine percent of respondents reported the use of "space oil". Photo: RTHK' src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1784169_1_20241219134307.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A recent survey by the Hong Kong Christian Service has found that half of drug users wait years before seeking help, and many downplay the negative effects of drug abuse.
 <br>
  <br>
  The organisation polled 304 drug users between September and November, and found that 55 percent only sought treatment after using drugs for more than three years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Almost 40 percent claimed that drug use had no negative impact on their lives, and the youngest drug abuser was just nine years old.
  <br>
  <br>
  Michael Ng, the group’s service supervisor, said people might be reluctant to seek help because of the stigma associated with drug use.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Sometimes it's a health issue. They cannot find any health issue in their body, or maybe they were not aware of the mental illness issue. The second point is they don't want to [publicly tell] their story,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Researchers also found that around nine percent of respondents reported using "space oil" - a regulated sedative typically inhaled through vapes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Psychiatrist Dr Matthew Wong said long-term use of space oil could cause irreversible damage.
  <br>
  <br>
  “When someone is using the drug repeatedly and also receiving a high dose, that will cause damage in the brain cells and also cause some irreversible chemical imbalance in the brain,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “That will bring all sorts of physical and mental problems the patient would be suffering from.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The group called for more prevention education in schools and more accessible support channels to help people tackle drug addiction.

    Local property market shows signs of stabilising: HKMA

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) on Thursday said the local property market showed signs of stabilising with transactions increasing steadily and prices rising marginally after the US Federal Reserve started cutting interest rates in September.
 <br>
  <br>
  With another quarter of a percentage point cut overnight, the Fed has cut interest rates by an accumulative 100 basis points since September.
  <br>
  <br>
  HKMA's chief executive Eddie Yue said a lower borrowing cost environment would be beneficial to the local economy and the real estate market, reducing the loan burden of home buyers. But he stressed there are many other factors affecting the economy and the housing market.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said whether local borrowing costs would drop further following the latest cut by the Fed would depend on local funding supply.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Banks will normally take into account factors like funding supply and demand in the interbank market, the level of interbank rates, and their own funding cost structure to assess the merits and extent of adjustment if there's any," Yue said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He called on borrowers to exercise caution as the future outlook on interest rate cuts remains uncertain.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Interest rates might still remain at a relatively high level for some time and the extent and pace of future interest rate cuts are subject to considerable uncertainty. The public should carefully assess and continue to manage the interest rate risk when making property purchase, mortgage or other borrowing decisions," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The HKMA reduced the base rate to 4.75 percent with immediate effect on Thursday according to the established mechanism.
  <br>
  <br>
  HSBC and Bank of China (Hong Kong) announced cuts in their best lending rates in Hong Kong by 12.5 basis points to 5.25 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The new lending rates take effect at HSBC on Friday and at Bank of China (Hong Kong) next Monday.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Former Real Madrid and Barcelona stars said they are ready to deliver a thrilling show for fans as they face off in an exhibition match at Hong Kong Stadium on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The star-studded lineup features a mix of World Cup winners, including Iker Casillas and Roberto Carlos of Real Madrid, along with Barcelona’s Xavi Hernandez, Carles Puyol and Thierry Henry.
  <br>
  <br>
  Michael Owen, the former England striker, and Dutch star Patrick Kluivert are also part of the lineup.
  <br>
  <br>
  Barcelona Heroes’ captain Puyol said he has no plans to travel around the city and wants to stay focused for the match.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's always a special game, because you've been playing against your biggest rival for quite a long time, but not only because they are rivals, but a lot of them are also friends,
  <br>
  because they've been competing also in the national teams. So in the end, it's about the show, to try to put a good show, and people enjoy these kind of matches," he said through an interpreter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Real Madrid Legends’ captain Luis Figo also promised El Clásico would be an exciting match for fans.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think El Clásico is one of the biggest games and derbies in the world, two of the biggest clubs in the world, so the passion is high, the rivalry is very intense... For us now, of course, everyone likes to win, but everyone is retired. We wanted to show a good entertainment game, so we're looking forward to that," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The legendary Portuguese midfielder visited Hong Kong with Real Madrid during their Asia tour in 2003 and scored in a pre-season match against the local team.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Well, of course I remember... We had a great time here, and it's always fantastic to come back to a place that you feel so much support and love. And of course, every time you score is a happiness, because football is a joy. I think you work for that, to make the fans happy, so looking forward for the game," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Event organiser Legend Assemble said they are looking to bring in more football idols to the SAR when the Kai Tak Sports Park opens next year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tickets for Friday's match are still available for sale on Klook.com, and students, alongside education and sports groups can enjoy a 25 percent discount.

 Chief Executive John Lee on Wednesday greeted members of the public as he visited a panda carnival in Tsim Sha Tsui.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lee visited several stalls at the fair, chatted with their operators as well as passers-by, took selfies with them and bought 38 panda dolls.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also went to a bar, had a drink and talked to a customer from Sweden who was in Hong Kong to develop her design business.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have long stays. We have short stays. That's Hong Kong. In fact, this is the world. Looking around, people are so mobile, so they tend to really float around. It's a global village," Lee told the Swedish visitor.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So I'm very glad to see that you are bringing Swedish culture [to the city]. That is what Hong Kong people love - to try everything. They appreciate the different characteristics of different countries."
  <br>
  <br>
  It was Lee's second district visit in a week.

    Kai Tak Sports Park preps for first concert

<img alt="Kai Tak Mall had its soft opening on Wednesday. Photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1784025_2_20241218170246.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Crowd control and set-up procedures are just a few of the measures that authorities will be taking note of, as Kai Tak Arena prepares for its inaugural concert on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Authorities said around 5,500 ticket holders are expected to attend the Chill Thai Music Festival, featuring local boy band Mirror.
  <br>
  <br>
  Commissioner for Sports George Tsoi said doors will open for concert goers at 4.30pm, with the performance set to start at 6.30pm and wrap up before 10pm.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tsoi said the arrangements for sporting events and concerts differ significantly.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For concert events, it involves more set-ups, the stage arrangement, which we do not have during the sports events. There's also rehearsals that we are going to test for a concert event," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Apart from the above, the spectators' arrival and dispersal patterns of concert events are quite different from typical sports events."
  <br>
  <br>
  Tsoi said concert goers should have already gotten their tickets in advance, adding that there will be no on-site ticket sales.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For the ticketing arrangements for these concerts, they are all distributed through the events organisers, so participants and spectators should have got their tickets by now. They are not required to get their tickets on site," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think this arrangement would ensure orderly pedestrian flow during the concerts and during the starting time of the concerts."
  <br>
  <br>
  He also reminded attendees that umbrellas, outside food and drink, water bottles, professional photography equipment, and support signs larger than 38cm long, 20cm wide and 30cm high are prohibited.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tsoi added these restrictions align with those at concerts held at AsiaWorld-Expo and the Hong Kong Coliseum.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Kai Tak Mall had its soft opening on Wednesday, featuring a sports recreation facility and around 200 shops with over 80 percent leased.
  <br>
  <br>
  Crystal Wong, head of retail at Kai Tak Sports Park, said the mall would discuss flexible operating hours with merchants during major events and performances, adding the mall can maintain a steady flow of visitors before and after shows and games.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The mall allows customers to come earlier to shop and enjoy meals. They don't have to come last minute just for their event. It's to give people more diverse options and creates a better experience," she said.

    'Stay alert to promises made by sports bodies'

<div class="itemFullText">
 Sports sector lawmaker Kenneth Fok on Wednesday urged young athletes and their parents to remain vigilant when signing contracts with sports bodies.
 <br>
  <br>
  This came after the family of a young skateboarder successfully terminated a contract with a local association for the sport.
  <br>
  <br>
  It claimed to be able to nominate the athlete to compete in international competitions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The chairman of the association told me that he had the authorisation to nominate my daughter to participate in the Asian Games and even the Olympic Games. Everything went through a phone call, but this is the main reason why I signed the contract without deep thinking," the athlete's father surnamed Su said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Su signed the five-year contract back in 2021. However, no regular training was provided for his daughter, and he was asked to pay more than HK$100,000 for training and enter competitions that anyone could sign up for themselves. He said he never received any receipts regarding his payments.
  <br>
  <br>
  When Su expressed his wish to terminate the contract this February, the sports body raised harsh conditions on his daughter.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They demanded us to either pay HK$300,000 as a termination fee, or my daughter [would] not [be] involved in any skateboarding activity in a year," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  A termination agreement was made in July after lawyers got involved in the dispute.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fok said parents can refer to membership information under sports associations to verify the authenticity of various sports bodies.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If in doubt, [parents] can contact SF&OC (Sports Federation & Olympic Committee of Hong Kong, China) or responsible national sports associations, to inquire more about the association or entity that you are involved with, to make sure that they are promoting the sports in a positive way, and not making any alternative claims that may not meet their expectation," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We welcome different sports entities, stakeholders to contribute to sports in Hong Kong. Everyone has a right to push sports. But if such organisations are making claims, do double check and stay alert," he added.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Development Secretary Bernadette Linn on Wednesday shot down a lawmaker's suggestion that people fined for carrying out large-scale unauthorised building works be allowed to keep them if they aren't considered dangerous.
 <br>
  <br>
  The government is hoping lawmakers will agree to amend the Buildings Ordinance. Under its proposal, the maximum fine for unauthorised building projects will go up from HK$400,000 to HK$2 million, alongside the existing risk of a two-year prison term.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a Legco development panel meeting, legislator Wendy Hong asked whether people could be exempt from demolishing or rectifying large-scale illegal structures that do not pose any danger after they pay the fine.
  <br>
  <br>
  Linn said the government does not want to "go down such a route" or mislead future generations into thinking they can "pay to break the law".
  <br>
  <br>
  It is also difficult to guarantee the long-term structural integrity of the works, she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A professional may be able to inspect it (unauthorised building works) with the naked eye and say that it is safe, but don't forget that at the time of construction, no building plan was submitted and probably they didn't have any construction records," Linn explained.
  <br>
  <br>
  At the meeting, Linn also reassured owners' corporations that they will not be prosecuted immediately after being served a notice to carry out mandatory building inspection, as long as they begin to take action.

    25 arrests over suspected fake certificates since 2022

<div class="itemFullText">
 The government said on Wednesday that 25 people have been arrested over the past three years on suspicion of using fake qualifications to apply for places at tertiary institutions in Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  Charges were laid against eight of them, with three convictions and five people on bail pending trial. The rest of the cases are still under investigation, the government said.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a Legislative Council meeting, lawmakers said many mainland intermediaries claim they can guarantee university admissions, as well as successful entry to Hong Kong through different talent schemes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Unionist lawmaker Chau Siu-chung asked whether the government has enough manpower to conduct checks on admissions, noting that some of those who moved to Hong Kong through the talent programmes are due to have their visas renewed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Acting security minister Michael Cheuk said in response that officers will step up inspections, adding that the authorities have been working closely with their mainland counterparts and that they conduct joint enforcement action in a timely manner.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As at 10 December 2024, the police had referred information of a total of 14 mainland intermediary agencies or intermediaries to the relevant mainland authorities for follow-up," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In respect of the recent cases involving false proof and unscrupulous intermediaries, the Immigration Department has been maintaining close communication and exchanging intelligence with the relevant mainland authorities."
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister also stressed that the Education Bureau has told tertiary institutions to adopt enhanced measures, such as requiring applicants to submit third-party verification proof before admission.

 The government on Wednesday said the sports sector gets priority when it comes to booking the Hong Kong Coliseum, after a lawmaker complained that organisers turned away are instead taking their events to Macau or Guangdong.
 <br>
  <br>
  New People's Party lawmaker Adrian Ho noted that the Coliseum is also in high demand for concerts, arts and cultural events and said some in these sectors aren't sure why they find it hard to secure the venue.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a written reply to his questions, culture and sports minister Rosanna Law said 461 booking applications – around 80 percent of the total received – have been rejected since 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  But she added that throughout this period, the venue has been in constant use.
  <br>
  <br>
  Around 60 percent of the successful bookings were for concerts, while around a fifth were for large-scale sporting events.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[The Leisure and Cultural Services Department] considers the nature, significance and attraction of the events, audience appeal of the performers and booking history of the applicants, et cetera, when more than one organisation applies for the same time slot," the minister said.
  <br>
  <br>
  She added that the Coliseum is regarded as an important sports venue and events in this category therefore get priority.
  <br>
  <br>
  Law said she expects event organisers will welcome the opening of Kai Tak Sports Park next year, and officials will work with the operator to promote the site for local and international events.

    'Set up one-stop platform for after-death procedures'

<div class="itemFullText">
 Ombudsman Jack Chan on Wednesday urged the government to set up a one-stop thematic website for after-death arrangements so the public do not have to go to various sites to get information.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chan's office investigated public services relating to after-death arrangements, including death registrations, mortuary services, cremations and burial services.
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted that these services are provided by different government departments, and people seeking information might have to check with each one.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department launched its own after-death arrangements thematic website in November, but the authorities should set up a website coordinating services by all the various departments.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It would be most useful and helpful to the bereaved families if there's one thematic interdepartmental website so that the family could just use that website to gather all the essential information," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The second recommendation is to provide a digital form for the bereaved family to apply for different certificates and procedures, instead of having to go to different departments and authorities to apply for different certifications or whatever document they need."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan also suggested the government provide more electronic application procedures to make services more convenient for the public.

    HK has role to play for Middle East businesses: FS

<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan said on Wednesday that Hong Kong can expand into the Middle East market by providing risk assessment and financial services.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on the RTHK programme Overview Policy, he said companies in the Middle East are eager to invest in China, Hong Kong and other Asian markets due to intensifying geopolitical tensions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan earlier visited Europe, the United States, Australia and the Middle East, with the aim of strengthening ties with traditional markets, as well as exploring new markets and capital sources.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In our exchanges, business leaders [in the Middle East] learnt about the real situation of how One Country, Two Systems is implemented in Hong Kong, and what can we do for them in terms of investing in mainland China," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Entering and leaving Hong Kong is very easy, such as they can get to Shanghai and return on the same day through Hong Kong. On the other hand, we can provide them with professional services that are targeted towards the mainland and Asian markets, to be their guide and assess different kinds of risks."
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that investments from Europe and the United States have continued to pour into Hong Kong, despite negative claims by Western media.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When stock market performances improved earlier, more than 80 percent of capital came from Europe and America. Moreover, in terms of asset and investment management, a lot of international banks expanded their operations here. That's because the Greater Bay Area's economic development is quick, and people here are relatively more wealthy among all of China," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have to separate politics and the financial sector. Companies may express their own political views, but they also want returns in business."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan also said the government is working hard to improve the city's economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We discussed with mainland authorities to expand the Individual Visit Scheme to more cities, and increase their duty-free allowance. We have also been attracting strategic enterprises since 2002, offered the Quality Migrant Admission Scheme, and hosted events such as the Global Financial Leaders' Investment Summit in November," he said.

 A charity that provides health behavioural education for children and their caregivers is seeking support to help those with special education needs.
 <br>
  <br>
  Be Priceless is one of the 11 beneficiaries of this year's Operation Santa Claus (OSC), an annual charity campaign holding fundraising projects for over 35 years.
  <br>
  <br>
  The founder of the organisation, Dr Czarina Leung, said Be Priceless is supporting children and carers through its SEED programme, which stands for self-value, empower, educate, and protect from dangers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We teach them how to prevent, prepare, respond and recover from mental disorder, physical disorder, as well as relational safety issues including bullying and violence," Leung told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  Leung said her organisation provided long-term workshops for children and their carers, especially when they are transitioning into a new phase in life.
  <br>
  <br>
  She added that with more support, her organisation would expand its network and help more children, including those with visual impairments and other disabilities.
  <br>
  <br>
  The foundation said Be Priceless would support 125 children and youth with special education needs, and 195 caregivers of the children.

    Smart ballot boxes shelved amid privacy concerns

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government has shelved a plan to introduce technology that can detect invalid votes, a day after lawmakers expressed privacy concerns at a Legislative Council meeting.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Constitutional and Mainland Affairs Bureau had planned to table legal changes by March, in part to bring in smart ballot boxes for polls.
  <br>
  <br>
  At the Legco meeting on Monday, some lawmakers said they were concerned about confidentiality, warning that a voter suspected of casting an invalid vote could easily be spotted at a polling station.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials didn't explain how the new voting process would work, how votes could remain confidential or which elections the smart boxes would be used for.
  <br>
  <br>
  A bureau spokesman said late on Tuesday that the boxes will not be introduced after all.
  <br>
  <br>
  "After listening to the views from lawmakers and the public, the government is willing to be receptive to the views," he said, stressing that the government highly values public opinion on its governance.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The government has decided to continue to provide ballot checking devices for voters, and they can use them on a voluntary basis if that's necessary."
  <br>
  <br>
  In recent years, such checking devices have been used in the District Committee constituency in district council polls as well as Legco's Election Committee constituency.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The MTR on Tuesday said its trains will run overnight on Christmas Eve and New Year's Eve to facilitate commuters participating in festive celebrations.
 <br>
  <br>
  It said trains on eight railway lines will run more frequently from 3pm on December 24 and 31, and overnight services will be provided, except for the Airport Express, Disneyland Resort Line and the section between Sheung Shui, Lo Wu and Lok Ma Chau on the East Rail Line.
  <br>
  <br>
  The company said 2,200 additional train trips will be provided on Christmas Eve and New Year's Eve.
  <br>
  <br>
  It added that train services will be gradually enhanced from Friday until January 1.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government earlier said it had submitted requests to mainland authorities on extending the service hours at two border checkpoints on New Year’s Eve, and the MTR said it would make further arrangements.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In alignment with the proposed extension of operating hours of the Lo Wu checkpoint to 2am, the MTR will make corresponding service arrangements."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Further details will be announced in due course," it said in a statement.

 Hong Kong, China have booked a place in the finals of the East Asian Football Federation (EAFF) E-1 Football Championship in South Korea next year after they crushed Guam in the finale of the qualifying round of the tournament, which the city hosted this month.
 <br>
  <br>
  A goal in each half from Tai Po midfielder Philip Chan, as well as strikes from Benavides Medeiros, Everton Camargo and Dudu, helped seal the 5-0 victory at Hong Kong Stadium on Tuesday evening.
  <br>
  <br>
  The win caps a perfect run in the preliminary competition, with the hosts having beaten Mongolia and Chinese Taipei in their previous matches.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was also the sixth straight win under head coach Ashley Westwood.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SAR can now look forward to the EAFF E-1 finals in July 2025, when they will face Asian powerhouses South Korea, Japan and China.

    AI oral-care app to give quick check-ups for elderly

<img alt="Researchers are hoping to give AI-powered check-ups to elderly people who have trouble visiting dentists. Photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1783892_1_20241217195648.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The University of Hong Kong has developed a new AI-powered mobile app that it says can reliably assess the oral health of patients in seconds.
 <br>
  <br>
  Over the next three months, volunteers are hoping to use the app to help hundreds of elderly patients who have difficulty visiting a dentist – by making home visits or at three service locations in Lam Tin and Kwun Tong.
  <br>
  <br>
  Students from HKU’s dentistry faculty are partnering up with legislators and district councillors to identify elderly people in need of help.
  <br>
  <br>
  The volunteers would then do a quick test simply by taking photos of the patients’ mouths and running it through the app – called GUM AI – which would then make an accurate assessment of the state of their teeth and gums.
  <br>
  <br>
  No professional training is needed – the app simply displays red for poor oral health, yellow when caution is required, and green means everything looks fine.
  <br>
  <br>
  The service teams would then give advice to the patients, or refer them to a dentist if needed.
  <br>
  <br>
  HKU researcher Walter Lam says the technology could make a real difference.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We hope the GUM AI can raise health awareness among those elderly, so that they can have a regular dental visit, and they can self-care their hygiene, which is quite important to prevent any oral diseases," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Developers of the app say it has proven to be highly reliable, with a 90-percent accuracy rate.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The accuracy of our AI system is comparable to experienced dentists," Lam said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The team is aiming to expand the use of the app to other age groups after the end of the three-month pilot project. They say the technology promises to reduce waiting times for oral check-ups, and can help people better monitor their oral health and get treatment early.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A counter-terrorism drill held at Kai Tak Youth Sports Ground on Tuesday saw the authorities tackling terrorists opening fire from the stands and the discovery of a backpack containing a suspicious device.
 <br>
  <br>
  Police, fire, customs, immigration, prison and Government Flying Service officers took part in the simulation, aimed at strengthening their capability to handle emergencies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Senior police superintendent Peter Leung, from the inter-departmental counter terrorism unit, said the current terrorist threat level in Hong Kong is "moderate", indicating that while an attack is possible, there is no specific information suggesting the city is being targeted.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are planning to invite more different government departments and also the public and private sectors as well as the members of public to participate in this kind of CT [counter-terrorism] exercise because I think we have to promote the inter-departmental cooperation in the prevention of terrorist attacks," Leung said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said public participation in counter-terrorism exercises is crucial for raising awareness and understanding terrorism trends, adding that the drills help equip the community to prevent terrorist activities.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Tuesday said they plan to install up to 7,000 surveillance cameras across Hong Kong in roughly three years' time, up from the more than 600 put up since the start of this year.
 <br>
  <br>
  The government had said the plan was to add 2,000 cameras each year from 2025.
  <br>
  <br>
  At an Independent Police Complaints Council (IPCC) meeting, operations senior superintendent, Leung Ming-leung, said CCTV cameras are currently being put up on regular and smart lamp posts, government premises and transport interchanges.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officers will look to put other cameras up on places like traffic lights, highway signboards and camera boxes to catch drivers running a red light.
  <br>
  <br>
  The force said they are also looking into connecting cameras installed by other government departments to the police's CCTV system.
  <br>
  <br>
  Leung said whether more cameras would be added beyond 2027 would depend on the situation at the time.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There is a lot of time before 2027. It all depends on the actual situation, the number may be more, the number may be adjusted," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The speed with which we'll install the CCTV would hinge on the development of technology. Now the plan covers a horizon up to 2027, and closer to [that time], we are going to be having the latest thinking that we can bring members up to date on."
  <br>
  <br>
  Leung said the force's CCTV cameras can record sound, but so far police have not used this function.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said police will refer to overseas examples and operational needs going forward.
  <br>
  <br>
  An IPCC member, Matthew Lam, asked whether Hong Kong would follow the example of Singapore in using facial recognition, for example at stadiums in the SAR where mega events take place.
  <br>
  <br>
  In response, Leung said he thinks what Lam has in mind will come to fruition soon, saying the force will adopt technology that's proven successful elsewhere.
  <br>
  <br>
  When asked what would happen if the police's system was hacked, Leung said the surveillance footage is encrypted and can only be viewed with special devices within the force.
  <br>
  <br>
  He stressed the police attach great importance to privacy, saying when private places are filmed, the areas will be masked.
  <br>
  <br>
  Footage in general will be kept for 31 days - unless it's useful in criminal cases.
  <br>
  <br>
  Leung went on to say the installation of the cameras since the start of the year has been highly effective, saying 97 cases were resolved with their help, including serious crimes such as murder, arson and burglary.

    Govt urged to allow more tour groups to access sights

<img alt="Tourism sector representatives say individual travellers may not be familiar with non-mainstream attractions. Photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1783858_1_20241217164152.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Tourism sector representatives on Tuesday called on the government to allow more tour groups to access sights and attractions, to further promote eco-tourism and cultural tourism.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lawmaker Perry Yiu, together with the New Youth Forum, surveyed over 800 local people between mid-November and early December.
  <br>
  <br>
  Almost 80 percent of interviewees agreed that Hong Kong has rich tourism resources, including historic buildings, monuments, natural resources and the coastline.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the tourism representatives said there are currently many restrictions on tour groups, for instance, only three coaches are allowed to enter the Hong Kong Geopark in Sai Kung each day.
  <br>
  <br>
  Travel Industry Council (TIC) chairman Tommy Tam said individual travellers may not be familiar with non-mainstream attractions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Some travel agents, they do have some experience and they are well-trained tour guides. They can escort [tourists], so we believe that they can benefit if they join the package or the tour organised by tour operators," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Derek Tse, a training committee member of the TIC, said tour guides can raise the attractiveness of sights by letting visitors learn about their history.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We also encourage in-depth education elements and also conservation. So throughout these five years, no matter the TIC, or the Hong Kong Tourism Board has supported some training for the local guides on cultural tourism," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Representatives said the sector has introduced more in-depth tours amid the resumption of multi-entry visas for Shenzhen residents, and they hope the tours will attract people to stay in Hong Kong for a longer period.

    'Digitised aerial photos to better manage slopes'

<img alt="With the computing system, aerial photos are digitised and practitioners can wear a pair of 3D glasses to conduct an analysis. Photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1783856_2_20241217163433.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A new tool that digitises print aerial photos can improve slope safety management and help prepare for extreme weather events, the Geotechnical Engineering Office (GEO) said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The office's Digital Aerial Photographs Interpretation System was paid for by the government’s Innovation and Technology Fund and cost HK$6.5 million to develop.
  <br>
  <br>
  The GEO’s library has 370,000 paper-based aerial photos and an average of 17,000 are loaned to other government departments and the engineering sector every month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Over time, pairs of aerial photos have been used together to draw geology maps, and form 3D models for slope management as well as landslide risk assessments.
  <br>
  <br>
  Practitioners in the past had to rely on their eyes to carry out the analysis, which could be tough for those who are inexperienced, GEO deputy head Jenny Yeung said.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said the new computing system can enhance the speed and accuracy of an analysis.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The system will enhance the accuracy and provide more information to technical practitioners because from the digitised aerial photographs, you can see more information such as height and the coordinates,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeung added that in future, people who want to access the data will be able to do so from their office, avoiding a trip to the library.
  <br>
  <br>
  70,000 aerial photos dating from 1963 to the present have been uploaded in the system so far, and they will be available for use by the end of this month.

    Exco approves fare hikes for 3 bus companies

<img alt="The Executive Council has approved fare hikes ranging from 4.3 to 7.5 percent for Citybus, KMB and New Lantao Bus. File photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1783851_1_20241217160651.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Executive Council on Tuesday gave the green light for three bus companies to increase their fares, although the hikes are smaller than what some of them had sought.
 <br>
  <br>
  Citybus can increase fares by 7.5 percent, while New Lantao Bus and KMB can raise theirs by 6.5 percent and 4.3 percent respectively.
  <br>
  <br>
  The new fares will take effect on January 5 next year.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, a government spokesman said around 80 percent of passengers will pay no more than 50 cents extra per trip.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Although passenger volume and the revenues of franchised buses have significantly recovered after the pandemic, they have not fully returned to pre-pandemic levels due to changes in consumption and travel habits," the statement read.
  <br>
  <br>
  The spokesman added the fare hikes would help bus companies stay afloat, and that factors such as operating costs and public affordability had been considered.
  <br>
  <br>
  KMB and New Lantao Bus had asked for 6.5 percent increases, while Citybus wanted to put fares up by 9.5 percent for most routes.
  <br>
  <br>
  In response to the fare hike approval, Citybus said this was the fourth approved fare adjustment application in the past 15 years, adding it would continue to improve efficiency and cut operating costs.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will continue to develop and expand our revenues next year, growing the network across Hong Kong organically and riding on the success and growth of our newly launched 'HK City Sightseeing' tourism brand," Citybus wrote in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  KMB said it would do its best to give fare discounts to passengers, including interchange discounts between different routes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The operator said it would continue to expand its non-farebox revenues, such as setting up convenience stores at bus stations and providing services to commercial vehicles.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Transport Commissioner Angela Lee said the fare increases strike a balance between the impact on people's livelihoods and the financial sustainability of bus companies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters after the approval, Lee said the government has exercised its gatekeeping role.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Regarding KMB and Citybus' franchises for urban and New Territories routes, we approved smaller fare increases than what the companies requested," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For routes that regular commuters use every day, we'll keep the increases lower. For routes mainly used by tourists on holidays and leisure trips, we'll apply higher increases. This way, we can minimise the impact on daily commuters."
  <br>
  <br>
  Stephen Cheung, chairman of the Transport Advisory Committee (TAC), welcomed the fare hike approval.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The TAC agrees that the government has endeavoured to strike a balance between minimising the impact on people's livelihood and maintaining reasonable financial capability of franchised bus operators for continuous investments," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cheung added the government should continue to help bus operators reduce costs and expand sources of revenue to ease the pressure of fare increases.

    All budget ideas will be seriously considered: CE

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday said the government will seriously consider all opinions on the next budget.
 <br>
  <br>
  With a public consultation under way on Sunday, Lee said Financial Secretary Paul Chan will give serious consideration to all the advice proposed for the upcoming budget.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A lot of advice and opinions have already been provided," Lee told reporters ahead of the weekly's Executive Council meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The financial secretary has been doing this budget consultation for a number of years, and he will of course be taking serious attention to all the opinions and suggestions that are raised, examine the pros and cons, and also the reasoning and the thinking behind, so as to ensure that the eventual budget will satisfy the overall needs of Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I am sure that the financial secretary will be paying heed to different opinions and analyse all the opinions very objectively and thoroughly to ensure that the best budget is prepared for Hong Kong."
  <br>
  <br>
  The CE told businesses to grasp opportunities, thanks to stronger visitor numbers and an increase in online shopping.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Yes, we have a budget deficit, but already we have said that we will try to increase income, and also to reduce expenditure as well and to promote economic growth so the businesses will make more money, as a result of which the government will also have more income," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CE said the government will seek to make around HK$90 billion in investments each year, and he believes private investments will improve following a number of policies and measures launched by the central and SAR governments.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government has said the budget deficit for the current fiscal year could double to around HK$100 billion from an earlier estimate.

    Police warn Carousell users of bogus payment websites

<img alt="From left to right: senior inspector Victoria Ng, chief inspector Felton Leung and Carousell chief of staff Tan Su-lin. Photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1783810_1_20241217114145.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police are urging users of the popular online trading platform Carousell to be vigilant against bogus payment links aimed at hacking into their bank accounts, with 644 cases recorded in the first 10 months of the year, incurring losses of HK$36 million.
 <br>
  <br>
  The new tactic emerged as the force noted a 23.7 percent year-on-year rise in the overall number of online shopping scams during the same period, and the amount involved more than doubled to HK$332 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  To make transactions safer, Carousell introduced a Buyer Protection service in August, through which the seller only receives payment after the buyer confirms receipt of the goods.
  <br>
  <br>
  But senior inspector Victoria Ng of the Cyber Security and Technology Crime Bureau said the number of scams surged after the service was rolled out, with 330 cases recorded alone between August and October, involving HK$25 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  She explained scammers would pose as buyers and offer to pay for the item through the new payment system.
  <br>
  <br>
  The sellers, after providing an e-mail address, would then receive a phishing link, which directs them to a website asking for details of their online banking account.
  <br>
  <br>
  The sellers could then withdraw all the money from the victims’ accounts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carousell chief of staff Tan Su-lin clarified users never have to surrender their e-mail address when using the payment system, let alone click on links.
  <br>
  <br>
  “In today's day and age, it's really a very risky behaviour to click on any links that you receive, whether it's via e-mail, or through your WhatsApp,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  But not just sellers are being scammed - chief inspector Felton Leung noted buyers seeking sought-after items, such as concert tickets, can also fall prey to deception.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The scammers … play mind games with the victims. They knew that the victims want [the product] so much and it's so hard to get in any other places, so they will put on some time frame or time constraint on the victims. If they don't settle the deal as soon as possible, they will not get the tickets.' he explained.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police advised buyers to stick to official or reputable sellers, and ask to trade in person whenever possible.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday said Hong Kong is ready for an influx of tourists on New Year's Eve, with special border crossing and transport arrangements in place.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters before the weekly Executive Council meeting, Lee said the government will ensure visitors have a smooth journey home after enjoying the 12-minute fireworks display.
  <br>
  <br>
  On December 31, most MTR lines will run overnight, and the Shenzhen Bay port will operate around the clock. The Lo Wu checkpoint will be open until 2am, instead of closing at the usual time of midnight.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For the government, we will ensure that the whole arrangement for tourists to come to Hong Kong will be orderly, safe, and also it will be a pleasant experience, particularly when they go through the boundary control points," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CE added that Hong Kong has seen a 20 to 30 percent increase in tourists from Shenzhen during weekends since the resumption of unlimited entry visas, and the trend is likely to continue through Christmas and New Year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With the increase in the number of tourists coming to Hong Kong from different parts of the world, in particular those from Shenzhen, we have to ensure that first of all we will treat them nicely so that they all have a good experience and will think of coming back," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Lee said he will travel to Macau to attend the inauguration ceremony of the new term of the SAR government and congratulate Macau CE-elect Sam Hou-fai on taking office.
  <br>
  <br>
  President Xi Jinping will also be in Macau from Wednesday to Friday to attend celebrations marking the 25th anniversary of the SAR's return to the nation.

 Financial Secretary Paul Chan said on Monday that Hong Kong has to fully support its innovative industry, in order to contribute to the country's drive for the development of new quality productive forces.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at an awards ceremony for the Science and Technology Innovation Prize, Chan said the SAR has been making use of its advantage as an international financial centre to provide capital support for the innovative industry.
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted that in the past couple of years, the government has attracted more than 100 firms to the SAR specialising in areas such as artificial intelligence and big data, biotechnology, as well as new energy and materials.
  <br>
  <br>
  "These companies will invest more than HK$50 billion in total in the coming few years, creating more than 17,000 jobs, many of which are research and managerial roles," Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dennis Lo, who chairs the Hong Kong Alliance of Technology and Innovation which gives out the annual awards, said the Hetao tech zone development between the SAR and Shenzhen will become a major cooperation platform within the Greater Bay Area.
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted that the country and the SAR government are going full speed ahead with building Hong Kong as an international innovation and technology centre.
  <br>
  <br>
  The five laureates of the Science and Technology Innovation Prize this year are Chai Yang, associate dean of Polytechnic University's science faculty; Chinese University's medical school assistant dean Ng Siew-chien; mechanical and automation engineering professor Chen Shih-chi, also from Chinese University; along with City University's chemistry professor Zhang Hua and computer science scholar Wang Cong.

<img alt="Erick Tsang says the main purpose of the smart ballot box is to prevent votes that are filled out erroneously from becoming invalid. File photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1783700_1_20241216164317.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Monday sought to alleviate privacy concerns over the potential future use of smart ballot boxes that can detect invalid votes.
 <br>
  <br>
  Constitutional affairs minister Erick Tsang told lawmakers that officials are testing out the devices designed to help voters fill out ballot papers properly.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a Legco constitutional affairs panel meeting, the DAB's Chan Wing-kwong expressed concern over how the votes will remain confidential if the ballots are analysed by the smart boxes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Election Committee lawmaker Tang Fei said voters might feel embarrassed if they are informed they have made a mistake.
  <br>
  <br>
  Third Side lawmaker Tik Chi-yuen said ballot-checking might amount to election interference.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tsang said the idea of bringing in the smart boxes is to protect voters' rights in the event that they inadvertently fill out ballots incorrectly, for example if a voter fails to tick the 40 boxes required for Legco's Election Committee constituency.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are not trying to identify voters who have deliberately defaced the votes. When people are actually casting their ballot, there is no CCTV involved, and you don't have to produce your ID card. And there is absolutely no way for us to identify who you are," the minister said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So the privacy of voters is preserved. Our main purpose really is to reduce the situation where erroneously, voters tick the boxes leading to the vote becoming invalid."
  <br>
  <br>
  Tsang said similar technology worked well in two recent elections.
  <br>
  <br>
  The smart ballot box is included in proposed legal changes the government plans to table to the legislature by the end of March.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials have not decided in which elections the boxes can be used, with Tsang saying they might not be used in Legco polls next year.

    High blood sugar lowers immunity in type 2 diabetes

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A medical research team found that people with type 2 diabetes are more likely to get viral infections, emphasising the importance of keeping blood sugar levels under control for better health.
 <br>
  <br>
  Researchers from the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Hong Kong said on Monday they discovered a connection between high blood glucose levels and reduced immunity to viral infections in patients with type 2 diabetes.
  <br>
  <br>
  They analysed 40 blood samples from people with the condition at Queen Mary Hospital between 2022 and 2023, and found that Th1 cells, immune cells, from patients with poorly controlled diabetes had a significant 40 percent decrease in functionality compared with those from healthy individuals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dr Paul Lee, one of the researchers, said these patients need to improve their blood sugar management to help reduce the strain on healthcare systems during viral pandemics.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said it is important for these people to ask their clinicians what their glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) levels are, or what their average blood sugar levels should be.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They should first understand their glycaemic control, their diabetes control. [They should] know about their HbA1c level, in addition to having self-monitoring of their blood glucose, and to see whether their HbA1c level is already at target. If not, I think for those who are actually not very compliant to the medications, please adhere to the medications. And for those who are actually overweight, obese, try to optimise their body weight, improve their lifestyle, [have] more physical activity," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "These will all actually improve their sugar control. But of course, for those who have already done their best, they may have to discuss with their clinicians whether they need to add some more anti-diabetic agents to improve their HbA1c target."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee said the study paves the way for new treatment options aimed at enhancing the immunity of patients with type 2 diabetes.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Fire Services Department on Monday said it has conducted more than 8,200 inspections at around 1,000 old buildings across Hong Kong, following a blaze at a residential block in Jordan in April that left five people dead.
 <br>
  <br>
  The department said it issued more than 8,500 Fire Hazard Abatement Notices during the operation, and over 90 percent of these notices were complied with.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said most of the buildings checked were in Yau Tsim Mong, Sham Shui Po, Eastern District, and Central and Western District.
  <br>
  <br>
  Acting Deputy Chief Fire Officer Wong Yuk-ping said the department will set up a special duty team to look at improvements for high-risk buildings.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our goal is to reduce and ideally eliminate fire hazards. This is our ultimate objective," he told a press conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For the work of our special duty team, we will consolidate our data and put high-risk older composite buildings on our inspection list. We will target these high-risk buildings and ensure a risk-based approach."
  <br>
  <br>
  The department said safety issues it found in the various buildings included smoke doors being left open or broken, and escape routes being blocked.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said it carried out more than 350 prosecutions over buildings failing to comply with abatement notices.

    Time to review claw machine regulations: watchdog

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Consumer Council on Monday called for a review of claw machine regulations after seeing an increase in the number of complaints about the games.
 <br>
  <br>
  The council received 42 complaints about claw machines from January to November this year, three times more than during the same period last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Complainants alleged machine settings were manipulated, with pincers automatically loosening, and a minimum spend required in order to win a prize.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kenneth Chan, vice-chairman of the council's publicity and community relations committee, attributed the rise in complaints to the industry's growing popularity.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This market capitalises on the consumers' enthusiasm for testing their luck and attracts a dedicated clientele with a wide range of prizes. Because of the low operating costs and minimal entry barriers, these shops are getting more popular in Hong Kong," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  In one case, a customer spent HK$500 trying to grab a prize over a period of 45 minutes, but received a box of trinkets instead of the displayed waffle maker prize he wanted.
  <br>
  <br>
  Claw machines are not regulated under the Places of Public Entertainment Ordinance, which means operators do not need a licence to open a shop.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We believe it's about time, because of the popularity and also the growing concerns and issues that we found, it's about time to review whether we should regulate these kinds of claw machine businesses," said the council's chief executive Gilly Wong.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An enhanced interactive exhibition dedicated to the now-demolished Kowloon Walled City has moved from the airport to Kai Tak's airside mall, allowing visitors to fully immerse themselves in the movie sets from  "Twilight of the Warriors: Walled In".
 <br>
  <br>
  The second phase of the exhibition, which was inspired by the movie, opened on Monday and will run until April 13 of next year, featuring several new photo spots, hidden gems for photography, and dining and retail stalls, including the iconic char siu rice from the film.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at the kick-off ceremony, Deputy Financial Secretary Michael Wong said the exhibition's success at the airport demonstrated the strength of the SAR's movie tourism and local cultural exploration.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The film industry in Hong Kong has great potential, especially when you consider that many of the filmmakers involved, both directors and screenwriters, are very young. The achievements they've made are highly commendable and have garnered much attention. Many critics have also recognised them. This is what makes me the happiest," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "From the government's perspective, we will continue to work hard to support the industry. In recent years, we have allocated about HK$4 billion into the Film Development Fund."
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong added that an accompanying exhibition will be held at Kowloon Walled City Park, featuring a blend of both indoor and outdoor elements.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This exhibition is currently in the planning stages and also revolves around the 'Twilight of the Warriors: Walled In' theme. We are working hard to incorporate many different props. We hope to launch the exhibition in March or April of next year," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For now, I'll keep some details under wraps, but further information will be provided by our colleagues from the Leisure and Cultural Services Department and the Cultural and Creative Industries Development Agency."

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The governing body for lacrosse has said they will use the success of the Super Sixes tournament to develop star players in the SAR, ahead of the sport’s highly anticipated return to the 2028 Olympic Games.
 <br>
  <br>
  Japan took the top spot in the tournament held over the weekend after beating the Philippines, while the SAR squad finished fourth out of five participating teams. They fell just short of the podium after losing 21-9 to powerhouse Germany in the bronze medal bout.
  <br>
  <br>
  The head of the Hong Kong, China Lacrosse Association Raymond Fong on Sunday said the tournament’s success serves as a testament to the sport’s rising popularity in the region.
  <br>
  <br>
  "One thing that is becoming very obvious now is that everyone is improving. If you look at countries like the Philippines and China, compared to where they were last year – they've upped their game."
  <br>
  <br>
  He also said the results serve as motivation for the local squad to improve.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So for the Hong Kong team, it's not about just playing the game and maintaining the status quo – it's not the case anymore, and we have to be better and better."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lacrosse is set to make a comeback at the Los Angeles Olympics in 2028, the first time it will be featured at the world’s largest sporting event in over a century.
  <br>
  <br>
  The coach for the SAR's lacrosse squad, Chan Hon-kei, said the experience his team gained from the Super Sixes tournament was a stepping stone towards the possibility of competing at the Olympic level.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We have a lot of hope and expectation for this group to grow to be better, to compete in the world stage. So this tournament really gave us a chance to see the [level of play] that we can be at.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan added that despite the loss over the weekend, there are a lot of opportunities to develop good players in the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We started in the grassroots and with a lot of kids, usually starting them young from the age of five," Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They can learn all the skills they need, so when they grow up, they have all they need."

    Choose anti-dandruff shampoo carefully: watchdog

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Consumer Council on Monday urged people to choose anti-dandruff shampoo carefully, after finding EU-banned substances in some products on the market.
 <br>
  <br>
  The watchdog tested 25 anti-dandruff models and found that four contained zinc pyrithione (ZPT), which is banned in the European Union due to the potential harm to unborn children.
  <br>
  <br>
  The four brands are HAIR CORNER, Petal Fresh Pure, CLEAR and Philip B.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gilly Wong, the council’s chief executive, said consumers should identify the root cause of dandruff before buying products.
  <br>
  <br>
  “When you have dandruff, you have to identify probably what is the reason. Is [your scalp] too oily, or maybe too dry, or other reasons? This is something as a first screening about yourself,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “But on the other hand, if you have this problem for quite a bit of time, it's much better for you to seek medical advice before you continue to try on different products.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Over 90 percent of shampoo products also contained fragrance allergens, with two containing the EU-banned chemical BMHCA which can adversely affect both male and female fertility.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the watchdog said some products were not labelled at all or only included some fragrance allergens.
  <br>
  <br>
  The council urged manufacturers to review their formulas and improve labelling transparency.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hospital Authority has reiterated its zero tolerance policy on workplace violence, including threatening staff and physical - or even verbal - abuse from patients.
 <br>
  <br>
  Dr Tung Chi-kwong, the authority's Workplace Violence Subject Officer of the New Territories West Cluster, told RTHK that cases of violence against staff fluctuated over the years.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the authority hoped to minimise such incidents by appealing to the public for a greater understanding of the issues facing its staff, and to create a culture of mutual respect in the workplace.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think this is a very valuable occasion for us to actually plead to public members that we will try to induce a mutual-respect culture in the workplace, and then hopefully it will improve communications and new ways to kind of de-escalate the tension," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The authority said cases of violence were often related to a patient's expectations not being met, such as long waiting times, or issues with the treatment plan.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said it was talking to frontline staff about their specific needs or the kinds of high-risk situations they faced, so it could provide tailor-made solutions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For example, we have been improving our designs of a forearm protector because one of the common injuries faced by our staff is when they have been doing some sort of routine nursing measures, like feeding or injection and so on. When our patients are in an abnormal mental state, they may consider the approach as threatening and sometimes they may have bitten or scratched our staff," said Dr Tung.
  <br>
  <br>
  The authority said certain departments were more prone to violence, including psychiatry, geriatrics as well as the emergency room.
  <br>
  <br>
  Training was being given to staff from these departments, including break-away techniques to learn how to escape from dangerous situations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Certain cases were also referred to the police, and the conviction rate was as high as 90 percent, the authority added.

    Beware of plasticisers in desk mats: Consumer Council
   </title>

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Consumer Council on Monday said that some desk mats commonly used as table protectors contain chemicals that can affect fertility or growth.
 <br>
  <br>
  Among 15 desk mats it tested, seven contained four plasticisers listed as reproductive toxicants exceeding a European Union limit.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the worst example, plasticisers in a desk mat by Qivation surpassed the EU limit by 222 times.
  <br>
  <br>
  The product has been referred to the Customs and Excise Department.
  <br>
  <br>
  The council also revealed that nine desk mats contain three other plasticisers that can affect children's livers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Although people are unlikely to absorb plasticisers through their skin, they are at risk if they have a cut, or put on sunscreen or oil-soluble moisturising products after touching the mats, the council said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gilly Wong, chief executive of the watchdog, urged the public not to use desk mats as place mats when they eat.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Reason being is obviously the ingredients that they used [in desk mats] may not be at the food grade, so it's much better to segregate the usage," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When you select the product, you have to make it clear about the purpose of that product. So that you can make use of it, the function of it properly."
  <br>
  <br>
  The public should also wash their hands immediately after using the desk mats in other circumstances, she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong also called on manufacturers to be careful about what ingredients they use in products.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They have to choose those that can safeguard the health of consumers and manufacture it with a very high quality control in order to produce products that shouldn't have harmful substances for consumers," she said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A charity operating in the Eastern District is hoping to involve more ethnic minorities in community activities in the area.
 <br>
  <br>
  Emily Yeung, an assistant social work officer at the Methodist Epworth Village Community Centre, Social Welfare, says many non-Chinese senior citizens live in Eastern District.
  <br>
  <br>
  But she told RTHK that a lot of them tend to stay at home and do not attend community events because of fear of not being able to communicate with others.
  <br>
  <br>
  This year, the community centre is one of 11 beneficiaries of the Operation Santa Claus (OSC) charity drive.
  <br>
  <br>
  The charity was founded in 1963.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeung said with funding support from OSC, the charity will expand its “Narrating Life Stories - Supportive Project for Ethnic Minority Elders”, which trains volunteers to listen to the stories of ethnic minority elders.
  <br>
  <br>
  “With our project, we have welfare assistants that they can speak in their languages so that the elders can know the programme, what is going on, and they can have someone to share with as well,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jointly organised by RTHK and South China Morning Post, OSC funds charitable projects that focus on children and youth, the elderly, the community, those with physical and mental disabilities, medical projects, and those concerning the environment.
  <br>

 Chief Executive John Lee greeted members of the public in Central and Wan Chai on Sunday evening, a day after concluding his duty visit to Beijing.
 <br>
  <br>
  With his wife Janet Lam, Lee went to the Tai Kwun heritage-arts venue in Central, where he also talked with visitors from Shenzhen and South East Asia.
  <br>
  <br>
  As Lee stopped by Lee Tung Avenue in Wan Chai, he chatted to passers-by and encouraged them to go out and spend during the festive season.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The atmosphere is really good. We went to another place just now. The atmosphere there was good too," Lee said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You usually go out during the weekends, do you? Please go out more, so that our economy will be better. Merry Christmas!"
  <br>
  <br>
  On his official Facebook page, Lee said he enjoyed the festive atmosphere in both places.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee added that he welcomed tourists from all over the world, saying they could experience Hong Kong's unique charm and vibrancy.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A woman has been bailed after she allegedly stole a sculpted model panda from a Kwun Tong public display on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Police said the 37-year-old was arrested in Sau Mau Ping on Saturday. She will have to report to police later this month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police said they were called in after a security guard noticed that the model panda, valued at HK$100, had gone missing.
  <br>
  <br>
  The model was part of an Urban Renewal Authority (URA) Christmas Celebration at Yue Man Square called 'Winter Transform'. It includes 80 giant panda installations, which range in height from half-a-metre to 3 metres.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police also said another model panda had disappeared last Monday but that the case was not classified as theft.
  <br>
  <br>
  In announcing the display earlier this month, the URA said it features an industrial style panda and an astronaut panda - symbolising Kwun Tong's transformation from an industrial area to a modernised commercial centre.
  <br>
  <br>
  The URA said, after Christmas, the pandas would be displayed in festive Chinese New Year attire.

    More and more fancy a shot at joining the police

 Police say more and more young people are now interested in joining the force and it aims to recruit another 400 officers and 80 inspectors in the next few months.
 <br>
  <br>
  With almost 6,000 vacancies across various departments, the force held a recruitment day on Sunday, giving people a taste of what it feels to like to wear the uniform, and even fire a gun.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have set up a mock firearm experience station so participants can experience the shock of a pistol firing a bullet, and also see how police constables receive weapons training," Senior Superintendent Mike Kwok told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We also set up a booth that consists of AI police uniforms, where participants can try on different police attire and take photos."
  <br>
  <br>
  Almost 1,300 people attended the event, with 400 submitting applications on the spot, the force said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kwok said more than 9,000 applications for officer and inspector roles were received between April 1 and November 30, a 5.4 percent increase on the same period last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Around 600 new officers were taken on, along with about 120 probationary inspectors.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We see more and more young people being interested in police work," Kwok said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked whether a relaxation in eligibility requirements from May 2023 contributed to the increase in applications, Kwok said the force is trying to "snatch talent".
  <br>
  <br>
  "We hope our market competitiveness will suit societal demands. Of course we would want as much applicants as possible. But I think the increase was mainly due to people being interested in the job as we have held a lot of recruitment activities in local and mainland universities," he said.

    'Lack of awareness leading to migrant worker abuse'

<img alt="Domestic worker groups say some helpers are only being paid HK$1,000 per month. Photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1783564_2_20241215165703.jpg&q=65">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Domestic worker groups on Sunday warned that a lack of knowledge on rights and legal protections is leading to some helpers being abused in Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong Federation of Asian Domestic Workers Unions (FADWU) and the Union of Nepalese Domestic Workers in Hong Kong (UNDW) said that in the past two years, they received eight complaints from South Asian workers who had been severely underpaid.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sarah Pun, an executive member of FADWU and vice-chairwoman of UNDW, said many workers are only being paid HK$1,000 to HK$4,000 per month, when the minimum wage is HK$4,990.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[Some of] the workers in Hong Kong don't know any rights of what is their proper salary and what is their contract salary, so some employers take advantage," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our South Asian [domestic workers], don't have an agent in Hong Kong. The broker will tell them to come to Hong Kong because all those who want to come to Hong Kong, they also want to earn the money for themselves to support the family.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They do some agreement, I think, with some amount, but they will not tell the worker the proper amount of the contract salary. So, they will just tell them that the only important thing is the job."
  <br>
  <br>
  A Nepali woman who turned to the groups for help told reporters that she was not paid her full salary, had her passport confiscated by her employer, and suffered constant mental and physical abuse.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They did not provide me proper food. They did not provide me a room, no bed. I had to sleep on a [sofa]. They did not give me any rest days. There were no fixed working hours. I had to work 24 hours. That was what I was told," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They always found fault in my work and they were always complaining. They used to scold me with foul language and assault me."
  <br>
  <br>
  Pun said the government should arrange mandatory training for both incoming helpers and employers, to increase awareness of responsibilities and fair wages.
  <br>
  <br>
  She added that the authorities should ensure that migrant domestic workers are aware of their rights and how to seek justice in the case of violations.

    HKers urged to 'team up' as budget consultation begins

<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Sunday urged Hongkongers to "team up for a brighter future" as he invited people to put forward suggestions for his next budget.
 <br>
  <br>
  A consultation exercise ahead of the blueprint expected in February got underway on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  It comes after the government doubled its estimated deficit for the current financial year to around HK$100 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  In his weekly blog, Chan said the government has to carefully manage public finances as the global outlook remains gloomy and the city is undergoing economic transformation. But he added that accelerating the city's economic development is of equal importance.
  <br>
  <br>
  "During this period, development is core and stability is the key. The administration has been seeking to expand into new markets and strengthen its position in technological innovation. Results of this are now beginning to flow through," he wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Let's make wise use of resources, and team up for a brighter future," he added, in a promotional video on the budget consultation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Chan said the city's market sentiment has been improving, with the central government continuously rolling out measures to support Hong Kong, including bringing back unlimited entry visas for Shenzhen residents.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 130,000 mainlanders visited the SAR last weekend, Chan said, adding that this was a 15 percent increase on the average number in November.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the number of innovative technology start-ups in the city is continuing to grow and a lot of enterprise founders from across the world agree that Hong Kong has a unique advantage in innovation and technology development.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Foreign companies are confident towards Hong Kong. The government's efforts overseas in promoting the city's advantage and telling real Hong Kong stories are yielding positive impacts," he wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Challenges are inevitable in each development stage, but we have to focus on greater opportunities and prospects. According to our past experiences, Hong Kong remains strong despite highs and lows, and we will continue to make steps forward in new developments and reach newer heights," he added.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The head of the government's investment vehicle on Sunday said the corporation will take on more projects and expand strategic partnerships next year to boost Hong Kong's economy and competitiveness.
 <br>
  <br>
  Clara Chan, CEO of Hong Kong Investment Corporation, told a radio programme that she will reach out to overseas companies that have cutting-edge technology and research capabilities.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wholly owned by the government, the corporation's mission is to attract foreign talent and businesses to the SAR while helping successful local brands expand globally, Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We need to make sure every dollar we invest creates the most value for Hong Kong. When evaluating potential investments, we look at two key things that align with our dual mission," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "First, we examine if the business meets our financial and operational requirements. Second, we evaluate their contributions and commitments to Hong Kong, including how they benefit the economy and the public."
  <br>
  <br>
  The new energy industry is showing great potential and the corporation is helping companies in the field tap into Southeast Asian markets, Chan added.
  <br>
  <br>
  She also said the companies they have invested in are doing better than expected, including an AI research centre at the University of Science and Technology which has attracted internationally renowned scholars.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Temperatures struggled to reach 15 degrees Celsius across much of the city on Sunday morning, as the observatory warned of the coldest day so far this winter.
 <br>
  <br>
  A low of 13 degrees was recorded at the forecasters' headquarters in Tsim Sha Tsui.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was even colder in parts of the New Territories, the observatory said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A strong northeast monsoon will affect the coast of southern China today. Since it will be windy, wind chill effect will be particularly significant on high ground and exposed areas. People are advised to be aware of the change in weather and keep warm when engaging in outdoor activities," it warned.
  <br>
  <br>
  The observatory added that daytime temperatures are expected to rise this week, but mornings will still be cool.

 The SAR's footballers on Saturday evening clinched a 2-1 victory over Chinese Taipei in the final Group B match of the East Asia Football Federation (EAFF) E-1 Football Championship preliminary competition at Mong Kok Stadium.
 <br>
  <br>
  Star striker Matt Orr scored for the SAR team before half-time, while defender Tsui Wang Kit scored the winning goal in the second half.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was their fifth consecutive victory under new coach Ashley Westwood.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong, China, will play Guam in the final. Guam had earlier defeated Macau 2-1 in a Group A game on Saturday afternoon. The two will square off on December 17 at Hong Kong Stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  The winner will advance to the tournament in South Korea next summer to play against the hosts, Japan, and the national team.
  <br>

<img alt="An EAFF E-1 Football Championship preliminary competition between Macau and Guam was held at the Kai Tak Youth Sports Ground. Photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1783495_1_20241214172534.jpg&q=35">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Some football fans from Hong Kong and Macau were left disgruntled over arrangements for a competition held at the Kai Tak Youth Sports Ground.
 <br>
  <br>
  An East Asian Football Federation Championship (EAFF) qualifier between Macau and Guam was held at the sports ground on Saturday, but the Football Association of Hong Kong, China announced a change the night before that meant registration would not be available onsite, and fans would need to reserve a ticket online.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We expected around 1,000 spectators to come and watch the match. In order to have better crowd control, it was decided by various stakeholders to implement online registration before the match. Registered individuals can collect the physical ticket at the gate," it posted online.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We understand that the arrangements were not ideal but this tournament needs to balance the requirements of and concerns from all government officials. We apologise for any inconvenience caused."
  <br>
  <br>
  Two fans from Macau said they were here to support the SAR's team.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We hope they can improve the arrangements. Even if we have to buy tickets, it's fine, but they should notify us earlier," they told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another local fan said the arrangement was unreasonable, but he wanted to have a look at the new venue.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They just announced a day earlier, at about 5 pm, and we had to reserve a ticket at 6 pm. Not everyone monitors the association's social media for ticketing," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The association said 400 tickets were distributed online, with the rest sent to local organisations, schools, and participating teams.
  <br>
  <br>
  A man said many fans were disappointed about the arrangement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If they require fans to register online, then they should do it at least two to three days in advance, and also specify the quota," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I only found out there were just 400 tickets distributed after I submitted the online form."
  <br>
  <br>
  Guam beat Macau 2-1, and will play in the final at the Hong Kong Stadium next Tuesday.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Secretary for Health Lo Chung-mau has elaborated on the plan to reform the healthcare system due to population and demographic changes - specifically boosting health management efficiency.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Health Bureau earlier pointed out that even though the overall population in the SAR will increase in 2041, that's not the case for Hong Kong Island, which might drop slightly.
  <br>
  <br>
  One of the key components of the plan, is the merging of Hong Kong East and West hospital clusters, which the health chief said would improve efficiency.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking after an RTHK radio programme on Saturday, Lo said the move aims to utilise resources.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're looking at merging the Hong Kong East and West clusters to co-care for 1.2 million people on Hong Kong Island. This will improve management and administration efficiency," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In terms of medical services, it will allow the two to have a strong collaboration through increased cooperation in terms of training and service."
  <br>
  <br>
  He emphasised that services offered by Eastern Hospital would remain unchanged.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the bureau is also looking into adjusting public hospital charges.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lo revealed that critical and emergency patients might be charged less, noting that the government is responsible for them.
  <br>
  <br>
  As for semi and non urgent patients, he said the authority will offer more a precise subsidy for them.

 People flocked to Victoria Park to enjoy one of Hong Kong's largest outdoor fairs.
 <br>
  <br>
  Organised by the Chinese Manufacturers’ Association, the Brands and Products Expo opened on Saturday and will run until January 6.
  <br>
  <br>
  This year's event saw 900 booths set up, with some offering discounts, including HK$1 special deals.
  <br>
  <br>
  A woman said she had not been to the fair for many years, and this time, she bought a bag of medicinal herbs.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's a steal. I didn't line up for too long. You can't imagine how happy I am because I got so many things for just HK$1. It would originally cost at least HK$100," she told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another woman said she arrived at the venue four hours early to make sure she got what she was looking for.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Abalones and fish maw. I will make soup and other delicious dishes. It's almost new year and also the winter solstice," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Financial Secretary Paul Chan also visited the expo, and bought soup packs, shiitake mushrooms, dried shrimps and egg rolls.
  <br>
  <br>
  The association's chairman Wingco Lo said Hong Kong's retail market had been facing various challenges, but with the festive atmosphere and the resumption of the multi-entry visas for Shenzhen residents, he's confident with the sales from the fair.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Saturday wrapped up his four-day duty visit to Beijing, making a last stop at the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security in the capital before returning home.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lee, alongside Chief Secretary Eric Chan who arrived in Beijing on Friday, met Wang Xiaoping, the minister of human resources and social security, as well as other mainland officials.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to a government statement, the two sides exchanged views on issues such as the integrated development of education, scientific and technological innovation, and building the SAR into an international hub for high-calibre talent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee reported to the minister that the idea of the committee came from President Xi Jinping, who “pointed out that education development, scientific and technological innovation, and talent cultivation should be promoted as an integrated effort”.
  <br>
  <br>
  “He said he hopes that the [Hong Kong] SAR government can create joint forces with the ministry in serving the country’s workforce development strategy and make greater contributions to building a great country in all respects through Chinese modernisation,” the statement read.
  <br>
  <br>
  For his part, the chief secretary, who chairs the committee, said the group would leverage Hong Kong’s strategic positioning and advantages in its work.
  <br>
  <br>
  The committee held its first meeting on Friday and agreed to review and improve existing schemes on attracting high-performing individuals.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ocean Park chairman Paulo Pong said the debut of pandas An An and Ke Ke have boosted the atmosphere at the park, and he expects the facility to see more visitors during festive holidays.
 <br>
  <br>
  The two pandas gifted by the central government earlier made their first appearance to the public, and Pong said tourists from both home and abroad have been lining up to spend time with the animals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a television programme on Saturday, the chairman said the park was ready for a visitor boom in the coming months.
  <br>
  <br>
  "December is always a peak. We normally expect more visitors during Christmas and Chinese New Year, and now people are eagerly looking forward to visiting the giant pandas. We know they're going to visit the park during these festivals, he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pong said Ying Ying's baby twins are expected to greet visitors during the Chinese New Year holiday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked whether visitors would have to pay extra to see the twins, Pong said he had not considered it yet, but stressed that ticketing is integral for Ocean Park's income.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Ocean Park Water World has been closed for a seasonal break this winter, instead of keeping its doors open all year round as usual.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pong said this allowed better allocation of manpower, so that more staff could help out at Ocean Park when the Water World was having a slack season.

 The transformation into green transportation is a new opportunity for Hong Kong to expand its market in developing electric vehicles.
 <br>
  <br>
  That's according to Secretary for Environment and Ecology, Tse Chin-wan, who told a radio programme that while many countries and regions are promoting green transportation, not many places have double-decker buses.
  <br>
  <br>
  The authorities earlier announced a green transformation roadmap of public buses and taxis, with plans to subsidise the purchase of electric buses and taxis.
  <br>
  <br>
  The environment chief stressed that it's worth investing as Hong Kong can make use of the advantage and expand its market in the technology that's involved.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This green transformation actually provides opportunities under the establishment of a new economy... If we use subsidies to help double-decker buses develop the technology, we can grasp the opportunity," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong is an international city and we can set an example for other places."
  <br>
  <br>
  The government shelved the pay-as-you-throw scheme earlier this year, and though some green groups say the scheme should still be rolled out at some point, Tse noted that the authorities would continue to promote waste reduction and recycling rates.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that there are different means to do so, but the ultimate aim is to establish a green-focused culture in society.

 The newly appointed Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism expects Hong Kong to see 45 million visitor arrivals by the end of 2024.
 <br>
  <br>
  The government earlier estimated that the region would welcome 46 million tourists by year-end.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a Commercial Radio programme, Rosanna Law pointed out that the tourism sector has been doing quite well recently.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said that during the first 11 months of the year, the SAR rolled out the red carpet for around 41 million travellers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Since the resumption of the multi-entry visa scheme [for Shenzhen residents], daily visitor numbers have been between 7 to 8 percent higher than the average for November," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Especially on weekends, average figures have increased by 30 percent, year-on-year."
  <br>
  <br>
  Law, who said she felt "a great responsibility" in her new role, emphasised that various industries should make good use of the benefitting measures offered by the central government.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the secretary also assured travellers that the government has already geared up for New Year's Eve celebrations, to ensure that mainland visitors have a smooth journey back home.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government had earlier announced that opening hours of border crossings will be extended that day, and most MTR lines will run overnight.

    Xi briefed on plans to achieve HK fiscal balance: CE

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Friday said he detailed to President Xi Jinping strategies to achieve fiscal balance "in three to five years", after the SAR government warned the deficit would balloon to around HK$100 billion for the current financial year.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lee, who was received by the president on the third day of his duty visit to Beijing, added the administration will aim to develop new growth points and grasp the opportunities provided by the mainland.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters after the meeting, the CE was asked if the president was concerned by the SAR government's fiscal situation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I have explained the strategies that we will be adopting to ensure that we will eventually make a balanced budget. That may take a few years," Lee replied.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said one way to strengthen the city's economy would be "expanding outside" to markets like Asean and the Middle East, or even Latin America and central Asia.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the nation still offers "the biggest opportunities" for Hong Kong, Lee stressed, and that it's up to the SAR to capitalise on them.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee revealed he and the president also discussed safeguarding national security, raising the level of governance, boosting development momentum, and improving people's livelihood.
  <br>
  <br>
  During a brief photo call at the start of the closed-door meeting, Xi had affirmed Lee's work and hailed his administration for completing the "historic legislation" of Basic Law Article 23.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think that recognition speaks for itself. I am a believer of there is never the best, only the better. That is also the doctrine advocated by President Xi. In this area, we see things in the same angle," Lee said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And I have been making reports to him as to how I can create extra synergy, new development, and also create economic growth for Hong Kong."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee and Chief Secretary Eric Chan will meet officials from the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security in Beijing on Saturday, before returning to the SAR on the same day.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee hoped the exchange would provide insight to a recently established SAR committee on education, technology and talents.
  <br>
  <br>
  The group, announced in his policy address, is chaired by the chief secretary.

    Stiffer penalties mooted for major illegal structures

<img alt="The government is proposing tougher penalties for serious illegal structures, while offering leniency for smaller works such as oversized drying racks. File photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1783391_1_20241213191930.jpg&q=40">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government announced on Friday a two-fold proposal to handle unauthorised building works, with those convicted of serious breaches facing a maximum jail term of two years and a HK$2 million fine.
 <br>
  <br>
  While stiffer penalties could be introduced for serious contraventions of the Buildings Ordinance, authorities are also rolling out a leniency scheme for minor unlawful works deemed to be low risk.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Development Bureau conducted a review of the existing regulations following a spate of incidents where chunks of concrete fell off the exterior facade of ageing buildings.
  <br>
  <br>
  There was also public concern after a landslide exposed unauthorised structures at multiple Redhill Peninsula villas last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under the proposed amendments to the Buildings Ordinance, those who ignore removal orders for "serious unauthorised works", such as an illegal basement, could be jailed for two years, double the current ceiling.
  <br>
  <br>
  The maximum fine would also be raised by 50 percent to HK$300,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  Owners, building professionals or contractors who erect structures without government approval face a HK$2 million fine, up from HK$400,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bureau is also proposing to lower the prosecution threshold, such that proceedings could be initiated even when the person concerned doesn't "knowingly" begin construction without permission.
  <br>
  <br>
  People who inherit illegal structures from the previous owner could still be prosecuted, if they didn't remove them within a certain time frame after the new law is passed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Relatively minor additions, including retractable awnings and outdoor signboards fixed to the floor, could be performed without prior approval in the future so long as the structures fit the prescribed size and height.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials also plan to relax requirements for drying racks for clothes and air conditioner support frames.
  <br>
  <br>
  There will be a three-year grace period for owners to have minor structures inspected by a certified professional. Structures which are approved can be kept.
  <br>
  <br>
  A bureau spokeswoman said the policy is aimed at minimising nuisance to the public. But the bureau was also aware of opinions that existing laws are not deterrent enough for serious breaches.
  <br>
  <br>
  "After all, our resources are limited. So we want to focus our law enforcement efforts on the most serious cases, tackling the bigger illegal structures," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities are also proposing a fixed penalty of HK$6,000 for owners who ignore statutory building inspection notices, which are served to premises aged 30 years or above.
  <br>
  <br>
  A two-month public consultation on the proposal will begin later this month, and the amendment bill could be tabled to the legislature in the first half of 2026.

    'HK needs long-term planning to be in line with China'

<img alt="Lau Siu-kai says President Xi Jinping showed his affirmation and appreciation towards Chief Executive John Lee and his administration. File photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1783388_1_20241213183923.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A senior member of a leading national think tank on Friday said Hong Kong needs more long-term planning in connecting its development strategy with that of the mainland.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lau Siu-kai, a consultant to the Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macau Studies, said President Xi Jinping showed affirmation and appreciation towards Chief Executive John Lee and his administration during their exchanges in Beijing on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The consultant said Lee was awarded with a high evaluation due to the SAR completing national security legislation under Article 23 of the Basic Law earlier this year, and its efforts in building ties with different countries and regions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think particularly [President Xi is] concerned about Hong Kong's international development space, which has been, to a certain extent, shrunk by the United States and the West," Lau told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That's why President Xi must be happy to see John Lee and his government trying to develop, or to enlarge, Hong Kong's international economic space by developing closer relationships with countries in the Belt and Road Initiative."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lau said President Xi was optimistic on Hong Kong's economy, and he expects "reform" and "innovation" to be the major principles for the city's future governance.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he stressed that it would require long-term planning so that Hong Kong could connect its development strategy with that of the mainland's.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chief Secretary Eric Chan also departed for Beijing to join the chief executive in meeting with relevant ministries in the capital.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lau said President Xi may want Hong Kong to boost its inter-departmental cooperation and also work with the central government to tackle external threats as US President-elect Donald Trump takes office next month.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That might involve a bigger impact on Hong Kong, and may also involve Hong Kong cooperating with the central authorities so that we can jointly handle the threats coming from Trump and his new administration," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  With Lee meeting leaders from universities in Beijing, Lau said Hong Kong has to strengthen its exchanges with mainland universities to further enable the city to serve as an educational hub.
