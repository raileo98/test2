<div class="itemFullText">
 Each Legislative Council election should be better than the previous one, according to a senior Beijing official overseeing Hong Kong affairs, who also stressed the SAR needs “capable, responsible and accomplished” individuals to serve the city.
 <br>
  <br>
  Wang Linggui, deputy director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, said the city should add more talent not only in the political arena but also innovation and technology.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong is expected to hold its next polls for the legislature in December this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  “In the new stage of transitioning from stability to prosperity, Hong Kong needs people who are capable, responsible and accomplished, to seek the best for the general public of Hong Kong,” Wang told RTHK on Sunday on the sidelines of the “Two Sessions” in Beijing.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Each Legislative Council election should be better than the previous one. Just like the Olympic Games, there is never the best, only better. Being ‘good’ is a goal that should be constantly pursued.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang added that he believes Hong Kong authorities would consult different sectors, including local deputies to the National People’s Congress and the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference, on the upcoming polls.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong and Macau delegates to the country's top political advisory body said the two SARs should make good use of their advantages under the One Country, Two Systems principle.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a plenary meeting of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) on Sunday, Hong Kong delegate Tu Haiming said the One Country, Two Systems principle helps Hong Kong and Macau maintain their long-term prosperity and stability.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the first phase of its implementation has been completed, but some people still don't have a deep understanding about the principle.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Entering a new phase, the advantages of One Country, Two Systems should be realised through vitalisation and an increase in volume. We not only have to develop Hong Kong, contribute to the country and bring the country together, but also have to benefit the world,” Tu said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Through deepening the understanding of the One Country, Two Systems principle in the new phase, we have to further enhance the sense of responsibility and mission of Hong Kong society.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Macau CPPCC delegate Lao Nga-wong, meanwhile, said Macau is an example of the successful implementation of the One Country, Two Systems.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Macau should use its advantages in reinforcing connection with both the mainland and the world… and build the SAR into another international passage besides Hong Kong,” he said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The director of the central government's liaison office, Zheng Yanxiong, on Saturday said Hong Kong should take the “One Country, Two Systems” principle to a new level, and strive for better development.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to Hong Kong deputies to the National People’s Congress (NPC) in Beijing, Zheng said President Xi Jinping made the remarks when meeting Jiangsu deputies, asking them to promote scientific and technological innovation.
  <br>
  <br>
  The director said the remarks were also meaningful for Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Hong Kong must focus on reform and innovation and walk on the new path of developing new quality productive forces,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zheng said Hong Kong should consolidate and enhance its status as the so-called “three centres”, and as an international hub for tertiary education, and innovation and technology.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the SAR should safeguard national security, pursue economic growth and advance development, as pointed out by Vice Premier Ding Xuexiang.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zheng added that Hong Kong should fully leverage its advantages under the “One Country, Two Systems” principle, and speed up the process of advancing to prosperity.

 The chairwoman of Gree Electrics on Saturday said private enterprises need continuous innovation and technological investment to thrive.
 <br>
  <br>
  Dong Mingzhu, who's also a deputy to the National People's Congress (NPC), said the country has long supported private enterprises through various forms of assistance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters in Beijing, Dong said her company's trade-in policy helps consumers gain a better understanding of household appliances and improves safety awareness.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xiang Wenbo, NPC deputy and chairman of SANY Heavy Industry, which earlier announced plans to list in Hong Kong, said the timing is favourable given the current capital market conditions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xiang added that he believes listing in the SAR will speed up his company's international development.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong officials on Saturday said they will learn from the spirit of "Two Sessions" and stressed the importance of unity in advancing the SAR's development.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a Facebook post, Civil Service Secretary Ingrid Yeung said her team was inspired by the speech of Vice Premier Ding Xuexiang.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeung stressed the civil service's role in implementing One Country, Two Systems, highlighting the importance of using technology in government operations.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Health Bureau said the city is making use of its advantages under One Country, Two Systems to attract medical professionals and help Chinese medicine reach international markets.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, home and youth affairs chief Alice Mak said she will work with care teams and district councillors to promote the spirit of Two Sessions at grassroots level.
  <br>
  <br>
  On her Facebook page, cultural, sports and tourism minister Rosanna Law said Premier Li Qiang's work report has provided important direction for the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  Law outlined plans to implement the Blueprint for Arts and Culture and Creative Industries Development, enhance cultural exchanges and organise major sporting events, including the National Games in November.
  <br>
  <br>
  Development Secretary Bernadette Linn, for her part, said her bureau will continue to push forward the development of the Northern Metropolis and enhance cooperation with the Greater Bay Area.

 Mainland authorities on Saturday said Hong Kong and the mainland should work together to tackle cross-border scams, after six more SAR residents were released from scam farms in Myanmar.
 <br>
  <br>
  The nation’s vice minister of public security Xu Ganlu said the joint operation of China and Thailand achieved success in rescuing victims from Myanmar.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We hope people trapped in scam farms can return to their families as soon as possible. The Chinese public security organs will work closely with foreign police to rescue more victims,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The chairman of the China International Development Cooperation Agency, Luo Zhaohui, said phone scams are outrageous, and Hong Kong should join hands with the mainland.
  <br>
  <br>
  “With our cooperation with relevant countries in Southeast Asia, and through diplomatic and public security efforts, we have seen progress in cooperation with Myanmar and Thailand,” he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It must be challenging to crack down on any kind of scams… Hong Kong is also facing this problem, so it is necessary for the SAR to work with the mainland.”

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Saturday said they have arrested six people for allegedly assaulting a 14-year-old girl in Mong Kok last August.
 <br>
  <br>
  The five women and a man, aged 15 to 22, were arrested on suspicion of assault occasioning actual bodily harm, after the teenage girl made a report to the police on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police said the girl was allegedly slapped and bullied by around 10 teenage boys and girls, at a rear staircase of a shopping mall in Mong Kok.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police said they had argued over “an attitude problem and trivial matters.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Police also believe that one of the attackers had filmed a video of the assault, but officers are investigating why the video was posted to the internet.
  <br>
  <br>
  The arrestees are being detained for further enquiries, and police said they have information about other alleged attackers. Some of the attackers allegedly have a triad background.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Deputy Secretary for Justice Horace Cheung on Saturday said the government will think about how to enforce the national security law better.
 <br>
  <br>
  His comment came after the Court of Final Appeal earlier overturned the convictions of three members of the now-disbanded Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements of China, for refusing to hand information over to the police in a national security investigation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a Commercial Radio programme, Cheung said the national security law is considered as a relatively new piece of legislation as this year marks the fifth anniversary of the implementation of the law in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said there was no precedent for law enforcement agencies to follow when carrying out the law.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Cheung said the government will take the court’s view into account and think about how to improve the enforcement of the law.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We’ll carefully study the judgement handed down by the Court of Final Appeal. We will see how the judgement can further improve the law enforcement mechanism of national security in Hong Kong,” Cheung said to reporters after attending the programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  “But I will say the judgement and the case law will contribute significantly to the development of jurisprudence of the national security law in Hong Kong,” he added.

 Chief Executive John Lee praised the contribution of women to society and pledged that the government is committed to promoting women's rights.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lee made the remarks on Saturday at a reception held at government headquarters, celebrating March 8 - the International Women's Day.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Yes, women are the backbone of our society.  They include leaders, innovators, caregivers, change-makers and more. From boardrooms to classrooms, from workspace to marketplace, the women of Hong Kong continue to break barriers and inspire future generations," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The government is dedicated to promoting gender equality and empowering women in every facet of life."
  <br>
  <br>
  The CE noted since taking over office, he had established the Women Empowerment Fund and organised the first Family and Women Development Summit in the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the government will work together with the Women's Commission to foster an inclusive, opportunity-filled Hong Kong for all women.

    New scheme aims to remove poorly managed buildings

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 There's hope that a new scheme can help eliminate poorly managed, so-called "three-nil buildings" - which are blocks that lack owners’ corporations, property management services, or resident organizations.
 <br>
  <br>
  Secretary for Home and Youth Affairs Alice Mak says the joint building management scheme will involve the same property management company handling aged building clusters in the area.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government will act as a middleman to link property owners with professionals from NGOs who can advise them on finding the right management company.
  <br>
  <br>
  It will commence a one-year test in Yau Tsim Mong, Sham Shui Po, Kowloon City, and Tsuen Wan later this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a Commercial Radio programme, Mak noted the project will help take care of aged buildings in the relevant areas.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Aside from the three-nil buildings, there are some aging, single-block buildings in old districts that only have 10 to 20 households. Even if they manage to form an owners' corporation, hiring a management company can be expensive as the cost can be too high for just a few units to share. So, in most cases they just choose not to set one up,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mak said the government has set aside HK$7 million for the project, with care teams and community NGOs helping to promote it.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister added that consultations have started in District Councils across the four districts and hoped that the project can commence by mid-year.

    'HK can't stop residential and industrial land sale'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Secretary for Development Bernadette Linn on Saturday said Hong Kong is not in a position to stop selling residential and industrial land.
 <br>
  <br>
  In this year’s budget, the government stated it wouldn't sell commercial sites in the coming year in light of the high office vacancy rate.
  <br>
  <br>
  Linn pushed back against opinions saying that all land sales should be put on hold.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Firstly, Hong Kong is eager to grow various industries. We want to make as much industrial land available for development as possible, so there’s no room to hold back. That goes against our strategy," she told an RTHK programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We also won’t stop selling residential land. We have a solid plan in place, with a 10-year projection for how much land we need for public and private housing. This plan has been in play for several years, and we allocate based on this estimate every year."
  <br>
  <br>
  The budget also proposed converting some commercial land into residential use, with locations including Hung Shui Kiu Ha Tsuen, Tung Chung, Shek Mun, and Kowloon East.
  <br>
  <br>
  Linn said the government will take various factors into consideration before making a decision.
  <br>
  <br>
  “If the area is not designated as a core business area, I think there's more room to include more residential elements in it. We’ll also look at the office vacancy rates. Additionally, are there newly built commercial buildings? If there are, it suggests the supply is sufficient, so we have room for adjustment,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  When asked if the government is considering installment payments to encourage developers to bid for land, the development minister said they have an open mind toward large-scale land deals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Linn pointed out that each pilot zone in the Northern Metropolis could involve HK$10 billion to HK$20 billion in investment, adding that the administration will seek opinions from developers in the market sentiment survey.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tending process for the three pilot zones, located in Hung Shui Kiu Ha Tsuen, Fanling North, and San Tin Technopole, will begin tendering work from second half of the year.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong Customs intensified enforcement at the international airport and uncovered multiple cases of illicit cigarette smuggling involving air passengers.
 <br>
  <br>
  On Thursday, Customs raided a suspected storage facility in Yuen Long, seizing approximately 6.7 million illicit cigarettes and 570,000 alternative smoked products, valued at an estimated HK$33 million, with a duty potential of HK$22 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the early hours of Friday, Customs arrested a 36-year-old man outside a hotel in Tin Shui Wai.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was found in possession of 90,000 illicit cigarettes and 110,000 alternative smoking products.
  <br>
  <br>
  Investigations revealed that the syndicate used air passengers to smuggle these items, which were stored in hotel rooms for further distribution.
  <br>
  <br>
  The man, who claimed to be unemployed, faces charges and will appear in Tuen Mun Magistrate's Courts on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Seized alternative smoking products will be handed over to the Department of Health for further action.
  <br>
  <br>
  Over the past two weeks, Customs intercepted 20 illicit cigarette smuggling cases at the airport, arresting 13 men and eight women.
  <br>
  <br>
  About 600,000 illicit cigarettes and 460,000 alternative smoking products were seized, with an estimated market value of HK$4 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  A follow-up operation at a Yuen Long logistics warehouse led to the arrest of a 44-year-old driver after the discovery of 6 million illicit cigarettes.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was released on bail pending further investigation.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Security minister Chris Tang said on Friday that six more Hongkongers trapped in scam farms in Myanmar have been rescued in a joint operation by the Security Bureau and authorities from the mainland, Thailand and Myanmar.
 <br>
  <br>
  Tang said the victims - three men and three women aged between 29 and 44 - had been held for five to seven months, after falling for job scams.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said Myanmar soldiers rescued them overnight and sent them to Thailand, adding that they are in good health.
  <br>
  <br>
  Five of the victims are scheduled to return to Hong Kong on Friday night, while the remaining person will stay in Thailand for at least one more day to assist with the ongoing probe.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was a rescue operation, so we did not pay any ransom," the minister told reporters at the airport after returning from Bangkok.
  <br>
  <br>
  "25 people, including these six, have returned, or will be returning to Hong Kong. The SAR government will spare no effort to rescue the remaining three people [trapped in Southeast Asia]."
  <br>
  <br>
  Tang was due to attend an event on Lantau on Thursday, but cancelled it at the last minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said he couldn't announce his trip because of the need to keep the rescue operation under wraps.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister also thanked Beijing officials from the Ministries of Public Security and Foreign Affairs, as well as authorities in Myanmar and Thailand for taking part in the mission.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Legal scholar and Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) member Albert Chen on Friday said the National Security Law can be amended, and that won't have retroactive effect.
 <br>
  <br>
  His comments came a day after the SAR's top court overturned the convictions of three former members of Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements in China for refusing to hand information to the police in a national security investigation.
  <br>
  <br>
  In response, the Hong Kong government said it will study the ruling, review how it enforces national security laws, and look for ways to improve them.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to RTHK in Beijing, Chen said the Court of Final Appeal's ruling is reasonable and aligns with common law principles.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked whether changes are needed, he said Hong Kong's Committee for Safeguarding National Security is in charge of making rules for the National Security Law.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Laws can be amended at any time. Of course, these amendments won't have retrospective effect. But after the amendment, the court will need to make rulings based on the newly amended laws," the University of Hong Kong professor said.
  <br>
  <br>
  This committee can decide to change the rules on its own without seeking approval from the National People's Congress, Chen added.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) Standing Committee member Henry Tang on Friday said Hong Kong should leverage its advantages and further promote internationalisation.
 <br>
  <br>
  Vice Premier Ding Xuexiang held talks with Hong Kong and Macau CPPCC delegates on Thursday on the sidelines of the "Two Sessions" in Beijing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tang said one of the issues they discussed was the city's responsibility to promote internationalisation, it being one of the most international cities in China.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We understand and recognise our responsibilities in how to further the internationalisation of Hong Kong so that we will play to the Two Systems advantage under the One Country,” Tang said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “At the same time, we are able to facilitate and to forge relationships with overseas organisations and counterparts that otherwise will be helpful in promoting relationships in this very complex political environment today.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Tang, who is also the chairman of the board of the West Kowloon Cultural District Authority, said the cultural hub will continue to promote exchanges with different countries in the cultural sector.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said West Kowloon will help enhance the cultural soft power and allow Chinese culture to go global.

<img alt="Local NPC delegates say safeguarding national security is one of the issues they discuss with Vice Premier Ding Xuexiang. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1794741_2_20250307153730.jpg&q=35">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Vice Premier Ding Xuexiang has urged Hong Kong to act more firmly in safeguarding national security while recognising the city's effort in implementing Article 23 legislation, according to attendees at a meeting with the top official in Beijing on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Ding, who's also a Politburo Standing Committee member and heads the Central Leading Group on Hong Kong and Macau Affairs, held a closed-door meeting with local deputies to the National People’s Congress (NPC) on the sidelines of the "Two Sessions".
  <br>
  <br>
  During the 90-minute meeting, the vice premier was quoted as saying the SAR made “new progress and breakthroughs” in the past year, such as enacting its own national security law.
  <br>
  <br>
  Starry Lee, the city’s sole delegate to the NPC Standing Committee, said Ding attached great importance to what has been happening in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  Addressing the meeting, Lee said NPC deputies must “be pioneers and lead by example”, and that security is the prerequisite for development.
  <br>
  <br>
  “At present, Hong Kong’s long-term stability is hard-won and must be cherished even more," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “[As Hong Kong delegates], we must firmly safeguard national security and have the courage to say 'no' to all words and actions that violate the Constitution and the Basic Law.”
  <br>
  <br>
  NPC delegate Ma Fung-kwok told reporters after the meeting that Ding highlighted the passage of Article 23 legislation last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  “He mentioned that this is a very important achievement, in terms of legislation concerning national security,” Ma said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He didn’t elaborate much on those directions. He just restated that we had done a very good job.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Ding also noted the city’s economic recovery and its increased influence globally, Ma added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, Xia Baolong; the head of Beijing’s liaison office, Zheng Yanxiong; and Minister of Science and Technology, Yin Hejun, were also present at the meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ding met Hong Kong and Macau delegates of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference a day earlier.

    Good to improve NSL, Beijing official says

<div class="itemFullText">
 A Beijing official on Friday said that it'll be the right thing to do to keep improving the National Security Law.
 <br>
  <br>
  Sun Qingye, deputy head of the Office for Safeguarding National Security of the Central People's Government in the SAR, made the remarks on the sidelines of the "Two Sessions" in Beijing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking in a group interview, Sun, who is also a delegate to the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), said the SAR government has been implementing the National Security Law well over the past five years or so, but noted that it'll be good to keep improving the law.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If there are any issues or problems in our National Security Law, it should be revised, but this is a matter for the National People's Congress to decide," he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sun added that the city's domestic Article 23 laws helped to complement efforts to safeguard national security.
  <br>
  <br>
  He slammed certain Western nations for imposing sanctions on SAR officials and judges.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Whether it is from the United States or from other countries, it is unreasonable for them to sanction our judges. We have to support the judges to handle relevant national security cases well. [For those countries], they are wrong and should not impose sanctions. Why don't they sanction their own judges?" he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sun also rejected calls to pardon Jimmy Lai, founder of the now-defunct Apple Daily newspaper who's on trial for alleged national security offences.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This should be handled in accordance with the law. Why should special pardons be granted? What are the reasons to grant a special pardon?
  <br>
  <br>
  "He's not the son of a certain president, so that the president can pardon him."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Beijing official also said it's important to enhance national security education at local schools, to help raise awareness among youngsters.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Kai Tak Sports Park will promote sports development and exchanges between Hong Kong and the mainland, according to senior Chinese sports officials attending the "Two Sessions" in Beijing.
 <br>
  <br>
  Zhou Jinqiang, vice president of the Chinese Olympic Committee and a member of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), said athletes from the national team who attended the sports park's opening last week were very impressed with the new facility.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If possible, of course we hope to organise some international events and sports exchange activities between Hong Kong and the mainland at the sports park," Zhou told RTHK on the sidelines of the "Two Sessions".
  <br>
  <br>
  Zhou also said preparations for the National Games are going well, adding that it will be an important milestone in China's development as a leading sports nation.
  <br>
  <br>
  This year's National Games will be co-hosted by Guangdong, Macau and Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liu Guoliang, president of the Chinese Table Tennis Association and also a CPPCC member, highlighted Hong Kong's strong performance in table tennis over the past year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liu, who also chairs the World Table Tennis (WTT) Board, said the SAR may play host to the WTT finals this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm really looking forward to having table tennis competitions at this new sports venue and have been following its development closely. Hong Kong's table tennis development has been excellent with widespread participation. This year's WTT finals may also be held in Hong Kong," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liu also expressed confidence that the National Games will lead to major breakthroughs in sports and tourism in the Greater Bay Area.

    Smart traffic control system to be tested in Kwun Tong

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Friday said they hope traffic congestion in Kwun Tong would be eased following the implementation of a new smart traffic management system in the area.
 <br>
  <br>
  The system, to be launched later this year, was co-developed with the University of Science and Technology’s Great Smart Cities Institute.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police said they received funding of HK$6.8 million from the Innovation, Technology and Industry Bureau to develop the system.
  <br>
  <br>
  It includes installing 11 sets of CCTV cameras across nine streets in Kwun Tong's business area.
  <br>
  <br>
  Traffic data will be collected round the clock, analysed real-time through AI and shared by the police and the Transport Department.
  <br>
  <br>
  For example, the system can show vehicle flow on different days and in different periods, as well as give suggestions on traffic lights control.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a press briefing, police chief inspector Terrence Yu said the collected data would not be used for enforcement and would be deleted after 28 days.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Our idea was to use technology to better understand the traffic flow in the business area to provide us with the most appropriate arrangement. We won’t carry out enforcement based on the system, but we will make arrangements in areas like deployment of manpower based on the situation, and ask our colleagues to take appropriate traffic control measures,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yu said the force does not have specific performance indicators and would review the system in future before considering whether to expand it to other areas.

    'Govt should seek new revenue streams amid deficit'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Former transport secretary Frank Chan says it is appropriate for the government to find new sources of income under a fiscal deficit, but it should carefully assess the impact of any new policies.
 <br>
  <br>
  Financial Secretary Paul Chan announced in his budget last month a proposed HK$200 levy on private cars every time they leave Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on the sidelines of the "Two Sessions" in Beijing, Chan - a Hong Kong deputy to the National People’s Congress (NPC) - said it was inevitable that new policies would have consequences.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he believed the authorities had done analysis on the possible impact.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I would expect the officers to come up with some kind of information and impact analysis so as to convince the public whether or not they should and how much it is to be raised," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Because at the time there's a financial deficit incurring in Hong Kong, then there must be a way that we need to balance it out.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Another NPC deputy Nicholas Chan said the government should also look into ways to help those being affected by policy changes.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We would have to probably take a more holistic approach about how we help people who might suffer from this, and if this is - overall - good for the economy, how do we lessen the hurt on those who are going to feel aggrieved by such a move,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government also announced plans to adjust the city’s subsidised public transport fares for the elderly, including setting a cap on the number of subsidised trips per month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Frank Chan said the subsidised transport fare was a welfare policy, instead of a transport policy, and that it is a responsible act of the government to review it based on the actual situation.

<img alt="Only 4.5 percent of private flats were vacant as of end-2024, the government says. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1794626_1_20250306222204.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Authorities insist there is still keen demand for housing, citing a low vacancy rate for private flats, in response to a market report suggesting the city's home market is on the decline due to a supply glut.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a statement on Thursday, an SAR government spokesman added delinquent residential mortgages remained at an extremely low level, and that banks are mitigating their credit risks.
  <br>
  <br>
  The comments were in response to an S&P report on Hong Kong's banks and property market.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We disagree with the observation that there is an oversupply of residential properties," the spokesman said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As of the end of last year, the vacancy rate for private homes stood at 4.5 percent, in line with the average between 2004 and 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Rents also keep going up, reflecting keen housing demand."
  <br>
  <br>
  As for delinquent residential mortgages, only 0.12 percent of all loans drawn were overdue as of end-January.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Under the Monetary Authority's counter-cyclical measures, the city's average residential mortgage rate remained solid at 60 percent, while the debt-servicing ratio, at 40 percent, was also low," the statement read.
  <br>
  <br>
  The spokesman added it agreed with the report's view that Hong Kong's banking sector can withstand "strains arising from the commercial real estate" sector, saying loans are diversified and institutions have taken measures to mitigate risks.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Net profit at the MTR Corporation more than doubled last year, thanks largely to strong gains in local property development.
 <br>
  <br>
  The railway firm posted a full-year profit of HK$15.77 billion, up from HK$7.78 billion in 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  Total revenue rose 5.3 percent to HK$60 billion, compared with HK$56 billion the year before.
  <br>
  <br>
  Local property development fared especially well, with net profit up nearly four times to HK$10.26 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  The gains were mainly due to earnings from sites at LOHAS Park, Ho Man Tin Station and The Southside in Wong Chuk Hang, the MTR said.
  <br>
  <br>
  It added it is considering possible tenders of Package 2 of Tung Chung East Station and Tuen Mun A16 Station Package 1 in the coming 12 months, but noted that any decisions will depend on market conditions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Losses in its mainland property business, meanwhile, narrowed to HK$3 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  The company also said patronage continued to recover, with passenger numbers of its domestic operations reaching 1.95 billion in 2024, close to pre-pandemic levels.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ridership rose for the high-speed rail link as well, with more than 26.7 million journeys recorded.
  <br>
  <br>
  Commenting on the MTR's annual results, Jacob Kam, the group's chief executive officer, noted that last year's performance was boosted by the notable recovery in property development under the "Rail plus Property" business model.
  <br>
  <br>
  "While the company’s operating results were satisfactory during the year under review, it is important to reiterate that much of these profits will be committed to the substantial funding required for the upgrading and renewal of existing lines as well as planning and constructing new railway projects," he said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We also must keep adapting to the new realities of consumer behaviour in the post-pandemic era, particularly the established trends of Hong Kong people travelling north for weekends and holidays and mainland Chinese tourists spending less time in local retail outlets."
  <br>
  <br>
  The company declared a final dividend of HK$0.89 per share, raising the full-year total to HK$1.31.

<img alt="The ICAC said the case centred on 11 league and cup matches between 2021 and 2022. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1794578_1_20250306172359.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The ICAC on Thursday charged four people on suspicion of fixing matches in the Hong Kong football league.
 <br>
  <br>
  Three of the suspects were linked to Fu Moon Athletic Association, which currently plays in the Second Division, below the Premier League and First Division.
  <br>
  <br>
  They included 30-year-old defender Lo Hong-ming, who's also the owner and the coach, as well as 32-year-old midfielder So Chun-yin.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong Him-chun, a former Fu Moon player, was the alleged betting agent, while Yao Xiaocong was the alleged bookmaker.
  <br>
  <br>
  They are due to appear in Eastern Court on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The anti-graft body alleged that 11 league and cup matches between the 2021-22 season were manipulated.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lo was accused of receiving HK$60,000 in bribes, while the three others allegedly offered HK$240,000 to other players in exchange for their cooperation on the pitch.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ICAC said investigations were ongoing and warned of more arrests in the future.

    Top court upholds sedition convictions of Tam Tak-chi

<img alt="Court of Final Appeal judges dismissed arguments from Tam Tak-chi's lawyers and upheld his sedition convictions. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1794531_1_20250306130910.jpg&q=40">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's top court on Thursday upheld the sedition convictions of former activist Tam Tak-chi over a string of incitement incidents in public in 2020.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Court of Final Appeal also maintained the former vice chairman of People Power's jail sentence of three years and four months for sedition and public order-related offences.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tam's lawyers argued that the case should have been tried by a High Court jury, not the District Court.
  <br>
  <br>
  They also said the prosecutors should be required to prove the appellant had the intention to incite others to engage in violence or create a public disorder.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the top court judges dismissed both arguments.
  <br>
  <br>
  They said it was valid for a magistrate to transfer the case to the District Court.
  <br>
  <br>
  The judges also ruled that clauses of the old sedition laws didn't require proof of the intention to incite as an element of the offence.
  <br>
  <br>
  They noted the crimes listed all came with an "or" rather than an "and", dismissing the lawyers' reliance on a clause that states it is only an offence when a person counsels "disobedience to law or to any lawful order".
  <br>
  <br>
  "[The clause] constitutes only one of the various alternative forms of seditious intention each of which is capable of constituting the offence," the judges wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tam was prosecuted and jailed under the decades-old sedition laws, before the enactment of the local national security legislation under Basic Law Article 23.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Vice Premier Ding Xuexiang has urged Hong Kong to make good use of its advantages and to continue to safeguard national security, according to SAR delegates of the nation’s top political advisory body.
 <br>
  <br>
  Ding on Thursday held talks with Hong Kong and Macau delegates of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) on the sidelines of the ongoing "Two Sessions" in Beijing.
  <br>
  <br>
  The vice premier, who's also a Politburo Standing Committee member, urged Hong Kong to be confident and capitalise on its strengths.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Hong Kong has a unique position of enjoying strong support of the country and being connected to the world,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Delegates from the SAR said after the 90-minute meeting that national security was one of the topics of discussion.
  <br>
  <br>
  CPPCC member Ko Wing-man said the vice premier praised Hong Kong for completing Article 23 legislation of the Basic Law last year, while stressing that the city should not lower its guard.
  <br>
  <br>
  “There are still many internal and external forces which want to mess around, in terms of national security or the One Country, Two Systems,” Ko quoted Ding as saying.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Therefore, we have to be highly vigilant, and achieve a good balance between development and safeguarding security.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Another focus of the meeting was the trade and technology wars between China and the United States, according to CPPCC delegate and lawmaker William Wong.
  <br>
  <br>
  “He (Ding) said that the situation will not slow down. It will continue to be a bit stiff. But we should be confident in ourselves and Hong Kong should work together with the central government to advance technology and to go international,” Wong said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another CPPCC delegate, Pansy Ho, said the vice premier highly recognised Hong Kong’s efforts in boosting the economy, saying it was stable and showed improvement in the past year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho also said Ding urged Hong Kong to work closely with nearby cities, such as those in the Greater Bay Area.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Because of the close proximity and also now, the possibility of us really capitalising on the various components that each of these cities possesses, we can create a much stronger base for development,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We do not have to see Hong Kong as a standalone. We need to work on how we utilise best to our advantage, how to collaborate with cities around us.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, Xia Baolong, and CPPCC vice-chairman and former Hong Kong chief executive CY Leung were also present at the meeting.

    'More transparent private healthcare charges needed'

<img alt="The Consumer Council says many private hospitals and clinics did not provide sufficient price information, resulting in a flood of complaints.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The city's consumer watchdog on Thursday called on various private healthcare service providers, including hospitals and clinics, to be more transparent when they disclose their fees, given complaints over unexpectedly higher medical costs.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Consumer Council said it received 191 complaints between 2021 and 2024, which were related to private medical care services, involving some HK$7.2 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  About half of those complaints were due to disputes over fees and charges.
  <br>
  <br>
  The council blamed the disputes partially on the lack of sufficient disclosures of fees by those private health care premises, adding a council study found that nearly 70 percent of patients surveyed encountered "price variations" when examining their bills.
  <br>
  <br>
  The final costs, in some cases, were HK$60,000 to HK$70,000 higher compared with the initial budget estimation.
  <br>
  <br>
  But about 65 percent of respondents did not get any explanation regarding the price difference, and about 39 percent reported receiving only verbal budget estimates without any written or detailed breakdowns of the chargeable items.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, the council pointed out the dramatically varied prices among the private premises also made it difficult for people to compare medical costs for the same treatment.
  <br>
  <br>
  To tackle the issue, the watchdog urged private medical providers to disclose their price list online, and roll out more packaged treatment services with clear and detailed written prices for consumers to choose and compare.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong’s top court on Thursday overturned the convictions of three people for refusing to hand information to the police in a national security investigation.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Court of Final Appeal unanimously ruled the trio, who were members of the now-disbanded Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements in China, did not have a fair trial.
  <br>
  <br>
  Implementation rules under the national security law require suspects deemed to be "foreign agents" to hand over information to police.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chow Hang-tung, Tang Ngok-kwan and Tsui Hon-kwong were jailed in 2023 for four-and-a-half months each for refusing such a request about their former organisation.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the top court found the evidence used by prosecutors to establish that the group was acting as a "foreign agent" was so heavily redacted that it was "self-defeating".
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was self-defeating to have redacted out the only material relied on for establishing the foreign agent element of the offence, so that, in its absence, the charge could not be proved," the judges, led by Chief Justice Andrew Cheung, wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[D]epriving the appellants of all knowledge of the nature of the prosecution’s case... made it impossible for them to have a fair trial."
  <br>
  <br>
  The court therefore quashed the three's convictions and jail sentences.
  <br>
  <br>
  A separate security trial of inciting subversion involving Chow and two former Alliance leaders is still pending.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Premier Li Qiang’s work report has offered “important guidance” on implementing the One Country, Two Systems policy, Chief Executive John Lee said on Thursday, as he pledged to further align Hong Kong with national development strategies.
 <br>
  <br>
  Addressing delegates at the Great Hall of the People on Wednesday, the premier said Beijing will continue to fully implement One Country, Two Systems and ensure Hong Kong and Macau are administered by patriots.
  <br>
  <br>
  Li also mentioned the central government’s backing to the two SARs on growing their economies, improving people’s livelihoods and deepening international exchanges.
  <br>
  <br>
  On social media, the chief executive said the government work report not only set out the country’s economic targets and policies, but also gave important direction for the practice of One Country, Two Systems.
  <br>
  <br>
  Reflecting on the premier’s message, Lee said his administration is heading in the right direction with its policies.
  <br>
  <br>
  “By following this correct policy direction and proactively aligning with the nation’s development strategies, Hong Kong’s development will have a bright future,” he wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We must better leverage the advantages of the One Country, Two Systems principle and break new ground.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The SAR will further deepen international exchanges and strengthen its role as a connector, Lee added.
  <br>
  <br>
  “On top of consolidating trade ties with traditional markets such as Europe and the United States, we will also work hard to explore new markets including the Middle East, Asean countries and Central Asia, while actively striving to join the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership,” he wrote.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong and Macau have the full backing of the central government in integrating into the country’s development, a senior Beijing official said on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Xia Baolong, director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, met Chief Executive John Lee, who attended the opening of the National People’s Congress (NPC) in the capital.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to a statement, Xia praised the SAR administration’s performance in recognising and responding to changes, fully promoting high-quality development, and uniting the entire society to focus on the city’s economy and development.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The central government has always adhered to the comprehensive and accurate implementation of the ‘One Country, Two Systems’ principle, and fully backed the integration of Hong Kong and Macau into the overall development of the country,” the statement read.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xia was also quoted as saying that he hopes Hong Kong would work to consolidate the city’s status as an international financial, shipping and trade centre, and to become a place for high-performing individuals to gather.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a government statement, the Chief Executive vowed to lead all sectors of the SAR to proactively integrate into national development, and contribute to the Greater Bay Area and the Belt and Road Initiative.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, the head of Beijing’s liaison office in the SAR urged local NPC deputies to “shoulder the historic mission and responsibility of promoting Hong Kong’s transition from stability to prosperity”.
  <br>
  <br>
  During a meeting, liaison office chief Zheng Yanxiong pointed out that the delegates should take up four roles to further bolster the territory’s development – athletes, active players, doers, and leaders.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zheng also highlighted the importance of tapping into the city’s advantages, introducing reforms, supporting the country’s high-quality development, connecting with the mainland and the world, as well as preventing risks.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Zheng emphasised that over the past few years, Hong Kong has made a number of major accomplishments, and has been widely recognised by the international community,” his office's statement read.
  <br>
  <br>
  “This year marks the end of the 14th Five-Year Plan, which is a key year for Hong Kong to accelerate its transition from stability to prosperity.”

<div class="itemFullText">
 A vibrant festival celebrating Indian culture through dance, music and cuisine, is set to brighten up the streets of Lan Kwai Fong later this month.
 <br>
  <br>
  The inaugural "Incredible India Festival", organised by the Consulate General of India in Hong Kong and the Lan Kwai Fong Association, will take place on March 15 and 16.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We hope that this will bring Indian art and culture to an accessible space for all Hongkongers, as well as tourists and foster an appreciation and better understanding of India's rich cultural heritage that goes back millenia, making it truly 'Incredible India'," said Satwant Khanalia, the consul general of India in Hong Kong and Macau.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jonathan Zeman, CEO of the Lan Kwai Fong Group, said he’s looking forward to creating a fully immersive experience for visitors.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the streets will be filled with "lots of great food, music performances, dance performances, and different workshops".
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong has a really rich history of Indian community going back at least 150 to 200 years almost, and that community still exists here, and it's important to build a bridge with the existing Indian culture over in India. It brings a lot of new elements to Hong Kong and a lot of richness to the mosaic that we have here," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two-day festival will be open to the public for free, and Zeman said he expects around 15,000 people to turn up.

    Air passenger departure tax to go up from Oct 1

<img alt="The air passenger departure tax will be increased from HK$120 to HK$200 on October 1. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1794422_1_20250306110817.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Travellers purchasing a plane ticket to fly out of Hong Kong from October 1 will have to pay HK$200 in air passenger departure tax (APDT) instead of the current HK$120, the government announced on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The tax increase was announced by Financial Secretary Paul Chan when he delivered his budget blueprint last month. The measure is expected to boost government revenue by about HK$1.6 billion each year.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, officials say some passengers will continue to be exempted from the tax.
  <br>
  <br>
  They include passengers under the age of 12, direct transit passengers, those taking connecting flights, as well as passengers who arrive at and depart Hong Kong by plane on the same day.
  <br>
  <br>
  Passengers who get to the Hong Kong International Airport by ship, or by vehicle via the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge, will also be waived, provided that they remain in the restricted area at all times.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The APDT was last increased more than 20 years ago in 2003-04. The proposed increase constitutes only a very small portion of the overall travelling cost for the general public and travellers to Hong Kong. The impact on air passengers is expected to be minimal,” a government spokesman said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Air Passenger Departure Tax (Amendment) Bill will be gazetted on Friday, and it will be tabled at the Legislative Council for first reading and the commencement of the second reading debate on March 19.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) member Andy Tsang on Wednesday slammed the US move to slap additional tariffs on Chinese exports because of the fentanyl crisis.
 <br>
  <br>
  Tsang, deputy director of the National Narcotics Control Commission and a former Hong Kong police commissioner, made the comments in Beijing on the sidelines of the "Two Sessions" after US President Donald Trump imposed an additional 10 percent tariff on China, citing a lack of progress on tackling fentanyl.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tsang said Beijing will study countermeasures and the move should not affect anti-drug cooperation.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that he believes China is one of the world's best performers in drug-control efforts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Former health minister and CPPCC delegate Ko Wing-man, meanwhile, said the setting up of Hong Kong's third medical school aims to strengthen medical education and research capabilities, not just addressing doctor shortages.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, another CPPCC member and former Bar Association chairwoman Winnie Tam said she hopes the Greater Bay Area will recognise Hong Kong's potential to help train professionals in foreign-related legal matters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tam, who chairs the Communications Authority, also said her team will continue to improve anti-fraud measures and work more closely with different platforms.

 Hong Kong and Macau will always have the central government's backing in terms of developing the economy and improving people's livelihood, a senior official in charge of the SARs' affairs pledged on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Wang Linggui, deputy director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, made the comments on the sidelines of the Two Sessions in Beijing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked by RTHK if more support measures were in store for Hong Kong, Wang pointed to the city's booming stock market.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said if investors were confident about Hong Kong, then the stock market would do well.
  <br>
  <br>
  On a separate note, Hongkongers were told by a former Beijing official to cherish their city and build it into a better place.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tan Tieniu, who was deputy director of Beijing's liaison office between 2016 and 2022, said Hong Kong had special meaning for him.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the city is a "very good" place and has a key role to play in the country's overall development, and urged everyone to "steadfastly and successfully" implement "One Country, Two Systems".

<div class="itemFullText">
 Andy Kwok, the captain of the Hong Kong Golf Club, on Wednesday said he expects a lot more spectators at the second edition of LIV Golf Hong Kong event in Fanling.
 <br>
  <br>
  The tournament will be the third event of the League's 2025 season, taking place from March 7 to 9 at the Hong Kong Golf Club.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kwok said he is looking forward to seeing people from Hong Kong and the Greater Bay Area at the event.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think it's great that we're now bringing mega sporting event organisers coming to Hong Kong to host mega sports events. I think it's great for Hong Kong, great for our people, great for the economy and as the club, being a golf club, obviously we want to bring the best golf events of the world to Hong Kong," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We were quite successful in hosting the first edition of the LIV Golf Hong Kong last year, and we're looking forward to an even more successful LIV Golf Hong Kong event this year, and hopefully we will try our best to continue to bring world-class events, and hopefully LIV can come back continuously in the future. We will try very hard to facilitate that."
  <br>
  <br>
  Scott O'Neil, CEO of LIV Golf, said the tour plans to have a major presence in all the markets that matter in Asia.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In terms of Asia, it's no secret golf is booming here. I believe we're up about 30 percent year over year in terms of participants playing golf, and it's no surprise that this is a place where we feel like home," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We'll obviously be in Hong Kong and Singapore and Korea, and those are three markets that we're very passionate about."

    Hospital patient chokes to death after meal blunder

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Caritas Medical Centre on Wednesday said it is investigating what led to an elderly patient choking to death after he was given a regular meal despite not being able to eat solid food.
 <br>
  <br>
  The man, 75, who had a history of cognitive impairment and high blood pressure, was admitted at the end of last month suffering from abdominal bloating and constipation.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was taken off food and given intravenous fluids instead, but after his condition improved doctors decided he could go back to his usual diet of pureed food, officials said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "By March 3, his condition continued to improve, and the medical team determined that this patient could return to eating his usual food, so it was recorded in his medical records as 'DAT', which stands for 'diet as tolerated'," the hospital's chief executive, Gladys Kwan, told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We believe that the nurse and doctor responsible had a communication issue, as the nurse mistakenly thought the instruction meant he could have a normal meal."
  <br>
  <br>
  Kwan said a student nurse was instructed to feed and monitor the man after each bite. Although the patient initially managed to swallow and chew, he soon began to cough, prompting the student to alert the medical team.
  <br>
  <br>
  The man was declared dead after resuscitation efforts, the hospital said.
  <br>
  <br>
  It added that it has apologised to the man's family.
  <br>
  <br>
  Raymond Cheung, chief manager for patient safety and risk management at the Hospital Authority, said a committee has been established to investigate the incident and to implement improvement measures within eight weeks.

    'Govt will support NGOs amid funding cuts'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Labour and welfare minister Chris Sun on Wednesday said the government would help NGOs save costs by streamlining administrative procedures amid funding cuts due to the fiscal deficit.
 <br>
  <br>
  Sun said the government would help shoulder a four percent reduction for 121 small-and-medium sized NGOs, meaning they would only face a three percent funding cut by the 2027-28 financial year.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, for the 58 large NGOs receiving over HK$50 million in government funding annually, Sun said they would have to bear the seven percent cuts on their own.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking after an RTHK radio programme on Wednesday, Sun said the government would give larger NGOs more time to hold onto their financial reserves, so they could make better use of their resources through these “difficult years”.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also said the government would give these NGOs more flexibility, and help them save costs by streamlining procedures such as reporting on how they used their funds.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I'm pretty confident after the meeting on Monday that we are more or less on the same page, so we are working together while we're facing a budget cut," Sun said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But at the same time, because of the more flexible use of reserves and also the efforts we are making to provide more room for them to make better use of their resources, we should be able to deal with it together,” he added.

 Fans at Kai Tak for the World Snooker Grand Prix will now be allowed to stay until the last game is finished, the government says, after spectators were ejected from the venue while a match was still underway on Tuesday night.
 <br>
  <br>
  About 100 people were watching Kyren Wilson play Matthew Selt in Kai Tak Arena when at around 11.15pm, with the match going into the fifth frame, the crowd were told to leave.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sports Secretary Rosanna Law said on Wednesday that organisers were worried about the availability of public transport if the spectators stayed any longer.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This situation is obviously not ideal, and we definitely need to take into account the experience seriously and identify remedial measures," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Law described the saga as "teething problems" and said it won't happen again.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Starting from tonight, all spectators will be allowed to view the entire series of matches until the last game is done. So, there will be no more question of spectators having to leave before the game ends," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Organisers said those affected can get complimentary tickets for another session of the tournament.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Some spectators were required to leave early before the match concluded and were unable to watch the full game. The tournament organising committee sincerely apologises for this situation," a statement said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's deputies to the National People's Congress (NPC) and the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) have given their backing to the country's economic growth target of around five percent target this year, saying it was no easy feat but achievable.
 <br>
  <br>
  HSBC chairman Peter Wong, who's a CPPCC delegate, was fully confident the country could meet the target.
  <br>
  <br>
  He recalled the many economic stimulus measures rolled out by the central government last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We think that hitting the five percent growth target last year was no easy feat, given the geopolitical situation and the world economy. But we worked hard to achieve this goal, and it wasn't easy," he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For 2025, I feel the country is well-planned to meet its goal."
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong's sentiment was shared by Jonathan Choi, who chairs the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  The businessman, who is also a CPPCC Standing Committee member, noted Beijing's support measures benefit companies big and small, across different sectors.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I just feel that we can achieve it, because at the moment, the Chinese government spent a lot of attention [on] local enterprises, not only the [state-owned enterprises] ... AI and also technology, new (sectors are) coming up," he commented.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, NPC deputy Nicholas Chan described the five percent growth target as a bold one, considering the scale of China's economy - the second-largest in the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For such a big economy, five percent in GDP is huge. Five percent is basically the entire economy of Switzerland. With such a big pie, just a small growth is humongous," he explained.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So this will lead to a lot of opportunities for people all over the world, for people along the Belt and Road, Brics (countries), and Rcep (Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership), so lots of opportunities for our friends together."

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Wednesday said he was encouraged by remarks about Hong Kong in Premier Li Qiang's work report.
 <br>
  <br>
  Addressing delegates at the Great Hall of the People, Li said Beijing will continue to fully implement the One Country, Two Systems policy and ensure Hong Kong and Macau are administered by patriots.
  <br>
  <br>
  The premier also said the central government supports the two SARs in improving their economies and the livelihoods of the people.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee, who attended the opening of the National People's Congress in the capital, said the SAR will continue to unswervingly implement One Country, Two Systems.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a Facebook post, he also said 2025 marks an important year for reforms.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This year marks the final year of the 14th Five-Year Plan, the beginning of the 15th Five-Year Plan formulation, and an important year for further comprehensive deepening of reforms, which has significant meaning for the practice of One Country, Two Systems," he wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CE said he will continue to advance the Northern Metropolis development and innovation initiatives, and strengthen Hong Kong's position as an international financial hub.

 Premier Li Qiang on Wednesday said Beijing would continue to fully implement the One Country, Two Systems policy and have the two SARs administered by patriots.

  <br>
  Delivering his annual work report at the Great Hall of the People, Li said the central government supports Hong Kong and Macau in improving their economies and livelihoods of the people.

  <br>
  "We will ensure that Hong Kong and Macau better integrate themselves into China's overall development and maintain long-term prosperity and stability."
  <br>
  <br>
  On Taiwan, Li said China resolutely opposes "Taiwan independence" and external interference, to promote the peaceful development of cross-strait relations.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will improve institutions and policies for promoting economic and cultural exchanges and cooperation across the Taiwan Strait and advance integrated cross-strait development to improve the well-being of Chinese people on both sides," the report said, adding that China will firmly advance the cause of reunification.
  <br>
  <br>

    CK Hutchison to sell Panama unit after Trump pressure

<img alt="The sale to a BlackRock consortium will deliver cash proceeds in excess of US$19 billion to Hong Kong's CK Hutchison. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1794251_1_20250305042524.jpg&q=45">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's CK Hutchison on Tuesday agreed to sell its interests in a key Panama Canal port operator to a BlackRock Inc-backed consortium, following intense pressure from US President Donald Trump.
 <br>
  <br>
  The US$22.8 billion sale, which also includes dozens of ports in other countries, appeared to be a win for Trump's aggressive diplomacy just hours before he is due to tout the successes of the first six tumultuous weeks of his second term in an address to the US Congress. Trump had refused to rule out military action to assert US control over the canal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has complained about the presence of mainland Chinese and Hong Kong-based companies in Panama, while US officials and politicians have said CK Hutchison's control of ports at both entrances of the canal represents a security risk for the operation.
  <br>
  <br>
  The sale of licenses will result in the consortium gaining a 90 percent stake in Panama Ports Company, which has been the operator of the Balboa and Cristobal ports in the Central American country for more than two decades, CK Hutchison said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  BlackRock has briefed the White House and Congressional leadership on the deal, a person familiar with the transaction said.
  <br>
  <br>
  This would be BlackRock's largest infrastructure investment to date, that person said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US State Department, White House, National Security Council and Panama's government did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
  <br>
  <br>
  The canal is operated by the Panama Canal Authority, an autonomous agency overseen by the Panamanian government.
  <br>
  <br>
  Panama's authorities have announced an audit of CK Hutchison's contract, saying they are investigating its compliance with concession agreements. Panama's attorney general determined earlier this month that CK Hutchison's port contract was "unconstitutional." The Supreme Court was to have had the last word on its legal status.
  <br>
  <br>
  US Secretary of State Marco Rubio made his first overseas trip as top US diplomat to Latin America last month, including to Panama, where he pressured the country over China's presence along the canal. After his departure, Rubio hailed Panama's decision to exit China's Belt and Road infrastructure plan, and he has expressed optimism in media interviews that Hutchison would not own the ports in the future.
  <br>
  <br>
  The sale of Panama ports licenses held by the unit of billionaire Li Ka-shing's conglomerate to a consortium that includes BlackRock, Global Infrastructure Partners and Terminal Investment will give it control of an 80 percent interest in Hutchison Ports for an equity value of US$14.21 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  It will get control of 43 ports comprising 199 berths in 23 countries while delivering cash proceeds in excess of US$19 billion for the Hong Kong-based consortium.
  <br>
  <br>
  The sale does not involve any interest in Hutchison Port Holdings Trust, which operates ports in Hong Kong and Shenzhen, as well as South China, or any other ports in mainland China, CK Hutchison said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The consortium has agreed that negotiations will be on an exclusive basis for a period of 145 days, the company said.
  <br>
  <br>
  BlackRock completed the acquisition of Global Infrastructure Partners for approximately US$12.5 billion in cash and stock last October. At the time, chairman and CEO Larry Fink described infrastructure as “a generational investment opportunity.” (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 World number one Judd Trump made a winning start in Hong Kong, beating Gary Wilson to advance to the last 16 of the World Snooker Grand Prix at Kai Tak Arena.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump, who recently obtained Hong Kong residency through the Quality Migrant Admission Scheme, was playing on home soil for the first time.
  <br>
  <br>
  But it was fellow Englishman Wilson who started off strong and took the first frame. Trump struck back with a 142 break to level things up, before going on to win the best-of-seven match 4-2.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 35-year-old will next face another Englishman Jack Lisowski.
  <br>
  <br>
  In other first-round action, English stars Shaun Murphy and David Gilbert both secured narrow 4-3 victories to reach the last 16.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism, Rosanna Law, was in attendance and officiated at the opening ceremony.
  <br>
  <br>
  She hoped the ranking tournament will be a huge success and hoped that players and visitors would have an unforgettable experience.
  <br>
  <br>
  This six-day event marks the first official sports competition at the Kai Tak Sports Park, with over 4,200 people attending on the first day.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A Beijing official overseeing Hong Kong and Macau affairs has told delegates to the national legislative body to ride on the stock market boom and boost economic development in the territory.
 <br>
  <br>
  Xia Baolong, the director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, also expressed confidence that the city can "weather the storm" in face of challenges posed by geopolitics.
  <br>
  <br>
  He made the comments on Tuesday during a closed-door exchange with National People's Congress (NPC) delegates from the two SARs.
  <br>
  <br>
  The city's sole delegate to the NPC Standing Committee, Starry Lee, said the central government highly recognised the work of the Hong Kong administration on supporting the economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said the city's economy has been relatively stable, and achieved moderate growth of 2.5 percent last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We all understand that Hong Kong’s economy is relatively stable … especially the stock market, the volume [went up]. All these [were contributed by] the support of the central government," she told reporters after the meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the coming future, we will continue as NPC (members) to act as (contributors) to the economic development, and to improve the livelihood of Hong Kong people."
  <br>
  <br>
  NPC delegate Ma Fung-kwok said the director singled out the city's stock market as an area of focus.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[Xia] did mention the stock market rally in recent months. He said if this trend continues, it will certainly boost Hong Kong's economy," Ma said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked if geopolitics had been part of the conversation, the delegates quoted Xia as saying that some of the pressure faced by the country would "inevitably pass down to Hong Kong", but such challenges could be overcome.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, the office said Xia expressed the hope for the delegates to perform their duties "with a sense of responsibility and mission" and reflect public opinion.
  <br>
  <br>
  The statement went on to say the director told the members to fully support their respective SAR governments.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xia urged Hong Kong delegates to expedite the city's transition from stability to prosperity, and those from Macau to promote moderate economic diversification, the statement added.

<img alt="Woo Chia-wai was credited for setting up the world-class HKUST Business School during his tenure. Photo courtesy: HKUST" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1794219_1_20250304203731.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The founding president of the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) has died last Sunday at the age of 87.
 <br>
  <br>
  Professor Woo Chia-wei led the university between 1991 and 2001.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement on Tuesday, HKUST council chairman Harry Shum said Woo's departure marked an irreplaceable loss to the university, Hong Kong and the global academic community.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Professor Woo was one of the few individuals with both grand visions and strong capability of execution. With unwavering dedication, he led the establishment of HKUST, transforming a bold vision into a world-class institution renowned for its pioneering research, innovation, and global impact, especially during a time when Hong Kong was in a critical juncture of transitioning to a knowledge-based economy,” he said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Current HKUST president, Nancy Ip, who worked alongside Woo for eight years when he was in charge, was also saddened by the news.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A man of extraordinary foresight, Professor Woo envisioned and empowered HKUST as a catalyst for Hong Kong's transformation. He forged a culture of excellence, recruiting distinguished faculty, designing cutting-edge curricula, and fostering partnerships with leading global institutions," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Woo’s son, Wu Dekai, expressed gratitude to the love and support his family has received during a difficult time. Also a professor at HKUST's Department of Computer Science and Engineering, he strived to carry forward his father's innovation, determination and can-do spirit.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other than his role in the university, the elder Woo also held positions in several government committees, and was appointed a member of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference in 1998.
  <br>
  <br>
  The physicist had also earned the Gold Bauhinia Star and Commander of the British Empire.

 The chairman of a leading casino and hospitality group in Macau said on Tuesday that Hong Kong and Macau should work together to attract more foreign investors.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on the sidelines of the Two Sessions in Beijing, Galaxy Entertainment Group chairman Francis Lui said Macau’s leisure industry has been developing steadily in recent years.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said he has full confidence in the industry’s future development, adding that the two SARs can work together to take business to a new level.

  “Hong Kong and Macau, we have a common objective in making sure that there will be more foreign players, customers and investors coming over,” he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I think we should cooperate with each other, making sure that all the hardware, all the services and all the resources behind Hong Kong and Macau could be working together to make sure that we bring in foreign investors.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Lui, a member of the National Committee of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference, said Hong Kong’s economic development is an issue for delegates.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said he hopes the central government will introduce measures during the Two Sessions that will help revitalise the city’s economy.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) outlined efforts to advance Chinese modernisation and refine standards and procedures at the start of the top political advisory body's annual session in Beijing on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Addressing 2,000 or so delegates -- as well as President Xi Jinping and other state leaders -- at the Great Hall of the People, Wang Huning also used his work report to note areas for improvement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We need to improve the CPPCC consultation systems and mechanisms, and the mechanisms for adopting, implementing, and providing feedback on consultation outcomes," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We need to expand the coverage of channels and platforms for bolstering unity and friendship, intensify implementation of measures in consultative oversight, and give full play to the unique role of different sectors. Going forward, we will take solid steps to make improvements in these aspects."
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang also recapped the party's achievements in the past year, saying the main economic and social development targets were accomplished, while major strides were made in the country's modernisation drive.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Hong Kong and Macau, the chairman said a system was implemented to facilitate visits by their delegates, as well as young people from the two SARs.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We continued to arrange inspection tours aimed at deepening exchanges and cooperation between the mainland and Hong Kong and Macau, and supported the organisation of report sessions to update young people in Hong Kong and Macau on national conditions as a form of campus outreach," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Last year, National Committee members held 75 report sessions in the two regions."
  <br>
  <br>
  Wrapping up his half-hour speech, Wang declared the further deepening of reform as both a "formidable task and a glorious mission", and urged everyone to forge ahead with firm confidence and collective strength.

    Octopus to speed up work for changing HK$2 scheme
   </title>

<img alt="Jeny Yeung said Octopus will try to complete its adaptation to the HK$2 scheme adjustment in less than 18 months. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1794167_1_20250304161513.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The firm which operates the Octopus Card on Tuesday said it hopes to shorten the process needed to implement the government's plans to scale back the HK$2 elderly transport subsidy scheme.
 <br>
  <br>
  In the budget last week, the government proposed limiting the HK$2 subsidised trips to 240 a month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elderly passengers would also have to pay 20 percent of future trips that cost more than HK$10.
  <br>
  <br>
  Labour minister Chris Sun said last week it would take around 18 months to adjust each and every Octopus machine to adopt the changes.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a media gathering, Octopus chairwoman Jeny Yeung said it would take time to implement the scheme because different transport operators have different discounts and fare calculation methods.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said it should take the company at least a year to discuss these issues with them to adjust the system, as well as conduct trials.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeung said Octopus would seek to finish the work in less than 18 months.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said the firm wants to introduce a new function in the second half of the year that would allow users who installed the Octopus mobile app to send money to another app user, or an actual card.
  <br>
  <br>
  Such payments would require entering the card details of the other user.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeung added the firm is trying to extend its services to Japan in the third quarter of this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said the idea is that transactions would go through the Octopus mobile app, as the firm is discussing cooperation plans with platforms that have wider coverage in the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the past year or so, the firm extended services to mainland China and Thailand.

    HK govt still in the dark over new US tariffs
   </title>

<img alt="" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1794132_1_20250304123411.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Commerce Secretary Algernon Yau on Tuesday said the SAR government still doesn't know whether new US tariffs on Chinese goods will also cover Hong Kong products, but in any case transit trade could be hit in the short term.
 <br>
  <br>
  An additional 10 percent duty on Chinese exports to the US is expected to come into force on Tuesday, following the extra 10 percent imposed by US President Donald Trump last month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Washington earlier clarified that the first tariffs move did apply to Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  On an RTHK radio programme, Yau reiterated the government's opposition to Trump's decision.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In fact, Hong Kong is a separate customs territory and the executive order is said to add duties on Chinese goods. But previous documents from the US Department of Homeland Security and the Customs and Border Protection have included Hong Kong goods as well. We have already announced that we'll file a complaint with the World Trade Organisation," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This time the US added another 10 percent levy on Chinese products. But it's very unclear; they did not say whether Hong Kong was included in the new tariffs. So we are studying whether they included Hong Kong this time."
  <br>
  <br>
  Yau said transit trade could be affected, but the tariffs won't have a significant impact as Hong Kong's exports to the US account for less than 0.1 percent of the city's overall exports globally.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, the commerce chief said there have been significant improvements in the city's trade of liquor, after tax on some spirits was reduced last October.
  <br>
  <br>
  The duty on liquor with an alcohol content above 30 percent and with an import price of over HK$200 was cut from 100 percent to 10 percent for the portion above HK$200.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yau said trading volumes of liquor increased by 60 percent from October to the end of January, while the value of the liquor traded rose by 150 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The momentum has been quite good in recent months. The reason we reduced the duties on premium liquor was that we wanted to develop Hong Kong into a trading centre for premium liquor. This would then have a knock-on effect to the catering, hospitality, logistics, and warehouse sectors, it could bring significant economic impacts," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We also hope to help Chinese baijiu to go global using the SAR as a trading centre. So we hope to boost trades on liquor, but not that we are encouraging people to consume more alcohol," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the minister encouraged SAR businesses to tap into opportunities brought by the rising e-commerce trend globally, noting that the sector accounts for some 20 percent of global trade, with revenues in this market rising by double digits on a yearly basis.
  <br>
  <br>
  A second edition of the "Hong Kong Shopping Festival" will be held in the SAR in August to further capture the booming e-commerce business, Yau said, adding that authorities also hope to take the festival to Asean member states to promote Hong Kong products.

    Facial recognition mulled after alleged Kai Tak breach

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Facial recognition technology could be deployed at Kai Tak Sports Park and other venues to stop people sneaking in without permission, Culture, Sports and Tourism Secretary Rosanna Law said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Her comment follows a report by Wen Wei Po on Monday that two reporters managed to attend the park's opening ceremony last weekend despite not having tickets. The newspaper said the pair, and a man that helped them get inside, also managed to avoid security checks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Law said police are investigating the alleged breach, but such a lapse wouldn't demonstrate any "large-scale loophole" in security measures.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said there might be a need to use technology to stop people such as backstage staff from getting non-ticket holders into venues.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The authorities need to check whether the person entering a place is the actual pass-holder. Say if you own the pass but you gave it to me, I shouldn't be allowed in," the minister said on an RTHK programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Whether we can adopt real-name registration here, or, as some people suggested, use facial recognition, we can discuss these things with event organisers."
  <br>
  <br>
  Law also said officials are hoping to bring non-local football teams to play at the sports park in the summer.
  <br>
  <br>
  She added that the staging of the National Games in Hong Kong, Guangdong and Macau this November will provide a litmus test regarding the possibility of the region holding other major tournaments in the future.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If we host the Games well, that would prove that the Greater Bay Area city cluster is very much capable of hosting major sporting tournaments. Would this be the Olympics, or, I've also heard others say, perhaps the Asian Games?" she said.

    'No major policy shifts at Two Sessions expected'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A local economics academic said he does not expect major policy shifts in the "Two Sessions" meetings in Beijing, saying it's important for the central government to focus on stabilising sentiment and continuing with high-quality growth.
 <br>
  <br>
  Delegates from the SAR and around the country are in Beijing for the opening of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference on Tuesday and the National People's Congress a day later, during which Beijing will announce its economic growth target for 2025.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho Lok-sang, an adjunct research professor from Lingnan University, said he expects mainland authorities to set a target of five percent, similar to last year's.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm pretty sure that the most likely target would be five percent, which is in my mind certainly within reach," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho highlighted the need for the world's second-largest economy to pursue high-quality growth.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's possible for China to achieve five percent, but there's no need to raise the target to suggest that they're very keen in pushing up economic growth. Five percent, I think, is a target that will produce the effect of giving confidence, and at the same time showing continuity."
  <br>
  <br>
  The academic believes under President Xi Jinping's leadership, the priorities this year include spurring domestic spending, boosting confidence and attracting more foreign investment.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's important to stimulate consumption. Internal consumption is something that's within the government's control, but external factors are difficult to tell... Continuing to open up is a main responsibility that President Xi has considered to be a priority, continuing to give the impression that we are really opening up, and all countries from Europe, North America, anywhere, are welcome to China."
  <br>
  <br>
  This year marks the end of the 14th Five-Year Plan, and authorities are now drawing up blueprints for the period between 2026 and 2030.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We do not expect any surprises and I think it's important for China – at this time – not to produce any surprises, because there had been some significant policy movement, initiatives in the past, and that had rocked market sentiments," Ho said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also said improving governance is another key focus at this year's "Two Sessions".
  <br>
  <br>
  "Improving governance has been on the agenda for quite some time, and improving governance is a way to boost people's confidence in the leadership.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Improving governance through introducing new laws can enhance people's confidence in the policies.
  <br>
  <br>
  "No one likes policies that come out of the blue, right? But if you improve governance, you're securing an atmosphere that is guaranteed by the legal framework."

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong delegates to the nation's top political advisory body who met with senior mainland official Xia Baolong in Beijing on Monday evening quoted him as saying the city should unite in supporting Chief Executive John Lee's administration.
 <br>
  <br>
  Xia, who heads the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, held talks with Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) delegates from the two SARs, a day before the opening of this year's CPPCC meetings.
  <br>
  <br>
  Delegates said during the 70-minute meeting with Xia, he highly praised the achievements of the two SARs in the past year.
  <br>
  <br>
  A local CPPCC member, Ho Hon-kuen, said Xia stressed that Hong Kong should work together as a whole.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Talking about the upcoming Legislative Council election, he said the current members have done a good job, but he hopes the next term can be even better,” Ho said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “He also said Hong Kong should unite and support the work of the chief executive. He said under the current economic and political situation, we should be confident in ourselves.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho also quoted Xia as saying that Hong Kong has the advantage of the One Country, Two Systems principle, and the central government and Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office fully support the SAR's development.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another local CPPCC member, Junius Ho, said they had discussions about the global political and economic situation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Junius Ho also mentioned Hong Kong's current situation.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The stability and prosperity that we are now enjoying do not come easy. We need to treasure them. We need to make it a sustainable growth. We need to maintain it. I think this requires concerted efforts, and we are all committed to do that,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The third session of the 14th CPPCC National Committee begins on Tuesday.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Sunbeam Theatre – the North Point venue best known for its Cantonese opera performances – put on its last show on Monday night, bidding farewell to fans and opera lovers after more than half a century.
 <br>
  <br>
  Dozens of people were already there ahead of the final show at 7.30pm, in what would be another full house.
  <br>
  <br>
  Harry Au Yeung brought along his son, 4, for a final look at the theatre that opened back in 1972.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think it's a great memory for many people," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I have never watched any Chinese opera before. But I think it is very valuable for most of the Hong Kong people, especially for the (older) generations. I hope the traditional Chinese opera can be extended to the future."
  <br>
  <br>
  Andrew To, a Malaysian who has been living in the SAR for over 20 years, was at Sunbeam Theatre for the second night in a row.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Today I'm not taking photo, but I'm just here to walk around, to see the people around, what they are doing, how they're saying farewells... Just soaking in the moment before it's gone forever," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Veteran actress Lana Wong, 94, performed at Sunbeam many times in the past. On this night, she came to watch the final show and say farewell.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Sunbeam is like my family, it's like my family being torn apart today. I am very, very sad," Wong said.
  <br>
  <br>
  But she said she doesn't believe the closure would affect the development of Cantonese opera, adding performances can still be staged in many other venues.
  <br>
  <br>
  A woman surnamed Chan also came for Sunbeam's last show, about the late paramount leader Deng Xiaoping played by award-winning opera performer Loong Koon-tin.
  <br>
  <br>
  Unlike Wong, she believes the end of the North Point landmark could have a negative impact on Cantonese opera because a lot of performances started off at Sunbeam.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan, who lives in Tseung Kwan O, also said while fans can still enjoy performances at locations such as the Xiqu Centre in West Kowloon, Sunbeam is more convenient because it's closer to her and can be easily reached by the MTR.
  <br>
  <br>
  A church will take over the location after Sunbeam ceases operation.

    'Hundreds of species at risk of local extinction'

<img alt="WWF-Hong Kong says it hopes to discuss its findings with government officials. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1794010_1_20250303173647.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Conservation groups are warning that around a quarter of almost 900 different species assessed in Hong Kong are at risk of local extinction, with types of birds and freshwater fish among the most in danger of disappearing from the territory.
 <br>
  <br>
  The findings were released on Monday in the 'The state of Hong Kong biodiversity' report by WWF-Hong Kong, in association with the Hong Kong Bird Watching Society, Kadoorie Farm and Botanic Garden, Outdoor Wildlife Learning Hong Kong and local researchers.
  <br>
  <br>
  The assessments covered mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, fish, butterflies, dragonflies and freshwater crustaceans. Of the 886 species researchers checked, 232 were deemed to be on the brink of local extinction while 21 were confirmed to be extinct.
  <br>
  <br>
  Examples of species under threat include the Oriental magpie which is at high risk of disappearing locally, and the crested bunting which has lost its breeding population here. The Chinese floating frog, meanwhile, is already gone from the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With nearly half of the native freshwater fish species at risk of local extinction, threats such as channelisation and water pollution, and the invasion of non-native species must be tackled," said Dr Alphonse Tsang, Research Assistant Professor at Lingnan University.
  <br>
  <br>
  The report is accompanied by the 'Hong Kong Terrestrial Biodiversity Hotspot Map 2025' which highlights what are described as 27 critical biodiversity sites outside the protected-area system.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nearly 80 percent of the hotspots are said to have suffered from eco-vandalism, while almost half are threatened by development.
  <br>
  <br>
  The report includes more than two dozen recommendations for the authorities, including the establishment of special task forces to combat poaching and a review of plans to build on ecologically important habits.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are going to share this report to all the relevant government bureaus and departments, and we would request to have a kind of sit-down and share our thoughts with the relevant departments," said Dr Bosco Chan, director of conservation at WWF-Hong Kong.

    HK's retail sales drop 3.2 percent in January

<img alt="Hong Kong's retail sales dropped for the 11th consecutive month. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1794002_1_20250303165314.jpg&q=85">

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's retail sales dropped 3.2 percent in January year-on-year, marking the 11th consecutive month of declines.
 <br>
  <br>
  According to official data released by the Census and Statistics Department on Monday, the value of total retail sales in January was estimated at HK$35.3 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  January's drop was narrower than the revised 9.6 percent decline recorded in December last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sales of motor vehicles and parts saw the sharpest decline at 52.6 percent, while those of furniture and fixtures saw a 26.4 percent fall.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, a department spokesman said looking at both January and February data would give a better picture of the city's retail performance during the Lunar New Year period.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Looking ahead, the near-term performance of the retail sector would continue to be affected by the change in consumption patterns of visitors and residents," the department statement read.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bond Law, executive director of the Retail Management Association, said he expects a sluggish year for the sector.
  <br>
  <br>
  "By April, we anticipate that the drop may narrow or level off with slight increases during certain holidays. Overall, we expect a flat year with fluctuations of no more than 2 percent," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Law said purchasing power and consumer sentiment remained weak despite an increase in mainland travellers.
