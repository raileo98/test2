<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism Rosanna Law on Friday said a recording of the opening ceremony for Kai Tak Sports Park will be aired after editing in order to provide the best viewer experience.
 <br>
  <br>
  The opening show will be held at 6.30pm on March 1. It will be shown by four TV channels at 9.30pm.
  <br>
  <br>
  On an RTHK radio programme, Law stressed that the arrangement is not due to technical constraints, but is to coordinate the transition between different scenes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We hope to air the programme in one go, so viewers can enjoy a packed programme. After having many considerations, we think going for post-production is better," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked about claims that post-production demonstrates a lack of professionalism, the minister said there are many ways to show how magnificent and beautiful the sports park is.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have a strong performance line-up, and they have various collaborations and crossovers," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Law added that apart from the line-up already announced, including Hong Kong singers Joey Yung and MC Cheung, and fencing star Vivian Kong, special guests may also feature in the ceremony.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A four-day conference aimed at promoting the importance of sports law and arbitration is currently underway in Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  Organised by the Law Society, the symposium – called the 2025 Sports Law Mega Event – explores the connection between sports, law, and business.
  <br>
  <br>
  Starting from Thursday and lasting until Sunday, a number of activities will be held with the goal of facilitating exchange between lawyers and visiting guests.
  <br>
  <br>
  “This conference is all about how sports law can create opportunities for Hong Kong’s legal and sports industries,” the president of the Law Society, Roden Tong, told
  <a href="https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/news-programmes/this-episode.htm?cmsid=77" target="_blank">
   RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme
  </a>
  on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  He explained that the conference will cover a number of areas, including broadcasting rights.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We even have e-sports specialists actually in one of the sessions,” he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Deputy Secretary for Justice Horace Cheung had revealed earlier this month that the pilot scheme for sports dispute resolution will be rolled out in the latter half of this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The idea was first unveiled in the Policy Address last year with the aim of promoting sports arbitration, which Tong said is currently not a common method of solving disputes.
  <br>
  <br>
  “What we see now is the global sports market is in fact booming, and with [this], there are more disputes, whether it’s about contracts, governance issues or competition-related matters,” Tong said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We believe that a robust and efficient dispute resolution system is essential, particularly in sports.”

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Democratic Party on Thursday evening announced its intention to disband following a central committee meeting to discuss its future.
 <br>
  <br>
  But party chairman Lo Kin-hei said a general meeting would be held at a later date and the disbandment would only move ahead if 75 percent of attending members approved.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It is a decision that we make based on our understanding of the current political situation and things like that,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lo also said he would chair a three-person working group to handle the initial preparations for the party's shutdown.

    'Wrong vaccines did not harm two affected kids'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Department of Health has apologised for mistakenly giving pneumococcal vaccines to two children who were supposed to get hepatitis B vaccinations at the Tin Shui Wai Maternal and Child Health Centre.
 <br>
  <br>
  The department said there was no adverse reaction in the affected kids and paediatricians have assessed that the wrong vaccines do not pose any health risks to them.
  <br>
  <br>
  Seven children, between one and seven months old, were scheduled to receive hepatitis B vaccines between 4pm and 5.30pm on Monday, the department said.
  <br>
  <br>
  But a routine check of vaccination records later that day found that two fewer doses of hepatitis B vaccine had been used and two extra doses of pneumococcal vaccine had been used.
  <br>
  <br>
  The department said while investigations are ongoing it is believed the incident was due to human error, noting it had instructed the health centre to step up efforts in the training of frontline staff.
  <br>
  <br>
  It added that the nursing staff involved had been suspended from vaccination duties and disciplinary action would be taken if the probe confirms any misconduct.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The average daily number of people in remand reached its highest in more than two decades while the number of new admissions to correctional institutions last year also rose, prison authorities said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  New prison admissions overall stood at 18,438 last year, up seven percent from the figure in 2023, according to the Correctional Services Department.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 3,600 people were remanded in custody on average per day over the past year – the highest figure since 2000.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In response to the ever-changing penal population, especially the increasing population of those in remand, the department has deployed part of the capacity of certain correctional institutions to admit those in remand, to alleviate the overcrowding situation of reception centres," said commissioner Wong Kwok-hing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Delivering an annual round-up of the department's work, Wong also said authorities decided against introducing legal amendments to prevent people placed under supervision from leaving Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  The idea was previously floated after former student activist Tony Chung allegedly violated his supervision order and went to Britain to seek political asylum.
  <br>
  <br>
  "After discussing with the Department of Justice, we found that under current laws, we actually have enough power to impose some new supervisory conditions," Wong said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So since last year, we have implemented some arrangements for all those under supervision on applying to leave Hong Kong. They must apply to our supervisors before leaving Hong Kong, and they can only leave when we give approval."
  <br>
  <br>
  Fifteen cases had been approved so far under the new rule, Wong added.

    8,500 tickets on offer for Kai Tak Sports Park opening

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government announced on Thursday that 8,500 tickets would be up for grabs for the opening ceremony of the Kai Tak Sports Park on March 1.
 <br>
  <br>
  Tickets will be available starting at 10am on Friday through Urbtix on a first-come, first-served basis, and they will cost HK$10 each.
  <br>
  <br>
  The figure is among the total number of 33,600 seats available for the event, with the government and park operator each responsible for the distribution of 16,800 tickets.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 8,000 tickets will be distributed for free to underprivileged families, charities and other district organisations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism Rosanna Law said while the show that starts at 6.30pm would not be broadcast live, the ceremony would be aired later in the evening by four TV channels at 9.30pm.
  <br>
  <br>
  She pointed out that overseas viewers could also enjoy the broadcast.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For overseas viewers, I think they also can [watch] through the apps or through the channels of our different free TV channels... watch it together with the Hong Kong audience at 9.30pm at home in their countries or in their areas," Law said.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said although the park is able to live stream the event, the government decided not to do that because the broadcast version would be able to showcase the park’s facilities better.
  <br>
  <br>
  Singers, celebrities and athletes from Hong Kong and the mainland were among those slated to perform at the ceremony.
  <br>
  <br>
  Law did not reveal how much the ceremony cost, but she said the government would spend its budget wisely.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I have to give special thanks to all the participating artists and also athletes and performers, most of them actually do not require us to provide a special remuneration, aside from the minimum, for example the makeup or hair-do.”

<div class="itemFullText">
 MTR bosses on Thursday unveiled a new "light rail sightseeing route" to take visitors on a tour of the delights of Tuen Mun.
 <br>
  <br>
  From February 22, six "Tuen Mun Voyager" trains will run in a circular route on weekends and public holidays. The journey will last about one hour and 15 minutes, although passengers can hop on and off at any of the 12 stops covered.
  <br>
  <br>
  A travel ambassador will be on board to tell passengers about the sights they can see.
  <br>
  <br>
  The railway company said it has come up with three different itineraries, one for food lovers, another for photography enthusiasts, and a third especially attractive to families.
  <br>
  <br>
  One highlight is Tuen Mun Ferry Pier, where the movie “Beyond the Dream” was filmed, while another is the seafood market near the Sam Shing stop.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jeny Yeung, MTR’s Managing Director for Hong Kong Transport Services, said she hopes the new route will attract people to visit the district as part of the "tourism everywhere" concept.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Tuen Mun is a charming place that not many Hong Kong people know. There are many beautiful landmarks, historical buildings and scenery,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Through this sightseeing route, we hope to draw in locals and tourists to come to Tuen Mun and discover the gems here.”
  <br>
  <br>
  A one-day travel pass costs HK$50 and comes with HK$150 worth of vouchers.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong official who heads an office coordinating the upcoming National Games, Yeung Tak-keung, said he expects around 1,000 spectators to attend a handball tournament serving as a test event for the Games this weekend.
 <br>
  <br>
  The two-day event will take place at the Kai Tak Arena, and comes before the SAR hosts the nationwide sporting tournament with Guangdong and Macau for the first time this autumn.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeung, who's the former sports commissioner, said on Thursday that workers at the Sports Park are ready after a series of trials in recent months.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said officials were making final adjustments for the tournament this weekend, such as making sure the changing rooms are fine as well as the lighting for the court.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Because for handball, sometimes players need to lob the ball high when they go on a fast break. That means they will look up, so we have to adjust the angle of the lights, and how bright they are," Yeung told RTHK in an interview.
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted the Hong Kong Rugby Sevens in late March would also be a test event for the National Games.
  <br>
  <br>
  But while it is the first time the mega event would take place at Kai Tak, Yeung doesn't expect much of a problem because the SAR has a wealth of experience in hosting it.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added the test event for beach volleyball would be held around Easter on the football pitches at Victoria Park, and stalls would be set up nearby to promote Hong Kong culture to spectators.
  <br>
  <br>
  But before that, Yeung said officials want to bring something different for the two-day triathlon trial races starting from March 1.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the past, such events would take place along the harbourfront. But this time, besides having the cycling and running there, a segment of the track will be inside the space for events at the Central Harbourfront," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There will also be stands for the spectators, and other areas for them, so they can be more comfortable, and get a close-up view of the athletes."
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeung said officials would also put up a giant screen in Central for a better viewing experience.

    Hospital doctors to use AI for medical reports

<div class="itemFullText">
 Public hospital doctors will start using generative AI to help them draft medical reports from next month.
 <br>
  <br>
  The technology will be used to summarise a patient's clinical data, including lab results, the Hospital Authority said on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The authority's chief executive, Tony Ko, said the introduction of AI is to save doctors time when preparing their reports.
  <br>
  <br>
  “All the reports have to be finally checked and authorised by the doctor himself, so the doctors will be responsible for the accuracy of the report that truly reflects his or her decision in terms of what the content is to be included in the report,” Ko said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The authority said it will first test the system at Caritas Medical Centre, Princess Margaret Hospital, Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Tin Shui Wai Hospital, Tseung Kwan O Hospital and United Christian Hospital.
  <br>
  <br>
  The authority also said that patients will soon be able to get copies of their medical reports via its HA Go app.

    Officials urged to let vacant public flats quicker

<div class="itemFullText">
 The city's Ombudsman has urged housing authorities to speed up the turnover of recovered public rental flats, such as by shortening the period between taking back a home and issuing a refurbishment order.
 <br>
  <br>
  A probe by the watchdog revealed that it normally took around two and a half months for a home taken back by the Housing Department to be ready for its next tenants to move in, and nearly three months when the Housing Society carries out the process.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The procedures for the recovery of flats by the Housing Department and the Housing Society, and their arrangements for refurbishment and reallocation of recovered flats need further revamping, to speed up turnover of public housing flats and ensure optimal utilisation of precious public housing resources," Ombudsman Jack Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the past five years, the Housing Department has recovered 15,700 public housing flats annually on average. The Housing Society, meanwhile, took back around 1,100 units each year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities have taken steps to expedite the refurbishment of recovered flats since the watchdog launched an investigation last year, Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted that the Housing Department would issue a refurbishment works order within three days of a public housing tenant moving out, while the Housing Society set the period to within two weeks.
  <br>
  <br>
  The watchdog said in its report that the two-week period "might raise doubts among members of the public as to whether it is reasonable".
  <br>
  <br>
  "[The Housing Society] could bring forward the time for notifying the contractors to start work in the estate," Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the Housing Department over the past five years managed to refurbish each recovered flat in 43 days, which is in line with its target.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ninety percent of renovations of homes recovered by the Housing Society met the completion target of 60 days, but Chan said the body should carry out a "comprehensive review" to cut down the refurbishment period.
  <br>
  <br>
  In response, the Housing Department pledged to review and study the recommendations in detail to allocate public housing flats to those in need as soon as possible.
  <br>
  <br>
  The department also noted that it has previously looked into introducing measures such as making sure public housing applicants can move in once the refurbishment of their new home is completed.

    Legco gives green light to lower Tai Lam Tunnel tolls

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lawmakers on Thursday approved plans for lower toll fees at the Tai Lam Tunnel when it comes under government control at the end of May.
 <br>
  <br>
  Instead of the present fixed toll of HK$58, private vehicles will be charged HK$45 during peak hours, HK$30 during regular periods, and HK$18 at quiet times.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tolls for commercial vehicles such as trucks and buses will fall from as high as HK$79 to HK$43 at any time of day, while taxis will be charged HK$28 – less than half the current HK$58 fee.
  <br>
  <br>
  Roundtable lawmaker Michael Tien had proposed making the tunnel free for private cars, motorbikes and commercial vehicles during non-peak hours, but this was rejected by the council, with concerns raised about lost revenue.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tunnel, which stretches between Ting Kau and Yuen Long, is currently owned by a subsidiary of Sun Hung Kai Properties. Its 30-year franchise began in 1995.

    Taxi, ride-hailing rivalry to intensify: expert

<img alt="Timothy Hau from the University of Hong Kong's Business School says there are more players entering the ride-hailing market. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1792395_1_20250220085201.jpg&q=40">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A transport expert on Thursday said competition between the taxi industry and other ride-hailing services will heat up, after cabbies called off a five-day strike to give authorities more time to carry out enforcement action.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong Tele-call Taxi Association had earlier threatened five days of industrial action from March 5, saying their business was seriously hurt by their unlicensed rivals.
  <br>
  <br>
  The association's chairman, Wong Yu-ting, apologised after a meeting with transport officials for causing "unease" to the public.
  <br>
  <br>
  Professor Timothy Hau from the University of Hong Kong's Business School told
  <a href="https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/news-programmes/this-episode.htm?cmsid=77" target="_blank">
   RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme
  </a>
  that the taxi drivers' “extreme" and "counterproductive” measures had angered the public.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[These measures] just make people madder and upset with them and dissatisfied with their services, which I must say is really getting increasingly worse."
  <br>
  <br>
  Hau noted that there are more players entering the ride-hailing market.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With Gaode entering the picture, and Tada more recently, we have a situation in which the government announced that within a year, they're going to regulate ride-hailing services...and so during this period, a lot of companies will come in and get their foot in the door,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “They would want to ensure that they have a place once all the regulatory policies are issued…It’s going to be a fairly crowded market,” Hau added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The taxi industry has said the government would submit a legislative proposal within this year to regulate ride hailing platforms.
  <br>
  <br>
  They also expressed the hope that authorities would require ride-hailing service providers to attend professional training beforehand, and have their vehicles undergo inspections annually.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Wednesday said they intercepted eight private cars in a citywide undercover operation targeting illegal ride-hailing services.
 <br>
  <br>
  The eight drivers, aged between 36 and 63, were suspected of using their cars for illegal hire or reward.
  <br>
  <br>
  Three vehicles were seized for further investigation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Police will continue to deploy manpower based on operational priorities to combat illegal vehicle hire or reward activities," said Cheng Ho-ming, a senior inspector with the force.
  <br>
  <br>
  The officer did not reveal whether the eight drivers were arrested, and which ride-hailing platforms were involved.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A Beijing commerce official on Wednesday pledged further support for Hong Kong under the Mainland and Hong Kong Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement (CEPA), the city's free-trade deal with the mainland.
 <br>
  <br>
  Fan Shijie, the director-general of the Commerce Ministry's Department of Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau Affairs, told a forum that the central government is committed to backing the city's economic development.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will, under the CEPA framework, continue to promote opening up and cooperation with Hong Kong, and support Hong Kong to better integrate into national development," Fan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will support different departments in implementing preferential measures under CEPA, and will continue to strengthen opening up and cooperation under the agreement to support investors in Hong Kong and around the world to enter the mainland via Hong Kong."
  <br>
  <br>
  An agreement signed last year between the two sides to amend the framework on trade in services under CEPA will come into effect next month. Changes include removing or loosening restrictions on equity shareholding and business scope across the border.
  <br>
  <br>
  Maggie Wong, Hong Kong's permanent secretary for commerce and economic development, said the changes are beneficial to sectors such as financial services, telecommunications, and tourism.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The SAR government will make the trade make good use of a number of preferential measures, and will continue to seek to jointly promote a higher level of opening up and closer economic and trade cooperation with the mainland on the basis of CEPA, so as to maximise the space of development for the trade on the mainland," Wong said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The administration must take measures to defend free trade amid challenges posed by unilateralism and protectionism, the official added.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Polytechnic University of Hong Kong (PolyU) is willing to stand with the government amid potential funding cuts, the institution's council head said on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Education officials earlier said the University Grants Committee will adjust funding for the territory’s eight universities due to a significant government deficit.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lam Tai-fai, chairman of PolyU’s council, told a media gathering that such cuts would definitely affect the university, and the institution is looking at ways to reduce expenditure.
  <br>
  <br>
  That said, he stressed the university will continue to push ahead with its development plans and recruitment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, PolyU's president, Jin-Guang Teng, said the university is working on a proposal to set up Hong Kong's third medical school.
  <br>
  <br>
  The university has many years of experience in offering medical-related courses with hundreds and thousands of graduates, Teng said, adding that he believes PolyU has what it takes to establish a medical school.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Wednesday proposed amendments to the Trade Unions Ordinance to improve the regulatory regime and better safeguard national security.
 <br>
  <br>
  Under the changes, the Registrar of Trade Unions could reject new registrations or amalgamations on national security grounds, with no appeal allowed.
  <br>
  <br>
  People convicted of national security offences would be barred from becoming trade union officers or promoters, and unions would be banned from joining any external political organisations.
  <br>
  <br>
  In order to join a non-political group outside the SAR, trade unions would have to obtain approval from the chief executive.
  <br>
  <br>
  Unions would also have to apply to the registrar before receiving any external funds, and any approved funds could not be used for local elections.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government also said the amendments protect employees' right and freedom to form and join trade unions in accordance with the Basic Law, the Bill of Rights Ordinance and relevant international conventions.
  <br>
  <br>
  “[The amendments] definitely won’t hinder the development of trade unions. They will even promote a healthier development of Hong Kong's trade unions,” said Deputy Commissioner for Labour Raymond Ho.
  <br>
  <br>
  The amendments are to be tabled to the Legislative Council in April.

    Man to be charged over suspicious SMS messages

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Wednesday said that a man had been arrested on suspicion of scamming people by sending phishing text messages that start with a hashtag.
 <br>
  <br>
  A little more than a year ago, authorities introduced a scheme under which registered firms and organisations can send messages that start with the symbol, in a bid to combat scams.
  <br>
  <br>
  The force said officers received around 30 reports in the past week about suspected fraud messages with the hashtag.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officers then arrested the suspect, 23, on Monday, and plan to lay charges against him.
  <br>
  <br>
  "After careful planning, officers arrested the man in Mong Kok on suspicion of conspiracy to defraud," said senior inspector Wan Chun-hong from the police's Cyber Security and Technology Crime Bureau.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The suspect was inside a van, and police seized two mobile phones and a radio jammer that was in operation."
  <br>
  <br>
  Wan said at a police briefing that one victim claimed to have lost around HK$22,000 after clicking a hyperlink from a suspicious text message and giving out credit card information.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Office of the Communications Authority said they found that some of the recent suspicious hashtag messages were not sent out by local telecommunication firms.
  <br>
  <br>
  Principal regulatory affairs manager Andrew Lo said people should be extra careful when they see their phone signal dip suddenly from maximum coverage to 2G, as messages they receive during that period could be from people using illicit radio jammers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The jammers would pretend to be a 2G base station, because under this standard, mobile phones generally won't authenticate the 2G station," he said at the same briefing.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So it's possible to deceive these phones, connect to their network and send fraudulent messages to them."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lo added that extra caution is also needed when the messages involve strange hyperlinks, or that they ask for money.

    Car-hailing services, taxis can coexist: Uber

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ride-sharing operators and the taxi trade can coexist under a "balanced and sustainable" framework on regulating car-hailing services, Uber's boss in Hong Kong said on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Estyn Chung, Uber Hong Kong’s general manager, also said he's hopeful for further exchanges with the government and the taxi industry.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We believe that a balanced and sustainable regulatory framework will allow taxis and ride-sharing to co-exist for the benefit of all Hongkongers, for Hongkongers to have more choice when it comes to point-to-point transportation," Chung said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We believe it's really important to protect the flexibility and earnings opportunity of drivers, and also to protect the safety and service quality for all Hongkongers."
  <br>
  <br>
  Representatives from Uber attended an afternoon meeting with government officials to share their views on regulating ride-hailing platforms in the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier, taxi industry representatives held talks with transport authorities before deciding to call off a planned strike to push for a crackdown on illegal ride-hailing services in the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government is seeking to introduce a regulatory framework to the Legislative Council on ride-sharing platforms, with authorities stressing illegal services would not be tolerated.

    Taxi trade calls off strike, apologises to public

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The taxi industry has called off a strike next month to push for a crackdown on illegal ride-hailing services, after meeting with transport officials on Wednesday morning.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong Tele-call Taxi Association had earlier threatened five days of industrial action from March 5, saying their business was seriously hurt by their unlicensed rivals.
  <br>
  <br>
  The association's chairman, Wong Yu-ting, apologised after the meeting for causing "unease" to the public.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added authorities should be given time to take enforcement action, so a strike was no longer necessary.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Wong maintained the government should take action against ride-hailing service providers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The number of arrestees (ride-hailing drivers) is actually not the top priority. Most importantly, they should take immediate action to prosecute the drivers, so as to deter others from doing so," Wong told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ryan Wong, chairman of the Hong Kong Taxi Council, described the meeting as positive and constructive.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the government would submit a legislative proposal within this year to regulate ride hailing platforms.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The ride-hailing platforms must ensure all the vehicles hailed from their platforms must have legal licence," Wong said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also hoped the government would require ride-hailing service providers to attend professional training beforehand, and have their vehicles undergo inspections annually.
  <br>
  <br>
  Transport Commissioner Angela Lee said the government was looking at next steps.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The government is now studying with the Department of Justice on fine-tuning existing laws to optimise the enforcement process," she added.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government has reappointed Peter Lam as the chairman of the Hong Kong Tourism Board (HKTB) for a three-year term.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lam, who succeeds Pang Yiu-kai, will begin his term on April 1.
  <br>
  <br>
  The businessman also served as the board's chairman between 2013 and 2019, before passing the reins to Pang.
  <br>
  <br>
  Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism Rosanna Law said in a statement that Lam's diverse experience in business management and public services makes him the best candidate for the role.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I am confident that under Dr Lam's leadership, the board will advance further while promoting Hong Kong worldwide and showcasing its charms, so that visitors will indulge in pleasure when staying in Hong Kong, thinking about Hong Kong, and returning time and again," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lam also currently serves as the chairman of the Hong Kong Trade Development Council, a position that will soon be handed over to former commerce chief Frederick Ma.
  <br>
  <br>
  Law expressed gratitude to Pang for his leadership in navigating the numerous challenges posed by the Covid pandemic and for spearheading the recovery of Hong Kong's tourism industry.
  <br>
  <br>
  The HKTB added that under Pang's leadership, Hong Kong welcomed nearly 45 million visitors in 2024, solidifying its status as a premier destination for meetings, incentives, conferences and exhibitions tourism, cruises and overall tourism, while serving as a crucial gateway for the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Greater Bay Area.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pang said it has been a privilege to serve the community over the past six years.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I am very grateful to the government, the travel trade, my fellow HKTB members and the team for the support they have given me throughout the years," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I will continue to work closely with HKTB team to promote ‘Hong Kong Super March’ and fully support the work of HKTB going forward. I wish HKTB and Dr Lam every success.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The government has also appointed Jeffrey Lam, Nikki Ng and Melissa Pang as new members of the board.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The government has appointed former commerce chief Frederick Ma as the new chairman of the Hong Kong Trade Development Council, succeeding Peter Lam.
 <br>
  <br>
  Ma's two-year term will run from June 1, 2025 to May 31, 2027.
  <br>
  <br>
  Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development Algernon Yau said in a statement that Ma’s extensive experience in public service and the commercial sector makes him well-suited for the role.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I am confident that he will lead the HKTDC to make every effort in assisting enterprises to embrace the challenges arising from the ever changing global trading landscape and actively tap new markets and business opportunities, with a view to further promoting Hong Kong's development as an international trade centre," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yau also thanked Lam for his contributions during his tenure.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Under his chairmanship, the HKTDC has successfully promoted Hong Kong as a two way global investment and business hub and assisted Hong Kong companies in further exploring the business opportunities in the mainland and overseas brought by the nation's dual circulation strategy, with outstanding achievements particularly in promoting Hong Kong in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Greater Bay Area and emerging markets under the Belt and Road Initiative," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ma currently serves as the non-executive chairman of the FWD Group and is a member of the Chief Executive’s Council of Advisers.

    'Ne Zha 2' to hit HK cinemas on Saturday

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Record-breaking blockbuster "Ne Zha 2" is set for general release in Hong Kong on Saturday, as it dethroned Disney's "Inside Out 2" and became the highest grossing animated film of all time -- based on domestic ticketing data.
 <br>
  <br>
  It premiered in the city on Tuesday night, after it garnered significant attention in the SAR over the past month, which saw the animated movie break records for the number of distributors and daily screenings for a mainland film in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are honoured to bring this world-class phenomenon-level animation to Hong Kong and Macau, allowing viewers to experience the charm of Ne Zha in the theatres," said a representative of Emperor Motion Pictures, which is a co-distributor of the film.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, some local fans went to Shenzhen to see the animation, ahead of its SAR release.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I've seen online comments about the animated film, saying it is a good and touching movie with an excellent storyline that's enlightening for viewers," said a Hongkonger who viewed the movie across the border.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I specifically watched the first movie in Hong Kong and came today to watch its sequel here in Shenzhen, as it hasn't been screened in Hong Kong. I want to see what makes this animation so successful in attracting many adults and to learn about the latest development of Chinese animation."
  <br>
  <br>
  A sequel to the 2019 hit "Ne Zha 1", "Ne Zha 2" has already packed out cinemas in China, where it claimed the title of the nation's biggest box-office hit since its release last month.
  <br>
  <br>
  State media, citing ticketing platform, Maoyan, said on Tuesday the fantasy epic had raked in over 12.32 billion yuan (US$1.72 billion), which surpassed "Inside Out 2" that took US$1.7 billion following its release last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Ne Zha 2" tells the tale of a rebellious young deity who uses his powers to battle formidable foes after his village is destroyed.
  <br>
  <br>
  The film was released overseas this month, sparking hopes that it would garner similar acclaim abroad.
  <br>
  <br>
  The original "Ne Zha" became what was then China's highest-grossing animated film, after it was released in 2019.

    More community pharmacies to be set up: Lo Chung-mau

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Health Lo Chung-mau said on Wednesday the government plans to establish up to five community pharmacies in each district, so patients can more easily get their medicine.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on RTHK’s Overview Policy programme, Lo said through the Hospital Authority’s centralised procurement, patients and private doctors can get cheaper medicine for chronic and episodic illnesses at community pharmacies.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said community pharmacies will also help to reduce drug wastage as patients need not take home several months’ worth of medication.
  <br>
  <br>
  “With community pharmacies, citizens will not need to get months of medication at one time. They can get one month of medication after visiting the doctor,” Lo said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “They also don't need to have a monthly follow-up appointment to get the same medicine. Instead, they can go to a community pharmacy to fill a prescription,” he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The health minister also expressed the hope that citizens would consult their own family doctors first for minor illnesses or chronic diseases. He added residents can select a general practitioner in their neighbourhood from a list of eligible doctors provided at District Health Centres (DHC).
  <br>
  <br>
  Currently, there are seven DHCs in the city, located in Kwai Tsing, Sham Shui Po, Southern District, Tsuen Wan, Tuen Mun, Wong Tai Sin and Yuen Long.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lo also said the government has subsidised family doctors in the community to provide screening services for diabetes and hypertension for eligible citizens.

<img alt="An HR expert says Hong Kong firms need to offer attractive pay to lure Islamic finance professionals to the SAR. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1792212_1_20250219084656.jpg&q=45">

<div class="itemFullText">
 A human resources expert on Wednesday said the latest government move to expand Hong Kong's Talent List is the right one, and will help plug holes in the SAR's workforce.
 <br>
  <br>
  On Tuesday, officials announced that aircraft maintenance engineers, accountants and financial professionals with Islamic market experience will be among nine professions added to the list from March 1.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Obviously, Hong Kong has a very serious shortage of these talents," Roy Ying, the co-chair of the advocacy and policy research committee at the Hong Kong Institute of Human Resource Management, told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted that aircraft engineering and maintenance firms such as Haeco has had to go overseas to recruit engineers all the time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ying also said the government has been proactive in addressing the needs of employers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I also think that the government is actively listening to the industries because these new jobs, they don't just land on the Talent List. It's a collaboration between the government and the industries.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Obviously the government sees a serious shortage and that's why these [jobs] are added to the Talent List."
  <br>
  <br>
  On bringing in more Islamic finance professionals to the SAR, he said Hong Kong firms not only have to offer attractive pay in order to compete with market leaders Malaysia and Saudi Arabia, but the territory also has to be become more Muslim friendly.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In terms of halal restaurants, we only have about 132 in Hong Kong... and most organisations don't have prayer rooms, so we have to make our city a little more embracing to attract these people," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We don't just want them to come, we want them to also bring their families... we have to get people who want to call Hong Kong home."

    HK's population grows by 6,400

<img alt="Hong Kong's population stood at 7.534 million at the end of 2024, representing an increase of 0.1 percent year on year. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1792151_2_20250218225030.jpg&q=70">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's population expanded for the third consecutive year, albeit at a slower pace, to 7.534 million last year, an uptick of 6,400.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 0.1 percent growth paled in comparison to the 0.7 percent increase in 2023, and one percent in 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the 36,700 births last year were outstripped by 51,400 deaths.
  <br>
  <br>
  That was offset by a net positive movement of 21,000 SAR residents, which included 40,000 arrivals through one-way permits. Around 18,900 people migrated elsewhere.
  <br>
  <br>
  A government spokesperson said that various talent attraction measures and labour importation schemes helped boost the city's population growth.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Professor Paul Yip from the University of Hong Kong's Department of Social Work and Social Administration struck a cautious tone.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said that the natural decrease of over 14,000 people remained a concern, alongside the city's ageing population.
  <br>
  <br>
  "What we can see is that the ageing situation remains a very important issue and it will get worse in the coming years," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yip does not expect the trend to reverse any time soon, despite a 10 percent jump in the birth rate last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In 2024, that was the dragon year. It is a year that tends to have a higher birth rate than before. But I think when we look at the historical figures, all the years after the dragon years, I think the birth rates reduced accordingly," he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  The population expert urged the government to focus on improving people’s health and wellbeing, while encouraging enterprises to adopt technology to make work less labour intensive.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Snooker legends Judd Trump and Ronnie O'Sullivan said they are very excited to play in their first tournament in Hong Kong since becoming SAR residents.
 <br>
  <br>
  The World Snooker Grand Prix 2025 will be held in the Kai Tak Arena on March 8 and 9.
  <br>
  <br>
  World number one Trump is set to face Gary Wilson of England, while O'Sullivan will take on Si Jiahui from China.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both Trump and O'Sullivan obtained their Hong Kong residency through the Quality Migrant Admission Scheme last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For me, it is more motivating to come back here because I feel like now that I'm here, and I feel like the people in Hong Kong can really get behind me and have someone to really support," Trump said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think when you have somebody that is trying to represent Hong Kong, which I am now. I think the people can kind of see that. I hope that comes off in the way that I'm able to carry myself and give everybody full respect. I hope to make Hong Kong proud and be the first winner of this tournament."
  <br>
  <br>
  O'Sullivan, a seven-time World champion, said he is ready and looks forward to play in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vincent Law, chairman of the Billiard Sports Council of Hong Kong China, said efforts are underway to make sure the event is being held successfully at the brand new venue.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We also hope the spectators will understand if something don't go right on the first day, we guarantee that we will try to our best to fix problems to make sure the tournament will run smoothly."
  <br>
  <br>
  Exhibition matches will also take place during the two-day event.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong's top player, Marco Fu, will face off the legendary "Whirlwind" Jimmy White on March 8.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SAR's Ng On-yee, meanwhile, takes on world number 1 Mink Nutcharut from Thailand the following day.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's unemployment rate remained at 3.1 percent in the November-January period, unchanged from the previous three-month figure.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Census and Statistics Department said 3,716,600 were in work in the latest period, a fall of 2,300 from October-December.
  <br>
  <br>
  The labour force, meanwhile, decreased by around 5,700 to 3,826,700.
  <br>
  <br>
  Around 110,100 people were looking for a job, down about 3,500 from the previous three-month period.
  <br>
  <br>
  The underemployment rate also remained unchanged in the three months from November, at 1.1 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Secretary for Labour and Welfare Chris Sun said Hong Kong's jobless rate remains low.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added in a statement that "the labour market should remain largely stable in the near term, though uncertainties in the global economy would continue to pose challenges to some businesses."

    Lawmakers back annual minimum wage reviews

<img alt="Hong Kong's statutory minimum wage will increase from HK$40 to HK$42.1 per hour. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1792143_1_20250218174210.jpg&q=60">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lawmakers welcomed the shift from biennial to annual minimum wage reviews, saying this would enhance the quality of life of grassroots workers.
 <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong's statutory minimum wage will increase from HK$40 to HK$42.1 an hour, following a 5.25 percent recommendation from the Minimum Wage Commission.
  <br>
  <br>
  This new rate is set to take effect on May 1, pending lawmakers' approval, and will be reviewed annually instead of biennially.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lam Chun-sing, chairman of the Legislative Council's manpower panel, said reviewing wages annually allows minimum wage workers to better pace their earnings with inflation each year.
  <br>
  <br>
  He told RTHK that the government's freeze on minimum wage levels during the pandemic led to four years without salary increases for grassroots workers despite inflation, severely affecting their ability to maintain their purchasing power and living standards.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lam hopes future adjustments to the minimum wage would give greater weight to economic growth, so that workers could benefit more substantially from gains in the economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We hope that later ... after three or five years we can review the formula to see whether we can increase the proportion of the calculation of growth of the GDP so that if there's a large increase in GDP, then we can also have a large increase in minimum wage levels so that the grassroots worker can share the fruits of economic development," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, lawmaker Kwok Wai-keung, of the Federation of Trade Unions, said they would continue to communicate with the government to see whether a review could be conducted within five to 10 years after this reform was completed.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added the increase was unlikely to have a major impact on the labour market, as only about 20,000 of the 3.6 million workers in the SAR earn the minimum wage.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The number of grassroots workers is small and their roles are concentrated in cleaning and security. We have heard that many companies in these industries already pay wages above the minimum wage, meaning that this adjustment will not affect those already earning more than the minimum," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Thus, we believe it will not have a major impact on the economy or competitiveness."

    Islamic finance among new additions to Talent List

<img alt="From March 1, the Talent List will cover 60 professions. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1792146_1_20250218174805.jpg&q=70">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Aircraft maintenance engineers, accountants and financial professionals with Islamic market experience will be among nine professions added to Hong Kong's Talent List from March 1.
 <br>
  <br>
  The government also wants new blood with a background in commodities trading, as well as systems architects, patent professionals, ship surveyors, professionals in green shipping, and legal knowledge engineers in the legal and dispute resolution sector.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a closed-door media briefing on Tuesday, the Labour and Welfare Bureau said that by expanding the number of jobs on the list to 60, the government is hoping to find talented people who can add significant value to the economy in areas where there are staff shortages and where it is not practical to train up locals.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the other hand, it said requests from industries to add further roles to the list, including pilots and language therapists, have been rejected because there are sufficient training opportunities for local people to take up such jobs.
  <br>
  <br>
  People in professions on the list get a smoother immigration process when applying to work in Hong Kong through various talent schemes, officials say.
  <br>
  <br>
  The last expansion of the Talent List was in May 2023, when the number of professions rose from 13 to 51.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bureau said between May 2023 and the end of last year it received 1,123 applications for work visas involving jobs on the list.

    Rise in cigarette smuggling in 2024: customs

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Cigarette smuggling accounted for around 68 percent of the total number of cases the Customs and Excise Department worked on last year, according to customs officers.
 <br>
  <br>
  The department handled more than 31,000 cases in 2024, which was a 63 percent increase from 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said cigarette smuggling increased 80 percent last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Customs commissioner Chan Tsz-tat on Tuesday said the numbers were due to the increased tobacco tax over the past two years.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The duty rates of cigarettes has increased from HK$1.9 to HK$3.3 per stick over the past two years. Inevitably, this would add the incentive to smugglers as well as incoming passengers to bring in excessive duty-free cigarettes," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added the department had cracked 40 large-scale cigarette smuggling cases in 2024, similar to 2023, but the number of cigarettes seized dropped 33 percent to around 600 million sticks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said the drop was due to syndicates decreasing the number of cigarettes being smuggled out at any one time and using differenct smuggling methods in order to reduce losses if smuggled products were seized.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, customs officers seized 6.3 tonnes of drugs and arrested 366 people last year in connection with these seizures.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among them, 19 cases involved the import of space oil drugs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Customs said it has stepped up its actions following the classification of etomidate, the key ingredient of the space oil drug, as a dangerous drug last Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have strengthened our enforcement covering the whole supply chain, including import and export, distribution and retail, and to crack down on their supply," Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The department has also enhanced intelligence analysis and risk management so as to ensure precise cargo and passenger selections. Etomidate has been added to the database of our Raman spectrometers to enhance detection on the front line," he added.

    Ngong Ping 360 sees record revenue in 2024

<div class="itemFullText">
 Ngong Ping 360 on Tuesday said it will work on attracting more long-haul tourists, as its visitor numbers last year surpassed pre-pandemic levels.
 <br>
  <br>
  The company said it received record-breaking cable car revenue of over HK$413 million last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said the facility welcomed more than 1.5 million guests in 2024, showing a 10 percent growth when compared with pre-pandemic levels.
  <br>
  <br>
  About 40 percent of the visitors were from short-haul markets, followed by mainland tourists, local people, and visitors from long-haul markets.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to the press, managing director James Tung said the company will do its best to attract more visitors, especially those from long-haul markets.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We are actually talking to some online travel agencies, trying to target those free and independent travellers - FIT - who may not necessarily follow a tour itinerary pattern, but they can get access to our tickets very easily,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “So we are even targeting potentially backpackers from the US, from Australia, from Europe as well.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Last month, the Airport Authority unveiled the Airport City development blueprint, aiming to create a new landmark for Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tung said the cable car facility has an advantage of being close to Chek Lap Kok.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We’ve been talking to different operators, different stakeholders who are involved in the project, to see what we can do moving forward… how we can actually get the tickets to the hands of the travellers,“ he said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong is set to raise the statutory minimum wage from the current HK$40 to HK$42.1 per hour.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a statement issued on Tuesday, the government said the Executive Council has adopted the recommendation of the Minimum Wage Commission (MWC) on raising the minimum wage level by 5.25 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said it will publish the Minimum Wage Ordinance (Amendment of Schedule 3) Notice 2025 in the Gazette on Friday, and table it in the Legislative Council on February 26.
  <br>
  <br>
  If Legco gives it the green light, the new minimum wage rate will take effect on May 1.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The recommendation … is in line with the policy objectives … to maintain an appropriate balance between forestalling excessively low wages and minimising the loss of low-paid jobs, while giving due regard to sustaining Hong Kong's economic growth and competitiveness,” labour and welfare secretary Chris Sun said.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday said the opening of Kai Tak Sports Park will mark a significant milestone in Hong Kong's sporting and cultural landscape.
 <br>
  <br>
  An opening ceremony will begin at 6.30pm on March 1, with a joint broadcast at 9.30pm across four free TV channels, rather than being shown live.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked about the broadcast arrangements, Lee said he believes the production company has tried its best.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have to make sure that members of the public will be able to view the event for free through the TV channels so that we can share the happiness with everyone," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The production company will seek partners to help deal with all the challenges that they are going to face. In this regard I believe the production company has been working very hard. They're going to find the best solution within such a short period of time."
  <br>
  <br>
  The park's opening is part of what is being billed as Hong Kong's "Super March", alongside Art Basel, ComplexCon, and the World Grand Prix snooker tournament.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee said the mega events scheduled for the first half of this year are expected to attract 840,000 tourists and generate HK$3.3 billion in spending.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday urged the taxi industry to avoid "drastic action" such as strikes, warning such moves would harm the public interest and could be hijacked by people with bad motives.
 <br>
  <br>
  His comments came after the Hong Kong Tele-call Taxi Association threatened a five-day strike from March 5 unless officials take immediate action against illegal ride-hailing services.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters before the weekly Executive Council meeting, Lee said strikes would not be good for society.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Any drastic action is not going to solve the problem. Drastic action may also hurt the interests of normal citizens in the course of their daily going about of their lives. It is not going to receive public support," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CE noted that many taxi drivers have said they wouldn't support strike action.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Transport Advisory Committee will meet representatives from both the taxi industry and ride-hailing platforms on Wednesday to discuss the issue.

 Chief Executive John Lee said on Tuesday that he's all for his ministers reaching out to the community and explaining their work, including to the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office.
 <br>
  <br>
  The head of the office, Xia Baolong, made a three-day visit to the Greater Bay Area earlier this month and met with some of the SAR's ministers, when Lee was in Harbin attending the Asian Winter Games.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking before the weekly Executive Council meeting, the CE said Xia is a busy leader, and that he and the top mainland official maintain good communication.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I also support my ministers in doing their work in their own right... I support them in explaining issues to different people and reporting their work to the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, especially in explaining their specific portfolio to Director Xia personally.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This precisely reflects my demands for different ministers to do their own part, taking charge of their responsibilities in resolving problems.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And at the same time, there's synergy among the team, united as one, complementing one another in handling problems."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee said he wanted to once again thank Xia for pointing the way forward for Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office said Xia exchanged views with a number of SAR government officials on how Hong Kong will speed up reform and better integrate into the Greater Bay Area's development. During his trip, he visited the Hetao Innovation and Technology Cooperation Zone, as well as Qianhai and Yantian.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government says it strongly condemns unfounded malicious attacks online, after a court issued an order to confiscate the alleged crime proceeds of self-exiled national security suspect, Ted Hui.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Court of First Instance issued the confiscation order on Monday upon application by the Department of Justice.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement overnight, a government spokesman accused Hui of committing numerous crimes, including conspiring with foreign politicians in 2020 to forge documents and deceive the court, in order to jump bail and abscond overseas.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Before and after Hui Chi-fung absconded from Hong Kong, he transferred nearly $2.5 million Hong Kong dollars in personal assets as gifts to his mother and wife," the spokesman said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government spokesman said such a gift made within six years from the date of prosecution may be regarded as the defendant's property, and confiscated under the law.
  <br>
  <br>
  The statement said it was common practice to confiscate crime proceeds, and denied that private property could be 'confiscated at any time' or 'arbitrarily', as such orders must comply with strict conditions.
  <br>
  <br>
  These include that the court must be satisfied the absconded defendant could have been convicted of the offence and whether they benefited from the offence.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Housing Bureau on Monday announced a new phase of light public flats, and people can begin moving in from the fourth quarter of this year.
 <br>
  <br>
  The second phase covers four projects in Kai Tak, Kwun Tong, Tuen Mun and Sheung Shui, generating 5,060 units with monthly rents between HK$860 and HK$3,270.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eligible people can submit their applications from February 24.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to the press, housing minister Winnie Ho said she expects the projects to receive an overwhelming response, especially the one in Kai Tak adjacent to the MTR station
  <br>
  <br>
  "Light public housing projects can effectively help residents in need. The locations of the second phase projects are very appealing," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have about 5,000 units this time, and together with the 4,400 units announced in the first phase, we have introduced almost 10,000 flats. That is one-third of the total number."
  <br>
  <br>
  DAB lawmaker Vincent Cheng, who's the deputy chairman of the Legco housing panel, said while the projects would help reduce the waiting time for public housing, the focus should still be on building more public flats.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Light public housing is not for the long term. Some of the residents also have to move again after they [are allocated with] a public housing flat," he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hopefully, even though the waiting time will be shortened, we hope that the government can keep providing more public housing in the future."
  <br>
  <br>
  The government aims to build a total of about 30,000 light public flats by 2028 under the scheme aimed at filling the short-term gap of public housing supply.
  <br>
  <br>
  Regarding the projects announced in the first phase last year, Ho said people would start moving into the units in Yuen Long and Ngau Tau Kok from March and June respectively.

 Hong Kong universities have seen a surge in non-local students, after the government doubled the enrolment ceiling for them to 40 percent.
 <br>
  <br>
  So, how are these students adjusting to life here? And what efforts are being made to help them feel at home?
  <br>
  <br>
  RTHK spoke to the warden and some students at St. John's College -- University of Hong Kong’s oldest residential hall -- to find out more.

    Baby's heart thrives after cross-boundary transplant

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Health authorities said the heart of a baby who received a successful cross-boundary organ donation is functioning well, with little post-operative bleeding.
 <br>
  <br>
  Eight month-old Whitney underwent a heart transplant on Sunday and is now in intensive care.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have at least a dozen of these monitoring lines attached to Whitney. We have minute-by-minute monitoring for at least a dozen of these parameters, and this is coupled with another list of interval monitoring like echocardiograms to look at the heart function, and radiographers to look at the chest conditions," said Dr Nicholson Yam, the head surgeon of the operation from the Hong Kong Children's Hospital.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have a team of dedicated nurses to look at the surgical wound condition, the bleeding conditions from the tubes that we place after surgery, and this will continue at least for the coming weeks."
  <br>
  <br>
  Yam said this was the baby's third open-heart surgery, presenting challenges such as removing the previously implanted biventricular assist device and minimising ischemia time -- the period during which tissue, such as a heart, is deprived of blood supply.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A lot of work has been done before to make sure the logistics [are] as smooth as possible, all the transportation, all the cross-boundary action, and then the transport to the Children's Hospital is as fast as possible, as smooth as possible," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As for Whitney's surgery, the main challenge was it was the third time the chest was opened, so she had two previous chest openings for heart surgery. We have expected quite a bit of scarring tissue inside the chest and that will make the heart removal procedure technically more challenging."
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Simon Tang, director of cluster services at the Hospital Authority, said close communication with mainland authorities -- specifically strengthened collaboration with the centre for the China Organ Transplant Response System -- was essential for ensuring a smooth cross-boundary organ transplant.
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted the first successful cross-boundary organ donation was in 2022 with a then four-month-old baby girl.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We established the communication channels and we also established the essential pathway. So in case if we have suitable grafts in mainland China, but there is no suitable recipients in mainland China, then this graft, we will see if it can be matched to a potential recipient in Hong Kong," Tang said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The key step is we need good preparations and so in these two years we have already set up various guidelines and protocols, so that we can ensure ... things can go smooth."
  <br>
  <br>
  Mr Cheung, Whitney's father, expressed his gratitude to the medical team, relevant departments and the donor's family for saving his daughter's life, calling the procedure a miracle.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Consumer Council has urged beverage shops to enhance their training for staff on bring-your-own-cup (BYOC) policies, adding there was a lack of transparency about such schemes.
 <br>
  <br>
  Additionally, it also saw cases where paper cups were used to make drinks even when customers brought their own cups, which failed to reduce waste.
  <br>
  <br>
  The consumer watchdog on Monday said it had sent staff undercover to conduct BYOC trials at 20 beverage shops.
  <br>
  <br>
  BYOC refers to schemes by drink shops, ranging from coffee shops to hand-shaken beverage shops, which encourage customers to bring their own cups instead of using plastic or paper ones in order to save waste.
  <br>
  <br>
  Often, this is accompanied by incentives such as a five dollar discount.
  <br>
  <br>
  Consumer Council CEO Gilly Wong said one problem was shops' inability to properly provide relevant information.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If you just simply say small, tall, may be standard, normal or similar words to describe the size of your drinks, but unfortunately you haven't provided exact size... then it's very hard for people to follow," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  She added that often customers do not know such a scheme exists since it is not consistently displayed, appearing in small letters at the bottom of the poster.
  <br>
  <br>
  Moreover, problems also arise when staff are not be properly trained, leading to misunderstandings.
  <br>
  <br>
  "From our findings, there are a couple of times that the shop staff didn't know such offer [existed] and said they didn't have the offer, or missed the discount."
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong suggested that merchants look into the details of their workflow to ensure the minimisation of waste and to better display their schemes.

    Many nappy creams contain allergens: Consumer Council

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Consumer Council on Monday said around 75 percent of nappy cream samples it tested contained fragrances or chemicals that can cause irritation or allergic reactions.
 <br>
  <br>
  The watchdog tested 16 nappy creams priced from HK$52 to HK$218.
  <br>
  <br>
  Most of them claimed to be suitable for use on infants, with three types also suitable for adults or the elderly who need to wear adult diapers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Seven samples contained fragrances.
  <br>
  <br>
  Most of them had one or two types of fragrant substances, but Weleda baby's sample had six types.
  <br>
  <br>
  Essential oils or plant extracts were found in four samples, including the aromatic compound terpenes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The European medicines regulatory body has warned that terpenes can cause adverse neurologic effects such as twitches in babies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two samples, a diaper rash cream from Baby Sebamed, and QV baby’s nappy cream, contain preservatives restricted in the United States and France.
  <br>
  <br>
  The council said those ingredients may worsen diaper rashes or cause allergenic reactions like dermatitis.
  <br>
  <br>
  “If nappy creams contain ingredients of concern, they are more likely to irritate the skin, pose allergy risks or may even cause adverse neurologic effects,” said chairman of the council’s committee on research and testing Chung Chi-yung.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Infants, having thinner skin and a higher body surface area-to-body weight ratio, are particularly susceptible to allergic reactions,” he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The council urged manufacturers to improve their labelling by listing all ingredients clearly, including their concentrations.
  <br>
  <br>
  They should also pay attention to the latest international regulations to improve product formulations.
  <br>
  <br>
  The watchdog also hoped local regulatory bodies would establish regulations on the safety and labelling of nappy creams.

    Over 5,000 people flock to Ocean Park for panda twins

<div class="itemFullText">
 More than 5,000 people flocked to Ocean Park for the panda twins' debut, its chairman revealed on Monday, saying the figures fell within expectations.
 <br>
  <br>
  Paulo Pong said that dozens of people arrived at the park gates at 6am, four hours before the start of public viewings.
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted entry to facility was smooth as several drills had been conducted earlier.
  <br>
  <br>
  The turnout marked a daily record high at the Giant Panda Adventure exhibition zone, Pong said, with a majority of them being locals.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This included annual pass holders, who are devoted fans of pandas. There were also visitors from around the world and the mainland, including Chengdu. Many people from foreign countries, like Southeast Asia, or even Europe and America, came to see the pandas," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Some of the tourists actually didn't know about the twins when they arrived at Ocean Park, but when they heard they could visit the cubs, they also queued to meet them."
  <br>
  <br>
  Public viewing of the twins, whom Ying Ying gave birth to last August, is for five hours daily – from 10am to 3pm.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Pong said visiting hours could be extended.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When they're more adapted to meeting the public, or even when they can be in the same exhibition zone with Ying Ying, then we can gradually extend the duration."
  <br>
  <br>
  He said Ocean Park received hundreds of applications for the HK$1,500 VIP session to meet the cubs for 30 minutes before the park opens each day.
  <br>
  <br>
  The first session will be held on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pong emphasised that income generated from the special tour would be used for its conservation fund after deducting expenses.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Health authorities said on Monday that thanks to a cross-border organ donation, an eight-month-old girl underwent a successful heart transplant on Sunday night.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, Secretary for Health, Lo Chung-mau, noted that it was the second such case of cross-boundary organ donation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "After a then four-month-old baby girl, Tsz-hei, successfully received a heart donation from the mainland in December 2022 to extend her life, Hong Kong and the mainland established a close communication channel and procedures for cross-boundary organ transplant co-operation based on that successful experience," said Professor Lo.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said more than 100 personnel from 18 mainland authorities worked together and raced against time to ensure the safe and smooth transportation of the organ across multiple locations.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Health Bureau and the Hospital Authority said the heart transplant was successfully completed for baby, Whitney, at the Hong Kong Children's Hospital.
  <br>
  <br>
  Consultant in-charge of the Cardiothoracic Surgery of HKCH, Dr Nicholson Yam - who was in charge of the transplant - said the operation lasted approximately 6.5 hours. The statement said Whitney was now under close monitoring in the Intensive Care Unit and the following 24 hours would be a critical period.
  <br>
  <br>
  Whitney's parents expressed their gratitude to the medical teams and to the different regional authorities in finding a suitable heart, as well as thanking the donor's family for their difficult and selfless decision, giving Whitney the chance for a new life.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Director of Cluster Services of the HA, Dr Simon Tang, said all efforts had been made through different networks to identify a suitable heart for Whitney amid the difficulties involved.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Since there was no suitable recipient in the mainland, the mainland decided to send the donor heart to Hong Kong for transplanting to Whitney upon confirmation by experts from the two places that the heart was suitable for Whitney's transplantation," Dr Tang added.

 Over 50,000 civil servants and members of the public took part in a stress test at the Kai Tak Sports Park on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The aim was to assess the park's readiness ahead of its official opening at the beginning of next month.
  <br>
  <br>
  The exercise also looked into the performance of the Easy Leave platform. It uses artificial intelligence to analyse real-time data on crowd density and the time needed for people to follow an exit route.

    Make good use of Hetao to boost biotech sector: DAB

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 DAB lawmakers on Sunday said Hong Kong should make good use of the Hetao Shenzhen-Hong Kong Science and Technology Innovation Co-operation Zone to boost the country’s biotech development.
 <br>
  <br>
  The suggestion is among dozens of others the party is planning to propose during the annual sessions of the nation's legislature and top political advisory body in Beijing next month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Starry Lee, Hong Kong’s sole member of the National People’s Congress Standing Committee, said for one, authorities should allow blood samples taken from the mainland to be processed in Hetao.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I understand that [Hong Kong] Red Cross receive blood donation from the general public because we cannot have the samples from [mainland] China. We [also] have to export the blood samples to overseas countries to manufacture blood-related products for medical use,” she explained.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Our suggestion is to make use of Hetao for a trial so that all these samples can move to Hong Kong for further development and innovation.”
  <br>
  <br>
  She added that her party hopes to see more cross-border exchanges in areas like medicine and healthcare equipment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the party quoted some private enterprises as saying they would like more support from the central government to help them ride out the economic downturn.
  <br>
  <br>
  “For example, you know, all the enterprises who are operating on the mainland have to pay the social security payment. And because of the tight economic environment, some say some sort of flexibility should be incorporated during this special period,” Lee said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The party also said drivers under the Northbound Travel for Hong Kong Vehicles scheme should be allowed to return to the SAR via more borders besides the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Customs officers have arrested a 28-year-old woman on suspicion of carrying the space oil drug in a vape stick.
 <br>
  <br>
  The woman was taken into custody at the Hong Kong-Macau Ferry Terminal in Sheung Wan after she arrived from Macau on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The arrestee, who claimed to be unemployed, has been released on bail.
  <br>
  <br>
  This marks the department’s first arrest since etomidate - a key ingredient of space oil drug - was included in the Dangerous Drug Ordinance last Friday.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan said on Sunday that issuing government bonds to fund the mega Northern Metropolis project is one way to ensure its development won’t be affected by Hong Kong’s economic situation.
 <br>
  <br>
  Writing on his weekly blog, Chan said bonds are commonly used around the world to finance infrastructure projects, adding that international investors have traditionally been very receptive to the SAR’s debt securities.
  <br>
  <br>
  These investors, the minister said, include central banks, sovereignty funds, global organisations and banks.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong has the conditions and ability to issue more bonds, and use market forces flexibly for implementing strategic infrastructure [projects]," Chan wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  The finance chief cited research from international groups and local universities as saying that the SAR's debt level remains comparatively low, and bond issuance would be a smart solution.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan went on to say that in some developed economies, government debt is actually higher than its total GDP.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also said as Hong Kong's debt is just over nine percent of its total GDP, there is room to lift this percentage.

    Govt mulls longer grace period for basic housing units

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Housing Winnie Ho said on Sunday that the government is considering extending a grace period for landlords to convert subdivided flats, after new laws are introduced to regulate the compact homes.
 <br>
  <br>
  Officials had initially proposed a transitional period of up to two years for the registration of such flats, known as "basic housing units", which will need to meet a number of requirements such as a minimum size.
  <br>
  <br>
  Citing public views received during a consultation exercise which concluded earlier, Ho said some respondents expressed the need for more time to make the changes.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said extending the grace period to three years could be an option.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Time-wise, it is helpful to the market - so tenants can move out and renovation work can take place and people have better options on where to live," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "All these will help the situation. So I think a three-year grace period is something that can be considered."
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho added that the government is analysing the public’s views and will make adjustments to the legal proposals accordingly.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, the housing chief said officials will soon put in place a pilot scheme at two public housing estates by installing sensors at the doors of flats occupied by elderly residents, in order to better ensure their safety.
  <br>
  <br>
  The scheme comes after a recent spate of cases involving elderly people who died alone in their homes for some time before being discovered.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said dozens of households at Sheung Lok Estate in Ho Man Tin and Wan Hon Estate in Kwun Tong have signed up for the trial.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The sensor records movements. The elderly person can decide who to send such information - it's not to the estate's management, it can be his or her son, daughter or other family members. It's up to the tenant," Ho said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister stressed the sensors don't have cameras and won't detect what's inside the flat.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ocean Park's panda twin cubs made their highly-anticipated public debut on Sunday in front of hundreds of delighted locals and tourists.
 <br>
  <br>
  Many visitors arrived extra early to make sure they could meet the baby pandas as soon as possible.
  <br>
  <br>
  A local panda enthusiast, surnamed Chan, told RTHK that he arrived at Ocean Park two hours before it opened - and he's also taking part in a contest to pick a name for the pair.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I arrived here at 8am. I want to see them as soon as I can. I will join the [naming] contest, but I am still thinking [about what names to propose]. The theme will probably be related to Hong Kong,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tourists were equally thrilled to meet the locally-born cubs.
  <br>
  <br>
  One Indonesian student who’s currently studying in Shenzhen said he doesn’t get to see pandas in his home country.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We don’t really have access to pandas [in Indonesia]. So looking at pandas, especially the cubs, is quite special to us,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ocean Park says visitors are allowed to stay for up to five minutes inside the venue to give more people a chance to view the panda babies.
  <br>
  <br>
  While some said they wish they could spend more time with the cubs, Christa from San Francisco said the arrangement is reasonable.
  <br>
  <br>
  “They [panda cubs] are just doing their own thing, just hanging out. They don’t need to do anything special, they’re just special the way they are,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I think if you can take what you can get so others could enjoy them too I think it’s better to have more people enjoy them and want to conserve and protect them. So I think it’s better to have more people see them.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Public viewings of the panda cubs are from 10am to 3pm daily, and the facility is expected to welcome up to 5,000 visitors each day.
  <br>
  <br>
  People can also choose to pay HK$1,500 each for a special, 30-minute visit before the park opens each day.
  <br>
  <br>
  A woman sunamed Ho said she may sign up for the session so that she can spend more time with the twins.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I saw the pandas climbing up and down. I like both of them. I think seeing the cubs grow up is like seeing my grandchildren. I am interested in the HK$1,500 session, at least I'll have half an hour to see the cubs. I think it's worth it because I feel happy after seeing them," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, another woman surnamed Leung said the VIP slot is just too costly.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I will not consider [registering] at all. It is not necessary. I still have to see the pandas with another 50 people even after paying HK$1,500," she said.

    Real-name ticketing deters scalpers: Consumer Council

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Consumer Council has called on the government to implement real-name registration for tickets to prevent scalping.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a TV program on Saturday, the council’s chief executive Gilly Wong said real-name ticketing can deter scalpers and allow people who are truly interested in attending to buy tickets.
  <br>
  <br>
  “When more mega events are taking place, there will be more ticket scalping. Recently, it was reported in the news that a ticket had been marked-up to an astronomical price of more than HK$100,000,” Wong said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We hope the market can be regulated and stabilized. We believe that real-name ticketing is a good way to achieve that,” she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The council received over 40,000 complaints last year, a 20 percent increase from 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong said over 7,000 complaints were related to Lionel Messi’s no-show at an exhibition match last February, as well as the abrupt closure of the Physical Fitness chain in September.
  <br>
  <br>
  She urged organisers to provide clearer clauses for future events, and to inform consumers earlier if they are any changes.

    Govt working with privacy watchdog on data interchange

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A data interchange system among departments has not been set up due to privacy and technical issues, according Secretary for Labour and Welfare Chris Sun, but the government is in touch with the Privacy Commissioner to overcome challenges.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lawmakers had called on the authorities to provide more assistance to hidden elders, after a 78-year-old man was found dead inside his Tuen Mun flat earlier this week.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters after an event on Saturday, Sun said the government should make use of data from departments like the Hospital Authority and the Social Welfare Department.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said authorities are currently in touch with the Privacy Commissioner to discuss ways allowing data interchange, while complying with the Personal Data Ordinance.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We hope we can intervene before any incident occurs. We can identify some high-risk cases and contact them to provide services. We hope to avoid tragedies as much as possible," Sun said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Chief Executive's Policy Address last year mentioned that officials would make use of identification tools designed by universities for detection of high-risk cases.

 People are invited to suggest names for Ocean Park's panda twin cubs as they turn six months old on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at the greeting ceremony for the panda babies, Chief Executive John Lee said people can submit their ideas, based on the twins' appearance and personality, from noon on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the government will announce their names in the first half of this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee added that Sunday will be a big day, as the cubs will finally meet the public.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's the first time that pandas have been born in the SAR, and there's a sense of elation among Hong Kong people. The pair only weighed about 120 grammes each when they were born, and they've shown extraordinary resilience," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "After six months, their weight has increased to over ten kilogrammes each. They were a bit shaky at first, but now, they've become experts at tree climbing."
  <br>
  <br>
  Ocean Park said people can suggest a Chinese name for each of the cubs, along with an explainer of the meaning of the Chinese names.
  <br>
  <br>
  The submission deadline is March 7, and the judging panel will comprise representatives from the park, the SAR government, and the China Conservation and Research Centre for the Giant Panda.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ocean Park's chairman Paulo Pong said with the support of the whole community, the SAR has successfully promoted the concept of "panda is everywhere".
  <br>
  <br>
  "With promotions through social media, on transportation and various creative activities across Hong Kong involving panda-themed products, we connected Hong Kong and global panda lovers. This further promotes Hong Kong's tourism and culture," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He pointed out that the park will use top-tier animal care, veterinary and scientific research to help with the breeding of giant pandas.

    Public urged to be alert to new SMS scam messages

 Police said efforts to educate the elderly have led to a significant drop in the number of so-called “Guess Who” phone scams – in which fraudsters pose as an old friend or relative of the victim.
 <br>
  <br>
  The number of “Guess Who” phone scams, which mainly targets victims aged 65 or above, were down by 48 percent last year, police commissioner Raymond Siu said on Saturday after attending a Commercial Radio program.
  <br>
  <br>
  “That’s why last year, we particularly focused our effort to deliver these anti-scam messages to the elderly,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Siu said police are working with The Office of the Communications Authority (OFCA) to combat other types of telephone scams.
  <br>
  <br>
  This comes following reports of suspected scam text messages carrying the hashtag prefix, to trick victims into thinking that they were sent by the authority.
  <br>
  <br>
  In December 2023, the authority launched a short message service (SMS) sender registration scheme, in which companies and organizations participating send text messages under their registered IDs with the prefix “#”.
  <br>
  <br>
  “In order to tackle other telephone scams, we need to find out the reasons as well as the victimised group, so as to work with all stakeholders, in particular the telecommunications industry and also the OFCA,” Siu said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We set up a specific working group back in September 2022. We continue to hold regular meetings with them, in order to come up with different measures to tackle this sort of telephone scam,” he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Siu reminded residents to remain alert to potential scam messages, especially those with hyperlinks.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The construction industry should look into limiting the use of bamboo scaffolding if the situation calls for it, according to Siu Sin-man from the Association for the Rights of Industrial Accident Victims.
 <br>
  <br>
  A scaffolding collapse at a Kai Tak construction site last month injured 11 workers, sparking discussions about replacing bamboo altogether with metal scaffolding.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a radio programme on Saturday, Siu said the industry should explore the possibility to limit the use of bamboo and find the most suitable material for each construction site.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Bamboo is very special material and it's widely used in Hong Kong, but in other places, they don't use bamboo. That means there may be some shortcomings of this material," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think we need to do more research on why some Hong Kong construction companies like to use metal material instead of bamboo."
  <br>
  <br>
  The chairman of the Hong Kong Construction Industry Employees General Union, Chau Sze-kit, told the same programme that it is impossible to completely scrap the use of bamboo scaffold immediately.
  <br>
  <br>
  He suggested the industry should instead look into ways of implementing safety mechanisms when using either bamboo or metal scaffold.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee has told his Macau counterpart the two SARs are "as close as brothers" with solid economic and trade relations.
 <br>
  <br>
  He also said, during the exchange with Macau Chief Executive Sam Hou-fai on Friday, that the two cities could enjoy the fruits of economic development by taking part in the development of the Greater Bay Area.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Lee said that the two cities are as close as brothers, with frequent people-to-people and cultural exchanges, alongside solid economic and trade relations. He noted that the One Country, Two Systems principle is a good policy for maintaining the long-term prosperity and stability of Hong Kong and Macau," a government statement read.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He also noted that Hong Kong and Macau, both of which are core cities of the [Greater Bay Area], can achieve complementarity and participate in and promote the development of the [Greater Bay Area] together, benefiting the people of both cities with the fruits of economic development."
  <br>
  <br>
  It was Sam's first visit to Hong Kong since becoming Macau's leader.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a separate social media post, the chief executive expressed hope the two cities would cooperate further under the leadership of Sam to carry out the four expectations laid out by President Xi Jinping in Macau.
  <br>
  <br>
  In December last year, Xi directed Macau to diversify its economy, improve governance, build a high-level platform to enhance China's international connections, and safeguard social harmony and stability.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A senior Beijing official on Friday called on mainland enterprises to take part in the Northern Metropolis project as part of efforts to fully back the Hong Kong government.
 <br>
  <br>
  Zheng Yanxiong, director of the central government's liaison office, told a reception that state-owned companies should also support the SAR in integrating into the country's development.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I hope state-owned enterprises will make good use of Hong Kong's unique advantages of having the backing of the motherland and being connected to the rest of the world," Zheng said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Mainland companies should continue to boost their investment in Hong Kong, and constantly improve their business strategies. They should also proactively take part in the Northern Metropolis development, fully support Hong Kong in consolidating its status as a financial, shipping, and trade centre, and in building an international innovation and technology centre."
  <br>
  <br>
  Zheng also urged companies to take root in Hong Kong and contribute to society.
  <br>
  <br>
  At the same event, Chief Executive John Lee described contributions to the Northern Metropolis development as "an investment with good returns" as he called on mainland firms to support the project.

 The government has backed a request by CUHK Medical Centre to extend a loan repayment period, saying it doesn't want to end up having to take back the hospital's site due to a default.
 <br>
  <br>
  In 2023, legislators agreed to a two-year extension to repayments of a HK$4 billion government loan, in view of financial difficulties brought on by the pandemic.
  <br>
  <br>
  The medical centre is now seeking another extension, of three years, saying it expects to make losses in the current financial year as well as in the next one, and its cash balance is insufficient to cover the repayments at present.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a Legco panel meeting on Friday, some lawmakers expressed concern that by 2028, the Chinese University would still be struggling to pay off the loan.
  <br>
  <br>
  "What will the hospital do to tackle such a big funding gap? I'm sure no one wants the hospital to come back to Legco for another repayment extension after three years," said DAB lawmaker Chan Wing-kwong, with the party's Starry Lee echoing his concerns.
  <br>
  <br>
  The chairman of the university's council, John Chai, told legislators that the medical centre will cut costs and find ways to boost revenue, for example by introducing more in-patient beds.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There are a pocket of measures, including strengthening the business model through governance, through better management of the operations, looking into means of increasing avenues of revenue, looking into resource efficiency," Chai said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Health Secretary Lo Chung-mau said if Legco doesn't approve the new extension before the middle of next month, CUHK will have to start repaying a first instalment of over HK$550 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If the medical centre fails to repay the loan, it is clearly stipulated in the contract that there will be an additional interest rate of three percent per annum," Lo said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If it still fails to repay the loan in the worst case scenario, the government will take back the medical centre, including the site and all the buildings or structures. We don't want to see this situation."
  <br>
  <br>
  The extension request will be submitted to Legco's Finance Committee for further discussion.
