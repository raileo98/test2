<div class="itemFullText">
 Motorists may soon have to pay HK$400 for an illegal parking ticket, a 25 percent increase, while metered parking spaces could cost HK$4 per 15 minutes, double the current rate, according to an RTHK source.
 <br>
  <br>
  RTHK has also learnt that fines for speeding and other traffic infringements could cost 50 percent more, as the government aims to improve road safety and enforcement efficiency.
  <br>
  <br>
  The final proposal is expected to be unveiled next week.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a Facebook post published on Wednesday, the Transport and Logistics Bureau pointed out that the fixed penalties for traffic contraventions have remained unchanged for over three decades.
  <br>
  <br>
  The fines were "significantly lower" than other regions in the world, the bureau added, citing examples in Singapore, London and the Australian state of New South Wales.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also noted a rise in dangerous behaviour such as speeding, not following road markings, and using mobile phones while driving, suggesting a need to raise fines to create a greater deterrence effect.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities also believe bumping up metered parking charges would deter drivers from circling the streets to look for a space.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials have at the same time pledged to increase off-street parking to cater to growing demand.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, owners of private electric cars could see the cost of driving go up further, as the bureau is looking to increase their licence fees.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a separate Facebook post, the bureau noted owners of such vehicles on average pay around HK$1,100 per year, compared to HK$7,500 for those who own private cars with internal combustion engines.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bureau is proposing a five-tier fee structure based on the vehicle’s rated power, and the adjustment will be implemented in phases over three years.
  <br>
  <br>
  The proposals will be discussed at the Legislative Council’s transport panel on April 25.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Legislators from the Business and Professionals Alliance (BPA) on Wednesday urged the government to roll out support measures for Hong Kong's business sector amid the ongoing trade war.
 <br>
  <br>
  The lawmakers said authorities should help companies obtain financing from banks and keep up with their cashflow, such as by allowing small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to defer loan repayments.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jeffrey Lam said the sector is having a hard time.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Some people are thinking of moving their production facilities out of Hong Kong into Asean countries," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But it's not easy. They need to find a site or a factory space, then equip it with their machines, train people.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It will take months.. So what's everybody going to do during this time when the factory is setting up? Paying a high price for merchandise. It is not fair to the people."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lam said SMEs are the "lifeline" of Hong Kong's economy and important driving forces of economic growth in the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  The lawmakers said the government should also work harder to attract foreign companies to Hong Kong, which includes setting up a fund to provide grants to leading enterprises.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Animal welfare groups on Wednesday urged the government to beef up penalties for animal cruelty and make Hong Kong a more pet-friendly city.
 <br>
  <br>
  At a press conference at the Legislative Council, the organisations said the current penalty of HK$200,000 and a jail term of three years is not enough.
  <br>
  <br>
  They want to increase the fine to HK$1 million and extend jail terms to seven years for a stronger deterrent effect.
  <br>
  <br>
  Susan Lai, founder of the Animal Rights and Welfare Association, said there are loopholes with the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Ordinance.
  <br>
  <br>
  “There is an urgent need to review the current legislation, including the addition of 'due diligence' in the legislation, and also increase the penalty regarding any animal cruelty case,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Currently it is very difficult to provide evidence, and successful prosecution cases are actually very low.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite there being nearly 500 animal cruelty cases reported in the first nine months of 2024, the prosecution rate was only three percent, official figures showed.
  <br>
  <br>
  North District councillor Corey Lau said authorities should also review restrictions for pets in restaurants and expand their access to public transport.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The demand is very high in Hong Kong because many pet owners want to transport and eat with their pets in the restaurants. That's why there's a demand for the improvement of the law,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  DAB lawmaker Edward Lau will meet officials from the Environment and Ecology Bureau to discuss these proposals later this month.

 Federation of Trade Unions lawmaker Bill Tang said all sectors of Hong Kong society should unite and pay attention to the importance of national security, one of the three messages that he said top Beijing official Xia Baolong told Hong Kong in his keynote speech marking the National Security Education Day on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to RTHK, Tang said people in Hong Kong, especially entrepreneurs, should prioritise national security over development, and they simply could not just focus on development and overlook national security.
  <br>
  <br>
  The FTU lawmaker said the speech by the director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office also emphasised the importance of remembering past events and remaining vigilant in times of peace.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tang also said Xia called for a clear recognition of the current situation and an understanding of the pressure facing China and the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  The lawmaker pointed out that it is essential to strengthen national education for the younger generation.

 Secretary for Transport and Logistics Mable Chan said on Wednesday that an electronic regime of fixed-penalty tickets is expected to be implemented on June 15 in an attempt to increase the overall efficiency of traffic enforcement.
 <br>
  <br>
  She also said a new thematic portal and mobile application for electronic traffic enforcement will be introduced, enabling vehicle owners and drivers to verify and view tickets online and make payments for penalties via electronic means.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The aim of digitalisation of traffic fixed penalty tickets is, in line with the direction of developing Hong Kong into a smart city, to increase the overall efficiency of traffic enforcement through the application of technology, improving the accuracy and speeding up the turnaround in the process of inputting, recording and retrieving information in relation to traffic offences or contraventions committed by offenders," she wrote in a written reply to the Legislative Council.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said the full implementation of the measure is estimated to save around HK$12.4 million a year as well as about HK$232 million notional savings in manpower through redeployment of staff to other traffic management duties.

    Ombudsman urges construction checks be stepped up

 Ombudsman Jack Chan said on Wednesday the government should step up inspections to ensure the construction sector carries out safety checks thoroughly.
 <br>
  <br>
  The call came after the Office of the Ombudsman completed a direct investigation operation into the enforcement of government regulations on occupational safety in the construction sector.
  <br>
  <br>
  It made 40 recommendations to the Labour Department, the Buildings Department and the Development Bureau.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said some examiners had not carried out any inspections before certifying the safety of equipment, such as lifting appliances and bamboo scaffolds.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the government should formulate an inspection checklist and set up an electronic platform for the sector to upload inspection records to facilitate monitoring.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We recommend the Labour Department require these examiners or certified persons to fill in a checklist… when they're checking the safety of these operations or appliances,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We propose to have a platform for these examiners to [upload] the examination records so that [they] could be easily checked by the Labour Department, and also make sure that they cannot fill in the form in advance because it's a real-time electronic platform.“
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said authorities should review the operational guidelines to select high-risk construction sites more precisely for in-depth surprise inspections.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also urged the Buildings Department to set up a mechanism to ensure timely follow-ups on cases referred to it by the Labour Department involving contractors who had been convicted of occupational safety and health offences.

    Frustration up over postal stop to US-bound parcels

<div class="itemFullText">
 Some locals have been left frustrated by Hongkong Post's announcement on Wednesday that it has suspended surface parcel deliveries to the United States with immediate effect.
 <br>
  <br>
  The move is made due to the longer shipping time required to deliver small parcels sent by surface mail in time to avoid the US tariffs that are coming into effect from May 2, given that Hongkong Post "will definitely not collect any so-called tariffs on behalf of the US".
  <br>
  <br>
  Air delivery services will also be suspended starting from April 27.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, postal items that only contain documents are not affected.
  <br>
  <br>
  Freda Cheung, who runs an online business that often requires her to send airmail parcels to the United States, said the move will greatly affect her.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I don't think I will use other courier services because the tax is too high for me," she told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So I will reject all US-bound packages."
  <br>
  <br>
  Cheung said she will adopt a wait-and-see approach for now, adding that she might consider marketing for other countries like the ones in Europe.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another resident, Chan, said he felt powerless, even though he only occasionally sends parcels to a friend in the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With the US imposing tariffs, there's nothing we can do as Hong Kong has to abide by it too," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There's nothing we can change.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'll still pay the tariffs. There's no other way."
  <br>
  <br>
  A man, Yeung, who sometimes sends parcel to his US relatives, said he will consider using international shipping companies.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, he will only do so when there is an urgent need as he will have to pay more.

 Police announced on Wednesday a new pilot programme to monitor traffic violations at four locations using security cameras starting on Tuesday, with the aim of enhancing road safety and enforcement efficiency.
 <br>
  <br>
  The initiative will leverage the Transport Department’s existing traffic control and surveillance system, including CCTV systems, to detect unsafe driving.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fixed penalty notices will be issued to offenders once drivers are identified through captured licence plate details and timestamps of violations.
  <br>
  <br>
  The superintendent of traffic management at the traffic branch headquarters, Nip Hoi-kwan, said the programme expands enforcement capabilities.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the past, the Transport Department's traffic control and surveillance system did not have video recording capabilities," Nip said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The purpose of this plan is simply to provide officers with an additional enforcement option.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Based on traffic conditions or their experience, officers will assess when congestion is likely to be more serious, and during those times, personnel will be sent to the control centre to monitor the traffic situation and activate the recording function."
  <br>
  <br>
  The first phase targets Queen’s Road Central's intersections with Ice House Street, Pedder Street and Bonham Strand as well as the Queen's Road East intersection with Wong Nai Chung Road.
  <br>
  <br>
  The superintendent of the enforcement and control division of traffic Hong Kong Island, Mak Chung-kit, said these sites were chosen due to recurring violations and their disproportionate impact on broader traffic flow.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the past, we have continuously deployed our officers, whether for patrolling, law enforcement or directing traffic, and have invested a significant amount of manpower and resources," Mak said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "However, traffic violations and congestion at the affected locations often reoccur shortly after our officers leave.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We found that the effectiveness of our officers' presence is very short-lived.
  <br>
  <br>
  "At these four locations, traffic violations such as illegal parking, illegal pick-ups and drop-offs or yellow box junction obstructions can cause congestion that, even in a very short period of time, will impact nearby major roads and even affect trunk roads."
  <br>
  <br>
  The police said the aim is to bolster public compliance with traffic laws, reduce accident risks and alleviate congestion through sustained monitoring.
  <br>
  <br>
  The three-month pilot will undergo a review before potential expansion, with outcomes informing future enforcement strategies.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong needs to seek new growth opportunities amid global uncertainties, such as developing e-commerce and the silver economy, says Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development Algernon Yau.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on RTHK's Overview Policy programme on Wednesday, Yau said geopolitical challenges and supply-chain disruptions are affecting the city's economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Under these circumstances, Hong Kong must seek new ways forward," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There are many good examples, such as the chief executive leading multiple visits to the Middle East and Asean countries."
  <br>
  <br>
  While the SAR has traditionally relied on trade with Europe and the United States, there is a need to seek new economic partnerships to mitigate geopolitical influences, Yau said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Noting the mainland's impressive e-commerce transaction volumes last year, he said online shopping is one key area that Hong Kong can tap into.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yau said a shopping festival held in August attracted a good response from the mainland, with 230 brands participating and more than 90 million impressions on discussion forums and the official website.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister also highlighted the importance of developing a silver economy, noting that around one-third of Hong Kong's population – or 2.67 million people – will be over 65 years old by 2043.
  <br>
  <br>
  "While we need to address welfare issues for elderly people from grassroots groups, there are also many middle-class or better-off seniors who own properties and have pension funds," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "How can we stimulate consumption among this demographic?
  <br>
  <br>
  "Despite their substantial economic power, society seems to pay little attention to their spending needs," Yau said.
  <br>
  <br>
  A government working group on the silver economy is focused on five areas: boosting consumption, developing the industry, promoting quality assurance, enhancing financial security and unleashing productivity.

 Hong Kong, China's junior men’s epee team made history at the World Cadets and Juniors Fencing Championships in Wuxi, clinching their first-ever bronze medal in the event - a landmark achievement for the SAR.
 <br>
  <br>
  The quartet of Gao Ying-chuen, Kenton Hsu, Wong Chi-ho, and Yuen Nok-man stormed through the early rounds, overcoming the Netherlands, Germany and Ukraine in succession to secure a spot in the semifinals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Although they were stopped by Canada in their quest for gold, the team regrouped for a dramatic bronze-medal showdown against Hungary.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a tense finale, Hong Kong narrowly edged out their rivals 45-43.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trailing 23-25 at halftime, Yuen turned the tide with a gritty 3-1 rally in the sixth round to level the score at 26-26.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong then ignited a commanding 9-3 surge, propelling Hong Kong to a 35-29 lead and cementing their path to victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  Italy claimed gold in the event, with Canada securing silver.
  <br>
  <br>
  The men’s team bronze, combined with Wu Haidi’s earlier third-place finish in the women’s cadet individual epee, capped Hong Kong’s campaign with two medals - a record haul for the SAR at the championships.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hongkong Post announced on Wednesday an immediate suspension of parcel services to the United States via surface mail, due to the longer shipping time as small parcels are due to be hit by US tariffs from May 2.
 <br>
  <br>
  It said it would contact the senders of such mail to make return and refund arrangements from April 22 if their parcels had not yet been shipped to the US.
  <br>
  <br>
  For air parcels, services will stop from April 27.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The US is unreasonable, bullying and imposing tariffs abusively. Hongkong Post will definitely not collect any so-called tariffs on behalf of the US and will suspend the acceptance of postal items containing goods destined to the US," a statement said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other postal items containing documents only without goods will not be affected.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee said the Greater Bay Area (GBA) offers a key development opportunity for local tourism.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lee made the comments in a speech at the 2025 World Tourism Cities Federation Hong Kong Fragrant Hills Tourism Summit held in the SAR on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CE pointed out that the GBA has a population of over 86 million and a combined GDP rivalling that of the world's 10th largest economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  "What it means is a consumer market and source of tourists that is over 10 times as large as our own city. What it also means, with our country’s facilitation measures for travellers, is that visitors who choose to visit this part of the world have much more cities to add to their itinerary," Lee said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are fast developing in multi-destination tourism for an interconnected world."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee also said the SAR is dedicated to free and open trade, despite global trade tensions.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An association representing global mobile operators said on Tuesday Hong Kong is a pivotal region for the development of innovation and technology and that it can learn from the mainland.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Groupe Speciale Mobile Association (GSMA) said operators on the mainland and in Hong Kong are leaders in the development and implementation of artificial intelligence solutions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking after the Asia-Pacific Summit of the World Internet Conference, association chief executive and director John Hoffman said Hong Kong should make use of its development centres and talent to further promote AI development.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[The companies] are leading in many aspects of not only the development of AI through companies like DeepSeek and others that are pushing the boundaries of AI, but then to turn around and implement them in a way that it benefits society," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's not technology for technology's sake, but it's technology for the betterment of industry, businesses, government and of course society."
  <br>
  <br>
  Hoffman said the mainland has some of the largest mobile operators in the world and Hong Kong should make use of its proximity to the mainland to learn from the firms.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think Hong Kong has proven in the past that it's a place of export," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's a place where others can learn from... Hong Kong must seize that opportunity to learn from the mainland, then adapt and modify to its local conditions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hopefully the rest of the world can look to Hong Kong and say 'This is a great solution. Let me try something similar'."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Digital Policy Office on Tuesday released guidelines on the application of generative AI, aiming to facilitate the safe and responsible use of AI by the industry and the public.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hoffman said guidelines on the use of AI must be localised but stressed that they should be established under a framework that allows innovation to further develop.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Mainland and SAR scholars on Tuesday called on the Hong Kong government to ramp up its vigilance against the so-called "soft confrontations", saying external powers such as the United States could double down on its suppression efforts against China via "ideological wars".
 <br>
  <br>
  Such comments came as the city marks the 10th National Security Education Day, with a forum held in the afternoon featuring the subject of soft confrontations, or "soft resistance", which refers to forces that focused on ideological warfare.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at the forum, Huang Dahui, a School of International Studies professor at Renmin University of China, noted that soft confrontation has emerged as a new battlefield and strategy among major powers and warned that Hong Kong is susceptible to such ideological warfare.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We all know that Hong Kong is a diverse, open and highly interconnected society," he told forum participants.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And therefore Hong Kong's interests, social composition and ideologies are also very diverse.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With such features, Hong Kong is more susceptible to this kind of soft confrontation cognitive warfare.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And soft confrontations are more likely to work here," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The professor, also the chief expert in the National Security Interdisciplinary Platform, further elaborated that such soft confrontations often come in the form of "spreading fake information" to confuse the public and represent a cognitive theory of western nations.
  <br>
  <br>
  He called on the SAR government to adopt more technologies to further improve its monitoring and warning systems to guard against such "psychological warfare", while ramping up its regulations to minimise risks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, Lau Siu-kai, a consultant to the Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macau Studies, said at the same event that soft confrontations have become even more effective following the rapid development of social media, making them potentially even more powerful than military, diplomatic and espionage measures.
  <br>
  <br>
  The senior member of the leading national think tank warned that he believes external forces, including the United States, will double down by using soft confrontations to suppress the mainland and Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Since conducting 'hard confrontations' is very difficult at present, soft confrontations have become an important means of political struggle," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I expect the United States will increase its efforts to suppress and smear China's rise and Hong Kong's development in the future.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I expect external forces will continue to launch propaganda wars against Hong Kong, intending to cause divisions and struggles in Hong Kong in order to undermine its international image."

 Commissioner of Customs and Excise Chan Tsz-tat said on Tuesday free trade and globalisation are losing momentum in the face of a wave of US tariffs.

  He said global tariffs imposed by the United States had brought significant challenges and uncertainty to international trade but that Hong Kong would support free trade by sticking to its zero-tariffs regime on imports.
  <br>
  <br>
  The customs chief urged trade partners in the Asia-Pacific region to work together to protect multilateralism.
  <br>
  <br>
  “In these challenging times, we call on our Asia-Pacific partners to stand united, promote multilateral collaboration and strengthen trust between the public and private sectors,” Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We must work together to develop innovative and forward-looking solutions that cater for the benefits of all members and stakeholders in the supply chain, ensuring that e-commerce continues to contribute to global prosperity in a safe, secure and efficient manner.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking after the opening ceremony, Chan said the tariffs are not affecting Customs’ works at border control points.
  <br>
  <br>
  For his part, Cuong Ba Tran, the assistant director and head of the Asean Secretariat’s trade facilitation division, said experts from the World Customs Organization and e-commerce giants such as DHL and Alibaba have joined the three-day conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the conference provides good opportunities for Asean countries to gain expertise and experiences from Hong Kong Customs and experts on e-commerce.

 The director of the central government's liaison office Zheng Yanxiong said on Tuesday that Hong Kong should push for greater development and contribute more to the nation.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at the opening ceremony of the National Security Education Day, Zheng pointed out that the office will fully implement the central government's request to fully support the chief executive and SAR government to turn Beijing's hopes into concrete actions.
  <br>
  <br>
  The director said Hong Kong should firmly coordinate high-quality development and a high level of security to achieve a positive interaction.
  <br>
  <br>
  He emphasised that if security cannot be maintained, development will not be solid.
  <br>
  <br>
  If development is delayed and neglected, the basis of security will not be firm, Zheng said, adding that Hong Kong has to maintain its positive momentum.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also said that the SAR should contribute more to the nation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The new phase of Hong Kong has both traditional strengths, as well as new advantages, such as AI, research and development, innovation and technology, talent hub and coordinated development with the Greater Bay Area, etc.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It even has unique strengths such as institutional innovation and acting as a gateway between the mainland and the world."
  <br>
  <br>
  The liaison office director also stressed that safeguarding national security needs continuous effort.

    Energy efficiency varies for even best split-level ACs

<div class="itemFullText">
 Consumers should read through seasonal performance factor indicators for split-level air conditioners and not just their energy-efficiency labels before making a purchase, the Consumer Council said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The call came after the watchdog tested 12 two-horsepower models priced between HK$9,888 and HK$20,580, with seven of them being cooling-only models and the other five also having heating capabilities.
  <br>
  <br>
  All models were rated Grade 1 under the Electrical and Mechanical Services Department’s (EMSD) energy-efficiency labeling scheme.
  <br>
  <br>
  The council found that two of the cooling-only models and two of the cooling and heating models provided less capacity than claimed.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Even after checking to make sure [the appliance] is of Grade 1, what you can do is to refer to the CSPF (cooling energy efficiency) and also the HSPF (heating energy efficiency) factors," said the council's chief executive Gilly Wong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "From our findings this time, the maximum difference can be about 27 percent and 10 percent respectively, for cooling and also heating.
  <br>
  <br>
  “By looking at these factors, you can identify a product that can offer you the best energy-efficiency performance,” she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Based on the current electricity cost of HK$1.70 per kWh, consumers can save around HK$400 a year by using cooling models that are more energy efficient if they are turned on for 12 hours daily for 180 days.
  <br>
  <br>
  For heating functions, the savings only amount to only HK$17, but that's based on the assumption the machine is in use for 12 hours daily for just 25 days.
  <br>
  <br>
  As such, the council suggested the EMSD upgrade its energy label grading standards to help consumers save on energy use and encourage suppliers to provide more energy-efficient products.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also urged sellers to extend product coverage, after finding seven models only provided one-year full warranties and that one model offered no warranty renewal options.
  <br>
  <br>
  The consumer watchdog said consumers are required to pay maintenance costs for the machines after the period, such as on-site inspections and scaffolding.

    HK to grasp opportunities arising from tariff war: CE

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday said Hong Kong will grasp the opportunities brought by a new economic and trade order amid the tariff war.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at the opening ceremony of the National Security Education Day, Lee slammed the United States for being "ridiculous" and "making wrong calculations" after the country imposed a total of 145 percent tariffs on Chinese imports.
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted Hong Kong does not levy tariffs on imports and exports, and that the moves by the US are damaging the multilateral trading system.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee said the SAR should be fully prepared for challenges, and make good use of its strengths as an international financial centre.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The trade war has changed the world's economic and trade order. A new order will be formed. In the process, there are both risks and opportunities for Hong Kong," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are looking into possible opportunities that can be generated by the new order. Hong Kong is a free port with zero tariffs, and this can attract more trade and business activities."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee said Hong Kong will explore new markets and deepen regional cooperation, such as with Asean, the Middle East and Belt and Road countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that stability has been restored in Hong Kong after the national security law took effect five years ago, but the city should be prepared for turbulent and stormy times.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We must always remember that the aftermath of the 2019 black-clad violence has not come to an end. There are still attempts at the resurgence of anti-China and anti-Hong Kong forces, with acts of soft resistance, and inciting disgust and hatred," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee added the government will use new methods to promote national security education, such as making use of different media platforms and technologies.

    Xia Baolong: United States after our very survival

<img alt="" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&w=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fexternal-content.duckduckgo.com%2Fiu%2F%3Fu%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fi3.wp.com%252Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%252Fimages%252Fmfile_1800428_1_20250415112731.jpg%253Fulb%253Dtrue%2526quality%253D99%2526w%253D1080&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Beijing's top official overseeing SAR affairs on Tuesday slammed the United States for imposing heavy tariffs on Hong Kong, calling the move "extremely arrogant and shameless".
 <br>
  <br>
  Xia Baolong, the director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, said in a video address that the up to 145 percent US tariffs on SAR goods showed "the US isn't after our tariffs – it is after our very survival".
  <br>
  <br>
  Addressing the opening ceremony of the National Security Education Day, Xia said the US levies were particularly unreasonable given the SAR is a free port with no tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This makes it clearer to the world that the US cannot tolerate Hong Kong's prosperity and stability, and it is the biggest 'sinister manipulator' undermining human rights, freedom, the rule of law, prosperity and stability in Hong Kong," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xia said the US has continued its suppression and containment of the SAR time and time again, adding that these actions will ultimately backfire.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Let those American peasants wail before the 5,000-year-old civilisation of the Chinese nation! History and reality tell us that the Chinese people will never accept bullying and all Chinese people, including Hong Kong compatriots, cannot be intimidated or overwhelmed," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Chinese have a proverb – strike a punch to avoid a hundred punches... Whether it is a tariff war, trade war, or any other kind of war, we have nothing to fear. The sky will not fall," Xia added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Beijing official also criticised the US for sanctioning six mainland and Hong Kong officials, accusing it of fabricating the so-called 2025 Hong Kong Policy Act Report, "once again exposing US' bullying and hegemonic true colours and its ugly face of hysteria born of desperation".
  <br>
  <br>
  And while Hong Kong appears calm on the surface, Xia warned of underlying security concerns and stressed that the struggle is not over.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Those who are opposed to China and attempt to destabilise Hong Kong have not yet been eliminated... Many people still have confused ideas, some sympathise with those who are opposed to China and attempt to destabilise Hong Kong, some justify them, and some admire, fear, worship or fantasise about the US."
  <br>
  <br>
  He expressed confidence in Hong Kong's business sector despite US pressure on China, saying that enterprises will continue to thrive with the city's unique advantages and strong backing from the nation.

 Over 300 primary and secondary schools as well as kindergartens, involving nearly 160,000 students across Hong Kong, held flag-raising ceremonies to mark National Security Education Day on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Organised by the Association of Hong Kong Flag-guards, officials from the Home and Youth Affairs Bureau, the Education Bureau and the police attended the event’s main flag-raising ceremony at the Hennessy Road Government Primary School (Causeway Bay).
  <br>
  <br>
  A pupil surnamed Wong, who is part of the flag-raising team there, said representing her school in the ceremony filled her with pride.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The reason I joined the flag-raising team was to try something new and to see how the team actually operates. After two years of training, I truly feel that being part of the flag-raising team is very worthwhile because I get to be a part of many events," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "After each ceremony, I usually reflect on where I didn't do well, so that I can improve for the next one."
  <br>
  <br>
  Another student, also surnamed Wong, serves as the flag bearer on the team, and is responsible for raising the flag.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Normally, we have training on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays each week. The training sessions can sometimes be quite tough because we have to practise marching under the sun, and it gets really hot," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "However, through the process, we learn to develop a sense of perseverance to overcome hardship."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chau Sai-yiu, chairman of the Association of Hong Kong Flag-guards, said that national security is the cornerstone of a nation’s stability and prosperity, as well as the bedrock of people’s peaceful livelihoods.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We must cherish the current peace and prosperity in Hong Kong. We have gone from chaos to stability, and this peaceful life is thanks to national security. So we all must strengthen our awareness of safeguarding national security," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We must unite, remain vigilant and support the government in jointly maintaining national security and social stability."

 Chief Secretary Eric Chan said on Tuesday society's awareness of national security has reached new heights.
 <br>
  <br>
  He was officiating at a flag-raising ceremony at Hong Kong Police College in Wong Chuk Hang to mark the 10th National Security Education Day.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said safeguarding national security is the SAR's top priority.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have seen growth and development in national security education over the past decade," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Under the joint efforts of the government and all sectors of society, awareness of and attention to national security have reached new levels with various events and promotion of national security education."
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted that during the 25th anniversary of Macau's return to the motherland last year, President Xi Jinping outlined four principles for One Country, Two Systems to be implemented steadfastly and successfully,  one of which includes the safeguarding of a high level of security to boost high quality development.
  <br>
  <br>
  This, Chan said, fully demonstrates the key role that national security plays in the nation's survival and development.
  <br>
  <br>
  He emphasised that high quality economic and social development could only be achieved with a high level of security.
  <br>
  <br>
  Therefore, safeguarding national security is the responsibility of every citizen and the common mission of society, Chan added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Secretary for Security Chris Tang, newly appointed Police Commissioner Joe Chow and Commissioner of Customs and Excise Chan Tsz-tat were among those at the ceremony.

 As Hong Kong moves towards legalising basketball betting, Secretary for Home and Youth Affairs Alice Mak stressed the government does not encourage gambling but that it's necessary to respond to demand.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong Jockey Club is working on plans towards legalising basketball betting and members of the public can submit their views regarding the proposed legislation until May 2.
  <br>
  <br>
  The consultation document also states that betting on local basketball matches will be prohibited.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a Legislative Council panel meeting on Monday, Mak spoke about the need to regulate betting activity.

  “There is, however, undeniably an actual and persistent demand for gambling in Hong Kong which, if left unregulated, would likely give rise to illegal gambling activities and associated social problems and other criminal activities,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I want to make it very clear that, on illegal gambling, no matter which type of events or sports are involved, we will crack down on any illegal betting stringently.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Mak told lawmakers that the government will educate the public on the harms of gambling addiction, and provide counseling and support services to people in need.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Jockey Club earlier estimated that HK$1.5 billion in tax revenue could be generated each year after basketball betting is legalised.

 Financial Secretary Paul Chan said on Monday the global trade war could endanger global technology development.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at the inaugural World Internet Conference Asia Pacific Summit on Monday, he said governments and regulators around the world are facing challenges in such areas as cybersecurity, data privacy and cross-border regulatory arbitrage but that digital fragmentation is a more urgent concern.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The trade war initiated by the United States is likely to extend beyond tariffs," Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We can foresee more barriers, ‘larger yards’ and ‘higher walls,’ which could stifle innovation and jeopardise global technological progress,” Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  In order to deal with the challenges and hold on to opportunities brought by the digital economy, he said the government has established a concrete action plan, which covers areas like digital infrastructure and governance, digital transformation, cross-boundary flow of data and talent development.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at another conference, one on Jiangsu-Hong Kong innotech, he also said the US trade war is affecting the international trade order and putting the global industrial and supply chains at risk of disruptions.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said Hong Kong will make good use of its connectivity with both the mainland and the world and join hands with more mainland enterprises to attract investment from around the world.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Drainage Services Department says the number of emergency response teams for extreme weather events will be increased this year from 160 to 180 for deployment in more than 30 operational stations.
 <br>
  <br>
  Department director Ringo Mok said the increase was made based on multiple factors, including resource availability and the current ability to respond to and bring flooding incidents under control within one to two hours.
  <br>
  <br>
  'If we further increase the number of emergency teams by 20... that will be sufficient for us to cope with extreme weather," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "At the same time, the increase in the number of emergency teams can reduce the deployment time as well as working time."
  <br>
  <br>
  The department will continue to apply innovative technology in flood prevention works, including robots that help to examine, clean and drain sewage, which has been in use since 2021.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among them are Crawler-type survey robots, River bots and Mobile Powerful Pumping Robot.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Yuen Long, an estimated HK$4.6 billion has been spent on a flood prevention construction project undergoing since May 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  The project includes a super drainage pump that can drain water volumes the equivalent of seven Olympic-size swimming pools, as well as automatic flood protection walls.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The progress of the Yuen Long project is going very well, and the project will be completed in stages by 2030... and the first part of the flood prevention facilities will be actually put into use by 2027," said Mok.

<img alt="Path of Democracy co-convenor Ray Poon, right, says the government can hold more promotional events to communicate the SAR’s actual situation. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&w=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fexternal-content.duckduckgo.com%2Fiu%2F%3Fu%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fi3.wp.com%252Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%252Fimages%252Fmfile_1800325_1_20250414170630.jpg%253Fulb%253Dtrue%2526quality%253D99%2526w%253D1080&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Foreign investors' and workers’ confidence in Hong Kong remains positive despite the challenges the SAR faced in the past five years, a think tank said on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Path of Democracy conducted a study last year to investigate the international community’s views on the city’s business environment, interviewing 12 foreign chambers of commerce and over 600 expats.
  <br>
  <br>
  It found that chamber representatives and around 70 percent of expats polled hold a neutral or positive attitude towards doing business in the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  “A lot of expats and the international business community are optimistic towards Hong Kong’s business environment, even though there is intense competition from other cities including Sydney, Dubai, Riyadh and Singapore,” said co-convenor Ray Poon.
  <br>
  <br>
  He suggested that the government should hold more promotional events for overseas trade to communicate the SAR’s actual situation to counter biased reports from Western media.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the think tank said Hong Kong’s economic stability and status as a free port remains strong amid US tariffs, with only about one percent of the city’s total exports last year shipped to the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  The figure, it said, does not include re-export trading, which is largely made up of mainland goods.
  <br>
  <br>
  The group added Hong Kong mainly exports garment, toys, and electronic products to the US, accounting for HK$6.1 billion. It said businesses could consider selling these products to other markets, such as Japan, South Korea, and Asean countries instead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Path of Democracy also pointed out that exports to the US is not Hong Kong's economic lifeline, and over 90 percent of the city’s GDP relies on the service industry.
  <br>
  <br>
  It called for residents to stay resilient under the ever-changing policies of US president Donald Trump.

<img alt="GSMA chief executive John Hoffman says China Mobile, China Telecom and China Unicom have helped in moves to unlock innovations in the mobile ecosystem.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Tech leaders from all over the world gathered in Hong Kong for the inaugural World Internet Conference Asia Pacific Summit on Monday, calling for stronger international partnerships in areas such as artificial intelligence, digital infrastructure and cybersecurity.
 <br>
  <br>
  The event brought in around 1,000 participants from governments, industries and technology organisations.
  <br>
  <br>
  In an opening-ceremony address, Hudaygulyyev Shihmyradowich, who chairs Turkmenistan’s state agency for communications and cybersecurity, said it's important to establish inclusive global cybersecurity standards amid the rapid advancement in artificial intelligence.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Artificial intelligence is a key factor for advancing the digital economy, and Turkmenistan is ready to actively work with all interested partners within the framework of international cooperation to ensure that the use of AI is accessible to all and brings real benefits to our citizens and global community,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  For his part, John Hoffman, chief executive of GSMA – a global trade association representing mobile network operators – said a community platform has been established to help firms explore AI use cases and set industry standards.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The group is currently made up of 12 industry players, and we’re grateful to have the support of these Chinese stakeholders, China Mobile, China Telecom and China Unicom, who have been pioneers in this space,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “And as a global organisation representing the mobile ecosystem, we know how valuable these collaborations are and I can’t wait to see the innovation unlocked by the community.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Hoffman also highlighted the need for a structured framework to guide the responsible use of AI, saying 20 organisations, including two from China, have adopted GSMA’s framework.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the chairman of Ghana Dot Com Nii Quaynor, often known as the “father of the Internet in Africa”, stressed the importance of creating a digital world that benefits everyone.
  <br>
  <br>
  Quaynor, who established some of Africa’s first internet connections in the early 1990s, noted that while the continent’s  internet user base is growing rapidly, it still faces barriers such as a fragile infrastructure.
  <br>
  <br>
  He warned of three divides that are holding the continent back in realising its AI potential.
  <br>
  <br>
  “First, technical capacities and educational preparedness for adoption needs to improve to avoid division.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Secondly, the cost of equipment and infrastructure for training AI imposes an economic divide on participation on the supply side of AI.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Lastly, the electrical power to run these machines limits the ability to participate beyond user level, not to mention the need for bandwidth to even load parameters of models,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Quaynor said he hopes to explore cooperation opportunities through the summit and get his region more involved in the global tech supply chain.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Beijing's top official overseeing Hong Kong and Macau affairs, Xia Baolong, is scheduled to deliver a keynote speech via video link at the 10th National Security Education Day on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Organised by the Committee for Safeguarding National Security of the SAR, the ceremony and a seminar will take place at the Convention and Exhibition Centre in the morning.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, Chief Executive John Lee expressed gratitude to Xia, director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, for his guidance and support for Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee pointed out that this year marks the fifth anniversary of the promulgation of the National Security Law, as well as the first anniversary of the implementation of the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance.
  <br>
  <br>
  "At present, the world is undergoing unprecedented changes at an accelerating pace. The geopolitical landscape is getting complicated, regional conflicts are frequent, global economic growth is slowing down, and unilateralism and protectionism are on the rise, all contributing to increasing global instability.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With Hong Kong faced with ever-changing national security risks, the HKSAR Government will resolutely, fully and faithfully implement the 'One Country, Two Systems' principle, deepen the understanding of a holistic approach to national security, continuously improve the legal system and enforcement mechanisms for safeguarding national security, and actively promote national security education across society," Lee said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CE also said the authorities will co-ordinate school and community activities to promote national security education.

    Don't judge healthcare reform by fee hikes, Lo says

<img alt="Health chief Lo Chung-mau insisted the reform is not meant to generate extra revenue but intended to focus resources on helping those who most require medical attention. Photo: Legco" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&w=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fexternal-content.duckduckgo.com%2Fiu%2F%3Fu%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fi3.wp.com%252Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%252Fimages%252Fmfile_1800289_1_20250414133802.jpg%253Fulb%253Dtrue%2526quality%253D99%2526w%253D1080&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The health secretary says it is unreasonable to judge upcoming changes in public hospital charges simply by focusing on fee increases for certain services, stressing that an extra 1.1 million people will be eligible for partial or full fee waivers under the proposal.
 <br>
  <br>
  At a Legislative Council panel meeting, Lo Chung-mau fielded questions on the reform, which is set to take effect from January.
  <br>
  <br>
  Election committee representative Chan Wing-kwong noted that people seeking general outpatient services will soon have to pay HK$150 per consultation, triple the current amount.
  <br>
  <br>
  "What factors do you consider when deciding on the new fee level?" he asked.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I understand there are fee waivers, but for those who are not eligible, how do you ensure they receive prompt medical assistance even when they are facing financial difficulties?"
  <br>
  <br>
  In response, Lo said it was unreasonable to judge the reform simply by focusing on how much more patients will have to pay.
  <br>
  <br>
  He stressed the government’s goal is to gradually reduce the subsidy rate for public hospital services from 97.6 to 90 percent over five years.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I wouldn't say a reduction to 90 percent is our ultimate goal either because the reform will continue," Lo said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We also need to evaluate the overall sustainability of Hong Kong's healthcare system and financing.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Right now we’re adjusting the fees based on the subsidy rate.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We wish to retain a higher subsidy rate for in-patient and complicated services, while the subsidy level will be lowered for outpatient and minor cases."
  <br>
  <br>
  The health secretary added that the aim of the reform is to focus resources on helping the most critically ill patients, while 1.4 million people will benefit from a revamped fee waiver mechanism, up from the existing 300,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  But many lawmakers felt it was not easy for patients to find out if they are eligible for the waiver or which procedures will be covered.
  <br>
  <br>
  Federation of Trade Unions lawmaker Kingsley Wong said people receiving welfare payments will obviously be eligible but noted there are only 600,000 or so of them.
  <br>
  <br>
  "What about the remaining 800,000 people – how can they tell if they’re eligible too?" he asked.
  <br>
  <br>
  David Lam, who represents the medical and health services sector, wanted to know if patients can pre-register for waivers or only find out whether they are eligible after a consultation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lo said any fee reduction is time-sensitive as the patient must meet income and asset requirements.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As long as authorities are well prepared and applications are not unduly delayed, there is no need for patients to pre-apply first," he replied.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hospital Authority chief executive Tony Ko said patients who face sudden financial hardships can seek a one-off waiver from a social worker.

 Tech businesses attending  the World Internet Conference Asia-Pacific Summit in Hong Kong on Monday expressed confidence in navigating escalating trade tensions between the United States and China.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on the sidelines of the summit, Keeson Technology, a leading Chinese manufacturer of high-tech beds and other sleep products, said the company will not give up on the American market despite tariff pressures.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chairman Jack Tang said that to mitigate the tariff impact, the company has diversified its supply chain across different regions, including Southeast Asia and North America.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We will focus on building our supply chain more reasonably because our products are very popular in the US market – in fact, we've captured over 50 percent of market share,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “At its core, this isn't really about the trade war but about meeting essential consumer needs.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With our current diversified setup, we believe we can effectively avoid the negative impacts of these trade tensions.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Fano Labs, a locally based AI startup that specialises in speech recognition and conversation analysis for fraud detection, said it has yet to feel any impact from the US tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Co-founder and chief executive Miles Wen said that’s because of the company's software-based business model and global demand for its services.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the company is also looking to tap new markets for growth opportunities.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I think there's a little bit of tension between the two big nations, but many other markets are more neutral and looking more towards economic growth," Wen said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That's where people can look at.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That's also why we're looking at markets in Australia, Europe and Southeast Asia,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wen stressed as a startup that is a spin-off from a University of Hong Kong research team, it also needs stronger support from the government as part of its efforts to bolster the city’s tech sector.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Monday called on global firms to pursue their business expansion in collaboration with the SAR at a time of spiralling global geopolitical and trade tensions.
 <br>
  <br>
  He made the remarks at the opening of the World Internet Conference Asia Pacific Summit 2025 at the Convention and Exhibition Centre in Wan Chai, where some 1,000 political and business elites as well as academics from over 30 countries and regions gathered to discuss the latest technological advancements in the internet industry.
  <br>
  <br>
  The opening of the two-day summit also marks the event's debut in the SAR, after previously being mainly held in Wuzhen in Hangzhou, Zhejiang, over the past decade.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee said Hong Kong has a lot to offer as he called on global investors and firms to prioritise collaboration in these particularly  challenging times.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong champions free trade and multilateralism," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We believe in teamwork and offer a range of welcoming programmes for investors, companies, researchers and other strategic talent.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong welcomes all business interests from those who are keen to pursue development with us.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In this global city, we will make a dedicated difference for you and your future."
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, Lee noted that the SAR is dedicated to maximising the use of artificial intelligence technology to assist the city in its goal of "new industrialisation".
  <br>
  <br>
  He also said he believes the Northern Metropolis, which occupies a site equivalent to up to a third of the city's land area and sits next to Shenzhen, will emerge as a global top innovation and technology (I&T) hub.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm confident that our collaborative efforts with Shenzhen, and throughout the Greater Bay Area, will see the rise of Hetao Shenzhen-Hong Kong Science and Technology Innovation Co-operation Zone as a world-class I&T hub, creating a critical source of new quality productive forces for the country," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Themed “Integration of AI and Digital Technologies Shaping the Future – Jointly Building a Community with a Shared Future in Cyberspace”, the event's Hong Kong debut also marks the first time that the WIC, also known as the Wuzhen Summit, is hosting an Asia-Pacific edition of the event.
  <br>
  <br>
  Key topics during the event's forums includes tech trends in AI, digital finance, e-government and smart living.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Schools across Hong Kong are embracing creative ways to mark National Security Education Day this Tuesday, which will blend interactive learning with civic engagement to deepen students’ understanding of the nation’s heritage, security and cultural values.
 <br>
  <br>
  Educators aim to promote national security education in ways that resonate beyond textbooks, through quizzes, hands-on exhibits and cross-border exchanges.
  <br>
  <br>
  One of the schools, Ma On Shan Ling Liang Primary School, recently launched a “School History Room and National Education Archive" centre housing historical displays, national education books and rotating exhibitions to bring lessons to life.
  <br>
  <br>
  Classes regularly attend specialised sessions there, exploring topics ranging from national security to other topics like flood prevention.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the learning does not stop beyond the classroom doors.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the hallways, students can deepen their knowledge about the nation by taking quizzes on large touch screens. Correct answers reward participants with prizes from a large capsule vending machine.
  <br>
  <br>
  “There are questions about ethnic minority groups in the game. While playing the game, I get to learn about the cultures of the different groups, so I enjoy playing it quite a bit,” said Sin, a primary four pupil.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another student, Lee, said the rewards had piqued her curiousity about the nation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the school’s flag-raising team had also gained first-hand insight on the ceremony during a two-day exchange trip to Shenzhen last October.
  <br>
  <br>
  Team member Choi said she was inspired by the discipline and precision demonstrated by flag-raising teams on the mainland.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vice Principal Yuen Kin-ming said that the school is committed to making education engaging.
  <br>
  <br>
  “When it comes to history and culture, classroom teaching alone has its limits. By placing interactive displays in common areas, students absorb knowledge naturally as they walk by,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We want learning to feel organic, not forced. We don’t want them to just memorise things rigidly, like in dictation exercises. What we really hope is for them to absorb knowledge gradually.”
  <br>
  <br>
  When asked about the one-off HK$300,000 government subsidy for Chinese cultural immersion activities, Yuen shared plans to host traditional lion dances and Chinese opera-style face-changing performances.
  <br>
  <br>
  He offered assurances that the funds are being used thoughtfully to enrich students’ connection to Chinese heritage.

    SF Express stops SMS messages for pickups

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 SF Express Hong Kong announced that it will stop sending SMS text messages to customers starting on Monday in the wake of a rising risk of fraudulent scams posed by counterfeit messages.
 <br>
  <br>
  The courier said all notifications for package pick-ups will now be sent exclusively through the official mobile application.
  <br>
  <br>
  The company said it received more than 800 inquiries and reports of fraud in the first quarter, a nearly fourfold increase compared to the same period last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Most of the cases involved scammers sending text messages that masqueraded as having emanated from the company and claiming delivery addresses were incomplete or required additional shipping fees, it said, thereby tricking individuals into entering personal information on fake websites or making transfers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Superintendent Theodora Lee from the police's Anti-Deception Coordination Centre welcomed SF Express's decision to cease sending SMS pick-up notifications, stating that this move sets a good example within the industry and helps raise public awareness of counterfeit messages.
  <br>
  <br>
  SF Express Hong Kong started transitioning from SMS notifications to the "SFHK APP" for package pick-up alerts since August.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Immigration Department said on Monday that more than six million travellers will use the city's border control points throughout the Easter holiday.
 <br>
  <br>
  About five million of them will pass through the eight land control points to and from the mainland, with Lo Wu, Lok Ma Chau and Shenzhen Bay to receive more passengers.
  <br>
  <br>
  It expects foot traffic will be higher on Friday and next Monday – the first and last day of the holiday weekend – and puts the numbers at around 759,000 and 618,000 travellers, respectively.
  <br>
  <br>
  The department said it will closely monitor the flow of travellers and vehicles going through the crossings and adopt traffic diversion plans if necessary.
  <br>
  <br>
  It advised all travellers to plan their journeys in advance and refrain from travelling during peak hours to avoid congestion and long waiting times.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also said permanent residents aged seven to ten that meet the minimum height requirement of 1.1 metres, can use e-Channels at all control points – a measure implemented last month to enhance clearance efficiency at the checkpoints.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Secretary Eric Chan said Washington's move to impose tariffs on imports from around the world does not conform to international practice.
 <br>
  <br>
  In an interview with Sing Tao Daily published on Monday, Chan said that by imposing "very high" tariffs, the United States wanted other countries to act according to its wishes and neglected international norms and free trade.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also denounced the United States for imposing sanctions on mainland and Hong Kong officials, saying they represented  interference in the nation's internal affairs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan noted that threats to national security still exist as interference in the SAR's national security trials show.
  <br>
  <br>
  The public has to develop an awareness of the need to safeguard national security, he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan also told local newspaper Ta Kung Pao that national security does not just include military security, pointing to the threat of financial systemic risks posed by the so-called "reciprocal tariffs" imposed by the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said recent US adjustments to the levies are not simply an economic measure but carry a political motive.
  <br>
  <br>
  The senior official said the US tariffs have seriously affected Hong Kong's business environment and financial security.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan emphasised that in the face of unreasonable suppression from external forces, the public has to be more united and safeguard the nation's sovereignty, security and development interests.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the eve of the 10th National Security Education Day, he said an opening ceremony and thematic seminar will be held on Tuesday and that a thematic exhibition to mark the fifth anniversary of the implementation of the national security law will be held this quarter.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Democratic Party said on Sunday it will start sorting out financial and administrative matters, after about 110 members authorised its leadership in a special meeting to follow up on the group's disbandment.
 <br>
  <br>
  But party chairman Lo Kin-hei told reporters that a date has yet to be set for a general meeting to be held to discuss the disbandment proposal.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said winding-up procedures can be initiated only after 75 percent of attendees at that meeting pass a motion to disband.
  <br>
  <br>
  A liquidator will then be commissioned to manage the party's account until there's no money left, he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lo said another meeting will be held so the liquidator can update members on the progress, after which the party will file documents to the Company Registry to complete the winding-up procedures.
  <br>
  <br>
  Any outstanding assets after liquidation, he said, will be donated to local groups and charities.

  Party vice-chairman Mok Kin-shing, meanwhile, said there are quite a number of procedures ahead, and the group may not be able to complete them this year.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The financial secretary on Sunday said he believes the Hong Kong market is stable and attractive, especially against the backdrop of global uncertainties.
 <br>
  <br>
  In his weekly blog, Paul Chan also urged different sectors to lure foreign capital and talent amid changes in the global market, saying the United States' so-called reciprocal tariffs have caused severe volatility.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the SAR government will maintain vigilance and enhance monitoring, forecasting, and planning to cope with the evolving situation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong can break new ground amid the changing landscape, as long as people stay united and do their best," Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Many large-scale international financial institutions and long-term capital are looking to step up participation in the Hong Kong market, he added, while overseas scientists and scholars are considering relocating to the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are actively attracting quality issuers from all over the world to list in Hong Kong," Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He revealed that the Securities and Futures Commission and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing have been instructed to make preparations for a possible surge in mainland firms looking to list in the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  On a related note, Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury Christopher Hui has voiced his confidence in the Hong Kong market, saying it has gone through many challenges before.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a Commercial Radio programme on Sunday, the minister said authorities will continue to enhance the market's safety, stability and foreseeability.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As a market operator, what we need to achieve is a credible market which both buyers and sellers will participate in, and it needs to operate smoothly," Hui said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As in the past, when even the macro environment, like what you said, is more complicated, it is important for us to stay calm and continue our work."

 Hong Kong, China's Jordan Tang and Tse Ying-suet made a triumphant return to international competition, securing their first Badminton Asia Championships mixed doubles title in Ningbo.
 <br>
  <br>
  The duo, pairing up for the first time since December's World Tour Finals, overcame Japan's Hiroki Midorikawa and Natsu Saito in a thrilling final.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong pair started strong, taking the opening game 21-15, but their Japanese world number 11 opponents rallied to claim the second game 21-17 to set up a decider.
  <br>
  <br>
  But it was proved to be the SAR pair's day as they dominated the third game, winning eight consecutive points at one stage en route to a 21-13 win, lifting the Asian title for the first time.
  <br>
  <br>
  This marks Hong Kong's second mixed doubles gold at the event after Reginald Lee and Chau Hoi-wah won it 11 years ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tang and Tse came into the final riding high on confidence, having pulled off a semi-final upset over China's top-ranked Jiang Zhenbang and Wei Yaxin on Saturday.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Sunday reaffirmed investors that Hong Kong will continue to welcome global business as a free port during "turbulent" times in global development.
 <br>
  <br>
  He was speaking at the opening of InnoEX, a four-day innovation and technology trade event featuring more than 450 exhibitors from 13 countries and regions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Addressing guests in a speech, the financial minister acknowledged "a shifting global landscape marked by a daunting trade war and technological fragmentation".
  <br>
  <br>
  He urged businesses to adapt by finding new partners, exploring untapped markets, and adopting more flexible business models in what he called the "new normal".
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan also declared that it is in "Hong Kong's DNA" to establish new connections and forge new partnerships, noting the SAR is home to more than 4,700 startups, with 28 percent founded by overseas entrepreneurs.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Rest assured that our free port status and free trade policy remain unshaken. We are firm in our commitment to the free flow of capital, goods, talent and information," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Also speaking at the event, Secretary for Innovation, Technology and Industry Sun Dong stressed that unilateral trade policies and protectionism means that technological cooperation will be more vital than ever.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As we navigate an increasingly complex world with a looming revival of unilateralism and protectionism, it is essential that we continue to harness innovation and embrace collaborative spirit to sustain the competitive edge of the tech-driven economies while pushing the technological boundaries for the well-being of people," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sun added that Hong Kong will continue to capitalise on its unique advantages under the One Country, Two Systems principle.
  <br>
  <br>
  These include the city's strategic location as a gateway between mainland China and global markets, world-class infrastructure and a highly diverse talent pool – all of which, he said, will attract top innovators and investors from around the world.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The commander of the SAR's search and rescue team on Sunday said a consensus has been reached with their mainland counterparts to work together in future missions.
 <br>
  <br>
  The SAR's 51-member team returned home from Myanmar on Wednesday after assisting in search and rescue efforts following a devastating 7.9-magnitude earthquake.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking after a Commercial Radio programme, deputy chief fire officer Cheu Yu-kok, who led the team, revealed that more than 10 mainland teams, including volunteers, were involved in the rescue operation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Chinese rescue teams have about 300 members. If we have 300 people working together each time, the manpower, equipment and technology, as well as the efficiency, can be improved. We can also be well-organised," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cheu also recalled the moment when the SAR rescuers found a 52-year-old man alive, after he was was trapped in the rubble for more than 120 hours.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said local residents and officials in Myanmar cried and clapped their hands after the man was rescued, describing the scene as emotional.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on the same programme, doctor Axel Siu, who's the Chief of Service (Accident and Emergency) at Ruttonjee and Tang Shiu Kin Hospitals, recalled how the team battled the sweltering heat and swarms of mosquitoes.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said they adjusted their strategy by sending smaller teams of two to three people to scout an area first, before deciding whether more personnel should be deployed there to conserve energy.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Officials warned on Sunday that air pollution in certain areas of Hong Kong will reach "serious" levels, and urged vulnerable groups of people to reduce outdoor exposure.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Environmental Protection Department (EPD) explained that the level of suspended particulates has gone up since Saturday night due to a "dusty air stream associated with the northeast monsoon".
  <br>
  <br>
  As of 10am Sunday, eight of the department's 18 monitoring stations recorded "very high" pollution levels, just one tier below the most severe "serious" classification in the Air Quality Health Index.
  <br>
  <br>
  The eight districts are Eastern, Central and Western, Tseung Kwan O, Kwun Tong, Tuen Mun, Yuen Long, Tai Po and North.
  <br>
  <br>
  The EPD noted that with the monsoon moderating gradually, winds were expected to weaken, hindering the dispersion of pollutants. The pollutant level is likely to remain "relatively high in the following one or two days", it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Children, the elderly and people with heart or respiratory illnesses were advised to cut down on time spent outside, while employers of outdoor workers were told to assess the risks and take preventive measures to protect the health of their staff.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Education Bureau said schools should take appropriate measures to safeguard students' health.
  <br>
  <br>
  The northeast monsoon has also brought very dry conditions to the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  At one point on Sunday morning, the relative humidity fell to 21 percent at the Observatory's Tsim Sha Tsui headquarters. The forecaster said that is the lowest mark ever recorded in April since the relevant monitoring equipment was set up in 1984.

 Director of Immigration Benson Kwok says more officers will be deployed to verify documents submitted as part of Top Talent Pass Scheme applications, following reports of false information being provided on occasions.
 <br>
  <br>
  "We will look into each case very carefully. Since June last year, we have been carrying out verification procedures for applicants' academic qualifications," he told reporters on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If verification procedures have not been carried out before, they will be conducted when applicants renew their pass."
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Kwok also said national security risks persist in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Immigration Department will not lower its guard, and it will make coordination actively on the implementation of the national security legislation," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The department will continue to safeguard the southern gateway to our country and comprehensively block those who endanger national security from entering Hong Kong."

<div class="itemFullText">
 The weather put a dampener on a water splashing festival in Kowloon City to celebrate Songkran on Saturday afternoon, with organisers forced to suspend the event when a thunderstorm warning was issued.
 <br>
  <br>
  The "Water Splashing with Electronic Music" festival was part of a campaign to enhance Hong Kong's day and nighttime vibrancy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rizwan Ullah, a member of Kowloon City District Council which co-organised the event, said there was no problem with a little rain, but the threat of a storm posed safety fears.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With the rain, it makes you feel more like in Bangkok or in Thailand, celebrating Songkran. I mean with rain it's perfectly okay, no problem. But the problem is with thunder," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Because if you are government organising an event like this with thunder, you have that responsibility to ensure public safety."
  <br>
  <br>
  A man who said he has been going to the festival for many years was disappointed with the suspension.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I understand that it should be suspended due to the thunderstorm warning, but I hope it can be resumed soon. The atmosphere is not as good as before," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  A tourist from Shanghai said while water splashing was the highlight of the festival, he still enjoyed the food on offer.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This festival is still special because there are Thai New Year celebrations in Hong Kong. The atmosphere is quite good," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The festival was slated to continue at Carpenter Road Park Basketball Courts on Sunday.

 Pan Yundong, deputy commissioner of the Office of the Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Hong Kong, has called for all sectors to leverage the SAR's advantages in telling good stories about Hong Kong and the nation.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at an event on Friday, Pan said Beijing is committed to becoming a source of stability as the world undergoes unprecedented changes.
  <br>
  <br>
  He highlighted how Chinese cultural appeal had resonated worldwide, and urged all sectors to showcase the nation's credible, lovable, and respectable image.
  <br>
  <br>
  As Hong Kong transitions from stability to prosperity, Pan said the SAR government is implementing reforms with strong central government backing. He hopes everyone will adopt the can-do attitude known as the "Lion Rock Spirit".
  <br>
  <br>
  Pan also noted how new technologies like AI and big data are changing how people communicate. He said Hongkongers should embrace these changes, while helping shape a positive narrative for the city and the nation.

 Newly appointed police commissioner Joe Chow on Saturday said officers will work more closely with police in other jurisdictions to combat cross-border scams.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a radio programme, Chow said it's becoming increasingly difficult to fight scams because many fraudsters or syndicates operate from outside Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have been working alongside other law enforcement agencies overseas, especially through the Interpol channel," he told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have two officers seconded over there in Singapore, the Singapore office of the Interpol. So on a day-to-day basis, we also continue this kind of collaboration work."
  <br>
  <br>
  Locally, Chow said many scams involve stooge accounts, and police will focus on catching those who sell them.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Friday, police arrested 139 alleged stooge account holders on suspicion of money laundering and obtaining property by deception.
  <br>
  <br>
  The police chief also said national security threats are still in place despite the SAR being generally stable.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chow said some people are using social media platforms to incite anti-government sentiment, and some shops have been printing seditious messages on receipts.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The soft resistance has never been stopped," he said. "So we have to work harder and harder, and at the same time, we would like to enhance the national security awareness of  the whole community."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chow also highlighted the use of new technology in police operations, such as plans to utilise drones in patrolling in both urban and rural areas.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Development minister Bernadette Linn says one or two sizeable Northern Metropolis land parcels should to be put up for tender this year, while one in the San Tin Technopole will be tendered in 2026.
 <br>
  <br>
  The government has received 22 submissions expressing interest to develop the three pilot areas of large-scale land disposal located in Hung Shui Kiu Ha Tsuen, Fanling North, and San Tin Technopole.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a radio programme, Linn said the submissions were made by property developers, contractors, conglomerates and logistic companies. She said 60 percent were local companies, and the others were from the mainland.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We expect to see some output in the next two years, including building or formation works. These can be rolled out gradually," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We normally give developers six to seven years in total, although there were opinions that the time was insufficient. We have to strike a balance because we want to speed up development."
  <br>
  <br>
  Linn added that the government will not rule out using a "two-envelope approach" for the tenders, which means non-premium factors will be considered.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the Development Bureau launched a two-year pilot scheme to relax the restrictions under land leases on public spaces of shopping malls, giving them more flexibility to host activities.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister said the scheme aims to boost the economy by encouraging shopping malls to make better use of their public spaces.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Development Bureau on Friday welcomed the High Court’s decision to dismiss a legal challenge against the environmental impact assessment of the San Tin Technopole project.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, the government said the ruling removes uncertainties surrounding the project, and that authorities will “press ahead with this flagship project of the Northern Metropolis”.
  <br>
  <br>
  The High Court’s decision came after the applicant withdrew his judicial review application.
  <br>
  <br>
  Justice Russell Coleman allowed social worker Eddie Tse to drop his case and rejected a request to have former Sai Kung district councillor Debby Chan take over the proceedings.
  <br>
  <br>
  Coleman shot down the request in a written judgement, saying Tse and Chan did not share sufficient common interests beyond a general concern for environmental protection.
  <br>
  <br>
  He ruled that Chan only expressed interest in the case "after she learnt from the applicant that he had decided to withdraw his own challenge".
  <br>
  <br>
  The hearing for the judicial review in June has been cancelled.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the Environmental Protection Department also welcomed the ruling, saying it will continue to strictly review all environmental impact assessment reports according to statutory requirements.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than HK$27 billion and nearly 300 hectares of land have been earmarked for the innovation and technology hub in San Tin.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Australian non-permanent judge Robert French has stepped down from the Court of Final Appeal, with the government on Friday expressing regret over his resignation.
 <br>
  <br>
  The administration also extended its gratitude to the departing judge and issued assurances that the SAR's judicial work would not be affected.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The presence or absence of individual judges will not undermine the integrity of the system, nor impair the [Hong Kong SAR] government's determination in upholding the rule of law," a spokesperson said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The [Hong Kong SAR] government fully supports the judiciary in its continuous efforts to appoint and retain foreign non-permanent judges in the future, and will endeavour to capitalise on the [Hong Kong SAR's] common law system, upholding the rule of law in Hong Kong."
  <br>
  <br>
  Confirming French's departure, the judiciary said he had "affirmed his continued respect for the independence and integrity" of all judges at Hong Kong's top court.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The judiciary is grateful to Mr Justice French for his valuable contributions to the work of the [Court of Final Appeal] and his support for the rule of law in Hong Kong during his tenure," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  French, who previously served as the Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia, joined the top court as a non-permanent judge in 2017.
  <br>
  <br>
  Following his exit, there are nine non-permanent judges sitting on the Court of Final Appeal. Five of them are from the United Kingdom and Australia.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In light of its steady caseload, the operation of the [Court of Final Appeal] will not be affected by the recent change in membership of the court," the judiciary said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The judiciary will continue to identify suitable local and overseas candidates for appointment as non-permanent judges."
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the Bar Association has expressed regret over French’s resignation, adding that it is grateful for his contributions to the development of jurisprudence and the rule of law in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also noted his departure will not affect the court's judicial functions, and said that it has “every confidence in the independence of the [Court of Final Appeal]”.

    Govt pledges to review RTHK operations

 Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development Algernon Yau said on Friday the government will further review operations at RTHK after lawmakers expressed concern over the broadcaster's expenditure.
 <br>
  <br>
  At a special finance committee meeting on the budget in the legislature, lawmakers raised questions over the station's headcount and spending.
  <br>
  <br>
  Junius Ho noted that the broadcaster's forecast budget for this financial year had been set at HK$1.5 billion, around 50 percent more than that of five years ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the station cannot keep asking for more public money when the government is under financial stress.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will go back to review once again the overall operations of RTHK, its production and manpower arrangements," Yau said in response.
  <br>
  <br>
  RTHK is under the purview of the Commerce and Economic Development Bureau.
  <br>
  <br>
  New People's Party lawmaker Regina Ip noted the broadcaster is cutting four positions from its 750-strong workforce this financial year, and questioned if it could cut more jobs at the programme officer level in the TV section, since three of its five TV channels are relays of state television or broadcast acquired programmes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Director of Broadcasting Angelina Kwan said the streamlining will continue, and proposals will be submitted to the bureau later.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kwan added that RTHK has been purchasing outside programmes to provide more diverse content.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Friday announced a pilot scheme to install flood-warning systems at five flood-prone areas to prevent vehicles from being stranded during severe rainstorms.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Wading Line System will be set up at Chai Wan Road, Lung Cheung Road in Wong Tai Sin, Tsui Ping Road in Kwun Tong, Chatham Road North in Ho Man Tin and Nam Wan Road in Tai Po Market.
  <br>
  <br>
  These five low-lying road sections were heavily flooded during what were described as "once-in-500-years" deluges in September 2023, officials said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The system comes with red wavy lines painted on roads, water level markers and real-time monitoring equipment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Drainage officials will also install flood-monitoring devices at the lowest points of the road sections to collect real-time water level data.
  <br>
  <br>
  When the water level reaches 0.1 metres, staff from the Drainage Services and Highways departments will be deployed to clear blocked drains.
  <br>
  <br>
  Traffic will be diverted on site when the water level reaches 0.3 metres.
  <br>
  <br>
  If water rises above this level, it can seriously damage vehicles.
  <br>
  <br>
  When officials get a flood warning, they will send teams to the site within 15 to 30 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  With installation work starting in late April and expected to be completed by mid-May, the five pilot projects cost around HK$700,000, a government spokesperson said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials will examine the scheme's effectiveness before deciding on the next step.

 Police said on Friday 139 people have been arrested on suspicion of money laundering and obtaining property by deception, with losses to victims amounting to more than HK$130 million.
 <br>
  <br>
  Officers said the suspects, aged between 19 and 73, provided syndicates with stooge accounts.
  <br>
  <br>
  The suspects were said to be involved in phone, investment and online scams.
  <br>
  <br>
  Senior inspector Wong Yuen-yan said the Kowloon West saw about 1,700 scams in the first quarter, 10 percent more than in the same period of last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said the police will continue to crack down on syndicates and stooge account holders.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Office of the Ombudsman said on Friday it’s launching an investigation into how the Highways Department handles damage to roads, such as uneven surfaces and potholes.
 <br>
  <br>
  The watchdog added that it has also received public complaints about the department’s ineffective monitoring of contractors and delays to repair work.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ombudsman Jack Chan said it’s essential for the department to ensure roads are safe and convenient for public use.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Moreover, as sudden and exceptionally severe rainstorms brought about by extreme weather have happened from time to time in recent years, road closures due to subsidence and serious flooding also take place now and then,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “In this light, I have decided to launch a direct investigation operation to examine the Highways Department 's work on the repair and maintenance of public roads.”
  <br>
  <br>
  People are being invited to put forward any views they have on the matter by May 11.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Transport and Logistics Mable Chan said the government has come up with strategies to tackle an expected drop in Hong Kong's global trading volume as a result of the tariff war initiated by US President Donald Trump.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chan told Ming Pao newspaper that the trade war has brought continued uncertainty to the logistics, maritime and aviation sectors in Hong Kong, and the government will take a leading role by offering them more concrete guidance.
  <br>
  <br>
  One of the strategies is to help the maritime sector look for new growth areas and set up new markets outside Europe and the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan also said the bureau will be more proactive in attracting shipments to the SAR by stepping up collaboration with ports in the Greater Bay Area.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another focus, the transport minister said, is to deepen exchanges and cooperation with international ports and shippers in an attempt to expand the SAR's maritime network, and in that regard an office will be set up in the Middle East in the second half to get more ships to be registered here.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said the government is also considering streamlining customs procedures to boost transshipments.
  <br>
  <br>
  As for the aviation industry, Chan highlighted the need for the sector to upgrade and transform itself by offering diversified services.

 Tickets for next month’s friendly between Manchester United and Team Hong Kong, China, went on sale at noon on Friday, with the cheapest tickets snapped up within half an hour.
 <br>
  <br>
  Priced from HK$390 to HK$2,990, tickets for the fixture were sold exclusively via the Cityline platform.
  <br>
  <br>
  By 3.20pm, the most affordable seats – which cost HK$390, HK$690 and HK$990 each – were sold out, leaving the more expensive tickets as the only options.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pre-sale tickets for the match began earlier this week exclusively for United’s supporters club.
  <br>
  <br>
  Event organisers ProEvents didn’t disclose the percentage of tickets reserved for public sale.
  <br>
  <br>
  The exhibition match, set for May 30 at Hong Kong Stadium, will see the Red Devils’ return to the SAR after 12 years.

    Trump levy looms larger for senders of small parcels

<img alt="People sending small parcels to the US will have to pay US$100 per item from May 2 and US$200 from June 1. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&w=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fexternal-content.duckduckgo.com%2Fiu%2F%3Fu%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fi3.wp.com%252Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%252Fimages%252Fmfile_1799912_1_20250411115603.jpg%253Fulb%253Dtrue%2526quality%253D99%2526w%253D1080&q=70">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong is continuing to see fallout from the trade war started by US President Donald Trump who raised the duty on small goods parcels from the SAR to 120 percent from the 90 percent that he had set just a day before that, and the 30 percent in his opening salvo on April 2.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump made the amendment in an executive order that went public on Thursday Hong Kong time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tariffs on parcels will go up from US$75 to US$100 from May 2 and from US$150 to US$200 from June 1.
  <br>
  <br>
  The jump in tariffs closes a trade exemption rule known de minimis that has allowed low-value packages from mainland China, Hong Kong and Macau to enter the United States free of duties.
  <br>
  <br>
  It means people wanting to send small parcels worth up to US$800, which are currently exempt from any duties, to the US from the mainland, Hong Kong or Macau will now have to pay US$100 per item posted between May 2 and before June 1 and US$200 for goods sent after June 1.
  <br>
  <br>
  The skyrocketing increase in duties comes as the number of shipments entering the US through the duty-free route has exploded in recent years, reaching nearly 1.4 billion packages last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 90 percent of these packages now enter under the de minimis rule, and of those, about 60 percent come from China, led by direct-to-consumer retailers such as Temu and Shein.
  <br>
  <br>
  The jump in duties on small goods parcels has been framed by Trump as a solution to the national emergency arising from the US trade deficits and in his starting a tit-for-tat trade war that has seen him levy a punitive 145 percent tariff on Chinese imports.
  <br>
  <br>
  China has said no one wins in a trade war and described the tariffs as protectionist.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Commerce minister Algernon Yau on Friday said the chief executive would head to the Middle East next month with representatives from mainland enterprises to seek more business opportunities.
 <br>
  <br>
  Yau made the announcement during the legislature's special finance committee meeting on the budget.
  <br>
  <br>
  The DAB's Starry Lee, who's also Hong Kong's sole delegate to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, asked how the SAR government planned to reduce its reliance on the US market amid the trade war.
  <br>
  <br>
  She pointed to the fact that Beijing had tasked Hong Kong with strengthening its global connections.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yau replied that officials like himself have been to different countries seeking new partnerships, and John Lee would also do so next month.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In May, the CE will visit the Middle East together with [those from] mainland enterprises. So amid the geo-political tensions, we seek to further development in new markets in the Middle East as well as Asean," the minister said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Among the 10 Asean countries, I've been to seven of them. Mr Lee has also led delegations to Laos, Vietnam and Cambodia. You can see the SAR government has been working proactively to connect with the world."
  <br>
  <br>
  Import and export sector lawmaker, Kennedy Wong from the DAB, asked whether the government plans to move some of its Economic and Trade Offices from Europe and the United States to new markets.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yau said in response that his bureau had been making plans to move some of the offices around, and it would submit its proposals later.
  <br>
  <br>
  Business and Professionals Alliance and industrial sector lawmaker, Jimmy Ng, meanwhile, asked for a direct communication channel with officials due to the trade war, saying the sector had been caught off-guard by the ever-changing developments.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister said in response that his bureau had held two recent meetings with the trade, saying the financial secretary could take the lead to liaise with the business sector if needed.

    HK to launch locally developed chatbot in second half

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Commissioner for Digital Policy Tony Wong said Hong Kong aims to launch a locally developed chatbot in the second half and that it may be available for use free of charge in the initial stage.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong Generative AI Research and Development Center is developing local large language models, and its generative AI document processing application HKPilot has been used by government departments since last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  In an exclusive interview with RTHK, Wong said he hopes the application can improve work efficiency and, in the long run, replace traditional jobs that require a lot of manpower.
  <br>
  <br>
  He expects HKChat's launch in the second half to bring great convenience to the people of Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For instance, Hong Kong residents may want to apply for some government services and they may not know where to find the services or what the procedures are," he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Because the chatbot is trained with data from Hong Kong and we provided it with a lot of information, it will answer you in detail the things you have to prepare and the procedures when applying for the services."
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong was speaking ahead of the annual World Internet Conference's Asia-Pacific summit at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre on Monday and Tuesday, the first time it is being hosted in the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  He expects the summit to attract more than 1,000 officials and business representatives from around the world, like the Six Little Dragons from Hangzhou which include DeepSeek and Unitree Robotics.
  <br>
  <br>
  He hopes Hong Kong can make use of its advantage of being connected with both the mainland and the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We hope we can demonstrate our strength in innovation and technology to the outside world through Hong Kong and seek more room for its development," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The World Internet Conference uses Asia-Pacific summit as its theme, hoping to connect different countries in the Asia-Pacific region and paying special attention to the development of emerging markets in the Global South."
  <br>
  <br>
  The commissioner said the authorities will go all out in making a success of the summit and hope it can be hosted in Hong Kong again next year.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Friday said Hong Kong is building a comprehensive financial protection network with systematic response plans and monitoring mechanisms to safeguard what he called the "southern gate" of the nation.
 <br>
  <br>
  The remarks came as trade tensions intensified further between China and the United States, with Washington confirming overnight that levies on Chinese goods now total 145 percent while Chinese duties on American products stand at 84 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  In an interview with the Wen Wei Po newspaper, Chan said the SAR has prepared response plans for different scenarios to ensure that all financial risks will be handled in a timely and effective manner.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SAR government, he added, is in close cooperation with relevant Chinese financial regulatory authorities and ministries, to fully communicate on the response plans and build a "solid barrier" to fend off systemic risks.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Under current geopolitics, if foreign forces attack Hong Kong from the financial aspect, they can be very powerful, therefore there must be strong support from the country for Hong Kong," Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The finance chief stressed the SAR must firmly safeguard financial security at the nation's "southern gate".
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan also said the authorities will take the opportunity of the 10th National Security Education Day next Tuesday to further promote national security and raise awareness, through exhibitions and outreach activities in schools and the community at large.
  <br>
  <br>
  He called on financial firms and businesses to take national security into their consideration when making any decisions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan added that he noted a 10 percent increase in the number of foreign firms setting up shop here last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The entry of these foreign companies is based on the high recognition of Hong Kong's business environment, further demonstrating the SAR's attractiveness as a financial centre," he said.

  , Wong, who represents the import and export functional constituency, said diversifying trade links to other regions and countries would be important for local trading firms looking to survive and thrive in this new environment.
  <br>
  <br>
  "What I've learned in the past few days from a lot of our members, exporters, is basically they just need to diversify or continue to diversify... a lot of Hong Kong exporters have implemented the so-called 'China+N' strategy."
  <br>
  <br>
  "So actually, apart from mainland China manufacturers, they have, for example, another few suppliers in the Asean countries," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong said the new round of US tariffs would accelerate trade trends that had been quietly taking place over the last few years, including reaching out to new markets in Southeast Asia, the Middle East and Africa.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I've seen more and more of our members going to Asean, Southeast Asian countries, and they are establishing footholds in the Middle East, like Dubai, and the more adventurous ones are even going to Africa."

 Hong Kong, China squash player Simmi Chan secured a historic silver medal at the inaugural Under-23 World Squash Championships in Pakistan.
 <br>
  <br>
  The fourth-seeded Chan launched a fierce battle in the women’s title decider against Egypt’s top seed Fayrouz Abouelkheir, stretching the opening game to a tense tie-break before narrowly conceding it 10-12 after 28 minutes of relentless rallies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Though the SAR athlete fought hard, Abouelkheir capitalised on her momentum to claim the subsequent games 11-9 and 11-6, sealing the championship victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite the defeat, Chan’s performance marked a milestone for Hong Kong, as she became the city’s first female athlete to secure a silver medal at the tournament.
  <br>
  <br>
  Her path to the final included a first-round bye followed by dominant victories over opponents from South Africa, Japan, and a hard-fought semifinal triumph against Malaysia’s Yee Xin-ying.
