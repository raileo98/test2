<div class="itemFullText">
 Laundry scent boosters did not help with cleaning at all, the consumer watchdog said on Friday, as it found "varying types and concentrations" of fragrance allergens in all 12 samples it tested.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Except for one model with only one type of fragrance allergen, the remaining 11 models had three to eight types of fragrance allergens. The test also revealed that models with two-coloured scented granules generally had more types of fragrance allergens," the Consumer Council said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The council also said a third of the scent boosters contained a musk compound, galaxolide, which is not readily biodegradable and highly toxic to aquatic organisms, potentially posing a threat to marine ecosystems in the long run.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 12 in-wash scent boosters tested were priced ranged from HK$38 to HK$179 per bottle.
  <br>
  <br>
  Half of the models claim to help with softening fabrics.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The council considers these in-wash scent boosters as unnecessary add-ons for laundry as the contained fragrances have no effect on cleaning, while the cost per wash could reach a maximum of HK$21 based on the recommended usage," the watchdog said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As such, consumers should consider the long-term need for these products, especially if they or their family members are prone to skin or respiratory allergies. Should consumers choose to use these products, they should exercise caution when using, and at the same time keep them out of young children's reach to avoid accidental ingestion."

    Document-free travel trial to mainland from next week

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong, Macau and mainland travellers will be able to enter the mainland at two border checkpoints without showing their travel documents starting next Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The National Immigration Administration said on Friday the trial scheme is meant for making things more convenient for travellers, as well as raising border clearance efficiency.
  <br>
  <br>
  The trial will take place at self-service gates at the Shenzhen Bay checkpoint between Hong Kong and Shenzhen and the Gongbei crossing between Macau and Zhuhai.
  <br>
  <br>
  The scheme covers people aged 14 and above who travel frequently for private but not business reasons.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also applies to non-ethnic Chinese who have a mainland travel card.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[Residents] who agree to the border inspection agency collecting facial information, fingerprints and other information for verification can choose to use the 'document-free' channel at border inspection, without showing physical travel documents," the authorities said in an announcement.
  <br>
  <br>
  They said all travellers should still bring along their travel documents, in case officials need to check them after they cross the border.
  <br>
  <br>
  The authorities said the scheme would gradually expand to cover other border crossings, as well as children aged under 14.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong's sole delegate to the National People's Congress Standing Committee, Starry Lee of the DAB, said her party welcomes the trial scheme, saying it's something they have been calling for.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Overall speaking, this is a very important trial arrangement, a major step. It's a response to many Hong Kong people's demands for crossing the border even more conveniently," she told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Her partymate and the convenor of the SAR's delegates to the National People's Congress, Brave Chan, said the move will boost the economies on all sides as travelling becomes more convenient.

<img alt="The consumer watchdog says nearly 70 percent of the 45 attempts to use people's own containers for to-go orders were successful. File photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1779266_1_20241115101553.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Consumer Council on Friday called for greater acceptance by the catering trade of customers' own containers when they order takeaways.
 <br>
  <br>
  It said proactive and flexible cooperation by eateries "is of crucial importance" to promote the container-free practice across Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Consumers need clear and easy-to-understand guidelines and promotion, complementing the operational procedures of eateries so that [bringing your own containers] can become a natural behaviour," the watchdog said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The council hopes that the government and the industry will work together to develop and promote reusable container lending services, so that the public can reduce the reliance on disposable containers and join hands to reduce plastic use at source."
  <br>
  <br>
  Checks by the council found some restaurants refusing to take boxes from outside for to-go orders.
  <br>
  <br>
  In August and September, the watchdog's staff members posed as customers and brought reusable food containers to 15 eateries during peak lunch hours on weekdays.
  <br>
  <br>
  Five of them were part of the government's bring-your-own-containers scheme.
  <br>
  <br>
  Of the 45 attempts made for the restaurants to accept self-brought containers for takeaways, almost 70 percent were successful, with the watchdog finding eateries taking part in the government initiative more inclined to do so.
  <br>
  <br>
  The council said four of the 15 eateries refused to accept people's own containers citing food safety and hygiene concerns, with one restaurant employee displaying "a slightly impatient tone" without giving an explanation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Others said to be accepting such containers were not able to entertain all requests citing practical constraints, such as the time being peak hours and the boxes being too small or dirty, the council added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The survey also found that none of the eateries offered discounts for [bringing your own containers], nor did they charge according to the number of disposable containers used on a 'user pays' basis, and some still charged [consumers who brought their own containers] for takeaway packaging," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong rolled out the first phase of a ban on single-use plastics in April, with restaurants prohibited from using or selling polystyrene utensils, plastic straws, cutlery and plates. People who fail to comply face fines of up to HK$100,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  Takeaway plastic lunch boxes and cups will also be prohibited in the second phase of the ban. There's no timetable yet on when that would be put in force.

<img alt="Carmel Armstrong (left) says the OSC funding will enable LOVE 21 to follow up with members like Nathan (right) to ensure they can maintain good eating habits.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A charity empowering people with genetic and neurodevelopmental disorders says members will be able to maintain their healthy lifestyle changes thanks to Operation Santa Claus (OSC).
 <br>
  <br>
  The first of 11 OSC beneficiaries this year, LOVE 21 supports Hong Kong’s Down syndrome and autistic communities through sport, nutrition and other programmes that include art therapy, music therapy, and African drumming.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carmel Armstrong, Chief Operating Officer of LOVE 21, said the charity – which now has 457 members – was founded to raise awareness of people who are rarely seen and often misunderstood.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Just have a little think: when did you last see a Down syndrome or autistic person on a train, or kicking a football, or running in the public park? And the answer's probably not very often, or not recently anyway. And we believe that's because of the stigma that is attached to being disabled in this part of the world,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Armstrong said with funding from OSC this year, the charity will expand an existing comprehensive nutrition programme, called "Follow-up Nutrition and Sport Programme", to help their members lead healthier, longer lives.
  <br>
  <br>
  “People with Down syndrome are often born with a higher propensity to be obese, slower metabolism, often eyesight problems, heart problems. And our autistic people often need to put on weight, or they need to learn how to eat in a more varied manner. They often don't like certain textures or colours, and so trying to get them to eat healthily and exercise is important.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Armstrong added the expansion would not only have members on the nutrition programme for a 12-month period, but it would also enable the charity to follow up with members to ensure they are maintaining good eating habits and meeting personal goals.
  <br>
  <br>
  One of those who has been part of LOVE 21’s programmes is Nathan, who said he has been “happy, confident and independent” since taking part.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Since I started the programmes here, most of it has helped in looking at better habits like better eating habits, better exercise habits and personal habits and making sure I make myself an intention to follow. I actually want this foundation to support as many people, as many friends that I have,” the member-turned-staff said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jointly organised by RTHK and South China Morning Post, OSC funds charitable projects that focus on children and youth, the elderly, the community, those with physical and mental disabilities, medical projects, and those concerning the environment.

 The Observatory cancelled all tropical cyclone warning signals at 1.20am on Friday as Typhoon Toraji weakened and the threat to Hong Kong receded. .
 <br>
  <br>
  However, the Observatory said it's still monitoring another tropical cyclone, Tropical Cyclone Usagi.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said Tropical Cyclone Usagi is currently forecast to cross the Luzon Strait on Friday morning and enter within 800 kilometres of Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said it's expected to stay more than 500 kilometres from Hong Kong, posing little direct threat to the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  It will then move northeastward toward the Ryukyu Islands and to gradually weaken.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Observatory downgraded the T3 signal to a T1 at 10.20pm on Thursday as tropical depression Toraji continues to weaken and moves away from Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  At 10pm, Toraji was estimated to be about 150 kilometres south-southwest of Hong Kong, and is forecast to move west slowly across the seas south of the Pearl River Estuary.
  <br>
  <br>
  The forecaster said it will drop all typhoon signals when Toraji no longer poses a threat to the SAR.

    Seven sentenced over 2019 bomb plot

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The mastermind of a plot to plant bombs and shoot police officers in 2019 was on Thursday jailed for more than 23 years while six others were slapped with jail terms ranging from five years and 10 months to 13 1/2 years each.
 <br>
  <br>
  The case involving the "Dragon Slaying Brigade" was Hong Kong's first-ever trial under a United Nations anti-terrorism ordinance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ng Chi-hung, whom the High Court heard was the mastermind in the case, was given the heaviest sentence of 23 years and 10 months after pleading guilty to one count of conspiring to commit the bombing of prescribed objects and one count of possession of arms or ammunition with intent to endanger life.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong Chun-keung, described as the leader of the group, was sentenced to 13 years and six months behind bars.
  <br>
  <br>
  Five other defendants received jail terms ranging from five years and 10 months to 12 years.
  <br>
  <br>
  During the trial, the High Court heard the defendants had planned to plant two bombs during a rally marking International Human Rights Day in December 2019, one on Hennessy Road in Wan Chai and the other around 100 metres away.
  <br>
  <br>
  Steve Li, chief superintendent from the national security police department, told reporters after the ruling that the heavy sentences reflected the severity of the case.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The statements and evidence [presented in court] showed that this group had the capability and was very active in trying to carry out the action," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If the police hadn't dismantled this group and their plan in time, it's believed that many people would have been impacted, including those participating in protests or innocent bystanders."
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, the government said the ruling shows that Hong Kong is a society underpinned by the rule of law.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The fact that the defendants were convicted and sentenced to imprisonment demonstrates that any person intending to plan and commit terrorist activities, endanger public security or disrupt society tranquillity can never escape sanctions of the law," it wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  It added that the Department of Justice will study the reasons for sentencing and consider whether to appeal the sentences.

 Hong Kong will face a manpower crunch of 180,000 workers by 2028, compared with the shortage of 50,000 that was recorded last year, according to the government's manpower projection released on Thursday.

  <br>
  The shortfall in the service industry was the worst last year, as it saw a shortage of 24,000 staff.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the Labour and Welfare Bureau said the situation would change by 2028 as jobs requiring skilled technicians would see a significant shortage of talent.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said the city needs to find at least 60,000 additional staff to fill the shortfall, a six-fold increase from last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Secretary for Labour and Welfare Chris Sun revealed the government already has plans to import 30,000 skilled workers in phases over the next three years.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are going to allow qualified technical professionals, who may not have a graduate degree, they may be educated below the bachelor level, to allow them into Hong Kong to fill the gap," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But one criteria we have to uphold is these people - they must be young technical professionals. By young, we mean those aged at or under 35."
  <br>
  <br>
  Sun revealed the bureau came up with the projection after holding more than 170 consultation sessions with different industries.
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted the rapid development of AI and automation, saying that the labour shortfall would be worse without the help of technology.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An international rugby match will be held on Saturday as part of trial events to test the new Kai Tak Youth Sports Ground.
 <br>
  <br>
  The match from 4pm between Hong Kong and Brazil is the second test event at the 5,000-seat venue, following a local football league game there last month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sports Commissioner George Tsoi said more than 3,000 spectators are expected to attend the match – double the number at the football game.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So we will be progressively increasing the intensity as well as the scale of our test events in the different venues within the Kai Tak Sports Park," Tsoi said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will increase the number of participants each time."
  <br>
  <br>
  Tsoi added that authorities will make direction signs larger and install more gates with metal detectors at the venue.
  <br>
  <br>
  The commissioner also said the government plans to hold a trial event for an indoor venue at the park next month, and another in the 50,000-seat main stadium in January.
  <br>
  <br>
  James Farndon, the CEO of Hong Kong China Rugby, said Saturday's match will be more than just a trial run.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It also gives us a prime opportunity to build on our collaboration with all the local government stakeholders that we've been working with in recent months," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "From a Hong Kong China Rugby perspective, we get the opportunity to really utilise the event as a means to learn and test our event operations as we move towards the big event in March."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong Rugby Sevens will take place at Kai Tak Sports Park from 28-30 March.

    'Professionals need guidance on child abuse reports'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A child welfare organisation on Thursday urged the government to offer professionals guidance before a mandatory reporting mechanism for suspected child abuse comes into effect.
 <br>
  <br>
  Against Child Abuse (ACA) said it handled about 1,000 enquiries between April last year and March this year, of which 185 involved child abuse fears.
  <br>
  <br>
  The organisation said more than 15 percent of the enquiries were from professionals, such as teachers, social workers and doctors.
  <br>
  <br>
  ACA director Donna Wong said she expects the number of cases reported by professionals to gradually increase, as awareness has improved since Legco passed the Mandatory Reporting of Child Abuse Ordinance in July.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Wong said sufficient preparatory work must be carried out before the legislation comes into effect in 2026.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We hope that relevant support measures, such as the mandatory reporting guide, trainings for related professionals, the childcare residential placement, emergency placement and publicity education… will be well prepared in the 18-month transition period so that the mechanism will fully play its effectiveness,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under the legislation, professionals who fail to report abuse cases risk a three-month jail term and a HK$50,000 fine.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Legislators on Thursday said Hong Kong’s stock market operated as usual during the first session under a T8.
 <br>
  <br>
  The decades-long practice of shutting down the markets when there's severe weather was scrapped in September.
  <br>
  <br>
  Financial services sector lawmaker Robert Lee said no major incidents were seen during the morning trading session, but there was room for improvement regarding the use of physical cheques.
  <br>
  <br>
  “From the brokers' perspective a lot of them already have electronic payment methods with the exchange. However, for a lot of the ultimate end clients, they may not all have these electronic payment methods,” he told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I think in terms of physical cheques, that's something that the HKMA recognises as a form of payment. For some of these people that are having some difficulties with dealing with physical cheques, I think there's room for improvement.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Accountancy sector lawmaker Edmund Wong said the stock exchange and the finance sector were well-prepared for business under severe weather conditions, allowing the stock market to run smoothly.
  <br>
  <br>
  The stock market opened at 9.30am. The observatory downgraded the T8 to a T3 at 10.20am.

    HK to sign free trade agreement with Peru: CE

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee has confirmed that a free-trade agreement between Hong Kong and Peru will be signed this week.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lee arrived in Lima on Wednesday evening local time, ahead of the Apec Economic Leaders’ meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a Facebook entry, the CE said he was greeted at the airport by Peruvian energy minister Romulo Mucho Mamani and Chinese Ambassador to Peru Song Yang.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong began negotiating the pact with Peru in January 2023, with the agreement to cover goods and services, as well as investment and a dispute settlement mechanism. Talks concluded in July this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  This will be Hong Kong’s ninth free-trade agreement with the existing eight covering 20 economies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Apart from securing the much-anticipated trade pact, the SAR leader will also attend bilateral meetings with other Apec leaders and meet local business representatives in Lima.
  <br>
  <br>
  Peru is Hong Kong’s fifth-largest trading partner in Latin America and 46th globally. Merchandise trade between the two places totalled HK$5.2 billion last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee will return to Hong Kong next Tuesday.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong climbed to seventh in a survey of economies ranking their global digital competitiveness.
 <br>
  <br>
  It was the city's highest ranking in three years.
  <br>
  <br>
  That's according to the latest World Digital Competitiveness Ranking compiled by the Switzerland-based International Institute for Management Development.
  <br>
  <br>
  The institute said Hong Kong had advanced three places following an improvement in three areas - technology, knowledge and future readiness.
  <br>
  <br>
  It added that employee training in the city demonstrated a significant enhancement.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, the SAR government said the result recognised Hong Kong's status as one of the most digitally competitive economies in the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Going forward, the HKSAR Government will continue to collaborate with various sectors of society to further enhance Hong Kong's I&T ecosystem, thereby upholding our competitive edge in the global market and injecting new impetus to economic development," a spokesperson said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Singapore claimed top spot in the ranking, followed by Switzerland and Denmark.

    Toraji not as bad as expected, say commuters

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Toraji left Hong Kong relatively unscathed, with commuters saying the storm was not as bad as they expected.
 <br>
  <br>
  At Admiralty Station many people were making their way to work as the observatory downgraded the T8 signal to T3 at 10.20am.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hotel worker Jana said getting to work wasn't a hassle, but she thinks the T3 announcement could have come earlier.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Not good. So everybody needs to be fast. We're going to work and [hurrying] to get ready... it's not good," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jason, who was waiting for a taxi at Kowloon Tong Station, shared her sentiment.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It’s not really a big issue but there needs to be more transportation options to help people get to work immediately. I think transportation should resume to normality a little before the signal is lowered," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Peter, a barrister, said taxi drivers were jacking up fares during the storm so he had to take the MTR instead.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The taxis are playing the usual game. I live in Sheung Wan. I got into a cab, wanted to go to Bank of China Tower. Once I was in, he said, oh, that'll be 100 dollars. Well, it's a scam," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The MTR is always operating, unless it's a direct hit when everything shuts down. I've lived in Hong Kong for so long, it's just part of the summer or late summer, isn't it?"
  <br>
  <br>
  Maeva, who was getting breakfast before a job interview, said transport was smooth but many shops were still closed because of the storm.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I came here to do some shopping but everything is closed, because of the storm. It's less [smooth] than usual but still. I think it was rainy and windy but not that bad," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some tourists told RTHK that it didn't feel like a T8 at all and they were eager to explore the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  "No, not affected in anyway. I feel relatively safe. I am looking forward to travelling around here," said a US visitor.
  <br>
  <br>
  But a tourist from Russia, Vladislav, said he had to start his activities for the day a little later than planned because most stores were closed in Kowloon Tong.

    T3 replaces T8 as storm moves away from HK

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Observatory issued the T3 signal in place of T8 at 10.20am on Thursday as Hong Kong gradually returns to normalcy with the departure of Tropical Storm Toraji.
 <br>
  <br>
  The T8 had been up for more than 11 hours, with the SAR largely unscathed as the storm skirted around 130km south of the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  Forecasters said the T3 would remain in force for most of the day.
  <br>
  <br>
  The storm led to the cancellation of 10 flights, with 20 others delayed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials said the airport would operate as normal for the day and should be able to handle more than 1,000 flights.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other modes of public transport would also gradually get back to normal.
  <br>
  <br>
  The MTR Corporation and bus companies said most services have gradually resumed to normal frequencies as T3 replaced T8.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shuttle buses to the bridge to Zhuhai and Macau would return to full operations from 10.30am.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, ferry services between Discovery Bay and Central would also resume from 10.40am.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sun Ferry said outlying island ferry services would resume from 11.30am, while Star Ferry said its cross-harbour services between Tsim Sha Tsui and Central as well as Wan Chai would resume at noon.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hospital Authority said public out-patient and specialist out-patient clinics as well as day services would gradually resume within two hours after T8 was replaced.
  <br>
  <br>
  The authority also said patients whose appointments were affected by the storm, and who made their bookings through the phone or the mobile app, HA Go, could make a new appointment from 11.20am.
  <br>
  <br>
  For the first time during a T8, the stock market stayed open under a new arrangement introduced in September to keep trading going despite adverse weather.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tourist spots would also reopen gradually. Hong Kong Disneyland said it would provide limited services from 11.30am, while Ocean Park would do the same from noon.
  <br>
  <br>
  The West Kowloon Cultural District would reopen at 1pm, and tickets to M+ and the Hong Kong Palace Museum were extended for 60 days.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development Algernon Yau is on a mission in Lima as he seeks cooperation and investment opportunities with other economies in the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, or Apec.
 <br>
  <br>
  On his first full day in the Peruvian capital, Yau held bilateral meetings with his Thai and Indonesian counterparts on the sidelines of the Apec summit.
  <br>
  <br>
  He first met Thai commerce minister Pichai Naripthaphan. The pair exchanged pleasantries in basic Cantonese, before sitting down for a formal dialogue behind closed doors.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SAR commerce chief then held similar exchanges with Budi Santoso, the Indonesian minister of trade.
  <br>
  <br>

 The Hong Kong Observatory (HKO) said it will downgrade the T8 storm signal to T3 at 10.20am – in time for students of afternoon primary and secondary schools to go back to class.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Observatory said winds are expected to weaken as Tropical Storm Toraji slowly moves away after coming within 130 kilometres of the territory.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Toraji is now closest to the territory,” the HKO said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Toraji is expected to weaken and move away from Hong Kong, and local winds will moderat gradually during the day today.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Forecasters are nonetheless expecting occasional squally showers on Thursday. They also urged people to stay away from the shoreline, as seas are very rough with swells.
  <br>
  <br>
  The T8 signal was issued at 11.10pm on Wednesday night. However, the storm didn’t have any major impact on the city, with authorities receiving three reports of fallen trees as of 6am, with no reports of landslides or flooding.
  <br>
  <br>
  One woman sought treatment at the Accident and Emergency Department at a public hospital during the T8 signal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Most students will get a day off, with morning and whole-day classes cancelled for the day. However, afternoon and evening classes will resume.
  <br>
  <br>
  Many public services, including outpatient services at hospitals and social welfare care centres will be suspended during the storm’s passage. All court hearings in the morning were also adjourned, while afternoon hearings will be held as scheduled.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the MTR Corporation said it would continue providing rail services – albeit at limited frequencies. It said trains on most lines would run at 10-minute intervals, while there would be 15 minutes between trains operating between Tiu Keng Leng and LOHAS Park, and a 20-minute gap on the Disneyland Resort line, as well as for East Rail trains running between Admiralty and Lok Ma Chau.
  <br>
  <br>
  Light rail services would run at intervals of between 15 and 20 minutes during the T8 signal.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 100 people have sought shelter at 27 temporary shelters opened in various districts by the Home Affairs Department.

 The Hong Kong Observatory on Thursday said it would consider downgrading the T8 storm signal between 10am and noon, as Tropical Storm Toraji starts slowly moving away after coming within 130 kilometres of the territory.
 <br>
  <br>
  Wind gusts in excess of 80 kilometres per hour were recorded at Waglan Island and Tate’s Cairn as the storm inched its way past Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a 6am briefing, Senior Scientific Officer Yeung Kwok-chung of the Observatory said Toraji was at that point the closest it would come to Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Toraji is expected to weaken and move away from Hong Kong, and local winds will moderate gradually during the day today. Depending on the weakening of local winds, the Observatory will consider issuing the Strong Wind Signal No. 3 between 10am and 12 noon,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Forecasters are nonetheless expecting occasional squally showers on Thursday. They also urged people to stay away from the shoreline, as seas are very rough with swells.
  <br>
  <br>
  The T8 signal was issued at 11.10pm on Wednesday night.

  Most students will get a day off, with morning and whole-day classes cancelled for the day. However, afternoon and evening classes would resume if the T8 signal is downgraded before 10.30am.
  <br>
  <br>
  Many public services, including outpatient services at hospitals and social welfare care centres will be suspended during the storm’s passage. All court hearings in the morning are also adjourned, and afternoon hearings will also be put off if the T8 warning is still up as of 11am.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the MTR Corporation said it would continue providing rail services – albeit at limited frequencies.

 Gale force winds buffeted some areas of Hong Kong early on Thursday morning as Tropical Storm Toraji slowly made its way towards the Pearl River Estuary.
 <br>
  <br>
  The T8 storm signal was issued at 11.10pm on Wednesday and will remain in force until 10am on Thursday at the earliest.
  <br>
  <br>
  By 3am, Toraji was centred around 140 kilometres south-southeast of Hong Kong, and was not expected to come much closer.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong Observatory said the storm has been taking a more westerly track, and is moving west slowly.
  <br>
  <br>
  Winds in excess of 90 kilometres an hour have been recorded on Waglan Island and Tate’s Cairn, but the Observatory said it expects the wind to weaken later in the morning.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Local winds will moderate gradually during the day on Thursday”, Senior Scientific Officer Yeung Kwok-chung said in a briefing.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Depending on the movement of Toraji and the weakening trend of local winds, the Observatory will assess the time of issuing the Strong Wind Signal No. 3."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Education Bureau said classes of all morning and whole-day schools, including secondary schools, primary schools, schools for children with physical disability, schools for children with intellectual disability, kindergartens, and kindergartens-cum-child care centres, will be suspended on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  It added that afternoon and evening classes would resume if the T8 is downgraded before 10.30am.
  <br>
  <br>
  The MTR Corporation said it would continue providing rail services -- albeit at limited frequencies.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was trains on most lines would run at 10-minute intervals, while there would be 15 minutes between trains operating between Tiu Keng Leng and Lohas Park, a 20-minute gap on the Disneyland Resort line, as well as for East Rail trains running between Admiralty and Lok Ma Chau.
  <br>
  <br>
  Light rail services would run at intervals of between 15 and 20 minutes during the T8 signal.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 100 people have sought shelter at 27 temporary shelters opened in various districts by the Home Affairs Department.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities had by 2am received one single report of a fallen tree, while there have been no reports of landslides or flooding.

<img alt="Lawmakers say governments plans to build a university town in Ngau Tam Mei will boost the overall development of the region. Image courtesy of the Development Bureau" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1778938_1_20241113212704.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lawmakers on Wednesday welcomed the government's plan to develop a university town, including Hong Kong's third medical school, in San Tin in Yuen Long.
 <br>
  <br>
  As part of the Northern Metropolis development project, authorities plan to use more than one-third of a 127-hectare land in Ngau Tam Mei to build an academic town, to bolster the SAR's status as an international education hub.
  <br>
  <br>
  The so-called UniTown will house a medical school, where a new hospital will be built next to it.
  <br>
  <br>
  Medical sector lawmaker David Lam said he expects the new facilities to offer advanced medical services to the residents there.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If we want to develop the region, Northern Metropolis, into a big area with high-end research and a population, they would certainly expect to have good hospitals and state-of-the-art medical services," he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With a university hospital in the region, you would expect this university hospital to provide state-of-the-art medical services to the people in the region."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lam believes the new hospital, along with the existing Pok Oi and North District hospitals, will be able to cope with an expected increase in the region's population.
  <br>
  <br>
  DAB lawmaker Edward Lau said the Ngau Tam Mei development plan, which he described as "reasonable", will offer crucial infrastructure to the nearby San Tin Technopole.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he also pointed out that the development of some nearby areas, such as Au Tau located to the south of Ngau Tam Mei, has been lagging behind.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lau called on the government to present plans to develop Au Tau and North Kam Tin as soon as possible.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The head of a green group said on Wednesday that it is important to further promote Hong Kong's status as a leading green financing hub on the global stage, highlighting the pivotal role of the city's financial expertise in advancing transition finance and fostering investment in sustainable projects throughout the region.
 <br>
  <br>
  Friends of the Earth (HK) and the Financial Services Development Council this week co-hosted a forum titled "Advancing Transition Finance and Cross-Border Green Financing – Engaging the Public to Achieve a Net-Zero Economy" at the COP29 China Pavilion in Azerbaijan where the United Nations Climate Change Conference is being held.
  <br>
  <br>
  Plato Yip, chairman of Friends of the Earth, said more people attended the event this year than in Dubai a year ago, proving that people from other countries are interested in what Hong Kong has to offer.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think there is a lot of interest how Hong Kong has issued like green bonds. We topped Asia. We actually issued one-third of Asia's green bonds and [people are interested in] how we are so successful in doing this. I think it's also because people understand that climate finance is so important for effective climate change mitigation and resilience programme," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The side event really helped us help Hong Kong and amplify our voice on green finance on the global stage. We do have very strong financial infrastructure, very supportive policies and talented professionals."
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that there is optimism China and Europe can play leading roles in shaping the future.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Most participants would acknowledge that the global green economy or green transformation is under way, particularly focusing on energy transformation or energy transition. This process is largely supported by China's supply chain. I have to note that Hong Kong has a huge role to play here too because coupled with the technology from China and the edge of Hong Kong's green finance, this is the winning formula," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yip also said that a methane fee for major oil and gas producers was finalised by the Biden administration in the United States, but that some people fear the measure could be scrapped with Donald Trump returning to the White House.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We can expect him to take a more sceptical view on climate change initiatives, which might lead to a rollback of some US policies and measures, and this could create some uncertainty in the market and potentially slow down climate action from the US side. I think it's also important to remember that the global push for sustainability and low-carbon economy is still very strong and unlikely to be completely derailed by any one administration," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Many countries and regions like the EU, China, Canada, Australia, and etc., they are all very committed, [and are] still very committed to their climate goals, regardless of what happens in the US, I think. Plus, there's another important factor is that the private sector is increasingly aware that sustainability is key for their long-term resilience and profitability."

 The Hong Kong Observatory (HKO) says it will issue a T8 storm signal at 11.10pm on Wednesday, as Tropical Storm Toraji edges closer to Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  The forecaster said that Toraji has moved on a more northerly track towards the coast of Guangddong in the past few hours, adding that gale winds and squally showers will affect Hong Kong overnight and on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Observatory added that Toraji will be closest to the Pearl River Estuary Thursday morning, skirting around 150 kilometres south of Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Observatory said that the T8 storm signal will remain until at least 10am on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  MTR rail and bus services, along with the local section of high-speed rail link, will remain normal for the rest of the evening.
  <br>
  <br>
  The railway company added that services on open sections of the railway, Light Rail and bus will be suspended immediately if T9 or above is issued.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The government said it plans to build the city's third medical school in San Tin in Yuen Long, as part of the Northern Metropolis development plan.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a proposal submitted by the Development Bureau to the Legislative Council, officials outlined the allocation of more than one-third of a 127-hectare plot in Ngau Tam Mei to develop a university town, which will house the medical school.
  <br>
  <br>
  The project to build the so-called UniTown will begin in 2027 at the earliest.
  <br>
  <br>
  Covering 46 hectares, the plot is larger than the proposed 30 hectares revealed by Secretary for Development Bernadette Linn earlier.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a closed-door press briefing on Wednesday, Development Bureau officials said they decided to arrange more land for local institutions to collaborate with mainland and overseas universities to build schools there, to help boost the SAR's status as an international education hub.
  <br>
  <br>
  But they did not say how many educational institutions will call the UniTown home.
  <br>
  <br>
  The University of Science and Technology has expressed interest in running Hong Kong's third medical school.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government also plans to build a hospital with 3,000 beds near the school.
  <br>
  <br>
  The hospital will be used to cope with the potential population growth in Yuen Long and North District thanks to the area's development, and to train doctors.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government also said the development project in Ngau Tam Mei will create about 13,000 housing units – mainly private homes – with the first batch of residents expected to move in from 2034.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government said it will reveal the cost of the project before construction begins.

 Executive Council convenor and New People's Party chairwoman Regina Ip on Wednesday said her party had fruitful exchanges with British government officials, think tanks and business leaders during a recent visit to the UK.
 <br>
  <br>
  "The key takeaways are that they are very interested in Hong Kong's development – in particular the development of our financial markets, our family offices, our connectivity schemes with mainland China, [and] the Greater Bay Area development," Ip told reporters after leading a delegation to London.
  <br>
  <br>
  She also said in response to questions from some UK media outlets about the national security laws in Hong Kong, her delegation assured them that the provisions are on par with British laws, and that press freedom is alive and well in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We explained to them our two national security laws actually only affected a very small number of people. All the trials were conducted openly in full transparency, and nobody has been able to point any finger at the quality of the judgements," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  On US president-elect Donald Trump possibly naming Marco Rubio as secretary of state and how this could affect the SAR, Ip said she hopes the Florida senator would visit Hong Kong to clear up "misunderstandings".
  <br>
  <br>
  Rubio sponsored the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act of 2019 to sanction SAR and central government officials, drawing condemnation from Beijing.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I hope he will actually visit Hong Kong to see the true situation in Hong Kong, and not just listen to a small minority of Hong Kong people who have a twisted view of One Country, Two Systems," Ip said.

 A man appeared at West Kowloon Court on Wednesday on suspicion of publishing seditious posts on social media.

  <br>
  <br>
  He was charged with "knowingly publishing publications that had a seditious intention".
  <br>
  <br>
  The man was not required to enter a plea and was remanded in custody.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government said on Wednesday that part of the money it earmarked for implementing a waste charging scheme has been used on other green policies, after the programme was shelved in May.
 <br>
  <br>
  It was responding to a written question from Third Side lawmaker Tik Chi-yuen, who noted that the scheme's estimated expenditure for the current financial year was more than HK$580 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  Environment chief Tse Chin-wan said in response that the money has been reallocated, to things including strengthening recycling facilities and improving publicity on waste reduction and recycling.
  <br>
  <br>
  Staff have also been redeployed to build up community and food waste recycling networks, he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tse said a revised estimate for the Environmental Protection Department for this financial year will be released in next year's budget, for the scrutiny of lawmakers.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister said the government's contracts with designated garbage bag and label suppliers are still ongoing, but they don't mandate production and storage quantities, and payment is needed only for the actual amount produced.
  <br>
  <br>
  "These contracts are still in effect at present and we will continue to maintain communication with the suppliers and properly handle all issues in accordance with the contract provisions," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tse added that agreements with major retail chains and wholesalers run through 2027, and officials have collected all unsold bags and labels from them, and are verifying sales figures for making payments.

    Govt, DAB hold jobs fair for ethnic minorities

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government is determined to build an inclusive work environment for ethnic minorities (EM), Undersecretary for Labour Ho Kai-ming said as he officiated at the opening ceremony of a jobs fair on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Ho told reporters that the Labour Department has been assisting non-Chinese people in landing government jobs, such as relaxing language requirements.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have provided some case management projects to provide some help for them to work. Last year, we have helped about 500 EM employees to take up jobs," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Furthermore, we have adjusted our Chinese proficiency levels to help them enter the government to work, but all of the civil servants need to know some Chinese. Therefore, we will discuss with departments continuously to employ more EM citizens."
  <br>
  <br>
  Equal Opportunities Commission chairwoman Linda Lam, meanwhile, said job fairs are a way to promote a more racially diverse workplace.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The language barrier is a common hurdle [for EM job-seekers], but other factors such as bias and stereotypes exist too," Lam said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have reached out to our racially diverse network of employers to bring in job openings that could be promising for potential employees from diverse races and qualifications, and have their language barrier thoughtfully considered," she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jobseeker Rizwan who was at the fair said he has been looking for a job for around a year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Once I went into the job market, [not knowing Chinese] was very tough. They [companies] do require you to either speak Chinese or they want you to have a lot of other experience. But in the CV and experience I show, they say that I don't have that experience," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Non-Chinese students were also taken to the event to learn how to search for a job.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think every non-Chinese students is used to that [discrimination] in Hong Kong, a little racism here and there. But it's not too bad. People just want to judge, and you can't change the way other people think," said Nareena, 16.
  <br>
  <br>
  She added that she will maintain her confidence and continue to pursue her dreams.
  <br>
  <br>
  The job fair, co-organised by the Labour Department and the DAB's ethnic minority committee, is being held in Mong Kok for two days. A total of 50 companies will participate in the fair, offering more than 3,100 job openings.

    EOC talking to catering sector about discrimination

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Equal Opportunities Commission (EOC) on Wednesday said it is actively communicating with the catering industry on ways to enhance awareness among staff about anti-discrimination measures.
 <br>
  <br>
  Paralympian Ho Yuen-kei, who uses a wheelchair, recently complained that she was denied entry into a restaurant due to limited space. The restaurant apologised to the athlete after the incident, but the matter sparked public concern.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The recent discussions have aroused public attention about the need to pay regard to the welfare of persons with disabilities and the importance of not to discriminate against them because of their disability. We treat this as a very positive development," said EOC chairwoman Linda Lam.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will work on what has been discussed in the media, including the general consensus that there is a need to enhance education and awareness of service providers in the catering industry."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lam said the commission published guidelines last November on how to ensure a barrier-free environment in restaurants, and has held seminars on providing accessible technology for food ordering services.
  <br>
  <br>
  She added that the watchdog will continue to have discussions with the industry about exploring training options, especially for frontline workers.

    T3 will be in force until 11pm, higher signal possible

<img alt="The T3 signal was issued at 2.40pm and will last until at least 11pm, with a higher signal possible depending on the intensity of Toraji's winds. Image courtesy of the Hong Kong Observatory" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1778862_1_20241113150332.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Observatory (HKO) issued the T3 storm warning signal at 2.40pm, while warning that Tropical Storm Toraji may come closer to Hong Kong than earlier anticipated.
 <br>
  <br>
  Forecasters say winds will pick up as Toraji creeps towards Hong Kong. As of 5pm on Wednesday, Toraji was around 210km southeast of the territory but is now expected to come between 150 to 200km of the city either on Wednesday night or Thursday morning -- compared to an earlier estimate of around 200km.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Observatory says the T3 signal will remain in force until at least 11pm on Wednesday night, and a higher signal is possible after that.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Whether a higher Tropical Cyclone Warning Signal will be issued depends on the degree of weakening of Toraji when it edges closer to the Pearl River Estuary, the distance of its associated gale winds from the Pearl River Estuary and the change of local wind conditions”, the Observatory said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The HKO also said winds in Hong Kong are strengthening gradually due to the approaching storm, combined with the effects of the northeast monsoon. More showers and squalls are also forecast. Gusts of wind in excess of 78 kilometres an hour have been measured at Tate's Cairn in Ma On Shan Country Park.
  <br>
  <br>
  As seas are rough, the Observatory said members of the public should stay away from the shoreline and not to engage in water sports.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Education Bureau announced that kindergartens as well as schools for children with physical disability and intellectual disability were suspended for Wednesday, and that the premises should stay open to accommodate students.
  <br>
  <br>
  The light-and-sound show "A Symphony of Lights" scheduled for Wednesday has been cancelled.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Social Welfare Department said all child care centres, centres providing after school care programmes, elderly services centres and day rehabilitation units will remain open under normal operating hours.

    KMB, Citybus seek fare increases

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Bus company KMB has applied to put fares up by 6.5 percent while Citybus is seeking increases of nearly 10 percent, sources have told RTHK.
 <br>
  <br>
  The firms' ticket prices last rose in June last year, by four to five percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  KMB said on Wednesday that it's facing a number of issues such as fewer passengers, a rise in operating costs and unstable fuel prices.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said it raised staff wages by 3.5 percent this year and 4.2 percent last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Citybus also pointed to wages increases over the past three years, saying this contributed to a rise in operating costs.
  <br>
  <br>
  A spokesman for the company said the application for fare increases was made in January, without disclosing how much it is seeking.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This fare increase application is still pending for approval, meaning that our fares have remained at the same level for over a year unlike other key transportation operators such as the railway, minibuses, taxi and ferry companies," the spokesman said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The company cited a poor economy as one reason passenger numbers have not recovered to pre-Covid levels.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Transport Department said officials are vetting the applications, adding that advisers and lawmakers will be consulted on the matter.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Legislative Council’s transport panel will discuss the issue on Friday next week, its chairman Ben Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the DAB lawmaker is already expressing concern about the proposal, saying “excessive” fare hikes would add to the public's burden amid an economic downturn.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said the government should instead explore other avenues for bus companies to make money while leaving fares alone – such as allowing shops at major bus interchanges.
  <br>
  <br>
  Roundtable lawmaker Michael Tien said the companies’ demands are unreasonable, adding that making such demands is a part of a “predictable” process that does nothing but annoy everyone concerned.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If you look at the past, it's becoming so expected that the whole thing is like a joke," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The bus companies would ask for the moon, the government would eventually give them 30, 40 percent of what they want. During the period, the companies bear all the curse of the community about being heartless."
  <br>
  <br>
  In past years, approved increases have often been lower than the levels requested by bus firms.
  <br>

 Test events for next year's National Games will get underway in Hong Kong this month, a government official said on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong will co-host the Games for the first time next November, alongside Guangdong and Macau.
  <br>
  <br>
  The eight competitive events to take place in the SAR are fencing, track cycling, rugby sevens, golf, triathlon, beach volleyball, men's handball and men's under-22 basketball.
  <br>
  <br>
  Additionally, Hong Kong will help organise cross-border events, including a marathon and road cycling competition.
  <br>
  <br>
  In an exclusive interview with RTHK, the head of the National Games Coordination Office, Yeung Tak-keung, said each competitive event must have a trial  six to 12 months beforehand.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For example, a test event will be held at Fanling golf course this month. Since many major tournaments have taken place there before, we’re quite familiar with the venue. However, we need to consider whether there are any differences in requirements between the Hong Kong Open and other large tournaments compared to the National Games. We’ll focus on any adjustments that need to be made during the November test event," Yeung said.
  <br>
  <br>
  A test event for the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau road cycling race will be held on November 24, although Yeung said most trials will take place between January and May next year, including handball and fencing at Kai Tak Sports Park, beach volleyball at Victoria Park and the triathlon along the Central promenade.
  <br>
  <br>
  The former sports commissioner said officials will work with counterparts in Guangdong and Macau on back-up plans in case of extreme weather conditions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The outdoor competitions will likely face a bigger impact from bad weather. For example, the triathlon involves swimming, cycling, and running, so if the weather is poor, we may need an alternative date. Also, the cross-border road bicycle race is lengthy and passes through some windy spots, so we need to think about these weather conditions and have back-up options ready," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  In terms of the accommodation arrangements for the thousands of athletes and journalists expected to come to the SAR, Yeung said due to the Games' "simple" concept, there will not be an athletes' village.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he stressed there will be enough hotel rooms for everyone.
  <br>
  <br>
  Over 32,000 people from Hong Kong have signed up to be volunteers at the Games, far beyond the original target of 10,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeung said he was surprised by the response and noted that those selected through interviews will receive training next year and will be assigned different roles, including at competition venues, hotels and border crossings.

    T3 to be issued 2.40pm as Toraji is expected to weaken

 The Hong Kong Observatory (HKO) says it will issue a T3 storm signal at 2.40pm on Wednesday, and will have to wait and see whether a higher storm signal is needed later as tropical storm Toraji shows signs of weakening as it approaches Hong Kong
 <br>
  <br>
  As of 1pm, the storm was around 260 kilometres southeast of Hong Kong and is expected to pass some 200 kilometres to the south of the territory on Thursday morning.
  <br>
  <br>
  Senior Scientific Officer Lee Shuk-ming from the Observatory, says whether or not a higher storm signal is needed depends on Toraji's intensity.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Right now, Toraji has adopted a west-northwesterly track. It will gradually edge closer to places with a cooler sea temperature. This will also cause its intensity to weaken," she told a radio programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  "On the other hand, we expect Toraji's vertical wind-shear to strengthen, which at the same time might cause Toraji to weaken when it edges closer to Hong Kong."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Observatory said the outer rain bands of the storm are affecting the coast of Guangdong, and local winds are expected to strengthen gradually on Wednesday afternoon, as the effects of the approaching combine with the northeast monsoon.
  <br>
  <br>
  It advised people to stay away from the shoreline as seas are rough with swells.

 Everyone is encouraged to become a hero of goodwill as Operation Santa Claus 2024 kicked off on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Co-organised by RTHK Radio 3 and the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the annual charity campaign has been holding fundraising projects for over 35 years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at the launch ceremony, acting director of broadcasting Christine Wai said the campaign has raised HK$383 million to support more than 350 projects over the years.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As we are about to launch into the main fundraising period of Operation Centre Claus for the 37th time, this is a chance to get together and share our common purpose and appreciate the value of this seasonal fixture which has become so much a part of our life," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Over the next few weeks, we'll be telling our listeners, readers and viewers what's going on and all about the fundraising activities, the creativity and imagination, and of course the fund."
  <br>
  <br>
  The theme for this year's campaign is "Everyday Heroes", and SCMP general counsel and company secretary Paul Wong urged people to take this theme to heart.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Through Operation Santa Claus, we are all brought in together with one another", he said. "We have a chance to help those who are in need and to support our neighbours, so let's be generous, and let's all be the everyday heroes of other people's lives."
  <br>
  <br>
  The funds raised this year will be shared among 11 beneficiaries that serve and support children and youth, the elderly, the environment and those with physical and mental disabilities.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong wheelchair badminton star Daniel Chan and singer Jay Fung are the ambassadors of this year's campaign.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan, who brought home a silver medal at the Paris Paralympics, said people told him he gave the city hope.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I became one of the Hong Kong heroes... Everyone can be a hero, but only with our help. Please give all our help to them, and let them have a chance to be our heroes," he said.

    'Systemic issues affect construction safety'
   </title>
   <link>
    https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1778728-20241112.htm

    <![CDATA[<div>
<img alt="" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1778728_1_20241112183834.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A workers' rights representative on Tuesday said systemic issues in the construction industry were to blame for a drop in workplace safety.
 <br>
  <br>
  Siu Sin-man from the Association for the Rights of Industrial Accident Victims told a press conference that more than 100 workers, 11 of them from the construction industry, have died on the job since the start of the year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last week, three workers lost their lives within a span of five days while another died on Tuesday after falling into the sea near Stonecutters Island.
  <br>
  <br>
  Siu cited a 7.5-hour mandatory safety training course currently in place – commonly known as the Green Card – and said it failed to provide new workers with adequate safety knowledge and awareness.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The government should increase the length of Green Card courses, and a certain training hours must be completed before they renew any speciality licences," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Siu also said the "lowest bid wins" principle and a low weight of safety scores in the overall bidding process led to insufficient resources to help ensure safety.
  <br>
  <br>
  To help raise public awareness at an early age, she called on the government to introduce construction safety education in primary schools.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho Wing-ip, an electrical and building services engineer, noted that the fatality rate for construction workers had dropped to 0.093 per 1,000 workers in 2016, but has since risen annually, reaching 0.178 last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  “As an engineer, I would conclude that the external factors must have deteriorated. The external factors include the tendering system, monitoring system, supervision system, audit system, mentality of workers, all these, I think they are deteriorating," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Personally I think we have room for improvement, especially touching on the penalty in the construction laws in relation to the safe working environment."
  <br>
  <br>
  Currently, all capital works with contracts over HK$30 million are required to implement the Smart Site Safety System, which includes features like centralised management platforms, monitoring devices for workers and electric locks for dangerous areas.
  <br>
  <br>
  Besides the safety features, Ho said a key focus should be on educating stakeholders about safety.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Sports Institute (HKSI) and the Hong Kong Academy of Medicine (HKAM) signed a Memorandum of Understanding on Tuesday to promote sports medicine and sports science, in the hope of enhancing better support systems for elite athletes.
 <br>
  <br>
  HKAM president Gilberto Leung said the Medical Council doesn't recognise sports medicine as a specialisation, so the SAR needs to catch up through developing training programmes in this area.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Hong Kong Academy of Medicine has a very good track record and we have rich experience in designing training for specialists, whereas the Hong Kong Sports Institute has a lot of experience with actually dealing with patients or athletes with injuries and how to handle their psychology, their nutritional needs, and also injury prevention," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We want to put the two together, our statutory status, in providing training for doctors and also the experience that the Sports Institute has, and hopefully with that, we can design some really effective and impactful programmes, and on top of that, we would like to explore how to do research because if you have good research, you can improve service and the care to the athletes as well."
  <br>
  <br>
  HKSI chairman Tang King-shing said the future cooperation between the two bodies will focus on providing medical training programmes, organising seminars and workshops to better understand sports medicine trends and technology advancements, and strengthening professional exchanges and experience sharing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two-time Olympic gold medallist Edgar Cheung and the SAR's "Flying Fish" Siobhan Haughey were among athletes attending the signing event to share the importance of sports medicine for elite athletes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I go to [the Sports Medicine Centre at HKSI] for physiotherapy pretty frequently because having fenced for so long, it's no surprise that many athletes have injuries. Even if we don't have injuries, preventative care is important for protecting our bodies, so that we can perform our best at the highest level," Cheung said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I see my nutritionist every week and we draw blood to collect my body's data, like white and red blood cell count, iron content and other data. Based on that information, we can see whether my body is healthy and in a normal state," Haughey said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If some numbers are not within the normal range or are out of range, my nutritionist will then suggest what I should eat so that I can supplement the missing nutrients."

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Observatory (HKO) says it will consider issuing a T3 on Wednesday afternoon as Severe Tropical Storm Toraji continues to move towards Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  The forecaster said it expects Toraji will skirt around 200 kilometres to the south of the territory on Thursday morning.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Depending on the intensity of Toraji at that time, the distance of its associated gale winds from the Pearl River Estuary, and the change in local wind conditions, the observatory will assess the need of issuing higher tropical cyclone warning signals," said Senior Scientific Officer Lee Shuk-ming.
  <br>
  <br>
  The existing T1 will remain in force until at least midday on Wednesday as Toraji is expected to maintain quite some distance from the SAR for the time being.
  <br>
  <br>
  Winds are expected to strengthen on Wednesday, the HKO said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The observatory also warned people to stay away from the shoreline and to avoid water sports.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Tuesday expressed confidence that Hong Kong's exchange traded-fund (ETF) market will continue to grow and reinforce the SAR's status as an international financial centre.
 <br>
  <br>
  At a ceremony marking the 25th anniversary of the Tracker Fund, Chan said the city has established itself as a leading ETF hub, offering a wide range of products and attracting many issuers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Created during the Asian financial crisis, the Tracker Fund has grown five-fold from an initial size of over HK$33 billion to become Hong Kong's largest ETF with a market cap of over HK$150 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Over the past 25 years, along with Hong Kong and our capital market, the Tracker Fund has demonstrated incredible resilience in navigating multiple challenges," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It has earned the trust of local, mainland and international investors seeking exposure to Hang Seng Index's constituent stock. It offers investors a simple way to invest in a diversified portfolio of Hong Kong stocks, mitigating the risks of excessive concentration in a very cost-effective manner."
  <br>
  <br>
  The finance chief added that the fund's global footprint is expanding, including listings on the Thai stock exchange and a new ETF on the Saudi stock exchange.

    'Govt and businesspeople have to work together more'

<div class="itemFullText">
 Former National People's Congress Standing Committee member Tam Yiu-chung on Tuesday called for stronger communication between the SAR government and the city’s business community, saying officials could do more to support local enterprises.
 <br>
  <br>
  Tam, who's now vice-president of the think tank Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macau Studies, said that a key message that Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office Director Xia Baolong gave to local business leaders during a meeting last Friday, was for officials and businesses to work together to solve problems.
  <br>
  <br>
  On an RTHK programme, the veteran politician said the government could have done better in working hand-in-hand with businesspeople.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For example, when the government is granting permits, can the relevant government departments carry out approvals more proactively, and not delay them for an unnecessarily long time?" Tam queried.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that the authorities should also understand that nowadays it is difficult to do business and the government should cooperate with the sector whenever it can to boost confidence.
  <br>
  <br>
  President of the Chinese Manufacturers' Association Wingco Lo was among those attended the meeting with Xia.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said Xia noted that the logistics sector is one of Hong Kong's advantages.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Xia also mentioned that Hong Kong cannot go it alone. It has to work with the Greater Bay Area to form a port cluster, and cooperate with ports on the mainland to expand its transportation and logistics industry," Lo said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Agnes Chan, who chairs the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce, said there had been a "productive discussion" in Shenzhen on how the business community can leverage its expertise to help with the city's economic growth.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We must enhance our status as a premier maritime and aviation hub, as well as a vital land gateway to the mainland," she said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The chamber said apart from offering suggestions to the government, it will also organise overseas events to promote the SAR.

 The top Beijing official overseeing Hong Kong affairs has told business leaders to show their love for the SAR and take concrete action to promote the economy, Chief Executive John Lee said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Xia Baolong, the director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, held exchanges with 29 business and industrial representatives during a seminar in Shenzhen last week.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters ahead of a weekly Exco meeting, the CE said Xia's message to businesses is that they should contribute to the overall well-being of the Hong Kong "family."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Of course, enterprises can make their decisions. But the key point is how much you love this place and how much you think you should contribute," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Whether it's just a business decision or whether you want to be showing your love to the people who live with you every day, showing your love to the home, which is the home for your children."
  <br>
  <br>
  Xia also told attendees to "wake up to the challenges and all collectively strengthen our competitiveness" while at the same time acknowledging the complexity of the world, Lee said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked what kind of concrete action should be taken, Lee said entrepreneurs and investors could take forward projects in the Northern Metropolis, adding that the government is rolling out larger pieces of land for developers in the area.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CE added that officials will soon promulgate a new development blueprint on tourism which will cover various areas to upgrade and transform the industry.

    'Mutual respect key for Hong Kong-US relations'

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday called for mutual respect from the United States in its relationship with Hong Kong, saying bilateral trade is "beneficial" to both sides.
 <br>
  <br>
  He also said no country should interfere in the city's internal affairs, in response to a question before his weekly Executive Council meeting relating to potential policies to be introduced under US President-elect Donald Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  During Trump's first tenure in the White House, he signed an order to end preferential economic treatment for Hong Kong, while imposing sanctions on officials or former officials from the SAR and mainland China.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Any country or economy which wants to develop trade relations or normal relations with another economy, then mutual respect is important. There should be respect so that there will be non-interference with local affairs, internal affairs. And also, Hong Kong attaches great importance to the rule of law," Lee said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I would urge all economies or countries to adopt that principle to develop relations with Hong Kong."
  <br>
  <br>
  Washington has enjoyed significant economic benefits in Hong Kong with a trade surplus totalling US$270 billion over the past decade, Lee noted, adding that more than 1,200 American companies have set up operations in the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  "These figures demonstrate the close economic ties between Hong Kong and the US, as well as the vast business interests of US businesses in Hong Kong," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The chief executive added Hong Kong has all along supported multilateral trade while welcoming exchanges with different economies, including the US.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Sizeable delegations from many Asian countries and territories will be converging this week on the Peruvian city of Lima for this year’s Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit – including ones led by President Xi Jinping and Chief Executive John Lee.
 <br>
  <br>
  The influx of Asian visitors will be a bit of an anomaly for the South American country – since tourists from Asia normally make up just 3.4 percent of all international arrivals.
  <br>
  <br>
  It’s a figure that Peru – for which tourism is the third-biggest industry – wants to pump up.
  <br>
  <br>
  RTHK spoke to some Chinese migrants to the country who believe there’s growing interest among Asian travellers in making the long and expensive trip to the region.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alicia Tay moved to Peru in 1983 and now runs a travel agency in Lima specialising in MICE tourism – catering to business travellers attending  meetings, conferences and exhibitions.
  <br>
  <br>
  She noted a growing number of Chinese firms wishing to bring their employees to Peru and other parts of South America in recent years.
  <br>
  <br>
  “A lot of our customers have travelled extensively around the world, such as Europe and of course Asia. Even the United States and Canada, many have been to these places. But for South America, it is certainly a new destination for them,” Tay explained.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the other hand, she said many Peruvian holidaymakers are curious about Asia, and see mainland China and Hong Kong as places with cutting-edge technology. There are also businessmen who are looking for investment opportunities abroad.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I think the Peruvians consider China as a potential country [to invest in] industries and technologies. I think it’s a point of interest, they want to visit China,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Peruvian government has been going all out in recent years to lure tourists, telling them there’s much more to see than just the ancient Inca town of Machu Picchu.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is a lucrative business after all: holidaymakers who are willing to travel halfway across the world to Peru usually have deep pockets. That includes Hue, a visitor from Sydney, Australia.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I'm here for a 19-day South American tour to see Machu Picchu, Iguazu Falls, mainly for sightseeing,” she said, adding she was planning to spend nearly US$10,000 for the trip.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Do I think it's worth it? Look, I think it is. I mean, for me, experience is more valuable than goods, so that's where I splurge my money.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Shenzhen natives Rachel and her sister planned to spend even more.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It’s around US$30,000, because we have a plan to go to Antarctica, I think that costs a lot. It takes around 28 days,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Peru hopes that the Apec meetings, which is held in Lima for the third time since 2008, will further raise the nation’s profile and attract more visitors and even investment.

 Chief Executive John Lee plans to garner support for Hong Kong's accession to the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) during a high-level summit in Peru this week.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lee, who is leaving for Lima to attend the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation conference (Apec), also said on Tuesday that he is going to meet with other leaders to promote the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Whilst in Lima, I'm going to attend a number of events and activities, including internal meetings and other sessions. I will also be exchanging views with other economic leaders, so that I can tell the good stories of Hong Kong and explain our advantages to other countries. We can also enhance ties with other governments," Lee said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There are a number of entities in Apec which are members of RCEP. I will make use of this occasion to strive for early accession to RCEP."
  <br>
  <br>
  Visiting South America for the first time since taking office, Lee said there's room for further development between the SAR and the continent, on top of already established trade ties.

    Storm Toraji expected to come within 200km of HK

<img alt="The observatory says it may issue a T3 signal during the day on Wednesday, and possibly a higher signal on Thursday when Toraji is expected to pass within 200km of the city. Image courtesy of HKO" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1778637_1_20241112094607.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Observatory (HKO) will consider issuing the T3 storm signal on Wednesday as Severe Tropical Storm Toraji continues to make its way towards Hong Kong, with the system expected to come within 200 kilometres of the territory on Thursday morning.
 <br>
  <br>
  Forecasters say whether a higher warning signal will be needed then depends on Toraji’s intensity and the strength of the winds here.
  <br>
  <br>
  For Tuesday, Toraji is expected to remain too far away to bring any major impact to the city, and the observatory says the Standby Signal No. 1 will remain in force for the entire day.
  <br>
  <br>
  But winds are expected to strengthen on Wednesday as Toraji approaches, coupled with the effects of the northeast monsoon, so the observatory will consider issuing the T3 warning during the day on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The observatory also warned people to stay away from the shoreline and to avoid water sports for the time being.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police said they've laid a holding charge of murder against three men, aged between 58 and 63, and the case will be mentioned at Tuen Mun Magistrates' Court on Tuesday morning.
 <br>
  <br>
  The three men were arrested on Sunday in connection with the death of a 34-year-old man in Castle Peak the same day.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police said a 59-year-old man who was arrested earlier in connection with the case has been released on bail, and is required to report back in early December.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Observatory said on Monday that the Standby Signal No 1, which took effect at 10.20pm, will remain in force until at least noon on Tuesday, as Tropical Cyclone Toraji moves closer to Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  The forecasters said they'll consider issuing the Strong Wind Signal No 3 between later Tuesday and early Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  They said according to the present forecast track, the storm may be relatively close to the Pearl River Estuary on Thursday, but may also weaken at the same time.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Whether a higher Tropical Cyclone Warning Signal will be issued depends on the distance between Toraji and the Pearl River Estuary at that time, its intensity and the change in local wind conditions," the observatory said in its storm warning.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Observatory said members of the public should be aware of stronger winds and stay away from the shoreline because of swells.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Monday brought one of the four suspects in a murder case in Tuen Mun to the scene of the crime as part of their investigation.
 <br>
  <br>
  The suspect, who was handcuffed and wearing a black hood, was taken to Yau Oi Estate Market under police supervision.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Sunday, officers arrested four men, aged between 58 and 64, in connection with the death of a 34-year-old man.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police allege the suspects beat up the victim outside the wet market.
  <br>
  <br>
  He later fell unconscious at home and was taken to hospital where he was pronounced dead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police said preliminary investigations suggested the suspects did not know the victim, and the case did not involve triad activities.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Real estate and Macau gaming tycoon Lui Che-woo has died at the age of 95, one of his listed firms announced on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Galaxy Entertainment Group said he passed away peacefully last Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[Lui's] vision, tremendous leadership and guidance were the foundations for the Group’s development and continued success," the group said in a filing to the stock exchange.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The board would like to express its deepest sorrow for the passing away of Lui and extends its deepest condolences to his family."
  <br>
  <br>
  The group said it will continue its operations in accordance to the strategies laid down by its board, adding that Lui's passing won't have any impact on how the group is run.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tycoon made his last public appearance in late September when a host of local celebrities joined him in a party celebrating his birthday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lui was also the chairman of the K. Wah Group, a multinational conglomerate he founded in the 1950s, focusing on construction materials and quarry mining.
  <br>
  <br>
  He later expanded his business into real estate investment.

  <br>
  <br>
  In 2012, Lui was awarded the Grand Bauhinia Medal, the city's top honour, for his contributions to Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  He had also been a member of the local Election Committee, as well as a member of the national advisory body, the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lui is survived by his wife and five children.

 Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Standing Committee member Henry Tang on Monday said Donald Trump's victory in the American presidential election will not diminish Sino-US tensions.
 <br>
  <br>
  "I believe the US-China tension will not change with the new president," Tang told reporters after attending a forum.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We always wish to cooperate and work with all the people in the world and live peacefully for the benefit of the people. But that’s not how a lot of Americans are thinking, and it is a cross-party interest. So I don’t think the tension will diminish.
  <br>
  <br>
  "On the other hand, I do think, I do hope that Trump will be more a US president as in being a businessman, meaning consider the interest of the people over the interest of who's threatening who."
  <br>
  <br>
  Tang said Hong Kong will face a "very challenging" situation due to tensions between China and the US. But the former chief secretary said the SAR has always survived in challenging situations and the city will overcome this time through the collective efforts of everyone in society.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Tang said he believes Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office director Xia Baolong hopes the local business sector will seek changes through reform and take concrete action.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xia told the SAR's business community during a closed-door meeting in Shenzhen last Friday that they are the "main force" in promoting the SAR's economic development.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tang said Hongkongers are always very patriotic and "very astute businessmen".
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will of course support the Central People's Government and we are always supporters of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office and Xia Baolong. So, I'm sure all of those who went [to the meeting] will take his advice to heart and consider their actions and how to demonstrate that they have actually put into concrete action their support for the government and for the economy."
  <br>
  <br>
  Tang said both government and business have to work together to boost economic development.

 The observatory on Monday said the Standby Signal No 1 will be issued at 10.20pm as Tropical Cyclone Toraji moves towards Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  The storm has passed over the Philippine island of Luzon and will come within 800 kilometres of the SAR overnight, forecasters said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Toraji will move towards the vicinity of the western coast of Guangdong to the Pearl River Estuary in the next couple of days," the observatory said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Under the combined effect of Toraji and the northeast monsoon, winds over the region will gradually strengthen with squally showers."
  <br>
  <br>
  The observatory said it will consider issuing the Strong Wind Signal No 3 later on Tuesday or early Wednesday.

 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Monday said bringing more strategic enterprises to Hong Kong helps the government get closer to the vision of the city becoming an innovation and technology centre.
 <br>
  <br>
  The finance chief made the comment at a signing ceremony involving the government's Office for Attracting Strategic Enterprises (OASES) and 17 companies from sectors including life and health technology, artificial intelligence and data science, fintech, advance manufacturing and new energy.
  <br>
  <br>
  With the companies in attendance, along with about 50 that got on board earlier, billions of dollars of investment are expected in the coming years, Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Together with the first two batches of partners, more than HK$42 billion of investment will be made and over 17,000 jobs will be created in the coming few years. It is particularly heartening to note that about 90 percent of the new batch of enterprises are planning to set up their international or regional headquarters here in Hong Kong," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said almost all of the enterprises attracted earlier have commenced operations in Hong Kong, and nearly 70 percent have chosen to set up their offices at either the Science Park or Cyberport.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prophesee – a French company that builds vision sensors that mimic the way the human eye works – was one of the enterprises that recently signed a partnership with the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  CEO and co-founder Luca Verre said the company has offices in Shanghai, Japan and the US and was thrilled to grow its presence in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Because it's a unique hub for the company to address the largest market opportunity for the company, which is the Asia-Pacific market, in particular, the mainland China market," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Besides looking for market growth, Verre also said he's confident that the research capabilities of the city will help in developing the firm's technology.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's always extremely attractive to work with top researchers to push the boundaries of this technology... and actually it turned out that Hong Kong has an incredible ecosystem from that point of view because within a relatively small area, actually the top five universities of Hong Kong are today doing some research related directly or indirectly within neuromorphic technologies," he said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The chairman of the Hong Kong Alliance of Technology and Innovation, Dennis Lo, on Monday said the body's annual tech awards are paramount for the development of the local science and technology sector and supporting the local economy's transformation.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lo, who is a molecular biologist and the incoming head of Chinese University, was speaking as the alliance gave out five awards on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think these young people in innovation and technology are the future of the industry in Hong Kong. Their ability to innovate and passion for research are important in advancing the sector's development for the SAR, and even that for the country," Lo said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We hope this award can serve as a fuelling station in their marathon career in innovation and technology."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lo expressed hope that the awards will bring the scientists more resources and support.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chai Yang, associate dean of Polytechnic University's science faculty, won in the artificial intelligence and robotics category, while Ng Siew-chien, Chinese University's medical school assistant dean, took home the prize in life and health.
  <br>
  <br>
  Professor Chen Shih-chi from Chinese University's mechanical and automation engineering department won the prize in advanced manufacturing.
  <br>
  <br>
  The award for new materials and new energy went to City University chemistry professor Zhang Hua, while City University computer science scholar Wang Cong grabbed the fintech award.
  <br>
  <br>
  The winners also received HK$2 million each as part of their prizes.

    People urged to watch out for online investment fraud

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Monday urged people to think twice before turning to social media or web forums for financial advice after the force recorded around 3,500 cases of online investment fraud in the first nine months of the year.
 <br>
  <br>
  Officers said the losses reported reached HK$2.2 billion in total, although both the amount of money swindled and the number of cases dropped by around 20 percent compared to the same period in 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  Senior Inspector Wan Pik-yee said there is a rising trend of fraudsters pretending to be police officers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They opened some WhatsApp groups using our logo as their profile picture to persuade the victims to believe that they are really police officers and ask them to provide some bank account details to scam their money," Wan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Michelle Yeung, head of investor education and stakeholder engagements at the Investor and Financial Education Council said more people have been scammed this year after falling for fake adverts online.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Listening or looking into the advice that is given on social media, I don't think there's anything wrong. But when it comes to asking you to join a group or click on any links, that's when it's really a problem," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So with whatever information that we get from the social media or from online, it's always worth to look into alternative sources just to verify whether that information is for real."

 Chief Executive John Lee on Monday called on the business sector and entrepreneurs to actively contribute to Hong Kong's development.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a forum, the SAR leader said businesspeople should take action to build up their industries, not stand idly by.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The business sector and entrepreneurs in Hong Kong are both participants in and beneficiaries of Hong Kong's development. They should be contributors rather than bystanders. They shouldn't just be commentators," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In economic transitions, every industry in Hong Kong should start with themselves, taking actions to grasp opportunities for transformation, building Hong Kong with concrete actions, to develop and construct the future together."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee said his administration will transform the power of patriotism into concrete action to ensure long-term prosperity and stability.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also said the government will continue to tackle obstacles and be innovative, and will make use of Hong Kong's advantages.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee said the SAR has to expand its global network to tell good stories of Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CE said he hopes society and professional media practitioners will promote the region's advantages, achievements and opportunities to the world.

    Think tank suggests regular youth uniformed group day

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A youth think tank on Monday called on the government to regularly hold a “youth uniformed group day” to raise awareness and break stereotypes about such groups.
 <br>
  <br>
  Youth I.D.E.A.S, under the Hong Kong Federation of Youth Groups, said it recently surveyed 1,001 people aged 12 to 26 and most respondents said they believe joining a uniformed group helps improve teamwork, discipline and a sense of responsibility.
  <br>
  <br>
  The survey also found that almost 55 percent of the respondents were current or former members of a uniformed group.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among those who had never joined a uniformed group, the main reasons cited were that they participated in other extracurricular activities, were worried about the time commitment or felt that it wasn’t required by their schools.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kelly Cheng from the think tank said many people have a limited understanding of uniformed groups.
  <br>
  <br>
  “So they may not encourage their children to join the uniformed groups, but we think it will be important to have different channels for youngsters to explore their potential. So one of our suggestions would be to have a regular uniformed group day so as to let the public know more of what exactly the uniformed groups can serve and can connect to a community,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cheng said a regular uniformed group day would also give young people a chance to serve the community and utilise their skills, such as teaching people about first aid and sharing health tips.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong has 19 community and government youth uniformed groups with about 280,000 members between them.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government said in its Youth Development Blueprint two years ago that it planned to get more young people to join such groups.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Windsurfer Mui Ma on Monday overcame Britain's two-time Olympic bronze medallist Emma Wilson to win the iQFOiL women's category at the Hong Kong Windsurfing Open Championships, as fellow Olympian Alex Cheng claimed the top spot in the men's races to cap off the five-day event.
 <br>
  <br>
  It was a welcome return to form for the Hong Kong pair, who made their Olympic debut in Paris in July.
  <br>
  <br>
  A dramatic ending to the women's event saw Ma, 26, secure a come-from-behind victory after edging Wilson in the 16th and final race of the competition.
  <br>
  <br>
  The pair finished the event tied with a final score of 18.
  <br>
  <br>
  An overall champion is determined based on the results of the day's final race, with Ma's heroics in the final round helping her seal the victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  Britain's Alice Read and India's Ishwariya Ganesh ranked second and third respectively.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the men's division, Cheng won 10 out of 16 matches to claim his second title since 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another Hong Kong athlete, Jason Au, edged out Korea's Kim Chan-yi by three points to take second place.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong team will be heading to the iQFOiL Asian Windsurfing Championships from November 19 to 25.

    'Step up training on use of cage lifts in emergencies'

<div class="itemFullText">
 A concern group for industrial accident victims on Monday stressed it is crucial to step up workers' training on the use of cage lifts in emergency situation.
 <br>
  <br>
  Siu Sin-man from the Association for the Rights of Industrial Accident Victims made the comment on an RTHK radio programme. This came as a worker lost his life after he was crushed by a cage lift at The Pavilia Farm construction site in Tai Wai on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Even experienced operators use different kinds of machines at different construction sites. When they're working at a new construction site, or when they have to use a new model of the equipment, they should receive training from scratch," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Apart from training workers in how to operate the equipment, I believe it's more important that they know how to stop the machine in emergencies."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee Kwong-sing, chairman of the Hong Kong Institute of Safety Practitioner's Education and Training Committee, said on the same programme it is rare for interlocking device at cage lifts to malfunction.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When we are carrying out safety checks at construction sites, we found out that for convenience, a lot of workers would jam up the safety lock. I've even seen some workers tamper with the control box, causing the safety installation to become useless."
  <br>
  <br>
  The incident was the third fatal industrial accident in five days.
  <br>
  <br>
  A man succumbed to his injuries after he fell from height at a construction site at the airport last Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 37-year-old victim is believed to be from the mainland.
  <br>
  <br>
  Siu pointed out that the industry has to strengthen communication with workers from the mainland, even if they have relevant experience before coming to Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's a totally different culture in Hong Kong - whether it's the mode of communication or jargon - they are very different. Training has to be stepped up in advance and ensure that mainland workers understand the instructions and are clear about the working procedures."

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Observatory said the Standby Signal No 1 will be issued between 8pm and midnight on Monday as a typhoon is about to enter within 800 kilometres of Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Observatory also said it will consider issuing the Strong Wind Signal No 3 between later Tuesday and early Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  At 1pm, Toraji was centred about 250 kilometres north of Manila and was forecast to move west-northwest at about 18 kilometres per hour across Luzon.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Toraji will move towards the vicinity of the western coast of Guangdong to the Pearl River Estuary in the next couple of days," the Observatory said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Forecasters added that the storm could be relatively close to the vicinity of the Pearl River Estuary on Thursday, but may also weaken at the same time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under the combined effect of the storm and the northeast monsoon, winds over the region will gradually strengthen with squally showers.

    EOC not doing enough in discrimination cases: Unison

<img alt="Hong Kong Unison's executive director, John Tse, said anti-discrimination laws had been passed in 1995, but people were still being denied service because of their disabilities.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A group advocating racial equality said on Monday that an incident in which a woman was denied service in a restaurant last week because of her wheelchair showed that Hongkongers needed more education on the issue, and accused the Equal Opportunities Commission (EOC) of not doing enough to help victims of such incidents.
 <br>
  <br>
  The wheelchair incident involving Paralympics double gold medallist Ho Yuen-kei has turned the spotlight on the SAR's treatment of the disabled.
  <br>
  <br>
  John Tse, the executive director of Hong Kong Unison, said anti-discrimination laws had been passed in 1995, but these problems kept cropping up.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Thirty years later we still have this kind of discrimination happening in Hong Kong and it's totally unacceptable," Tse told RTHK's
  <a href="https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/news-programmes/this-episode.htm?cmsid=77" target="_blank">
   Hong Kong Today
  </a>
  programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tse said the EOC had to do more to promote and educate HongKongers and keep them informed of any action that it took after such incidents.
  <br>
  <br>
  Although the catering sector drew fire after last week's incident, Tse said these problems weren't limited to restaurants.
  <br>
  <br>
  He cited a separate incident earlier this year in which two visually disabled people were forced to leave a flight in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "No action was ever taken. The two people complained to the EOC. What did they do? Well, nothing much, they just dismissed it," he said.

    HK eyeing free trade agreement with Peru: TDC

<img alt="Chankay, located about 80km north of Lima, used to be a remote fishing village and is frequented by locals for short getaways.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong government is looking to finalise a free trade agreement with Peru, as Chief Executive John Lee heads to the South American nation to attend the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) leaders’ meeting this week.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Trade Development Council (TDC) also hopes a brand new port near the Peruvian capital of Lima will provide fresh impetus for cargo trade between the two regions.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to the Commerce and Economic Development Bureau, Peru is Hong Kong’s fifth largest trading partner in Latin America, with over HK$5 billion worth of merchandise trade last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  While Latin American nations are rich in natural resources, they rely heavily on imports for some daily necessities such as clothing and household appliances.
  <br>
  <br>
  Economist Alice Tsang, who leads the global research team at TDC, expects more Hong Kong businesses to tap into the Peruvian market once a free trade agreement is signed.
  <br>
  <br>
  “From what we see in Peru, there is room to further boost spending among general consumers. After the Covid pandemic, there is demand for high-end products,” she said in an interview with RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tsang added that Peruvian department stores have been sourcing products in Hong Kong, mainland China and Southeast Asia. Some develop their in-house brands whose products are manufactured by SAR companies.
  <br>
  <br>
  “A free trade agreement can facilitate these exchanges by spelling out the legal framework and government regulations. I believe more Hong Kong companies will be willing to tap into this emerging market,” she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to a 2022 document published by the Trade and Industry Department, the proposed free trade agreement seeks to eliminate or reduce tariffs, facilitate customs procedures, as well as improve market access for both sides.
  <br>
  <br>
  China is already Peru’s largest trading partner globally, with bilateral trade reaching some US$37 billion last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  With a massive Pacific coastline, Peru’s strategic importance in cargo trade was recognised by China Ocean Shipping Company, or COSCO, a state-owned enterprise headquartered in Shanghai.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a major undertaking, the firm in 2021 began the construction of Chankay port, located around 80km north of Lima.
  <br>
  <br>
  Once a remote fishing village, Chankay has been transformed into a natural deep-water port and could serve as a crucial gateway for shipments in and out of Latin America.
  <br>
  <br>
  The port began its soft launch this month, and a massive container ship was docked there during a visit by RTHK on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tsang explained that once the port becomes operational, the shipment time between Shanghai and Peru can be slashed by one week. The time savings also translate to a one-third reduction in operational expenses.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The cooperation between China and Peru is mutually beneficial. Many consumer goods in Peru arrive from China and Asia. Following the construction of Chankay port, a container ship will be able to reach Peru from Shanghai in 28 days, down from the current 35 days,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “That reduces costs by more than 30 percent, because less fuel is used and the insurance would be cheaper due to less time spent at sea.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The economist believes the project may not be necessarily linked to the trade tensions between China and the United States. She explained that after Covid, nations around the world realised the need to diversify supply chains to reduce risks and minimise disruptions.
