<div class="itemFullText">
 Social worker Jackie Chen was on Wednesday handed a three-year, nine-month prison sentence after being convicted of rioting during the 2019 unrest in a retrial.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chen was accused of taking part in a riot on August 31, 2019, when protesters used debris to set up roadblocks in Wan Chai and clashed with police.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2020, a District Court judge acquitted her and ruled that she had no case to answer, before the Department of Justice lodged an appeal.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Court of Appeal later ordered a retrial of four defendants, including Chen. She was the only one out of the four to not plead guilty in the retrial.
  <br>
  <br>
  In sentencing, Deputy District Judge May Chung said the case was very serious.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chung noted that while there was no evidence showing the four defendants were leading the charge in the riot, some of them had brought gear such as masks and gloves.
  <br>
  <br>
  The judge also said Chen had voiced support for the gathering crowd at the scene and encouraged the riot – not the lowest level of participation in the protests.
  <br>
  <br>
  But she decided to reduce the jail term by 10 months for all four defendants, after noting they were under stress from the five-year long proceedings.
  <br>
  <br>
  Three others in the case each received a jail term of two years and five months after pleading guilty.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Train services between Tung Chung and Sunny Bay will end earlier next Saturday to make way for track diversion work as part of the line's extension, MTR officials said on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  On April 19, Tung Chung Line services will conclude two hours earlier at 11pm.
  <br>
  <br>
  Free shuttle buses will be provided for people to travel between the two stations.
  <br>
  <br>
  The railway company said the last train from Tung Chung to Hong Kong station will depart at 11.01pm, while the final train from Hong Kong to Tung Chung will leave at 11:07pm.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ben Lui, MTR's chief of airport segment, said 100 extra staff will be deployed to help passengers along the line.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If there are any unexpected situations like severe weather, our team will work quickly to fix it," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If these issues might affect train services the next day, we will communicate through the news media and social media as soon as possible."
  <br>
  <br>
  The extension project, which includes building a new Tung Chung East station, is expected to finish by 2029.
  <br>
  <br>
  The MTR said foundation work for the new station has been completed and everything is progressing well.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Housing Winnie Ho said new construction technologies can speed up housing projects and that residents living in substandard subdivided flats will not go homeless amid policy changes.
 <br>
  <br>
  The government announced a plan to eradicate substandard subdivided flats last year, saying they will be replaced by basic housing units, each of which must be no less than eight square metres, or 86 square feet.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on RTHK's Overview Policy programme, Ho said residents of substandard subdivided units do not have to worry about relocations.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Let's say one third of the subdivided flats have to be redesigned," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But the supply of public housing units will increase in the future, and we will have 21,000 transitional flats and 30,000 light public flats
  <br>
  <br>
  "These flats will help to accommodate some 30,000 households in subdivided flats who have to be relocated."
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho said she believes new construction technologies can help speed up housing projects, such as the modular integrated construction method being used to build transitional housing and light public housing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho said she has had exchanges with experts on the mainland and that their new technologies could help the construction sector of the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There are more and more robotic arms being used," she pointed out.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Light public housing are structural steel projects, so welding is an important procedure.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Robotic arms are used for welding, and the efficiency, accuracy and safety are a lot better than doing it manually."

    HK exporters 'furious over Trump tariffs'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A commercial-sector lawmaker said on Wednesday US President Donald Trump's tariffs on China are an act of bullying.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump will impose an additional 50 percent tariffs on Chinese imports at around noon Hong Kong time on top of 54 percent levies, bringing the total to 104 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jeffrey Lam, who is also an executive councillor, told an RTHK radio programme that manufacturers and exporters in Hong Kong who mainly do businesses with the United States were furious about the move and felt powerless.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Many companies now face a situation where they have many batches of completed goods that cannot be shipped, and they're unable to collect payment," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Because, normally speaking, when a customer places an order, companies can only collect payment when the goods have been shipped and have a shipping order.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As they cannot collect the payment, there is a great impact on their cash flow."
  <br>
  <br>
  But he stressed that companies have to be united and not be cowed, saying that will get them through this difficult period.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lam pointed out that firms have reached a critical point, as they still have to settle operating costs, such as wages and rents amid their cash-flow struggles.
  <br>
  <br>
  The lawmaker called on the Hong Kong Monetary Authority to roll out measures to help support small and medium-sized companies.
  <br>
  <br>
  These include extending a payments moratorium on principals for 12 months and offering flexible arrangements for firms to repay loans.
  <br>
  <br>
  Even though the industry has been trading in the Middle East and Southeast Asian markets in the past two years, Lam said combined sales from the two places are still lower than US turnover.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that opening up new markets takes time and that they won't be able to replace the US market at once.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Willy Lin, chairman of Hong Kong Shippers' Council told the same programme that companies in Hong Kong cannot do much even if they have already set up factories in various places, like Southeast Asia, as many of those countries have been  hit by Trump's levies.

<img alt="HKTDC's Irina Fan says Hong Kong's diversified trade links will help it withstand any pressure from new US tariffs. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1799560_1_20250409111312.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A senior official with the Hong Kong Trade Development Council (HKTDC) on Wednesday said the SAR would be resilient in the face of ongoing uncertainty from the new tariffs imposed by the Trump administration.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on
  <a href="https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/news-programmes/this-episode.htm?cmsid=77" target="_blank">
   <u>
    <b>
     RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme
    </b>
   </u>
  </a>
  , Irina Fan, the HKTDC's director of research, said the city had the experience of dealing with previous disruptions from US trade policies.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The good thing about Hong Kong is that this is not the first time we have faced higher US tariffs, given relatively low dependence on the US market, we are actually more resilient to the higher tariffs," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fan said local businesses were more prepared this time round, while the city had diversified its trade links substantially since the first Trump administration, with Southeast Asia, as well as the mainland, becoming more important to Hong Kong traders.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have diversified, we have our trade diversions to engage with new markets, for instance, exports to the Asean market expanded by 39 percent and Asean is now already our second largest trading partner after the mainland."
  <br>
  <br>
  "So our trade dependency [on the US] is low and we have diversified our sourcing which makes us more resilient."

<div class="itemFullText">
 Leung Chai-yan, the elder daughter of former SAR chief executive CY Leung, has died at the age of 33.
 <br>
  <br>
  Confirming the news on social media early on Wednesday, the former SAR leader said his daughter passed away "very suddenly".
  <br>
  <br>
  Leung, a vice-chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, said Chai-yan "left without saying a word" and passed away peacefully in bed.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Thanks to police and forensic investigations, we can rule out suicide and other suspicious circumstances at the moment," Leung wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We are grateful for the concern, understanding and sympathy from all our friends during this most difficult time for our family.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Police said they received a report of a woman found unresponsive at a Shau Kei Wan serviced apartment complex on Tuesday evening.
  <br>
  <br>
  The woman was certified dead at the scene, according to the force.

    Fans delight as Coldplay kick off HK tour

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 There was fanfare at the Kai Tak Stadium on Tuesday evening as Coldplay kicked off the first of four concerts in Hong Kong on its current world tour.
 <br>
  <br>
  The show marked the British pop band’s return to the SAR after a 16-year hiatus, and the first concert held at the new stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zoe, a longtime Coldplay fan, said she's attending the band’s concert for the first time.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Because it might be the last concert they have in their career, so we're expecting just a very good concert tonight,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another fan, Judy, got the standing ticket that puts her right next to the stage.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I hope there will be fireworks tonight,” she said. “We already know the routine playlist, but I still want to hear if somebody's gonna order a song. My favourite song is ‘Every Teardrop is a Waterfall.’”
  <br>
  <br>
  She was upset about missing Coldplay’s previous world tour and said this time is a dream come true.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Actually, I used to study in London, but I think it's 2018, 2019, that’s the time they stopped the world tour. So it's such a shame that I didn't get a chance to see the tour. This time is like my dream comes true,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Organisers allowed people to bring empty reusable plastic or silicone bottles that can hold up to 600 millilitres of liquid into the stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  There were restrictions to bag size while a list of items, including professional cameras and handheld signs, are prohibited.
  <br>
  <br>
  Most fans whom RTHK spoke to, including Bertha, found the rules reasonable.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I'm aware of this and I think it's quite normal to have such restrictions. Because when I was in Taiwan and New Zealand, they didn't allow people to bring water bottles inside as well,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Once the concert got underway, the atmosphere was electric.
  <br>
  <br>
  It started with the band's vocalist, Chris Martin, greeting fans in Cantonese.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said Coldplay were delighted to be in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fans reached another frenzy when local singer Marf, from the girl group Collar, was invited as a guest to perform with the band.
  <br>
  <br>
  The band also handed out LED wristbands that lit up in different colours for each song.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police, meanwhile, said five people were arrested on suspicion of reselling tickets at inflated prices.
  <br>
  <br>
  Coldplay will put on three more sold-out shows at Kai Tak Stadium on Wednesday, Friday and Saturday.

 Tram fares will go up by up to 15 percent starting from May 12.
 <br>
  <br>
  The rise comes after the Executive Council approved an application from Hong Kong Tramways.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government said the new fare will be HK$3.30, or 10 percent more, for those aged 12 and above.
  <br>
  <br>
  The rise will be steeper for the elderly, as their new fare of HK$1.50 is an increase of 15 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Children aged between three and eleven will pay HK$1.60, or a rise of nearly 7 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The price for monthly tickets will stay the same at HK$260.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government said a number of factors were considered as part of the vetting process, such as rising operating costs, the quality and quantity of service provided and public acceptability.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The government considered the fare increase necessary for maintaining stable operation, and that [its] proposed level of increase is acceptable," a spokesperson said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "After the fare increase, the tramway remains the most economical means of transportation serving the northern shore of Hong Kong Island."
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials said they'll continue to work with the company and encourage it to find different sources of revenue, especially tying in with its concept of "tourism everywhere" and preserving its historical value.
  <br>
  <br>
  The last fare increase for trams was in July 2022, when different classes of charges also rose by up to around 15 percent.

<img alt="Financial Secretary Paul Chan, centre back row, says more than 80 strategic enterprises have set up in Hong Kong in the past two years.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan said on Tuesday the Office for Attracting Strategic Enterprises, OASES, will seek to attract cultural enterprises in the future in a way that combines innovation and technology with artistry.
 <br>
  <br>
  He made the comments at a signing ceremony between the office and 16 companies, including Ant Digital Technologies and China Mobile Innovation Research Institute.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said the creative and cultural industries hold huge power and their development is unstoppable.
  <br>
  <br>
  “This sector, enriching lives, sparking joy and preaching cultures, is among the fastest growing in the world,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "How artistic toys and animation have captivated audiences globally is simply amazing.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Through Hong Kong's platform, creative pioneers can indeed extend their reach across continents.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan also said more than 80 strategic enterprises have set up in Hong Kong in the past two years, and will bring nearly HK$50 billion worth of investment and create more than 20,000 jobs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Car company Li Auto is among the companies securing a partnership agreement with OASES.
  <br>
  <br>
  Its senior vice president, Li Guanhua, said the company is looking to invest around HK$20 billion in the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We chose to come to Hong Kong to develop a core research centre this year because we value Hong Kong’s position in the whole economic, financial and fintech aspect,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our investment in Hong Kong will be long term."
  <br>
  <br>
  Li said the Hong Kong office will serve as an offshore clearing centre, as well as a research centre for AI facilities.
  <br>
  <br>
  When asked whether US tariffs would affect company sales, Li said the firm only started developing its overseas market this year but the United States would not be its target.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another company, Enlight Medical, said Hong Kong provides a stable environment given the current chaos created by US tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The Hong Kong government said it will not follow Beijing’s decision to impose retaliatory tariffs on the US,” said co-founder Rocky Bian of the health technology company.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This helps us stabilise our global supply chain.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Hong Kong is a free port. Apart from re-export trades, the city also provides stability in importing machine components and raw materials from the US.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Bian said the company will hire around 900 workers in a few years time, spanning from researchers to quality assurance talent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The cost of operating in Hong Kong, he added, does not differ by much from mainland cities.
  <br>
  <br>
  Web 3 auditing company CertiK said it hopes to safeguard technology development in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Hong Kong is a hub of the financial supply chain and market, and the government is also promoting and encouraging business development in this area,” said its chief security officer Li Kang.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But they are also under pressure due to risks in the new area.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We are here to try to safeguard institutions against risk.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We can help make sure users make the right investments and secure their assets.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Li added that the company has already been serving one of the largest banks in Hong Kong.

    Man gets seven years over 2019 Yuen Long riot

<img alt="A District Court judge said Wong Chi-wing took part in an indiscriminate attack on others in Yuen Long in 2019. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1799406_1_20250408125602.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A transport worker convicted of rioting and wounding with intent in Yuen Long in 2019 was jailed for seven years on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Wong Chi-wing, 60, was found guilty last week after a retrial for taking part in the violence nearly six years ago on July 21.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong's lawyer argued in mitigation last week that his client had a rather small part in the clashes.
  <br>
  <br>
  But District Court judge Eddie Yip dismissed the plea.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yip said the case was very serious.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong, he said, was among a group of white-shirted men that carried out what he described as an indiscriminate attack on others inside and near Yuen Long MTR station.
  <br>
  <br>
  The sentencing starting point for two co-defendants in the case was seven years behind bars, Yip noted, and the same was applied to Wong with no discount offered.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong had been acquitted in 2021, and a higher court ordered a retrial after the Department of Justice won an appeal.

<div class="itemFullText">
 YouTube streamer IShowSpeed's flash visit to the city last week shows that Hong Kong is safe, fun and open, according to Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism Rosanna Law.
 <br>
  <br>
  Some netizens and lawmakers have questioned the rough planning of the itinerary, saying the government missed a great opportunity to promote Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  In an interview with Ta Kung Pao and Wen Wei Po newspapers, Law said Speed's nine-and-a-half-hour citywide livestream served as an excellent promotion of the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  Law said she believes spontaneity is the streamer's selling point and that he might not have wanted to follow an official itinerary.
  <br>
  <br>
  The crowds that gathered during his MTR ride caused some disruption, which was unexpected even for Speed himself, Law added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Law also noted there have been changes in the ways tourism is promoted, adding that online influencers have become an important way for people to uncover new places.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong is a very open place. Anyone can have a great time as long as they follow the rules," she said, adding that it sent a great message in the current geopolitical climate.

    Beijing prepared for US tariff retaliation: Regina Ip

<img alt="Regina Ip said the SAR government should come up with policies in case of a global recession. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1799392_1_20250408122043.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The central government is well prepared and has a broad arsenal to respond to any further tariff escalation by US President Donald Trump, according to Executive Council convenor Regina Ip.
 <br>
  <br>
  She was speaking on RTHK's Backchat programme on Tuesday on Washington's recent tariff barrage launched across the world, including an additional 34 percent tariff on Chinese imports.
  <br>
  <br>
  In response, Beijing hit back with tariffs of 34 percent on all goods from the United States and added 11 US firms to its unreliable entity list.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ip, who's also the New People's Party chairwoman, said Trump is effectively ceding the role of champion of free trade and rule-based multilateral system to China.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the long term, China will be the winner, in terms of trade, technology and moral high ground," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ip stressed that if Trump does decide to retaliate further, it will only continue to plummet global markets, and that the tariff war will likely continue unless Trump's tycoon backers reign him in or Republicans get burned in the midterm elections next year.
  <br>
  <br>
  As for the likelihood of a global recession, Ip said it's likely.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The SAR government should work out a panoply of policy options to buoy the local economy pending a global recession," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  When asked about the SAR not setting any countermeasures to the US tariffs, Ip said Hong Kong will continue to be a free port, noting that the city is bound by the Basic Law, as well as its tariff commitments to the World Trade Organization.
  <br>
  <br>
  Weighing in on the same issue, Andrew Leung, China strategist and former senior Hong Kong government official, said the US was upending the very trade institutes it helped create after World War II.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the current Trump policies are a continuation of what he had started during his previous term in office, and therefore "China had been preparing for this for a long, long time."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Immediately, after Trump 1.0 President Xi was quite prescient -- shortly after Trump won the White House for the first time, he already ordered China to go full steam ahead towards self-sufficiency and self-reliance -- particularly on high technology," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Leung also said Chinese products will remain competitive globally, like BYD electric cars, because of the superior technology and price, despite the tariff headwinds.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee said on Tuesday Hong Kong will seize every opportunity to help social media influencers show the city to the world.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lee was speaking after YouTube megastar IShowSpeed's visit here last week.
  <br>
  <br>
  The live streamer drew crowds of fans and chaos as he made his way to Causeway Bay, Ocean Park and the Temple Street night market on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking before the weekly Executive Council meeting, Lee said the Tourism Board had reached out to the YouTuber but didn't hear back from him.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This KOL [key opinion leader] has many followers, he has many fans, so I'm sure we all take very seriously any opportunity to publicise Hong Kong," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee also called on different sectors of the community to welcome and support influencers coming to the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I see there were hotels, restaurants, public transport operators which provided Speed and other KOLs assistance in their broadcasting," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So if anyone wants to promote Hong Kong, please do our best to help them because Hong Kong is our home."
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked about his assessment of Super March, Lee said the series of mega events attracted overseas tourists and boosted the hotel and catering industries.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said more mega events are lined up for April, including the first-ever World Internet Conference Asia-Pacific Summit to be held in Hong Kong.

    HK economist expects Fed to cut rates sooner

<img alt="" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1799386_1_20250408113645.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An economist said on Tuesday he expects the US Federal Reserve to cut interest rates sooner than expected in a bid to rescue the American economy.
 <br>
  <br>
  The prediction came a day after a global stock market rout amid concern over the ongoing trade war as seen in tit-for-tat tariff levies between the world's two largest economies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on an RTHK radio programme, Terence Chong, executive director of Chinese University's Lau Chor Tak Institute of Global Economics and Finance, said that if the US stocks continue to slump, the Fed's top priority is to save the economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I believe the chance of the Fed cutting rates due to the slump in US stocks and global stock market is high," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Because if US stocks continue to drop, it has to save the economy first.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Inflation is not its top concern."
  <br>
  <br>
  US President Donald Trump has threatened to impose an additional 50 percent tariffs on Chinese goods from Wednesday if Beijing does not retract its 34 percent counter-tariffs to the American levies imposed last week.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chong said this shows that Trump was scared of China tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  The economist pointed out that as soybean is one of China's top US imports, soybean farmers would be hit the hardest under the potential additional levy.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also said if the trade war escalates, it might give rise to smuggling and panic buying in the United States when some goods are not imported to Washington.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, Chong expects Hong Kong stocks to remain volatile in the short run and suggests investors not enter the market for now.

 The MTR said it would enhance services on the Tuen Ma and East Rail lines this week to accommodate concertgoers attending Coldplay’s performances at Kai Tak Stadium.
 <br>
  <br>
  The British rock band will hold four concerts - Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday and Saturday - with shows expected to conclude after 10pm each evening.
  <br>
  <br>
  The rail operator warned that stations along the Tuen Ma Line, particularly Kai Tak and Sung Wong Toi, may experience heightened crowds, with concert entry times overlapping with the evening rush hour.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said temporary measures such as one-way directional systems and adjusted entry and exit routes would be implemented at these stations to manage passenger flow.
  <br>
  <br>
  Passengers are advised to pay attention to station announcements and follow directional signage for guidance.
  <br>
  <br>
  The MTR also reminded cross-border passengers to check the last train departure times for Lo Wu Station to ensure timely connections after the events.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said additional staff would be deployed to assist with crowd control, and the corporation emphasised ongoing coordination with relevant authorities to streamline operations.

    'Reckless' tariffs hurt global trade, says John Lee

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee has hit out at the United States for slapping "reckless" tariffs on countries and places around the world, vowing to take steps to respond to the sweeping levies through deepening international cooperation.
 <br>
  <br>
  Washington has announced an additional 34 percent tariff on Chinese goods, which also applies to Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  Coming on top of existing levies, the tariffs go up to 54 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The US no longer adheres to free trade, arbitrarily undermining the internationally established rules of world trade," Lee said ahead of Tuesday's Executive Council meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Its ruthless behaviour damages global and multilateral trade.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The reckless imposition of tariffs affects many countries and regions around the world with huge tax rate increases and covering a wide range of goods, disrupting the world's economic and trade order, bringing great risks and uncertainties to the world."
  <br>
  <br>
  Export enterprises will inevitably be affected in the short run by the tariffs, Lee added.
  <br>
  <br>
  To address the effects brought about by US tariffs, the chief executive said seizing opportunities on the mainland and integrating into national development is one of seven key areas in which the SAR government is hoping to strengthen its work.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee also pledged to boost international exchanges, strengthen global financial cooperation, and work to attract foreign investment.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Hong Kong, he said the authorities would accelerate industrial transformation, intensify efforts in the development of innovation and technology, while supporting enterprises to cope with the impacts of tariffs and external challenges.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A modern dance drama inspired by renowned Chinese poet Su Dongpo and innovative works relating to tea are some of the highlights of an upcoming Chinese Culture Festival organised by the Leisure and Cultural Services Department (LCSD).
 <br>
  <br>
  To be held from June to September, the festival features more than 280 performing arts programmes, with art groups and artists from the SAR and around the country taking part.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among the highlights is the opening programme, "Dongpo: Life in Poems", a modern dance drama by the China Oriental Performing Arts Group and inspired by the life of Su, a poet in the 11th century in the Song dynasty.
  <br>
  <br>
  It features both modern dance and traditional crafts such as poetry writing and calligraphy "for a visually stunning and internationally accessible experience," said Ivy Ngai, a chief manager of the LCSD.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ngai said another key event of the festival is the tea culture series, which features works curated by the Ambassador for Cultural Promotion, Tan Dun, blending traditional tea culture with music and performances.
  <br>
  <br>
  In addition, "there will be exhibitions, talks and workshops which try to immerse the audience into different kinds of activities and feel the significance and culture of tea," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think innovation is a very important element, that we would like to fuse in Hong Kong elements, and how we modernise the traditional essence," Ngai added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The festival also features Peking opera, plays and films, among other works.
  <br>
  <br>
  It aims to promote Chinese culture and enhance the public's national identity and cultural confidence.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ngai also said she expects the event to be popular among visitors as well. "This year, we added on more bilingual elements so as to make the programmes more accessible to travellers."
  <br>
  <br>
  Tickets to various performances are available from April 15.

<img alt="Paul Chan says investors should exercise caution going forward as market fluctuations are expected to continue. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1799293_1_20250407191203.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan said the Hong Kong stock market and the local currency remain robust and strong, after the US tariffs triggered the biggest single-day sell-off for the Hang Seng Index on record.
 <br>
  <br>
  The local bourse lost 3,021 points, or 13.2 percent, to close at 19,828.
  <br>
  <br>
  The percentage drop was the worst among major Asian markets on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to the press after trading ended, Chan said the plunge reflected grim global investor sentiment.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he pointed out that officials didn't see any "systemic market abnormalities" in the SAR, saying the local financial system is very sound and the Hong Kong dollar remains strong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Basically the market has been functioning orderly. There are substantial selling as well as buying interests. The spread between the two has been very tight, indicating that the buying power remains very strong," Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister noted that for some time going forward, it's unavoidable that the markets would continue to fluctuate, and investors should exercise caution and assess their risks.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said reciprocal tariffs from different counties against the United States and interest rate movements by central banks could add to market volatility.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We do not think the current volatility in the market warrants any drastic measures to be taken," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan added that officials will keep a close eye on the markets to guard against financial risks.

    HK stocks slump has retail investors seeing red

<img alt="Retail investors mostly saw red on the worst day for Hong Kong stocks in nearly three decades. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1799281_2_20250407180508.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Small-time investors in Hong Kong were left reeling on Monday as US President Donald Trump's punishing tariffs and Beijing's retaliation saw the city's stock market suffer its worst day in almost three decades.
 <br>
  <br>
  The benchmark Hang Seng Index fell by 13.2 percent – its biggest drop since 1997 during the Asian financial crisis.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a securities brokerage in Central, where more than a dozen elderly investors stared at numbers flashing red on computer screens, the mood was grim.
  <br>
  <br>
  A woman in her nineties, Tam, said she "hated" Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He cost me HK$200,000," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He's nonsensical, he says one thing and changes his mind a few minutes later... How can someone in such a lofty position act like that?"
  <br>
  <br>
  "[Trump] won't let it go, he's making a mess," said another retiree Lee.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Everyone around me is losing money."
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong resumed trading on Monday after a three-day break, which worsened the drawdown, according to Stanley Chik, head of research at Bright Smart Securities.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong's stock market had outperformed the United States since Trump took office, but Monday's rout wiped out HSI gains from the first quarter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Investors have taken a wait-and-see approach for weeks as Trump finalised his trade policies, Chik said, adding that the mood was not yet one of "despair".
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong tops the world in retail investor participation, with one 2023 survey showing that 48 percent of the respondents held or traded stocks in the preceding year.
  <br>
  <br>
  A 35-year-old man, Tsang, said his long-term investments lost around US$12,900 on Monday, but he would not consider selling yet.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I didn't expect it to get so bad," said Tsang, a bank employee.
  <br>
  <br>
  China A-shares may be more resilient, he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In this sort of fight (between China and the United States), it's hard to say who will suffer more."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lawyer Ray Chan, 30, was among those left unscathed on Monday, as he sold all his Hong Kong and US shareholdings two weeks ago, netting gains in the seven figures.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're clearly entering a bear market but I'm prepared," Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When [Trump] said there would be tariffs on April 2, I could guess where things were headed."
  <br>
  <br>
  It will take "at least a year" before he returns to the market, Chan said. (AFP)

    Nurturing talent 'cornerstone of innovation and tech'

<div class="itemFullText">
 Nurturing talent is the "cornerstone" in innovation and technology (I&T) development, according to the city's tech chief on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Secretary for Innovation, Technology and Industry Sun Dong told a launch ceremony for the Polytechnic University's faculty of computer and mathematical sciences that SAR authorities have been taking steps to expand the pool of highly-skilled professionals and equip young people with skills needed for the future.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We firmly believe that nurturing talent is a cornerstone of innovation and technology development," Sun said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We continue to proactively promote science and mathematics education, and strengthen digital education, so as to provide talent support for developing Hong Kong into an international I&T centre."
  <br>
  <br>
  The university's newly established faculty focuses on three main disciplines: applied mathematics, computing, and data science and artificial intelligence.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Home affairs minister Alice Mak on Monday defended some district councillors who reportedly have not spoken during meetings for an entire year.
 <br>
  <br>
  Citing minutes, the Ming Pao newspaper reported that six appointed or ex-officio councillors never said a word at full council sessions in their first year in office.
  <br>
  <br>
  They're among 33 who reportedly didn't speak at around 80 percent of meetings.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mak said councillors might have opted not to speak for the sake of efficiency.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The councillors should definitely give their views on topics, but they don't want to repeat the same opinions," she told reporters after attending an event.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is not an efficient use of time – it'd be speaking for the sake of speaking, to hit a certain target in terms of numbers. That's definitely not what everyone wants to see."
  <br>
  <br>
  Mak noted that she herself had been a district councillor for more than 25 years before joining the government, and members were always prepared about agenda items and knew when to give their thoughts.
  <br>
  <br>
  She questioned if the public would want to see councillors give the same views hundreds of times, or better utilise their time by meeting with residents in the community.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister said the same idea applies at the legislature to avoid repetition.
  <br>
  <br>
  She also said all district councillors met their performance targets.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mak added that mobile street booths will soon be set up to further boost communication between residents and district councillors, and announcements will be made in due course.

    Power bank ban doesn't leave some air passengers wired

 From Monday, airline passengers have been banned from using and charging their power banks during flights and storing portable chargers in overhead compartments.
 <br>
  <br>
  The ban by the Civil Aviation Department came after a returning Hongkong Airlines' flight on March 20 had to make an emergency landing in Fuzhou due to a fire triggered by a portable charging device.
  <br>
  <br>
  An Air Busan plane that was also bound for Hong Kong caught fire as well in January at its home airport for the same reason.
  <br>
  <br>
  A traveller surnamed Cheng told RTHK at an in-town check-in centre that the regulation would not affect her in-flight experience.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I know about the rule, and I don’t think it will affect me,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I can still put my power bank under the seat, there is sufficient space.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I saw some news of planes catching fire due to these chargers, so I think for everyone’s safety, I am not in any rush to charge my phone.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Another flyer, Gillett, said he had not heard about the new rule.
  <br>
  <br>
  “No, not a word,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "No [impact on me] at all.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I don’t have any power banks, and I charge my phone ahead of time and turn it off when I’m on the plane.
  <br>
  <br>
  This was echoed by a passenger, Stark, who also does not own a portable charger.
  <br>
  <br>
  “No [effect on me],”she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I just watch the in-flight entertainment, and I just plug [my phone cable] into the [USB port in the seat in front].

 Under Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury Joseph Chan said on Monday the government will pay close attention to the stock market and ensure that the city remains financially stable.
 <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong stocks plunged on the first trading session after Beijing hit back over the US imposition of an extra 34 percent tariffs on Chinese goods by announcing reciprocal levies of the same quantum on American goods.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hang Seng Index was down about 9 percent in early trading on Monday, with tech, solar, banking and online retailers' shares plunging.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan told lawmakers that Hong Kong has a strong financial base that can deal with any volatility in the market and that authorities will stay vigilant to market changes.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Our fundamentals are very strong, liquidity is high, and therefore, we have been fair and open in our operation," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our core and fundamentals are very strong,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The government will continue to be vigilant together with the regulators to monitor closely the market to maintain a stable financial market.” (additional reporting by Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Airport Authority Hong Kong board has appointed Vivian Cheung as its chief executive.
 <br>
  <br>
  Her three-year term begins on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Secretary for Transport and Logistics Mable Chan offered the new CEO a warm welcome.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I trust that under Mrs Cheung's leadership, the Airport Authority will continue to strengthen the leading position of Hong Kong International Airport as an international aviation hub and promote the long-term development of the airport," the government said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan added that the government will work closely with the authority to lead the aviation industry to new heights.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cheung, for her part, expressed gratitude to the board and government.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The global business environment is increasingly challenging, but I am full of confidence in the future of our aviation industry," she said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With staunch support from the government, chairman and the board, Airport Authority Hong Kong colleagues and our business partners, we shall further consolidate Hong Kong International Airport’s leading position and develop the airport city as a new landmark in Asia."
  <br>
  <br>
  The appointment was endorsed on March 31 by the authority's board following approval by the SAR chief executive.
  <br>

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's justice chief has stressed that educating the public on national security is an ongoing effort, calling on people to stay vigilant against possible threats.
 <br>
  <br>
  In the run-up to the city's National Security Education Day on April 15, Secretary for Justice Paul Lam told local newspaper Sing Tao Daily that the push to raise public awareness should not be limited to certain days.
  <br>
  <br>
  For example, he said, one should not treat one's spouse well only on Valentine's Day, adding that national security education should similarly be an everyday thing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lam also warned that national security risks might still exist even though Hong Kong now has a very stable environment.
  <br>
  <br>
  One of six officials recently sanctioned by the United States, Lam said Washington's move might encourage more people to take part in work to safeguard national security.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the punitive actions would not affect him and that none of the officials placed on Washington's list left their job as a result of the sanctions.
  <br>
  <br>
  While no one would be happy to be sanctioned, Lam said, it did not mean that they had to be agitated and upset over it.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The financial secretary said on Monday Hong Kong is committed to creating a promising and successful future for Web3, or third generation Internet, development.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at the Web3 Festival Hong Kong that has attracted thousands of participants from around the world, Paul Chan pointed out that Web3 allows transactions to be carried out more efficiently, at a lower cost and with enhanced market transparency.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong's approach to Web3 is not simply about regulation," Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We aim to strike a balance, ensuring market integrity without stifling innovation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "After all, innovation entails risks.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The lesson we have learned is that we need to put it under a balanced regulatory framework so as to enable the sector to grow in a responsible and sustainable manner."
  <br>
  <br>
  He pointed out that innovation is crucial to the development of Web3, and regulators should adopt a technology-neutral approach.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan added that the government is looking to work with innovators and entrepreneurs from around the world to promote Web3 development and leverage its power for the greater good.
  <br>
  <br>
  He revealed that the Securities and Futures Commission has already issued licences to 10 virtual asset trading platforms.
  <br>
  <br>
  The four-day event staged at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre will conclude on Wednesday.

    Ghibli-style AI art can't match real animation: expert

<img alt="The new feature transforms photos into the soft pastel palette style of Studio Ghibli. Photo courtesy of Raj Shroff" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1799213_1_20250407113648.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A tech expert says people still prefer authentic animation over AI-generated art, despite ChatGPT's popular new function that creates Ghibli-style images.
 <br>
  <br>
  The new feature transforms photos and memes into the soft pastel palette style of Studio Ghibli — the renowned Japanese animation workshop behind “Spirited Away”.
  <br>
  <br>
  AI consultant Raj Shroff told RTHK he believes the effect is good marketing for the animation studio.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Studio Ghibli's viewership could increase by a factor of two, five or 10. The people that own Studio Ghibli, their employees and their current fans, they should be very happy that they're just getting free advertising," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  While the AI chatbot's usage and app downloads have hit record highs after the viral rollout, it has raised concerns about privacy and copyright.
  <br>
  <br>
  Studio Ghibli's founder Hayao Miyazaki previously expressed strong opposition to AI animation, and Miyazaki's son said in a recent interview that his father's creative work is irreplaceable.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shroff, for his part, thinks companies should follow ethical guidelines when developing features that replicate distinct artistic styles, such as watermarking AI-generated images.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked about the relationship between AI art and traditional animation, Shroff compares it to lab-grown diamonds versus natural diamonds.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Because AI animation or AI art is so easy to create, my personal theory is that the value attached to it will be a little bit lower," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When it comes to very hardcore or dedicated fan bases of Studio Ghibli or another style of animation, they may prefer the old-school animation methods. If a show is created using those techniques, it may actually be more valuable in the market," he said.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Transport Department on Sunday called on people coming to Hong Kong to see the band Coldplay this week to plan their journeys in advance.
 <br>
  <br>
  The British band will be the first to hold concerts at the new Kai Tak Stadium, with performances on April 8, 9, 11 and 12.
  <br>
  <br>
  The department said there will be special transport arrangements on those days, including bus routes to the border and extra trains on the MTR's Tuen Ma and East Rail lines.
  <br>
  <br>
  There will be cross-boundary coaches departing from Kai Tak, but tickets must be bought in advance.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As the traffic in the vicinity of the Kai Tak Sports Park (KTSP) is expected to be heavy, spectators should opt for public transport and avoid driving," a department spokesperson said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "No parking spaces will be provided in the KTSP during the event period."
  <br>
  <br>
  The department added that it will "mobilise the taxi trade" to pick up passengers at the stadium.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Changes to fees for treatment at Accident and Emergency departments will provide the public with better medical protection, Health Secretary Lo Chung-mau said on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Planned adjustments will see the HK$180 charge for an A&E visit increase to HK$400 from next year for patients who aren't deemed to be critically ill or an emergency case.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other public hospital fees will also change, although there will be a HK$10,000 annual cap on payments.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lo told TVB that the reforms are akin to the government providing everyone in Hong Kong with free medical insurance.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are providing more medical protection to the poor and to those in need of urgent or critical care. This improved protection will benefit seven-and-a-half million people. Everyone in Hong Kong gets extra medical protection. It's just like the government gifting medical insurance to everyone," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lo also said the authorities are looking into charging patients for any appointments they miss, likening such a move to hotels billing guests who fail to show up.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hotels will keep your credit card information, and if you do not appear on the day, or only inform the hotel of your absence on the day, then you should be charged for that cost," he said.

 Hong Kong will calmly face any problems caused by US tariffs with the government providing support to local firms, Financial Secretary Paul Chan said on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Donald Trump administration last week imposed new tariffs on virtually all of Washington's trading partners around the world, including an extra 34 percent on Chinese goods.

  <br>
  Writing on his weekly blog, Chan said US tariffs will put tremendous pressure on trade and the global economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the government has been on the alert and Hong Kong is already less reliant on the US when it comes to exports than in the past.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As unilateralism has gradually been on the uptrend in recent years, Hong Kong companies have made adjustments with regards to their export markets," Chan wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Data shows that last year, goods heading to the US accounted for 6.5 percent of the SAR's overall exports, compared to 8.6 percent in 2018."
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister said firms have been turning their attention to Asean and countries in the Middle East, while the government has been helping companies find new markets and with digitilisation.

 Environment minister Tse Chin-wan has rejected the idea of legislation to force businesses to cut down on their use of packaging, saying many are willing to sign up to the cause voluntarily.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Environmental Protection Department (EPD) launched a "Packaging Reduction Charter" last week and more than 100 firms have signed up so far.
  <br>
  <br>
  The charter is aimed at eight sectors, including supermarkets, food and drink manufacturers and the hospitality trade.
  <br>
  <br>
  Writing on his official blog on Sunday, Tse said given that packaging comes in various forms, it would be difficult to set standardised versions via legislation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Firms signing up to the charter agree to submit an annual report on their use of packaging and the information will be collated by the government with a view to taking steps towards future improvements, he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister noted that as well as pledging to reduce their use of packaging or find sustainable alternatives, the companies involved have agreed to encourage their suppliers, business partners and customers to do the same.

    'AI guidelines push to help prevent data leaks'

 Hong Kong firms making use of generative artificial intelligence may run the risk of data breaches, Privacy Commissioner Ada Chung warned on Sunday, as she explained how new advice issued by her office will help mitigate the dangers.
 <br>
  <br>
  Last week, Chung issued a checklist for companies that is designed to help them develop internal policies or guidelines on the use of Gen AI by their staff.
  <br>
  <br>
  It suggested that firms cover what areas of work AI can be used for, as well as data security, ethical considerations and the protection of personal privacy.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Some organisations may not know that if they input clients' personal information into AI, the AI may leak this information to another party," Chung told Commercial Radio.
  <br>
  <br>
  As an example, she said retail stores may use AI to analyse the preferences of their customers, but this could be problematic if they don't strip out information such as names and telephone numbers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chung said companies with questions on how their use of AI can comply with the requirements of the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance are welcome to make use of a new hotline her office has set up, adding that more promotion and education work will be carried out.
  <br>
  <br>
  The commissioner added that her team has the authority to investigate any incidents where people's privacy is endangered by a company's use of AI.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We can investigate incidents when we receive data breach reports and after that we can issue reports, or even publicly condemn the organisations involved. We can also issue enforcement notices to them and it is a criminal offence if an organisation does not abide by a notice," she noted.

    HK won't impose countermeasures against US tariffs: FS

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Saturday said Hong Kong will not impose countermeasures even though the United States announced sweeping tariffs on countries around the world.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Trump administration announced the imposition of tariffs of 34 percent on Chinese imports, and Beijing authorities have struck back, imposing a 34 percent tariff on all US goods.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a seminar organised by the Hong Kong News-Expo, Chan said Hong Kong will not impose any countermeasures.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Allowing a free flow of capital and acting as a free port are our advantages, and this will not change. The SAR government, of course, strongly opposes the actions by the US, and we also need to be defensive," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But on the other hand, we think we should persist in being free and open. The rules-based multilateral trading system is our core."
  <br>
  <br>
  The finance chief said Hong Kong has an overseeing mechanism to identify risks that may threaten the financial system.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, he said companies from the United States and Western countries regarded the mainland and Hong Kong as "non-investable" markets in the past years.
  <br>
  <br>
  But foreign investors changed their mind with the rise of DeepSeek earlier this year, he said, reassessing the potential of the country's innovation and technological companies.

    Water tariff review aims to make users pay: director

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Director of Water Supplies said on Saturday that while the department is still reviewing water charges, its objective is to achieve the principle of user pays.
 <br>
  <br>
  Roger Wong revealed on a television programme that the public's average daily water consumption has dropped by 12 percent compared to during the pandemic.
  <br>
  <br>
  The department has been reviewing water charges, which have been kept at the same level for almost three decades, since last year, and Wong said the authorities also have to take into account people's livelihoods, as well as the current economic situation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have talked to a number of stakeholders - the catering, hotel and construction sectors, to learn more about their level of water consumption, and obtain their views on price adjustments," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's quite good. Many of them understood that the charge has not been adjusted for years, and find it reasonable if there's a change. But they said they hope the increment can be imposed in a gradual manner, instead of us charging them a lot more all at once."
  <br>
  <br>
  He also pointed out that water pipes in Hong Kong have been in use for about 20 years.
  <br>
  <br>
  About one to two percent of them are considered very old, the director said, and they are located near residential areas or busier roads.
  <br>
  <br>
  A working group has been set up to carry out the prevention of water mains bursts more efficiently, Wong added.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Home and Youth Affairs Alice Mak on Saturday said youth facilities will be set up at the original site of an isolation facility in Kai Tak by October this year.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chief Executive John Lee announced in his Policy Address last year that the government will turn the Kai Tak Community Isolation Facility into a "Youth Post" hostel and spaces for cultural and arts exchanges.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to the press, Mak said her bureau has finished assessing the tenders, and chosen Glorise Tourism & Culture, which is under the China Travel Service, as the organisation to operate the facility.
  <br>
  <br>
  It will be co-organised by CTG Development and Dorsett Hospitality International, she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They will transform 60 percent of the total floor area of the isolation facility into a youth hostel, and gradually organise youth and international exchange activities with cultural, arts and sports elements according to their five-year plan," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mak added that the lease term is five years, and the organisation has to operate the facilities on a self-financing basis.
  <br>
  <br>
  She expects the relevant facilities to commence operation in phases by October.

    Manufacturers told to look for markets outside US

<div class="itemFullText">
 The former president of the Chinese Manufacturers' Association of Hong Kong has called on entrepreneurs to look for new markets away from the US.
 <br>
  <br>
  On April 2, US President Donald Trump announced sweeping tariffs on countries around the world. They included a 34 percent tariff on Chinese goods, on top of the previous 20 percent levy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a Commercial Radio programme, Allen Shi said many manufacturers export goods to the US where there is a huge consumer market.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the future, we need to consider setting up in new markets such as the Middle East, Asean or the former Soviet states, or concentrating on domestic markets," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We cannot just rely on the US market."
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on the same programme, lawmaker Sunny Tan, who represents the textile and garment sector, said the industry felt powerless in the face of Washington's latest move.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he said manufacturers in the US would also suffer from the levies, as a lot of their low-value work is done overseas.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Friday, China said it would impose a 34 percent retaliatory tariff on all US imports from Thursday, in response of Trump's announcement.

    Housing Society to complete tenant checks in late 2026

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Housing Society on Saturday said it hopes to complete checks for well-off tenants by November of next year.
 <br>
  <br>
  The society introduced the "Well-Off Tenants Policy" in 2018. Last year, it was expanded to cover all households that signed new tenancy agreements.
  <br>
  <br>
  The society has already said it will start issuing new tenancy terms from September to the 25,000 households still awaiting checks. Housing Society chairman Ling Kar-kan said the new rental agreement says tenants must regularly declare their income and assets. He said those who refuse to sign must move out within four months.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ling said so far only a few tenants had been classed as being well off.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If we look at the Well-Off Tenants Policy, it has already been implemented on those signing new tenancy agreements," he told an RTHK radio programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There are about 4,000 households who have signed new terms and nine are well-off tenants. Among the nine, seven are paying 1.5 times the standard rent and the other two are paying twice the standard rent."
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the society would discuss the new policy with households before September.

    Retaliatory tariffs on US goods 'aim to cause pain'

<img alt="Lau Siu-kai, a consultant to the Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macau Studies, said China's measures were not gestures. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1799015_1_20250405103147.jpg&q=80">

<div class="itemFullText">
 A senior member of a leading national think tank says China's retaliatory tariffs on the US aim to cause pain. Lau Siu-kai, a consultant to the Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macau Studies, said that given the difficult trade situation, China's retaliatory measures were not gestures, saying otherwise they would be meaningless.
 <br>
  <br>
  On Friday, Beijing announced it would impose a 34 percent tariff on all US imports starting on April 10. The move was in response to US President Donald Trump's announcement on April 2 of a fresh round of tariffs targeting countries worldwide. They included a 34 percent tariff on Chinese goods in addition to the previous 20 percent levy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Washington also made no distinction between goods coming from the SAR and the mainland. In response, Lau said - apart from imposing countermeasures on Washington should Beijing request such a move - Hong Kong could also consider placing levies on US goods.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Terence Chong, executive director of Chinese University's Lau Chor Tak Institute of Global Economics and Finance, believes Beijing's latest round of tariffs will cause US stocks to fall further.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said a recession would likely occur in the US in the next few quarters due to inflationary concerns and the reduction in GDP caused by a decline in consumption.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chong also said the US might impose additional tariffs in response to Beijing's move, further reducing trade between the two countries.

<div class="itemFullText">
 One of the National Games test events – the Hong Kong International Track Cup – will be held from April 19 to 21, attracting professional cyclists from around the world.
 <br>
  <br>
  The three-day event will be held at the Hong Kong Velodrome in Tseung Kwan O, involving about 150 cyclists from over ten countries and regions.
  <br>
  <br>
  The chairman of the organising committee, Steve Nip, said it is also the first time that 50 cyclists from local affiliated clubs will be invited to participate in elite and junior races.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Audiences can enjoy races involving world-class cyclists, and also cheer for cyclists from local affiliated clubs. I hope they can achieve good results with the advantage of racing at their home track," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pui Kwan-kay, the vice president of the Cycling Association of Hong Kong, China, also expressed hope for local cyclists.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This provides the opportunity for the Hong Kong team and young cyclists from local affiliated clubs to showcase their skills," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The public can also watch races of a high standard, and they can treat this as a warm-up for the National Games at the end of the year."
  <br>
  <br>
  SAR cyclist Ceci Lee, who will participate in the race, said she will step up training in the coming two weeks, especially on her sprinting skills, and she hopes she can achieve good results.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another local cyclist, Mow Ching-yin expects his condition to improve gradually as it is getting closer to the National Games, and he said he will focus on improving his endurance and speed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Standard tickets for the Track Cup can be had for HK$50, while a concession ticket costs HK$30.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Secretary for Sports, Culture and Tourism emphasised that she will stay principled and innovative in her work, as she wrapped up her three-day trip to Beijing on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Marking her first visit to Beijing since becoming the tourism chief four months ago, Rosanna Law revealed that Xia Baolong, the director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, has offered his encouragement to her staff.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The director was particularly focused on how we can be innovative in the aspect of tourism, particularly our islands and coasts, we can make good use of such valuable, rich tourism resources," she told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In fact, we have been working on that in the short, medium, and even the long-term."
  <br>
  <br>
  She noted that the Development Bureau is inviting expressions of interest for coastal and island tourism projects on Lamma Island and Lantau Island.
  <br>
  <br>
  Describing the trip as "very fruitful," the minister said she has reported to Xia and the General Administration of Sport of China on a series of mega events staged at the Kai Tak Sports Park after its opening in March.
  <br>
  <br>
  These included the Hong Kong Sevens, for which Law said the feedback from revellers coming outside the SAR and athletes was generally positive.
  <br>
  <br>
  She emphasised that the government has to continue to fulfill its role in leading and monitoring the Kai Tak venue.
  <br>
  <br>
  Law, meanwhile, noted that the current situation for Hong Kong's film industry is challenging.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said the overall economic situation might have caused some cinemas to shut down.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tourism chief added the industry should grab hold of the opportunities on the mainland offered by the Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement, or CEPA.

<div class="itemFullText">
 People on Friday flocked to cemeteries to pay their respects to their ancestors as part of tradition for the Ching Ming Festival.
 <br>
  <br>
  At a cemetery in Diamond Hill, police have controlled traffic flow on certain roads to maintain order.
  <br>
  <br>
  A woman said the crowd was smaller than expected, and the weather was suitable for tomb sweeping.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There are not many people here. I normally come in the morning. There's wind and it's not too sunny," she told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  People also bought paper offerings to cemeteries, but one man said they cost more than last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "These cost me HK$400. It's ten percent more than last year. But this is the tradition. We use these to pay respects to our ancestors. It's not about the money. It's about our intention," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  A shopkeeper said business was better than expected, and there had been people buying paper offerings at his shop since a month ago.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Friday said five local men were arrested in relation to child pornography, as officers warned about AI-generated pornographic images.
 <br>
  <br>
  Officers said five local men, aged between 16 and 49, were arrested last week on suspicion of producing and possessing child pornography, and obstructing a police officer in the execution of his duty.
  <br>
  <br>
  They said hundreds of videos and photos related to child pornography were found in the suspects' electronic devices.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police said pornographic images were found in a 16-year-old suspect's mobile phone, in which he was believed to have filmed his 11-year-old sister.
  <br>
  <br>
  A police clinical psychologist, Fung Ho-kin, said that police, schools and parents need to work together more to prevent this from happening.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They should, and they do, provide education to students as in what behaviour is acceptable on the internet and what is not," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think they are doing workshops in some schools to teach their students how they should respond or how they should behave when they are faced with threats, including internet bullying or sexual exploitation."
  <br>
  <br>
  Police said there were 80 cases in Hong Kong related to child pornography last year, and about 80 percent of the cases were in relation to online activities.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officers said in a joint operation with authorities in Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand, a total of 435 people were arrested over the past two months.
  <br>
  <br>
  They said some cases in other countries were found to involve AI-generated pornographic images, and officers warned that producing content involving child pornography electronically is also a crime.

    HK manufacturers to wait-and-see amid Trump tariffs
   </title>

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The president of the Chinese Manufacturers' Association of Hong Kong has voiced its strong opposition towards US President Donald Trump's latest round of levies.
 <br>
  <br>
  They were part of sweeping tariffs by the Republican leader directed at countries around the world on Thursday, including 34 percent tariff on goods from China. That's on top of the existing tax of 20 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on an RTHK radio programme on Friday, association chairman Wingco Lo pointed out that the move has affected the stability of global supply chains, and has damaged the international trade order.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There are a lot of variables and uncertainties, so manufacturers do not dare to move when it comes to planning, he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will wait and see what the US is going to do. Because its policies often keep changing."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lo noted that US firms and importers are also adopting a wait-and-see approach, and they might suspend placing an order, or doing it later than usual.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the short-run, there might be a shock effect on trade activities, he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  World leaders and businesses have expressed shock and concern by Trump's tariff barrage, with many markets taking a similar stance of not making any major moves.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Lo believes the imposition of tariffs are Trump's bargaining chip and will not last long.
  <br>
  <br>
  This is because Washington itself will also suffer from the move, especially its importers, ports, as well as retailers, according to Lo, and the measure would step up inflation and reduce consumer purchasing power.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that Hong Kong manufacturers are encouraged to open up new markets, and set up production lines in places with low, or even no tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Terence Chong, executive director of Chinese University's Lau Chor Tak Institute of Global Economics and Finance, told the same programme that while he anticipates the SAR's trade industry to suffer losses due to the levies, he expects the impact to be temporary.
  <br>
  <br>
  The situation will get better when people adapt to the reciprocal tariffs, he added.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The SAR government has expressed strong disapproval and discontent over the United States for imposing a fresh round of tariffs and cancelling a duty-free exemption on small parcels.
 <br>
  <br>
  It called on Washington to withdraw the “bullying” measures.
  <br>
  <br>
  US President Donald Trump earlier announced a raft of punishing tariffs targeting countries around the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also signed an executive order to cancel a trade exemption known as "de minimis", which allows low-value packages from mainland China and Hong Kong to enter the country free of duties, from May 2.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The US's measures are bullying and unreasonable, and grossly inconsistent with the World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules, willfully undermining the multilateral trading system which is the cornerstone for international trade," a Hong Kong government spokesperson said on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Once again, the government firmly requests the US to withdraw its so-called reciprocal tariff measures."
  <br>
  <br>
  Responding to changes to the "de minimis" exemption, the administration said Hongkong Post will temporarily maintain postal services to the US without collecting any so-called tariffs on behalf of the US until May 2.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The US has been repeatedly changing its policies unilaterally. Hongkong Post has requested the postal administration of the US to promptly clarify the matter and should not cause inconvenience to the public," the spokesperson said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The administration also pledged to closely monitor and assess any unilateral measures of the US that are inconsistent with fair trade, saying it will defend the city's legitimate interests by, for example, filing a complaint to the WTO.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Any sanctions imposed on public officers are "insults" to the rule of law, the head of Hong Kong's Law Society said on Thursday, days after the United States took action against six officials.
 <br>
  <br>
  Its president, Roden Tong, also said in Beijing that the society would not make comments from "a political perspective", but stressed that public servants should not be interfered with when discharging their duties.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Any sanctions targeting public officials, lawyers or even businessmen for exercising their due functions and rights in accordance with the law are an insult to the rule of law," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tong led a delegation from the society on a four-day visit to the capital, during which the group held a number of exchanges with mainland officials.
  <br>
  <br>
  One of the meetings was with a deputy director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, Nong Rong, he said, adding that they discussed a number of law-related topics.

 A boxing coach charged with murdering a man in Fo Tan last month appeared in Shatin Court on Thursday, after he was arrested in Thailand and sent back to Hong Kong this week.
 <br>
  <br>
  Truong Quoc Anh, 25, faces a preliminary charge of murder following the death of the 52-year-old man in an attack in Lai Wo Lane on March 16.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sha Tin magistrate David Chum adjourned the case until May 29 at the prosecution's request.
  <br>
  <br>
  The defendant was remanded in custody.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police earlier said the defendant was one of nine suspects identified as being connected with the case.
  <br>
  <br>
  All but one of them had been arrested or charged by local or mainland authorities.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A transport worker was on Thursday convicted of rioting in the Yuen Long clashes in 2019 following a retrial.
 <br>
  <br>
  Wong Chi-wing, 60, was acquitted in 2021 but the Department of Justice later successfully sought an appeal, sending the case back to the District Court.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong faced a count each of rioting and wounding with intent, as part of a group of white-shirted men inside the Yuen Long MTR station on July 21, 2019.
  <br>
  <br>
  District Court judge Eddie Yip also found him guilty of wounding with intent, saying Wong could be seen in video footage carrying out what the judge described as "an indiscriminate attack" on people at the station.
  <br>
  <br>
  The judge said he had compared the face of the man shown in the footage with pictures of Wong following his arrest, as well as clothes that officers had seized.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yip said the trousers and shoes were extremely similar to what the suspect was wearing at the scene, saying the shoes were unique.
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted that CCTV footage had caught the defendant wearing those trousers and shoes going in and out of his residential building.
  <br>
  <br>
  In mitigation, Wong's lawyer, senior counsel Lawrence Lok, sought a lenient sentence, saying his client wasn't highly involved in the attack, that his wife had passed away and he's now on medication to treat anxiety.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sentencing is due to take place on Tuesday.

    'Don't go with top-bidder rule for N Metropolis'

<div class="itemFullText">
 A DAB lawmaker on Thursday suggested the government take into account the financial stability of developers when it comes to decisions on tender awards for Northern Metropolis projects to the highest bidders.
 <br>
  <br>
  The suggestion comes after a Development Bureau announcement this week that 22 Hong Kong and mainland companies had submitted expression of interests in developing three pilot zones in the area.
  <br>
  <br>
  The zones are located in Hung Shui Kiu, Fanling North and the San Tin Technopole.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tenders are set to begin in the second half of the year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lau Kwok-fan cautioned against the highest-bidder-wins principle.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The bidders' financial strength is also crucial," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If the government simply allows the highest bidder to win the tender, it's true that a company might be able to offer a high bid.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But if the company doesn't have much assets, the company's size isn't big, it doesn't have experience building largest-scale infrastructure, or it has a high debt ratio, are we really confident that we can hand them such a large area, or confident that the firm can complete the project by the deadline?"
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted that the government can adopt a two-envelope approach – which takes into account the bidders' technical competence as well as their financial ability – and awards the tenders to those bidders that have the highest overall scores.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lau also said given that land in the Northern Metropolis will be developed for various purposes, such as residential and industry, the government should set up a working group to help developers obtain approvals from different bureaus and departments more quickly.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A series of traffic accidents disrupted early morning commutes on Thursday, with collisions occurring in quick succession along Lung Cheung Road and Ching Cheung Road.
 <br>
  <br>
  At about 7:30am, a major collision involving seven private cars occurred on Lung Cheung Road’s Kwun Tong-bound lanes near Lung Cheung Road Park. The crash left six people injured – five men and one woman – all of whom were brought to Queen Elizabeth Hospital for treatment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Footage showed the rear of a car pointing upwards as it lay on top of another car.
  <br>
  <br>
  Just nine minutes later, a coach and a private car collided on the same road’s Kwun Tong-bound section near Wong Tai Sin Temple. No injuries were reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  And two minutes later, a three-vehicle accident occurred on Ching Cheung Road near Caritas Medical Centre. The collision involved two taxis and a private car, with one taxi passenger – who suffered chest and back pain – taken to Princess Margaret Hospital.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Transport Department said some of the Kwun Tong-bound lanes of Lung Cheung Road near Lung Cheung Road Park are closed, and that traffic is congested.

    Tariffs target packages under US$800 from HK

<img alt="US President Donald Trump holds a signed executive order on tariffs, in the Rose Garden at the White House. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798734_1_20250403084633.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Wednesday that closes a trade exemption known as "de minimis" that has allowed low-value packages from mainland China and Hong Kong to enter the United States, free of duties.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump signed the order, which takes effect on May 2, in the Rose Garden of the White House after announcing sweeping new tariffs on global trading partners.
  <br>
  <br>
  The White House said the move came after Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick certified "adequate systems are in place to collect tariff revenue" on the shipments.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said imported goods from mainland China and Hong Kong sent outside the international postal network and valued at or under US$800 would now be subject to all applicable duties.
  <br>
  <br>
  Imported goods sent through the postal network and valued at or under US$800 would now be subject to a duty rate of either 30 percent of their value or US$25 per item, with that rate increasing to US$50 per item after June 1.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump had signed an initial order on February 1 ending duty-free entry for the cheap Chinese goods, but later paused the order because of logistical issues complicating the inspection of millions of the low-value shipments.
  <br>
  <br>
  The number of shipments entering the US through the duty-free route has exploded in recent years, reaching nearly 1.4 billion packages last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 90 percent of all packages coming into the US now enter via de minimis, and of those, about 60 percent come from China, led by direct-to-consumer retailers such as Temu and Shein.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's order affecting de minimis parcels was paused on February 7 because there had not been sufficient time to prepare, with packages stacking up at ports of entry.
  <br>
  <br>
  The White House said carriers transporting the mainland Chinese and Hong Kong postal items must "report shipment details to US Customs and Border Protection (CBP), maintain an international carrier bond to ensure duty payment, and remit duties to CBP on a set schedule."
  <br>
  <br>
  It said CBP may require formal entry for any postal package instead of the specified duties.
  <br>
  <br>
  The White House said the commerce secretary would submit a report within 90 days assessing the order’s impact and considering whether to extend these rules to packages from Macau. (Reuters)

    Govt seeks interest in ecotourism projects

<img alt="The government wants to develop Pak Nai into an ecotourism destination. Photo: Development Bureau" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798669_1_20250402192137.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Development Bureau announced on Wednesday that it is inviting expressions of interest for three major ecotourism projects in outlying islands and coastal areas.
 <br>
  <br>
  This is the first time in recent years that the government has released large areas of land to build new attractions for tourism and recreation.
  <br>
  <br>
  The projects are: transforming the Ex-Lamma Quarry site into a high-end lakeside resort; developing a new Eco-Recreation Corridor in South Lantau; and creating ecotourism nodes at Tsim Bei Tsui and Pak Nai.
  <br>
  <br>
  A bureau spokesperson said officials are seeking market input before starting statutory planning procedures, to ensure the projects better align with market interests.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Ex-Lamma Quarry project envisions a luxury resort complex featuring a 5-hectare artificial lake, a marina that can accommodate 150 to 200 yachts, as well as low-density housing development.
  <br>
  <br>
  To ensure coordinated planning, officials aim to have a single developer manage the site.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 9.3-hectare South Lantau Eco-Recreation Corridor – spanning Cheung Sha, Pui O, Shui Hau and Shek Pik – will feature adventure resorts and ecotourism facilities.
  <br>
  <br>
  Developers may choose to develop the entire corridor or focus on individual facilities.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Tsim Bei Tsui and Pak Nai nodes, covering 87 and 33 hectares respectively, will become tourist spots featuring restaurants, wellness centres and holiday resorts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Multiple developers can participate in this project, and local villagers will have the opportunity to become business partners.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bureau will hold briefing sessions for each project on April 14, and interested parties have until July 2 to submit their expressions of interest.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials said the three projects are expected to cost tens of billions of dollars each.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government plans to open the Ex-Lamma Quarry project for bidding in the second half of 2026, and expects it will take around six to seven years to complete.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office (HKMAO) on Wednesday reposted an article by the Ta Kung Pao newspaper voicing opposition to CK Hutchison's plans to sell dozens of ports, including strategic assets along the Panama Canal.
 <br>
  <br>
  The article said CK Hutchison is an important Hong Kong-based firm, and it should bear its basic responsibilities and fix its mistakes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The piece included views from various political and business leaders, including vice-chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and former chief executive CY Leung who said national interests are most important.
  <br>
  <br>
  He questioned if the US government would give the green light if China wants to buy US chip enterprises and the firms are willing to sell.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing officials in charge of SAR affairs have reposted a number of commentaries at the Ta Kung Pao newspaper, criticising the proposed sale to a US consortium led by investment firm BlackRock.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police said on Wednesday more suspects have been arrested in connection with the murder of a 52-year-old man in Fo Tan last month.
 <br>
  <br>
  One of the suspects is a 25-year-old man who was taken into custody in Thailand earlier and has since returned to Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officers said he was arrested near Pattaya and sent back to the SAR on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police believe he was one of two people who carried out the attack.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Wednesday afternoon, the suspect was taken to Fo Tan where officers reconstructed the case.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officers said he will be charged soon.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police also revealed that two others were arrested earlier on suspicion of assisting offenders.
  <br>
  <br>
  So far, eight out of the nine suspects linked to the case have been arrested by Hong Kong or mainland police, including a 76-year-old man and his son who allegedly planned the attack.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking in a media briefing, superintendent Li Muk-yik said the remaining suspect, who allegedly served as a lookout, had fled to the mainland and remains at large.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also said the force was able to identify all the suspects after going through surveillance cameras.
  <br>
  <br>
  Li added that the probe has been challenging.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The suspects [allegedly] put fake licence plates on taxis [as they fled]. They were very cautious before and after the incident," he told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They had [allegedly] changed their clothes and the vehicles several times after they fled."
  <br>
  <br>
  Li said the case was triggered by disputes over money.

  The 52-year-old man had been trapped in the rubble of a hotel for more than 120 hours.
  <br>
  <br>
  The joint rescue came five days after the earthquake, beyond what is typically considered the critical "golden" period for finding survivors.
  <br>
  <br>
  The man was found in stable condition and has been transferred to local medical facilities for treatment.
  <br>
  <br>
  This marks the ninth survivor rescued by the national team since their deployment to Myanmar.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a Facebook post, security minister Chris Tang expressed gratitude to members of both the national and SAR squads.
  <br>
  <br>
  Deputy chief fire officer Cheu Yu-kok, who led the 51-strong SAR team, said they spared no effort in the search and rescue work.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The team will grasp every opportunity, never give up and do its best to find the remaining survivors," he said.

 The psychological well-being of Hong Kong's secondary school pupils improved slightly in the last academic year but was still worse than before the pandemic, the Department of Health said on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  About 430,000 children in primary and secondary education received student health services in the 2023/24 school year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Data from the department's annual report shows 2.8 percent of secondary pupils reported having had plans to take their own lives, while 1.3 percent said they had actually attempted suicide.
  <br>
  <br>
  This figures were up from the 2.5 percent and 1.1 percent recorded in 2018/19.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is self-reported, so it may not represent the whole story. Some students may not wish to tell in the questionnaire... It may be underestimated or overestimated," said community medicine consultant Chuang Shuk-kwan.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If they say yes to the attempted suicide or planned suicide, we are very concerned and we will provide them individual counselling, and if necessary, we will refer them to the specialist or even A&E departments, if there is indeed an emergency."
  <br>
  <br>
  Dr Chuang also said that over 40 percent of primary school students and 80 percent of secondary school students spent two or more hours per day using electronic screens for recreational purposes.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said the increased screen time among students may worsen their vision.
