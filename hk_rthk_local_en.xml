<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Thursday warned that technology-related crimes are on the rise in Hong Kong, while vowing to work with other jurisdictions to take on the challenges new technology poses.
 <br>
  <br>
  At the Asia and Pacific Regional Conference of the International Association of Prosecutors, Chief Executive John Lee said the SAR attaches great importance to ensuring the security of cyber infrastructure.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In Hong Kong, a highly developed international financial centre where technology is easily accessible by all, criminals are increasingly turning to the use of cryptocurrencies, virtual assets and technology in committing traditional crime. And crimes executed solely through technology are also on the rise," Lee said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That's why Hong Kong places great emphasis on the security of cyber infrastructure, in fighting technology crime, locally and internationally."
  <br>
  <br>
  Secretary for Justice Paul Lam told the same conference that crimes involving modern technology present "novel challenges" to prosecutors, adding that it can be difficult to bring offenders to justice.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Modern technology is, of course, not inherently evil. It becomes evil only when it is misused and abused by criminals," Lam said. "Our overriding objective is not only to prevent, suppress and punish such misuses and abuses, but also to outwit the criminals by becoming better users of modern technology and make modern technology our close ally in our war against the criminals."
  <br>
  <br>
  Tong Jianming, first deputy prosecutor general of the Supreme People's Procuratorate, said it is important for jurisdictions to adapt to changes brought about by technological developments.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that Beijing is willing to collaborate with others on using modern technology in strengthening prosecutions and looking into effective ways to tackle crime.

    Analyst sees slight growth in home prices in 2025

<img alt="A property analyst says the supply of new flats will peak next year, which will provide a good opportunity for potential homebuyers. Photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1781176_2_20241128105247.jpg&q=40">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A property analyst says housing prices are bottoming out and should stabilise next year, with possible growth of under five percent.
 <br>
  <br>
  Hannah Jeong, head of valuation and advisory services at CBRE, was commenting after official data showed that home prices went up in October after declining for five months.
  <br>
  <br>
  Data showed private residential prices were up 0.6 percent month-on-month. In September, prices dropped to their lowest level in eight years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rents in October recorded their first fall since February, falling 0.3 percent month-on-month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jeong said the major reasons for the upswing in prices were local banks lowering their prime rates after the US central bank began cutting interest rates in September.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government relaxing the maximum loan-to-value (LTV) ratio for all residential properties to 70 percent, regardless of the value of the property and whether it is for self-occupation, also had an impact, she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think we only have three or two months to go. So the decline or the overall negative growth will continue within this year," Jeong said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But 2025, possibly we are bottoming out and then see slight positive growth, possibly less than five percent, or remain stable or flat. So that's the forecast for 2025."
  <br>
  <br>
  The analyst noted the rental market was performing quite well, with a yield reaching about 3.3 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said she expected this upward trend to continue in 2025, due to the number of people entering the city under various government talent schemes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jeong also said there was a very strong desire for home ownership in Hong Kong, and next year, when the supply of new flats was expected to peak at around 26,000, this would provide a good opportunity for potential homebuyers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So I think we are facing the supply peak, obviously, at the wrong time. But this will give a good opportunity to homebuyers. People were waiting a very long time and unfortunately during Covid, people thought the market will be soft. But we had a 2020 price peak and people are losing money, whoever bought at that moment," she explained.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So now people learned a lesson and expect that if the price is much more affordable at this moment, people want to have a home."
  <br>
  <br>
  She also said developers were keen to get rid of their new units and were offering good incentives in the first-hand market.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Secretary Eric Chan on Wednesday said a three-day visit to the Greater Bay Area has offered authorities insight into developing the Northern Metropolis project in the New Territories.
 <br>
  <br>
  Concluding the three-day visit to Guangdong province attended by government officials and business leaders, Chan said the trip had met its goal.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This trip to different major cities is purely an introduction, an exchange. We do not require business representatives to make any investments," Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I hope that they are able to see business opportunities, because they are truly the experts in doing business. When they see business opportunities, naturally, they will hold discussions [with others]."
  <br>
  <br>
  During the trip, enterprises from Guangdong and Hong Kong signed 126 economic and trade cooperation projects worth a total value of more than 100 billion yuan.
  <br>
  <br>
  The delegation also learnt about a “large-scale, land-disposable” development model used in mainland cities, which the SAR administration hopes can be used to expedite development in the Northern Metropolis.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan also said the government will hold a "promotional event" relating to the mega project on Friday, with local, mainland and foreign companies expected to attend.
  <br>
  <br>
  Finance chief Paul Chan is hammering out the details and will make an announcement in due course, the chief secretary added.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Banker Peter Wong has been named the new chairman of the University of Hong Kong (HKU) governing council, succeeding barrister Priscilla Wong after her term ends next month.
 <br>
  <br>
  The government on Wednesday announced the appointment of the banker, who was previously the Asia-Pacific chief executive officer at HSBC, for a term of three years with effect from January 1, 2025.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chief Executive John Lee, in his capacity as the university's chancellor, also appointed five new members to the governing council.
  <br>
  <br>
  They include former director general of civil aviation Simon Li; Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) Standing Committee member Irons Sze; lawmaker Rock Chen; former president of the Hong Kong Institute of Human Resource Management Wilfred Wong; and CPPCC delegate Samuel Yung.
  <br>
  <br>
  Five other current members will also leave the governing council, alongside the outgoing chairwoman.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The newly appointed members are all elites in the community, possessing outstanding capabilities and rich experience," the government said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The chief executive hopes that the new appointments will provide the HKU's governance with a new outlook and new impetus, begin a new chapter in governance, steer the HKU towards striving for excellence and provide fresh momentum to the university."
  <br>
  <br>
  The university, for its part, said it respects the appointments made by the administration.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The university will continue to pursue excellence and make contributions in academic excellence, talent cultivation and international cooperation," HKU said.
  <br>
  <br>
  In June, a task force was established amid a conflict among the university's leadership, with vice-chancellor Zhang Xiang complaining that he was left in the dark about appointments made by Priscilla Wong.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the government statement, the chief executive thanked the task force “for its unremitting efforts in coordinating the HKU's internal operations, enhancing communication, assisting in resolving issues, reaching a consensus, and achieving a positive outcome”.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The group will continue its work to facilitate collaboration between the new council and the management for the continuous enhancement of the HKU's governance effectiveness."

    Auditor finds hitches with care home voucher scheme

<img alt="The auditor said welfare officials need to resolve some administrative issues with the Residential Care Service Voucher Scheme. File photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1781061_1_20241127153405.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Audit Commission said on Wednesday that it has found a number of administrative issues with a government voucher scheme for elderly people to pay for care homes, such as incorrect charges and widely varying application processing times.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a report, the commission said more than 5,700 applications for the Residential Care
  <br>
  Service Voucher scheme were received in 2022-23 and 2023-24, and as of the end of March this year, 3,179 vouchers had been issued.
  <br>
  <br>
  Welfare officials haven't given a timeline on how long applications should take, but the auditor found it can vary greatly, from issuance the same day all the way to a wait of seven months. The average time was 43 days, it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The auditor also found that some voucher recipients were wrongly sent bills for charges that were supposed to be covered by the government, or were overcharged by homes for extra items like nutritional drinks.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Social Welfare Department is tasked with inspecting service providers, as well as carrying out visits to check various aspects of the voucher scheme, such as the fees being charged.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the auditor found that in the previous three financial years, inspections were carried out 41 days late on average, while visits were 232 days overdue. The department blamed the delays on the Covid pandemic.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[The social welfare director should] take measures to ensure that service monitoring visits and inspections are conducted in accordance with the timeframes stipulated in the department's guidelines," the commission said.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also made a series of other recommendations, such a specific timeframe for processing voucher applications and a mechanism for vetting care home charges.
  <br>
  <br>
  The department said it agreed with the recommendations and will take the necessary follow-up action.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Four people who were jailed for conspiracy to commit subversion in Hong Kong's largest national security trial to date have appealed against their convictions and sentences.
 <br>
  <br>
  Former activist Owen Chow, former lawmaker Helena Wong, former district councillor Clarisse Yeung and ex-hospital worker Winnie Yu filed their appeals to the High Court on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The hearing date has not been scheduled, according to the judiciary website.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last week, the High Court handed down jail terms to 45 people for their roles in a scheme aiming to bring down the government by organising an unsanctioned Legco primary poll, with sentences ranging from four years and two months to 10 years behind bars.
  <br>
  <br>
  The four who lodged the appeals were among those who pleaded not guilty but were convicted after trial.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chow was slapped with a jail sentence of seven years and nine months; Yu received a prison term of six years and nine months; and Wong and Yeung were each sentenced to six-and-a-half years in jail.

    Auditor urges closer scrutiny of drone registrations

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Audit Commission has urged the Civil Aviation Department (CAD) to improve its verification procedures when registering drones, after finding multiple cases of "odd data" in the system.
 <br>
  <br>
  The commission said it looked at some of the more than 24,000 drone registrations recorded via the Electronic Portal for Small Unmanned Aircraft (eSUA) as of June this year, and found numerous discrepancies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rules on flying drones in Hong Kong, such as whether permission is needed from the authorities, vary depending – among other things – on the weight of the aircraft in question.
  <br>
  <br>
  But in some cases, the recorded weight of drones registered in the database did not match the standard weight for their model and appear to have ended up in the wrong category, the commission said in a report released on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also found that while drones should have a unique serial number, dozens in the database had duplicate numbers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another issue flagged up in the report was eSUA account holders deleting their accounts without deregistering their drones.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If an eSUA account has been deleted, there may no longer be any responsible person for the valid SUA [Small Unmanned Aircraft] held under the deleted account," the commission warned.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also discovered that as of June 30, several thousand registrations were "under verification" – with more than 1,250 languishing under this status for more than two years.
  <br>
  <br>
  The commission linked this to an earlier move by the authorities to streamline the registration process by scrapping a requirement for owners to provide a photograph of the registration label attached to their drone.
  <br>
  <br>
  "While CAD has drawn up plans and taken measures to handle the SUA under verification by 30 November 2024, CAD needs to continue to closely monitor the handling of the SUA under verification and take measures to ensure that those cases will be properly followed through," the commission said.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also found that as of the end of June, the CAD had dealt with 38 cases of suspected violations of the SUA Order under the Civil Aviation Ordinance, of which 13 involved tourists.
  <br>
  <br>
  "These indicated that visitors might not be well aware of the requirements under the SUA Order. With a view to enhancing the awareness of visitors on the SUA Order, CAD needs to make sustained efforts in arranging publicity and education targeting visitors," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Director-General of Civil Aviation, Victor Liu, said he generally agrees with the commission's recommendations.

 Police on Wednesday launched an investigation after a six-metre-tall noise barrier along a road in Tsuen Wan caught fire.
 <br>
  <br>
  Emergency personnel were called to Cheung Pei Shan Road near Shek Wai Kok Estate when the force received multiple fire reports at about 11am.
  <br>
  <br>
  Firefighters took about half an hour to put out the flames.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officers believe the blaze began beneath a footbridge near Shek Kuk House of Shek Wai Kok Estate, before spreading to the barrier.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chief inspector Law Sai-to of the Tsuen Wan district crime unit said emergency personnel did not find any accelerant at the scene.
  <br>
  <br>
  "During our investigations, we noticed some security cameras had captured the incident. However, since the location of the incident was accessible to anyone and was frequented by residents, and due to limited distance of the security cameras, the real cause of the fire is still under investigation," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The force added that though a 40-metre stretch of the road was burnt, the noise barrier structure was not at risk of collapsing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Videos posted online showed the structure engulfed in flames. "Wow, it's burning through the top," one driver in a video remarked.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another said: "There's no way we can drive through this."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Highways Department said it aims to fully reopen the road by early Thursday.

    Help make HK a green finance hub, CE tells bankers

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Wednesday told the banking sector to gear up and help realise the government's vision of turning Hong Kong into a regional green finance hub.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a luncheon session hosted by the Hong Kong Association of Banks, Lee pointed out that the government has issued HK$220 billion worth of green and sustainable bonds since May 2019.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee said a roadmap will soon be released to guide financial institutions in meeting international sustainable standards.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the coming weeks, we will launch a roadmap on the adoption of the International Financial Reporting Standards on Sustainability Disclosure. We aspire to make Hong Kong among the world's first jurisdictions to align local requirements with international sustainability reporting requirements," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, the chief executive noted that the government is just as committed to supporting the financial sector in innovation and adopting new technologies.
  <br>
  <br>
  He cited a new subsidy scheme launched earlier this year which gives a maximum grant of HK$150,000 for each approved fintech project.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The establishment in June of a dedicated proof-of-concept subsidy scheme for green fintech makes that clear. Among other things, it will provide early stage funding support for pre-commercialised green fintech projects,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Beyond its value in green and sustainable finance, fintech can help companies tap into new technology, including AI and blockchain, to boost efficiency and stay abreast of the competition.”

<div class="itemFullText">
 Customs officers on Wednesday said they arrested five men and two women in a series of anti-drugs operations this month involving "space oil" and an anaesthetic called etomidate, which is illegal to posses unless prescribed by a doctor.
 <br>
  <br>
  Officers said their operations led to the seizure of space oil capsules and etomidate powder with a total estimated market value of around HK$17 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The gaining popularity of space oil or etomidate, which is currently a part one poison abused by the young people, has aroused our enforcement attention," said acting assistant commissioner Wong Ho-yin.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The success of our enforcement in November demonstrates the strong determination of Hong Kong Customs in detecting the crimes relating to illicit etomidate or space oil," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong added that etomidate can cause tremors, dizziness, hallucinations and even brain damage.

    HKU to ensure Hong Kong's doctor supply

 The head of the University of Hong Kong's medical faculty said on Wednesday that it is important to ensure that support for all medical schools will continue after the establishment of a third such institute in the city.
 <br>
  <br>
  The government said earlier that a medical school will be set up in the Northern Metropolis. So far, three universities have submitted proposals to run it.
  <br>
  <br>
  Professor Lau Chak-sing said HKU will help ensure there are enough doctors to serve the people of Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will continue to do our very best in training the best doctors with diversification, so they will not just be good in looking after patients, but also have a good understanding of disease mechanism, medical and health research, and be able to contribute to research development in Hong Kong and beyond," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lau added that the university's plan to establish a new graduate-entry medical programme can help produce the right doctors for the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have been receiving students who have completed a first degree before joining us in studying medicine [as a second bachelor's degree]. We have some experience in these students, and these students are more mature, more empathetic, and we find this is a useful development within the medical faculty," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Lau said the faculty's new clinical trial centre in Hetao which opened last week will provide a one-stop platform for training medical talent in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the centre aims to increase the standards of clinical trials by coordinating different stakeholders' needs, including the two existing medical schools, and public and private hospitals.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The institute is a common platform to facilitate clinical trials development in Hong Kong, we hope to attract industry investment in Hong Kong, attract clinical trials to be performed and conducted in Hong Kong as well as the Greater Bay Area," Lau said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that the centre will train as much talent as possible so the city's medical industry can continue to thrive.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government is proposing that landlords who rent out poor quality subdivided flats face prison terms of up to three years and fines as high as HK$300,000.
 <br>
  <br>
  Plans to regulate such cramped homes include a minimum flat size of 86 square feet, or eight square metres, with rooms having a minimum height of 2.3 metres.
  <br>
  <br>
  Documents submitted to Legco on Wednesday set out proposals for further requirements, including fire detectors and fire-resistant walls, as well as a ban on toilets being placed on balconies or outer corridors of buildings.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials say as well as proper ventilation and lighting, each subdivided flat should have its own water and electrical meters.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Housing Bureau says renting out a flat that isn't certified would also be illegal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lawmakers are due to discuss the plans on December 2, with a public consultation exercise beginning the following day and lasting until February 10.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bureau says it hopes the bill will be passed next year and that registration of subdivided flats can get underway in the final quarter.

    Lawmaker labels new arts blueprint 'a breakthrough'

<img alt="Works by German artist Markus Lupertz on display at this year's Art Basel Hong Kong. Under the government's blueprint, the city will strive to become an East-meets-West cultural exchange hub.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A member of the government's Advisory Committee on Arts Development says a new blueprint for the sector is a big leap forward.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lawmaker Johnny Ng told Hong Kong Today's Ben Tse that the development plan was very comprehensive and could build up the city as an East-meets-West centre for international cultural exchanges, as expressed in the National 14th Five-Year Plan.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government unveiled its Blueprint for Arts and Culture and Creative Industries Development on Tuesday, with dozens of measures for the city's creative industries.
  <br>
  <br>
  It spells out four key directions, including promoting Chinese culture, building an international platform for cultural exchanges, and refining the ecosystem for creative industries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ng told RTHK that the overhaul of arts funding was a "big breakthrough" that would see greater support towards individual artists or smaller groups.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We can see that some small and medium-sized artist groups will be funded by the ADC (Arts Development Council), while the nine largest major performing arts groups will be supported by ACAD (Advisory Committee on Arts Development). I think we can see that in between, there's some mobility we can enhance in order to support individuals, small artists to get funding," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Currently, government subventions are given to nine major performing arts groups - including the Hong Kong Ballet, the Hong Kong Philharmonic Orchestra and the Chung Ying Theatre Company - and grants to small and medium arts groups.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ng said that by striving to become an East-meets-West regional arts hub, tourism and other sectors in Hong Kong would also benefit.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was hopeful that more film festivals, art auctions and art tech exhibitions could be hosted in the SAR.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The public will get to meet two pandas sent by the central government as gifts to the SAR on December 8, a day after a greeting ceremony at Ocean Park.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chief Executive John Lee said the names of the giant pandas, which arrived here from Sichuan in September, will be unveiled by officials at the ceremony, following a naming competition organised by the government.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee added that he and his wife recently visited the pandas with Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism Kevin Yeung.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We saw that the pair of giant pandas were energetic and lively," he wrote on social media.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The park told me that the pair have adapted to their new environment very quickly, and they're doing well."
  <br>
  <br>
  The pair's addition raises to six the number of giant pandas currently in the SAR, after Ying Ying gave birth to a pair of cubs in August.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A former inmate has credited a local charity with helping him reintegrate into society and overcome many challenges in his life.
 <br>
  <br>
  John has now become one of the ambassadors of the Sports Change Life Foundation, which provides sports companionship and mentorship to inmates, rehabilitated individuals and those facing adversity.
  <br>
  <br>
  The foundation is one of the beneficiaries of this year's Operation Santa Claus (OSC) and has organised the project "Free Running Peer Exercise Reform Plan - Join Together to Save Calories for the Warmth Campaign".
  <br>
  <br>
  The idea is that the number of calories burnt during the exercise is exchanged for food and Christmas meals to be donated to the needy.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Before, I don't believe that I can keep running for 10 kilometres. But through this kind of practice, step by step, I can break through some obstacles and make me to build up my confidence and let me to believe that I can stand up again. It's very important to me to build a positive mindset to myself that helps me to reintegrate into the society," said John (not his real name).
  <br>
  <br>
  Fundraising director Chu Ki-sum said peer-running programmes were designed to train inmates and rehabilitated individuals as ambassadors, who eventually visit schools to share their experiences, inspire youth to steer clear of drugs and crime, promote healthy values, and prevent delinquency.
  <br>
  <br>
  John added that the funding would cover expenses for professional coaching, running equipment, resources, and school visits.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For the training and also after the training we have some gathering so this gathering can build a friendship to support them and just like the guardians to help them to integrate into society," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jointly organised by RTHK and South China Morning Post, OSC funds charitable projects that focus on children and youth, the elderly, the community, those with physical and mental disabilities, medical projects, and those concerning the environment.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong government on Tuesday strongly disapproved and opposed a letter from US politicians to the country’s treasury secretary, saying that it damages the SAR’s reputation as an international financial centre.
 <br>
  <br>
  An SAR government spokesman stressed that the allegations had no factual basis and the letter was a “crude and reprehensible attempt to spread lies and misinformation about Hong Kong for personal political gain”.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the government “has been enforcing the sanctions imposed by the United Nations Security Council fully and vigorously to fulfil our international obligations”.
  <br>
  <br>
  The spokesman added that maintaining the integrity and robustness of the city's financial systems is a top priority for the SAR government.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong has been recognised by the Financial Action Task Force, the international standard-setter on anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism, to be overall compliant with the relevant international standards, with a robust legal framework and effective system in this area, especially in the identification and understanding of risks, law enforcement, asset recovery and international co-operation," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The letter by US lawmakers alleged Hong Kong is playing an "increasing role as a financial hub for money laundering, sanctions evasion, and other illicit financial activities".

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Tuesday said they arrested 59 people, after officers busted syndicates allegedly linked to loan shark and illegal debt collection activities involving a total of more than HK$39 million.
 <br>
  <br>
  The force said the suspects, between the ages of 20 and 76, are alleged to have targeted foreign domestic helpers
  <br>
  <br>
  They said syndicate members used different methods to deduct the amount of money the borrower actually received, such as forcing them to purchase goods or pay administration fees. The victims then had to repay the loan at a high-interest rate.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The syndicate took advantage of lenders who have borrowing needs,” said Ho Yan-ki, the Chief Inspector of Hong Kong Island Regional Crime Unit.
  <br>
  <br>
  The force said officers seized over HK$1 million in cash, passports, employment contracts and loan agreements during the operation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho encouraged foreign domestic helpers and their employers to contact police if they encountered such loan shark syndicates.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A renowned theatre producer and curator on Tuesday welcomed the government's new roadmap on promoting arts and culture development in Hong Kong, saying it provides a comprehensive plan for the sector's growth.
 <br>
  <br>
  Mathias Woo, co-Artistic director and executive director of Zuni Icosahedron, said the 71 measures in the Blueprint for Arts and Culture and Creative Industries Development are very comprehensive, covering almost all aspects.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It covers venues, it covers exchange, it covers personnel training, facility, [role of West Kowloon Cultural District Authority]. Somehow I think it's a very, very good start,” he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  Woo said he hopes the West Kowloon Cultural District Authority can more proactively reach out to art groups and allow them long-term use of its performance venues.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The blueprint mentioned that the authority should pick up a stronger role in facilitating culture and creative industry. I think it has to strengthen its connection with the industry and also to build a more content-based venue, which means, like in London, you have the Royal Ballet, the art groups have their own venue and their own home base,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tam Kwok-kan, a member of the Arts Development Council, also welcomed the news, especially the idea of industrialising the sector.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The industrialisation of art and culture makes it something that can involve people, involve talents, involve artists, not just in their own production, in their own creativity, but also make their work marketable,” he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tam, who’s also the dean of the School of Humanities and Social Science at Hang Seng University, said he believes this focus can help showcase the work of arts groups to the outside world.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Many of the art groups in Hong Kong do not know how to market their products. So this blueprint has a focus on marketisation, not just let the different art groups to work alone, but to create synergies among them, and to build a platform for them to market their work, not just in Hong Kong, not just in China, but also in places outside Hong Kong,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tam added that he thinks the government should accord priority to developing the theatre and film industries, saying theatre performances and movies are good ways to attract tourists and showcase Hong Kong.

    Ombudsman probes construction waste recycling

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ombudsman Jack Chan announced on Tuesday that he has launched an investigation into construction waste recycling services provided by the government, as well as its work in combating illegal dumping.
 <br>
  <br>
  The government implemented the Construction Waste Disposal Charging Scheme almost two decades ago and also rolled out a pilot scheme in 2021 for people to make reservations for recycling construction waste through the app "HoHoSkips".
  <br>
  <br>
  But Chan noted that waste is still illegally disposed of in public places.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This not only causes inconvenience and safety hazards for the public and road users but also affects environmental hygiene and requires additional public resources for disposal," he said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan also said data suggests the app might be underused.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Therefore, I have decided to launch this direct investigation operation to scrutinise the existing management of construction waste, including the EPD's control and preventive measures against illegal disposal of construction waste, specific details and operating situations of the 'HoHoSkips' service, how its effectiveness is monitored, and relevant promotion and publicity initiatives."
  <br>
  <br>
  The public have until December 27 to submit any views they have on the matter.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government and the Housing Authority on Tuesday both said they respect the top court's ruling that grants subsidised housing benefits to same-sex couples.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Court of Final Appeal affirmed lower court rulings made earlier, saying that it also finds current policies discriminatory and unconstitutional.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will study the judgment thoroughly and seek legal advice from the Department of Justice for appropriate follow-up actions," a government spokesman said.
  <br>
  <br>
  A Housing Authority spokesman also said it will study the judgment in detail and seek legal advice where necessary for taking follow-up actions.
  <br>
  <br>
  One of the litigants involved in the case, Nick Infinger, said he is happy he won the case after a six-year legal battle, saying this means same-sex couples have the right to live together.
  <br>
  <br>
  He told reporters that he hopes Hong Kong can become more equal and fair. "I feel quite excited because the court made the judgment in favour of us," he said outside court.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think the most important thing is not only fighting for me and for my partner, but this is fighting for all the same-sex couples in Hong Kong."
  <br>
  <br>
  DAB lawmaker Holden Chow expressed concern over the verdict, saying it might affect public housing resources.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We would foresee following the verdict today there might be a lot of same-sex couples
  <br>
  getting married abroad and then they come back to Hong Kong and apply for public housing."
  <br>
  <br>
  So the question now is what is the impact on the public housing resources to be allocated to traditional families? These are the concerns shared by the general public," he said.

    Govt unveils arts and culture industry blueprint

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government has vowed to leverage Hong Kong's strengths to make the SAR an international cultural exchange centre, as it unveiled a development plan with dozens of measures for the city's creative industries.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Blueprint for Arts and Culture and Creative Industries Development spells out four key directions -- promoting Chinese culture, developing diverse creative industries, building an international platform for cultural exchanges, and refining the ecosystem for creative industries.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also includes 71 measures covering industries such as film, music, and performing arts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Around half of the initiatives have commenced, with the remaining beginning from next year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ultimate goal, the administration said, is to turn Hong Kong into an "East-meets-West" centre for international cultural exchange.
  <br>
  <br>
  Culture, sports and tourism minister Kevin Yeung on Tuesday said the blueprint is a "macro policy document" that is not "cast in stone".
  <br>
  <br>
  "One unique aspect of art and creative industries is that they evolve over time with social development. The specific measures won't remain unchanged," Yeung said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We'll keep an open mind when discussing with industry stakeholders. We'll review priorities for individual development paths and measures, explore new ideas aligned with the blueprint's vision and principles, and provide support with our resources."
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities hope the economic benefit generated by creative industries will go from HK$122 billion in 2022 to HK$200 billion by 2034.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another goal is for the number of jobs generated by such sectors to rise from more than 220,000, to 264,000 over the same period.
  <br>
  <br>
  The measures include establishing a museum in the Northern Metropolis on the nation's development and achievements; displaying works of local artists and designers in government offices and buildings as a bid to make Hong Kong the "capital of creativity"; and promoting the city's unique pop culture on the mainland and around the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  On enhancing the ecosystem, the blueprint mentions a comprehensive review of the current funding mechanism for arts groups.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeung said groups could be added to, or removed from, the subsidised list, although not based on one individual factor.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Over time, we aim to maintain a balance in our different funding systems by considering various factors, and we plan to keep this approach in the future," Yeung said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We look at things like the individual art level, audience response, the impact on promoting sector growth, and whether the ideas are innovative. All these factors could serve as criteria when we update the funding mechanism."
  <br>
  <br>
  The blueprint puts an emphasis on participation from the whole of society and it shouldn't only be the government that pours in resources for arts and culture, the minister added.

    CFA affirms housing rights of same-sex couples

<img alt="The five-judge panel of the top court unanimously rejects the appeal from the Housing Authority. File photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1780848_1_20241126121312.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's top court has affirmed earlier court rulings granting subsidised housing benefits to same-sex couples, after finding current policies discriminatory and unconstitutional.
 <br>
  <br>
  The five-judge panel of the Court of Final Appeal (CFA), led by Chief Justice Andrew Cheung, unanimously rejected an appeal from the Housing Authority.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lower courts had granted the rights to subsidised housing benefits to two same-sex couples married overseas.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CFA on Tuesday rejected the Housing Authority's argument that under the Basic Law, only opposite-sex married couples are entitled to apply for public housing, overriding provisions on equality.
  <br>
  <br>
  The judges held that while only opposite-sex couples can obtain the legal status of marriage under Hong Kong's constitutional framework, this doesn't shield housing policies from scrutiny under equality provisions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Entitlements to apply for [public rental housing] units and [Home Ownership Scheme] flats are only some of those [legal] rights, but they do not go to the status of marriage itself," the judgement read.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[The Basic Law article on marriage] therefore does not remove the subject Housing Authority policies from the purview of the equality provisions."
  <br>
  <br>
  The housing body had also argued that same-sex and heterosexual married couples weren't comparable because the latter can give birth, therefore supporting the government's policy objective on population growth.
  <br>
  <br>
  The judges rejected this argument, saying same-sex couples can adopt children or have children through artificial means.
  <br>
  <br>
  They also said they found the authority's policies aimed at supporting traditional family to be "disproportionate and unjustified", saying it didn't offer enough evidence over their arguments.
  <br>
  <br>
  The judges said the authority did not address the likely effect on housing supply or the impact on opposite-sex couples if the policies were relaxed.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CFA dismissed the authority's appeal and ordered it to pay for the legal costs of the respondents.
  <br>
  <br>
  The court also ruled against the government in a related case regarding the inheritance of property.
  <br>
  <br>
  Edgar Ng, now deceased, had wished to add his same-sex spouse as a registered occupant and joint owner to a Home Ownership Scheme flat.
  <br>
  <br>
  The secretary for justice had argued that foreign same-sex marriages aren't comparable to heterosexual marriages when it comes to inheritance rights.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CFA judges ruled that excluding same-sex spouses from inheritance amounted to unlawful discrimination.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 University of Hong Kong (HKU) researchers on Tuesday said stress levels of employees in the service industry must be dealt with for the SAR to further promote the hospitality sector.
 <br>
  <br>
  HKU's business school, together with the Hong Kong Association for Customer Service Excellence (HKACE), conducted three rounds of studies during and after Covid, involving about 1,000 employees in the service industry.
  <br>
  <br>
  They said they found that employees are now more stressed out, with almost 45 percent reporting they frequently experienced burnout in the post-pandemic period, up from 15 percent during the Covid crisis.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bennett Yim, a marketing professor with the school, described the survey findings as "shocking", adding that people had had high hopes for society to rebound after Covid.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Businesses have not improved substantially. A lot of the organisations and companies on one hand want to rebuild their business, and at the same time, customers also have high expectations in the post-Covid period," Yim said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When the two things come together, they're putting a lot of pressure on employees who are providing services to customers."
  <br>
  <br>
  Yim said the stress issues of employees, especially frontline workers, must be addressed for the city to further promote the hospitality sector.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We see more tourists returning to Hong Kong. At the same time, we see a manpower shortage, particularly in the service industry. Because of that, it adds more stress to the employees which certainly affects the service provided to tourists," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  HKACE honorary advisor Buston Chu said employers should provide workers with flexible arrangements, and also enhance their engagement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Get your employees involved. Let them know their purpose and that they are a very important stakeholder to make Hong Kong a place of hospitality. I think this is something the management have to do," Chu said.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Senior Citizen Home Safety Association on Tuesday said it has been proactively informing and advising elderly people about an impending cold spell, and has bolstered manpower to support those requiring assistance.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on an RTHK programme, the group's head, Maura Wong, said there has not been a notable uptick in requests for assistance from the elderly lately, adding that a surge in help requests typically occurs approximately three days after a sharp temperature decline.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong urged senior citizens to prioritise their well-being, cautioning that a significant temperature decrease could greatly affect their health.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Generally, when the temperature drops, we notice several things. The elderly may complain of intensified pain, their blood circulation may not be that good, or they don't exercise or they find they lose their balance and fall, or suffer from dizziness," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In more serious cases, they may experience problems with their trachea."
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Cheng Yuen-chung, an assistant director at the observatory, said on the same programme that temperatures could dip as low as 16 degrees on Wednesday and 15 degrees on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said temperatures in southern China are still within the normal range despite the impact of global warming.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our preliminary forecast is that the number of cold days this winter will be close to normal. What is considered normal? Generally speaking, the normal range of cold weather days in Hong Kong is 9 to 17 days. Last year, there were 14 cold days, which is within the normal range," he said.

 The innovation and technology chief on Tuesday expressed confidence in the use of artificial intelligence and robotics, saying these are “immensely promising”.
 <br>
  <br>
  Sun Dong, the secretary for innovation, technology and industry, also told a summit on AI and robotics that such technologies not only enhance productivity and service quality, but also offer greater convenience and better quality of life.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Coupled with the vast market size and population in the Greater Bay Area, the benefits of AI and robotics applications, alongside the associated business opportunities, are immensely promising and substantial,” Sun said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also said the SAR offers a “perfect setting” for the technologies to flourish, and that the city is moving towards becoming an international IT centre.
  <br>
  <br>
  The event, organised by the Hong Kong Productivity Council, explores the trends and applications of AI and robotics.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The director of the central government's liaison office on Monday urged Hong Kong and Guangdong to work together to bring positive developments for the Greater Bay Area (GBA).
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at the Guangdong-Hong Kong Deepening Economic, Trade and Investment Cooperation Conference in Guangzhou, Zheng Yanxiong said Hong Kong's economy and society have seen improvements with the help of the central government.
  <br>
  <br>
  He hopes the SAR and Guangdong could lead the GBA on the development of innovation and technology.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I hope Guangdong and Hong Kong can make good use of the advantages of the innovation and industrial chains of the GBA, focusing on emerging fields like artificial intelligence, life sciences, low-altitude economy and green development," Zheng said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The two places should accelerate the cultivation and creation of new industries, and develop new quality productive forces."
  <br>
  <br>
  Guangdong party secretary Huang Kunming said the GBA has unlimited prospects, with the size of the economy reaching over 10 trillion yuan last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I hope everyone can improve together with Guangdong, making use of different advantages, with Hong Kong serving as a super-connector and a super value-adder, and helping Guangdong and Hong Kong go global together," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chief Executive John Lee, who is leading a delegation of government officials and business leaders on a visit to the GBA, also attended the conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said Hong Kong and Guangdong reached agreement on 126 economic and trade cooperation projects totalling more than 100 billion yuan at the meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  Of these projects, 101 involve Hong Kong businesses investing in Guangdong, with a total value exceeding 91 billion yuan.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They cover areas like financial cooperation, modern logistics, smart productions, biomedicine and artificial intelligence, demonstrating the love for the country and family as well as practical actions by Hong Kong entrepreneurs in actively serving the development of Guangdong and the mainland," Lee said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The delegation arrived in Foshan on Monday night on the next leg of their visit. Lee will return to Hong Kong on Tuesday, with Chief Secretary Eric Chan continuing to lead the delegation that will also visit Dongguan, Huizhou and Shenzhen.

    Drones to be used to probe construction site safety

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Labour officials on Monday said they plan to start using drones in around a year's time to check safety issues at construction sites.
 <br>
  <br>
  In the first half of this year, there were 11 fatal industrial accidents, two more than during the same period last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials said they will use drones for taking photos from the air and will then use the pictures to generate 3D models to help with law enforcement and evidence collection.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With the advantage of being able to fly, [the drones] can collect evidence and take photos for us," an assistant labour commissioner, Wan Chi-ping, told lawmakers at a manpower panel meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're now working along this line to see how we can help our staff in patrolling and inspecting various sites in Hong Kong."
  <br>
  <br>
  Wan said officials are now buying the drones needed, and some 20 members of staff are being trained to control them.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials also said they will look at eliminating risky work tasks or lowering workers' exposure to such activities by helping the sector use technology to improve occupational safety and health.

 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Monday said Hong Kong will continue to play an important role in helping companies in the Greater Bay Area (GBA) go global.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Greater Bay Area Listed Companies Summit, Chan described the GBA as a developed economy, and said companies in the area are vital for the country's opening-up.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the SAR, as an international financial centre, can help create more opportunities and add value for GBA companies.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Under the geopolitical haze, mainland companies are facing unprecedented challenges when they raise funds in the Western markets. Hong Kong will reform the financial market in response to the situation to gather more domestic and overseas funds to support projects and companies in the GBA," Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As long as they are beneficial to companies, the development of Hong Kong's financial market, and the development of the country, we will actively study and push forward the policies."
  <br>
  <br>
  Qi Bin, deputy director of Beijing's liaison office, said there are 5,000 listed companies in the GBA, and they help promote cooperation in areas like finance, economics and trade.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I hope listed companies in the GBA could actively make use of Hong Kong's advantages, and treat the city as a base for overseas expansion. While consolidating the American and Western markets, we should work together and expand into emerging markets like the Asean, Middle East and Latin America," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong's member of the National People's Congress Standing Committee, Starry Lee, meanwhile thanked the country for supporting the city's development as an international financial centre, international aviation hub and offshore renminbi hub.

<img alt="A Hospital Authority director says senior management under the accountability framework include hospital chief executives and department heads. File photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1780696_1_20241125120700.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A Hospital Authority director on Monday said holding senior managers to account for any medical blunders at public hospitals won't mean that lower-ranked staff involved will be off the hook.
 <br>
  <br>
  Bosses have pledged to improve governance and spell out the responsibility of staff of all ranks, after a special committee submitted 31 recommendations following a three-month review.
  <br>
  <br>
  As part of the reform, the authority said it will develop a framework to strengthen the accountability of senior staff.
  <br>
  <br>
  Michael Wong, the authority's director of quality and safety, said a reform committee will look at a reward and penalty system.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Senior management under the accountability framework include hospital chief executives and department heads. Although they're the ones who'll mainly be held responsible, it doesn't mean that no other colleagues should take responsibility," Wong told an RTHK programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Those overseeing hospital wards have their corresponding responsibilities, which will be evaluated during the employees' annual appraisals."
  <br>
  <br>
  The authority's chairman, Henry Fan, previously said authorities might freeze the pay of senior managers for blunders, but firing employees might not be an option due to a manpower crunch faced by the public healthcare sector.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alex Lam, from Hong Kong Patients' Voices, said Fan's comment gives a bad impression.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If there's no dismissal mechanism when an employee makes a grave mistake, it seems to be like a 'get-out-of-jail free card', which says the employee can keep their job regardless of their mistake, and at worst, may only have their salary frozen," Lam said.

 Hong Kong Sports Institute cycling head coach Hervé Dagorne on Monday hailed as a success Sunday's cross-border road race, an event that was largely seen as the first major test ahead of the 15th National Games to be held next year.
 <br>
  <br>
  Dagorne said the organisation of the race, which featured dozens of cyclists traversing a 230-kilometre route that included a crossing of the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge, was behind the positive result.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I was very impressed with how smooth it all turned out," Dagorne said. "This was the first time we could hold such a race passing through a bridge.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's one of the longest bridges in the world, so for us, we were able to gain more knowledge on how we can manage the actual race come next year. We were all very excited, and interested to see what we can achieve in the National Games."
  <br>
  <br>
  Dagorne also highlighted the obstacles that came with organising the large scale sporting event, and noted what needs to be done ahead of the Games.

  "The matter of immigration is an important aspect when it comes to organisation [of the race]." he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We must also determine how wind and slope can affect athletes – as such factors can be difficult to predict while passing a bridge compared to when on a car or bus."
  <br>
  <br>
  The race is set to be the first national sports event that connects Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macau.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The head of the National Games Coordination Office on Monday said the overall time taken for a cross-border cycling race on Sunday was shorter than expected.
 <br>
  <br>
  The event was held as a test race for the National Games that will be staged in the Greater Bay Area next year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeung Tak-keung told an RTHK radio programme that the race went very smoothly, and cyclists completed the event safely.
  <br>
  <br>
  There were also no special incidents.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The cyclists rode slightly faster than we thought. At first, we expected them to take around an hour and 30 minutes to complete the Hong Kong section of the race. But it turned out they completed the leg in an hour and 22 minutes," Yeung said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That meant that for the whole event, whether heading to Hong Kong Disneyland after passing the bridge as well as heading back to the mainland, it was faster than we anticipated."
  <br>
  <br>
  He said cyclists and their supporting crews told the office after the event that the race distance of 230km posed a challenge for them, and they also struggled with strong winds on the bridge, as well as light rain in Zhuhai and Macau.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Yeung said the cyclists managed to go faster once they had adapted to the environment.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also said the race route is suitable for the National Games, but did not rule out the possibility of making adjustments.

    HA looking to use AI to identify high-risk patients

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Public hospitals hope that artificial intelligence will help them identify and treat high risk patients at an earlier stage.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Hospital Authority's head of information technology and health informatics, Dr Cheung Ngai-tseung, said the authority was looking to incorporate AI into the existing clinical management system, which contains more than 10 million patients' records, to create automated tools to tailor individual treatments.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hospital services have been digitalised, including having paperless patient records that allow for real-time information updates on the authority's HA Go app, which enhances patients' self-care abilities.
  <br>
  <br>
  AI could be used to remind patients of specific prescriptions and laboratory results in the form of a blue elf on the screen.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dr Cheung spoke about future plans to further develop the system.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So the general capabilities as described is perhaps things like, more use of AI, more use of personalisation, more communication techniques, that sort of thing. Plus specific targeted interventions that will be maybe disease-specific or specific workflows that exist in today's hospitals," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dr Cheung added that more work was needed on specific cases and they were working on a fifth generation of the system.

    OSC funding helps promote inclusiveness in hiking

<div class="itemFullText">
 A charity advocating for the conservation of the city's countryside through connecting the public with nature is one of the beneficiaries of this year's Operation Santa Claus (OSC).
 <br>
  <br>
  Accessible Trails - a programme dedicated to promoting the benefits of nature to all walks of life - was started in 2017 by Parks and Trails Limited. The charity was founded in 2014 as a mobile application TrailWatch, which gives hikers a platform to track their hikes and report incidents of damage to trails.
  <br>
  <br>
  Its head of communications, Kwong Sum-yin, said the project also helped wheelchair users enjoy greater access to the countryside.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In Hong Kong, the countryside is actually very convenient. But for some groups of people, it is not as accessible as we think, especially those with disabilities," Kwong said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The project comprises two parts; first it identifies suitable hiking trails for wheelchair users and then it brings participants, their family members and volunteers to the field.
  <br>
  <br>
  17 hiking trails have been verified, and more than 180 wheelchair users and their carers have benefited from the programme since it started.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Some of the participants tell us that they've never been to the countryside of Hong Kong, or even the New Territories, because it is very inconvenient for them. [Through the programme], they say they can actually enjoy the environment. They feel peaceful and are very happy about that," Kwong said.
  <br>
  <br>
  But she said limited resources had prevented the programme from organising larger-scale activities.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hiking season in Hong Kong depends on the weather, so it may not be that long. For example, there was one particular trip - we wanted to see the Autumn village - and we have a time concern there as well. Given the limited resources, we cannot organise enough [activities]," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Sometimes, wheelchair users tell us it is very difficult to get into the programme, so they can't really go. We really want to expand this programme and have more resources to let more people to enjoy [the nature]," Kwong added.
  <br>
  <br>
  She also said the funding would be used not only to recruit more wheelchair users, but also volunteers to understand the difficulties of those with disabilities and contribute to create an inclusive experience.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jointly organised by RTHK and South China Morning Post, OSC funds charitable projects that focus on children and youth, the elderly, the community, those with physical and mental disabilities, medical projects, and those concerning the environment.

    Carbon monoxide poisoning leads to government warnings

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) on Sunday said people should only use gas water heaters in well-ventilated areas. It made the comment after a 56-year-old man, and two of his family members, were hospitalised on Saturday with carbon monoxide poisoning after he took a shower.
 <br>
  <br>
  All three were sent to Yan Chai Hospital. The man was later transferred to Pamela Youde Nethersole Eastern Hospital. His two family members, including a 13-year-old, were discharged.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Electrical and Mechanical Services Department (EMSD) also reminded people to only use gas water heaters which have a 'GU' mark, meaning they have been approved by the department.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, the government said all windows in the apartment were shut and the exhaust fan had not been turned on. An on-site inspection conducted by the EMSD showed that the flueless gas water heater at the home was not suitable to be used in bathrooms. The heater model also lacked approval from the department.
  <br>
  <br>
  The EMSD has seized the gas water heater. It will investigate whether any person has contravened the Gas Safety Ordinance.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CHP said that carbon monoxide is a colourless, odourless and tasteless gas which is a by-product from incomplete combustion of any fuel which contains carbon, such as wood, natural gas and gasoline.
  <br>
  <br>
  Exposure to a low concentration of carbon monoxide can lead to a range of symptoms such as dizziness, headache, tiredness and nausea. Exposure to a high concentration of carbon monoxide can lead to impaired vision, disturbed co-ordination, unconsciousness, brain damage or even death.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 American golfer Patrick Reed has won the Hong Kong Open in style, shooting a 22-under overall to clinch the title on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The overnight leader entered the final day with a three-shot lead, after notching a 59, an 18-hole record at the historic Fanling course.
  <br>
  <br>
  The PGA Tour professional ended up edging defending champion, Ben Campbell from New Zealand by the same margin.
  <br>
  <br>
  This was Reed's fifth time playing in Hong Kong, and he told reporters that he was glad to have finally triumphed.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's awesome playing this golf course, to come out and learn from the mistakes from the past on this place, and to go out and really feel like I was in command and control around a golf course," he told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I was able to hit quality golf shots after quality golf shots, which has always been a tough thing around here for me in the past."
  <br>
  <br>
  Local sensation Taichi Kho finished six shots behind Reed, good for a tied-sixth overall.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said he didn't have the best of starts on the final day, but he felt he bounced back well and there were still plenty of positive takeaways.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think I was just really focused out there and I was able to let myself play golf. You know, towards the start of it, I wasn't too comfortable to swing, so I was aiming away, aiming at the middle of the greens," the Hong Kong, China golfer said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But once I felt like I'd gone in the groove of it, I was able to aim at flags a bit more and get a bit more aggressive."
  <br>
  <br>
  Thousands of spectators were on hand for the tournament at the Fanling Golf Course, with many families bringing their children for a nice day out.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among them was Queenie, a mother of two who managed to share a photo moment with Kho.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I’m so excited, I got an autograph, a photograph with him. He’s so nice, very friendly,” she told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tournament was also a test event for next year’s National Games, when golf will be one of eight sports Hong Kong will be hosting while other events take place in Macau and Guangdong.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong Golf Club captain Andy Kwok said both local and mainland officials have been at the site in the past few days to gauge the operation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They assess various aspects of the tournament. My feeling is I think they are quite happy with what the club and the organisers have put forward in this tournament," Kwok told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hopefully we can carry this momentum forward to the National Games next year and put together a very good show for both Hong Kong and spectators from afar."

    'Volunteering scheme aims to motivate CSSA recipients'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Labour and Welfare Chris Sun on Sunday said plans to mandate certain government subsidy recipients to do voluntary work is a way of helping them integrate into society.
 <br>
  <br>
  Sun was referring to a new Social Welfare Department pilot scheme, which will make it compulsory for unemployed Comprehensive Social Security Assistance (CSSA) recipients aged 15 to 59 to take up at least one hour of unpaid work each week.
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted 16,000 CSSA recipients are healthy adults capable of working, and hoped that the scheme can motivate them to start looking for a job.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We don't want CSSA recipients to feel like they are out of touch... We think the most viable way is to ask them to do volunteering work. This is achievable and there's a great social need for this kind of work," Sun told reporters after attending a charity event.
  <br>
  <br>
  On a separate note, the labour chief also expressed great concern regarding two fatal industrial accidents on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  One case involved an 18-year-old apprentice, who fell into an escalator shaft in Central.
  <br>
  <br>
  The other fatality was a 57-year-old painter, who died after being trapped on a spider lift platform while working at a Tung Chung public housing construction site.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Labour Department has issued suspension notices to the contractors involved, and is investigating the accidents.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The probe will focus on whether the two sites complied with the necessary work procedures. Everyone knows there are clear guidelines for both escalator maintenance and the use of lift platforms," Sun commented.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also stressed the need to step up promotion and education efforts.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We hope that whenever an accident occurs, other workers in the trade can raise their safety awareness and sense of responsibility... The government, employers, employees and relevant stakeholders should all work towards this goal."

<img alt="HKFYG's Employment and Economy Group convenor Tony Lau (centre) says young people still treat Hong Kong as their home and want to develop their careers here. Photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1780628_1_20241124172139.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Five in six young adults in Hong Kong believe the city needs to undergo economic transformation, but only two in 10 of them have considered a career pivot, according to a think tank.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong Federation of Youth Groups urged the government to do more to help fresh graduates and early career professionals plan ahead, as well as boost their confidence towards the city’s future.
  <br>
  <br>
  The group conducted face-to-face interviews of 600 people aged 18 to 34 between September and October.
  <br>
  <br>
  Less than 40 per cent of respondents agreed that Hong Kong has a positive economic outlook.
  <br>
  <br>
  Around 60 percent of them expressed concerns about various issues, including a potential pay cut and a perceived lack of skills to stay competitive.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite the pessimism, the vast majority still planned on developing their careers in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Young people still treat Hong Kong as their home. They are willing to contribute to the economy," said Tony Lau, convenor of the federation's employment and economy group.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is important for the Hong Kong government to cultivate local talent, and they should roll out their utmost measures to retain them and provide training," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Researchers also explained that the majority of respondents had not considered a career transition because of a “lack of clarity” in their direction.
  <br>
  <br>
  Many said they were unsure which industry they could switch to, while others admitted they lacked the skills and knowledge to make a move, or were simply not interested in the openings on the market.
  <br>
  <br>
  The federation suggested young people learn more about the development plans in the Greater Bay Area or Belt and Road countries, and explore opportunities in new markets.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another way to start, researchers said, is to study manpower projection reports, which predict a labour shortage in aviation and innovative technology industries.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Sunday said they arrested 11 people, including a student, after officers said they busted a local fraud syndicate allegedly behind three online shopping scams involving HK$640,000.
 <br>
  <br>
  Detectives said the scammers, aged 20 to 50, reached out to sellers of luxury spirits and watches.
  <br>
  <br>
  The fraudsters would then ask to meet at an office under a short-term lease. To gain the sellers' trust, the suspects posing as buyers even meticulously inspected the products and spoke industry jargon.
  <br>
  <br>
  The transactions were then settled in cash, or "practice banknotes". The tools are used by bank staff to learn how to manually count currency, and usually bear the words "not for circulation".
  <br>
  <br>
  "The meeting room was carefully set up, and the counterfeit banknotes closely resembled genuine HK$500 notes in size, shape, colour, and texture," said Chau Ho-haung, an inspector with the Wan Chai district crime squad.
  <br>
  <br>
  The scammers even placed real banknotes at the top and bottom of the stack of fake notes, he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  When the sellers eventually realised they had been duped, the suspects had already made off with the goods.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police offered some tips for people conducting face-to-face trades.
  <br>
  <br>
  The money and the goods should change hands simultaneously, detectives said, and sellers should never hand over items before receiving payment.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the case of bank transfers, the seller must also verify the payment has been cleared.

 Two women, aged 38 and 44, have been charged with one count of trafficking in dangerous drugs.
 <br>
  <br>
  Customs arrested them on Saturday, after officers found about 10 kilos of suspected cannabis buds inside their check-in suitcases.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two women had arrived in Hong Kong on a flight from Bangkok.
  <br>
  <br>
  Customs estimate the suspected drugs have a street value of about HK$2.3 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  The case will be brought up at the West Kowloon Magistrates' Courts on Monday.

    Smooth riding for cyclists in cross-border test race

<img alt="Some travellers were left frustrated by the closure of Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge. Photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1780609_2_20241124141606.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A cross-border road cycling race which doubled as a test event for the National Games held in the Greater Bay Area next year went ahead smoothly on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  A total of 67 cyclists set off from Zhuhai at 9am for the men's individual 230-kilometres event.
  <br>
  <br>
  The peloton arrived in Hong Kong about 90 minutes later via the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge. The cyclists continued east along the North Lantau Highway, and headed back to the mainland after passing Hong Kong Disneyland in Sunny Bay.
  <br>
  <br>
  The race offered authorities a chance to gauge disruption to traffic. Lanes in both directions on the cross-border bridge were closed in staggered intervals to allow the cyclists to pass through.
  <br>
  <br>
  Traffic fully resumed shortly after 12:30pm.
  <br>
  <br>
  But some Hong Kong travellers arriving the border checkpoint were unaware of the temporary arrangements.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I didn't know the roads were closed today. If I'd known, I wouldn't have come. I plan to go home, and return this afternoon," Mr Fong said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Maybe I wasn't paying attention, but there wasn't much information available. I'm really frustrated because I have no idea how to get to Zhuhai," another man bemoaned.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think they should definitely issue more information or reminders on the MTR. There should be announcements at every station. If I'd known in advance, I could have made alternative plans," said another traveller.
  <br>
  <br>
  The unique nature of the race drew a lot of interest from locals.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I saw the news yesterday, so I wanted to come here and take pictures. I used to take part in road cycling races ... I hope Zhuhai will continue to develop this sport and hold similar events every year,” a Zhuhai resident said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another man said he came all the way from Zhongshan to support his former teammates who participated in the race.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I arrived in Zhuhai two days ago because my former teammates also arrived early to acclimatise to the environment. I came here to cycle with them. It really brought back memories of us training together," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sports minister Kevin Yeung said his colleagues would review the arrangements with their mainland and Macau counterparts, and seek further improvements.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said as a result of the road closures, travellers to and from the airport spent 20 to 25 minutes longer on average this morning.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That was already less than what we forecast at the beginning. So I think overall, the test event has been carried out very smoothly,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeung noted three cyclists had to abandon the Hong Kong section of the race, although there were no accidents.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Yeung Tak-keung, the head of the National Games Coordination Office, revealed the General Administration of Sport of China has not decided how many cyclists can sign up for the actual race next year.

    Govt-market integration key for Hetao: Sun Dong

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Secretary for Innovation, Technology and Industry on Sunday said government backing and an efficient market are both necessary, if plans to expand a Shenzhen-Hong Kong tech zone were to succeed.
 <br>
  <br>
  Sun Dong's comments came days after officials unveiled the development outline for the SAR section of the Hetao Shenzhen-Hong Kong Science and Technology Innovation Cooperation Zone.
  <br>
  <br>
  The first phase of the development now covers twice the gross floor area compared to the original scheme.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a radio programme, Sun said he explained to his friends in Shanghai what Hetao is really about.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I told them today's Northern Metropolis is like Shanghai's Pudong district in the old days, and that Hetao is equivalent to Pudong's Oriental Pearl," he recalled.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They immediately understood that this is extremely important for Hong Kong's future development."
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister added mainland officials faced similar challenges when they developed Pudong in the 1990s. But they made it happen, even with a limited budget, he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked about US president-elect Donald Trump's tech restrictions on China and how it might affect Hong Kong, Sun said the city should work more closely with the mainland and strengthen its own technology infrastructure to cope with the complex global environment.
  <br>
  <br>
  The innovation chief also called on local tech companies to procure supplies and equipment from different sources, instead of relying too much on a single market.

    Kai Tak Sports Park 'ready for more events'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The police on Saturday evening said a test event at Kai Tak had gone smoothly, and the results were satisfactory. They added that they think the venue they used is ready to host more events.
 <br>
  <br>
  The third stress test at the Kai Tak Youth Sports Ground was designed to test communication and trust levels between various departments through scenario-based exercises.
  <br>
  <br>
  The test involved 4,500 civil servants and 500 members of the public.
  <br>
  <br>
  Unlike previous trials, designated seating was adopted this time.
  <br>
  <br>
  The test kicked off at 3.30pm and was expected to run until 8.45pm.
  <br>
  <br>
  One participant surnamed Cheung headed to the sports ground from Sung Wong Toi station.
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted that there are some canopies along the way, but said that it would be better if there were more.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cheung also told RTHK that he appreciated the signage from the MTR station to the venue, adding that the walk took less than 10 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There are a lot of signs and staff. Everything is very clear. We definitely didn't take an unnecessarily long route."
  <br>
  <br>
  But a man surnamed Au said his journey from the Sung Wong Toi area had many zig zag routes, which may take time for the public to familiarise with.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police chief Raymond Siu revealed that officers from the tactical unit were deployed to the stress test.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lawmakers can start moving into new offices on Saturday, with the renovation works for the first phase of the expansion project at the Legislative Council Complex completed ahead of schedule.
 <br>
  <br>
  Writing on his social media, the council's president, Andrew Leung, said that the early move is a testament to the unity and cooperation of all members and staff involved in the project, adding that lawmakers can finally "get to the next level under one roof".
  <br>
  <br>
  The renovation included the addition of four storeys to accommodate offices for the 20 extra lawmakers who joined Legco as part of electoral reforms in 2021, taking the total from 70 to 90 members.
  <br>
  <br>
  Leung said that the relocation will allow all members currently using the nearby CITIC Tower as a temporary office to return to the complex, while also moving members already in the building to higher levels.
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted that some finishing touches are still needed, such as waterproofing the exterior walls, clean up, and interior design, adding that the Secretariat, together with the Architectural Services Department and contractor, would follow up with the matter. He encouraged lawmakers to share their suggestions for improvements.
  <br>
  <br>
  Looking ahead, Leung said that the second phase of the expansion project would start as soon as possible, including the construction of a new conference room and public education facilities.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said he hopes that all expansion projects will be completed before October of next year.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hongkongers were out bright and early on Saturday to celebrate the twin panda cubs' 100 days at Ocean Park.
 <br>
  <br>
  Many donned panda headbands and costumes, while others carried panda toys as they waited to glimpse a broadcast of the cubs on giant LED screens.
  <br>
  <br>
  The older club, weighing 5.3 kilogrammes, was seen lying peacefully in bed, while her little brother, weighing 5.5 kilogrammes, was more lively, patting his sister from time to time.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I am very happy because Ying Ying and Le Le have been in Hong Kong for a while now and they finally have children, so its a joyous occasion," said a woman surnamed Shum.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another woman surnamed Law, who carried a large stuffed panda, said she's been looking forward to today.
  <br>
  <br>
  "My daughters and I love pandas because they're so pure and well-behaved. That's why I take this stuffed panda with me everywhere I go. I even bring it to dim sum. I love taking photos of pandas," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  People were also excited by the reopening of the Giant Panda Adventure facility after two months, which houses the cubs' father, Le Le.
  <br>
  <br>
  Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism Kevin Yeung said a lot of publicity has been done in the SAR to promote the pandas.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The new pandas will be Hong Kong's new tourism ambassadors...in hopes that they will attract more tourists to come," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Visitors also received red eggs and pork knuckle ginger stew with vinegar at the event - dishes served to celebrate the birth of a baby.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ocean Park also said that people can look forward to meeting the two new giant pandas gifted by the Central Government next month.

    Police plan to use test strips to detect 'space oil'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police commissioner Raymond Siu revealed on Saturday that the force made over 90 arrests for offenses related to "space oil" in the first 10 months of this year.
 <br>
  <br>
  Space oil is an emerging drug that is usually inhaled through vapes. It often contains etomidate - a part 1 poison that has to be prescribed by a doctor.
  <br>
  <br>
  Siu told reporters after a passing-out parade that the force is looking to use test strips for detection.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the future, when patrolling officers find someone who's suspicious, let's say the person is suspected of taking space oil, we could immediately use test strips to check. We hope that this could have a deterrent effect," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The police chief pointed out that in an operation carried out in Kwai Tsing district related to space oil, all but four of the 17 arrestees were students.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that the police will step up education by inviting people who used to take the drug, as well as medical workers, to share the hazards of space oil.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government is aiming to list space oil as a dangerous drug next year.

    'Two years suitable to comply with new sports rules'

<div class="itemFullText">
 Sports sector lawmaker Kenneth Fok said that a two-year time frame is suitable for sports bodies to comply with new standards, adding that the National Sports Associations responded positively to the review report and governance code.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Sports Federation & Olympic Committee (SF&OC) of Hong Kong, China had earlier reviewed the operations and governance of 77 member associations across six key areas - board governance, integrity management, selection of athletes, management of coaches and umpires, administration of membership, and general administration - totalling 243 governance items.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on an RTHK programme on Saturday, Fok, who is also vice-president of SF&OC, noted that nearly 60 percent of these items have been fully or partially implemented.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said that when it comes to selecting athletes, the criteria must be fair, just and open.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think past performance or potential should account for the vast majority of the selection process for all athletes. The responsibility of the National Sports Associations is to write down clear requirements. For each competition, what goals do I hope to achieve and what athletes do I hope to select? Performance may account for 60 percent, and there may be other indicators that account for the rest of the percentage," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The most important principle is that the athlete's performance cannot be buried and cannot be prevented by other factors or institutional factors from being able to perform to the best of their abilities."
  <br>
  <br>
  Fok also said that the code of governance recommends that sports bodies implement a maximum tenure and length of term of office an individual may serve on the Board of Directors, adding that the age should not exceed 70 or 75 years old.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Each sports association faces different situations. Their initial establishment or stage of development and the level of talent participation in their industry or sports field are different. If there's a hard-and-fast age set, it may not necessarily be the best for the development of the sport so it's important to leave room for flexibility," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SF&OC initiated a review of its governance and operations following a 2020 audit report.
  <br>
  <br>
  The body had said that member associations failing to meet the new governance and operational standards in the two-year time frame may face penalties, including reductions in subsidies.

    'Senior staff held more accountable increases morale'

<div class="itemFullText">
 The head of the Hospital Authority emphasised that its plan to hold senior staff more accountable when medical blunders occur will not demoralise workers.
 <br>
  <br>
  The HA announced earlier that it will set up a high-level reform committee to review the responsibility of staff of all ranks.
  <br>
  <br>
  It comes after a review committee, which was set up months ago after a series of incidents, found that the duties of staff are not clearly defined.
  <br>
  <br>
  HA chairman Henry Fan told reporters on Saturday after a Commercial Radio programme that he believes the move will not dispirit senior staff.
  <br>
  <br>
  "What we're trying to do is to actually build up a more proper governance system and management structure, which will in fact assist our colleagues in performing better for the well-being of our patients, which is what the HA is about. We want to provide the best service and have the confidence of the people of Hong Kong. So, I don't think it will be demoralising," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "On the contrary, we would do it properly in a sense that we will have consultation before we reach any decision. I think it will, in fact, increase morale."
  <br>
  <br>
  Under the reform, the HA officially plans to roll out a reward-and-penalty system.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fan has more ideas that he believes could be beneficial, such as giving staff a warning letter for a minor medical blunder. If they are involved in two or more incidents, then they would not get a pay rise for a year - but he stressed that these are just his personal views and have not been discussed by the committee yet.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think this is one way to hold colleagues accountable. Because we cannot say any time you make a mistake, you're suspended. Nor can we say every time you make a mistake, you only get a letter or a warning."
  <br>
  <br>
  Fan added that the HA is also considering setting up channels for staff to voice their opinions confidentially.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Holding senior managers at public hospitals accountable for blunders means they have the responsibility to try to prevent them from happening, medical sector lawmaker David Lam said on Friday, after the Hospital Authority vowed to improve its governance and accountability.
 <br>
  <br>
  A review committee put forward more than 30 recommendations to the Hospital Authority, including enhancing top-level oversight for quality and safety issues, as well as defining the roles, responsibilities and authority at various levels.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lam, a member of the review committee, said strengthening accountability at a higher level meant it won't just be frontline staff taking the blame whenever a medical incident happens.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That puts a responsibility on the senior management that they have to maintain a low complication rate or a low incident rate in their department. And a way to do so is to make sure the staff are adequately trained and adequately staffed," Lam told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  The lawmaker added it's important to build up a "good portal of communication" among all levels of hospital staff, with the review noting junior employees not always willing to speak up even when they spotted problems.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The senior staff should start the ball rolling, and encourage the frontline staff or the junior staff to talk to them whenever necessary," he said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Two men died in separate industrial accidents in Central and Tung Chung on Friday, sparking fresh calls to protect workers' safety.
 <br>
  <br>
  In one of the cases, an 18-year-old apprentice fell into an escalator shaft during repairs at the Euro Trade Centre on Des Voeux Road Central.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was rescued by firefighters and rushed to Ruttonjee Hospital, where he was later pronounced dead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another fatal work accident occurred at a public housing construction site in Tung Chung, where a 57-year-old painter was believed to be trapped on a spider lift platform.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was declared dead at North Lantau Hospital.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Labour Department said it's investigating both tragedies.
  <br>
  <br>
  A workers' rights representative said the occurrence of more industrial accidents serves as a warning.
  <br>
  <br>
  Siu Sin-man from the Association for the Rights of Industrial Accident Victims said both government and industry need to do more to prevent future incidents.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are heartbroken to hear that workers have passed away. It has only been a little over a week since three workers died from work accidents in five days. This is a huge wake-up call," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "People from the industry and government departments need to help think of ways to solve this problem.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If it is an equipment problem, please improve it immediately. If it involves insufficient training, please strengthen mandatory training as soon as possible."

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lawmakers have approved HK$33.5 billion in funding to help with the abolition of the Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF) offsetting mechanism.
 <br>
  <br>
  The mechanism will be scrapped from May 1 next year, and a 25-year subsidy scheme will provide for employers as they adapt to the policy change by sharing the costs associated with severance and long service payments during the transition period.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lawmakers endorsed the funding request at a Legco Finance Committee meeting on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Secretary for Labour and Welfare Chris Sun said the government plans to engage a processing agent to assist in the implementation of the subsidy scheme, by facilitating, vetting and approving applications.
  <br>
  <br>
  Federation of Trade Unions (FTU) lawmaker Bill Tang, for his part, said he's concerned that some people may not understand the arrangements well.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There may be some cases in future because we know that maybe some employers or even some employees do not understand the arrangement of the cancelling offsetting mechanism... We can foresee some disputes between employees and employers, so the FTU is very concerned about it," Tang said.

    Improving governance and accountability a priority: HA

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's hospital bosses have vowed to clarify the responsibility of staff of all ranks and strengthen accountability of senior management when it comes to medical incidents, after a review committee found the roles of workers are not clearly established.
 <br>
  <br>
  Instructed by the administration following a string of medial blunders, the Hospital Authority (HA) set up a review committee a few months ago to look into the operations and management of public hospitals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among 31 recommendations put forward to the authority, the review committee suggested public hospitals enhance top-level oversight for quality and safety issues, as well as define the roles, responsibilities and authority at various levels.
  <br>
  <br>
  The HA said it would look into introducing a reward-and-penalty system when assessing staff.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think it's important to more clearly delineate the roles and responsibilities of each of the staff at different levels," said HA chief executive Tony Ko on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The committee also recommend that in terms of the performance assessment of individual staff, we have to put into elements of quality and safety. So we'll be more explicit in terms of the performance assessment of the individual staff to see how they can reflect in part of the performance and obviously subsequently will be related to the accountability issues."
  <br>
  <br>
  The review committee noted that junior hospital staff often have a strong sense of hierarchy, stopping them from speaking up even when they spotted problems before incidents eventually happened.
  <br>
  <br>
  Younger and less experienced staff members lacked enough training and were not too familiar with safety culture, it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  A high-level reform committee, to be led by HA chairman Henry Fan, will be formed. The permanent secretary for health and the under secretary will join the committee, to give timely policy directions and guidance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fan said the group will focus solely on improving governance and accountability, while other issues would be worked on as quickly as possible.
  <br>
  <br>
  "However, having said that, there are some issues, for example the recommendation that we should change the culture of HA, which would probably take some time," Fan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Culture, by definition, is deep-rooted, and we can't expect to change that overnight. So we will do our best. But what we want is to try to make changes as quickly as possible."
  <br>
  <br>
  Other recommendations include strengthening clinical mentorship and supervision, and encouraging staff to report incidents.

    Bus fare increase requests opposed by lawmakers

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Some lawmakers attending a Legco transport panel meeting on Friday voiced their opposition to fare increase applications made by franchised bus operators.
 <br>
  <br>
  Kowloon Motor Bus (KMB) and New Lantao Bus want to put fares up by 6.5 percent, while Citybus is seeking 9.5 percent increases.
  <br>
  <br>
  KMB told lawmakers it needs to charge more because the expansion of the MTR network is having an "irreversible" impact on its finances.
  <br>
  <br>
  The firm's finance director, Joseph Leung, said average daily passenger numbers are down nine percent compared to 2019.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is due to changes in economic cycle, ageing population, as well as a change in people's commuting patterns, and people are going out less during weekends and at night," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are also seeing an expansion of the railway system, including the Tuen Ma Line as well as the East Rail Line. We see a loss of 130,000 passengers every day. The further expansion of the railway system will hit the bus operators and these conditions are irreversible."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lawmaker Gary Zhang was among those criticising the fare increase applications. But he backed a Citybus plan to roll out a loyalty programme for customers.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said he hopes it will cover journeys between Tin Shui Wai and Hong Kong Island as bus fares are more expensive than the MTR.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For example for journeys from Tin Shui Wai North to Hong Kong Island, actually Citybus has the advantage. Because compared to the railway, Citybus routes are faster and more convenient," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But the problem is that these routes are too expensive even when passengers interchange to trains. Therefore, if there are such loyalty programmes, I believe it will encourage commuters to choose to take buses."

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Super Sixes, a lacrosse tournament, will be held in Hong Kong for the second time in December, with local players seeing it as an opportunity to train themselves up for the 2028 Olympics.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Super Sixes will be held from December 13 to 15 at the Wong Chuk Hang Recreation Ground and the Aberdeen Sports Ground, featuring five men’s and five women’s teams, from countries including China, Japan, Germany and the Philippines.
  <br>
  <br>
  Raymond Fong, CEO of the Hong Kong, China Lacrosse Association, said the tournament will allow the SAR’s players to gain practical experience.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Hong Kong is very small. It's not like China, it's not like Japan. Without all these tournaments, all they can do is just play among their own players in Hong Kong,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “They are already top in Hong Kong, so they’re really not challenging themselves too much. This tournament would be basically bringing the overseas teams to challenge them.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The lacrosse sixes is a new and faster-paced version of the sport, and it will be added to the Los Angeles Olympics in 2028.
  <br>
  <br>
  The leader of the men’s team, Wing Cheung, said they will be using different strategies from last year, and he is confident they will perform better.
  <br>
  <br>
  “This year, we focus more on conditioning because last year it showed that the sixes format requires lots of running,” Cheung said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We have been playing box lacrosse in this summer, and it helps with our stick skills and overall skills, so I think this year may be a good year for us.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Lacrosse player Samuel Chow said the competition will be an opportunity for them to learn more about the other teams.

  “The sixes tournament will be a very important step for us to see how we’re going to perform in the international stage in this new format, and we’re going to see how we might be able to compete into the 2028 Olympics,” he said.

 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Friday said global investors have confidence in Hong Kong, dismissing reports of capital moving out of the city.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a forum on wealth management, Chan highlighted Hong Kong's status as a well-established international financial hub.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong's fundamentals as an international financial centre have remained as strong as ever. Recently, Hong Kong returned to the top three global financial centres, along with New York and London," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Yet from time to time, we come across reports about Hong Kong, such as those on the outflow of funds. A few important facts will illustrate that international investors remain highly confident in Hong Kong."
  <br>
  <br>
  The finance minister said Hong Kong's stock market has continued to grow, raising about HK$70 billion through initial public offerings (IPOs).
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan added that asset and wealth management companies have been expanding their businesses in Hong Kong, increasing office space rentals and relocating senior executives to the city.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hospital Authority (HA) is to set up a committee to reform its governance and structure after the government ordered a review of its management following a spate of medical blunders.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Health Bureau said on Friday that the committee, to be formed under the HA's board, will be chaired by the authority's chairman, Henry Fan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials had been vetting a review report submitted over "systemic management issues" at the authority.
  <br>
  <br>
  Health chief Lo Chung-mau said his bureau agreed with the directions set out in 31 recommendations for enhancing the HA's governance and structure to provide better and safer healthcare services.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Henry Fan, being the reform committee chairman, is to steer the implementation of recommendations made in the review report regarding governance, accountability and distribution of responsibilities, and relevant reform work," the bureau said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said the permanent secretary for health and the under secretary will join the committee, to give timely policy directions and guidance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lo added that the HA will have to submit regular progress reports to the government to ensure that enhancement measures are implemented in a timely and effective manner.

 Residents and tourists gathered at China Merchant Wharf  in Western on Friday to get a view of the People's Liberation Army Navy's assault ship the Hainan.
 <br>
  <br>
  The vessel, along with the Changsha destroyer which was docked at Stonecutters Island, arrived in the city on Thursday morning for a five-day visit.
  <br>
  <br>
  One of the spectators told RTHK he was stunned by the Hainan's size.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I’ve got time, and the ships are here, so I just came to see the country’s strengths. I think the country being strong can help balance the world,” Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  A tourist from Guangdong said she decided to visit the city after hearing news about the two vessels.
  <br>
  <br>
  “These ships are great. They don’t come here often, and this time it is staying for five days, so I came to Hong Kong just to see the ship. Just looking at the ship is enough,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  A series of activities will be held during the ships’ stay, including tours, cultural exchanges and talks on national defence.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chief Executive John Lee said earlier that people will be able to understand the nation’s achievements in defence and military modernisation if they join the activities.

    Cyberport ready for low-altitude flying tests: CEO

<img alt="Hendrick Sin, who chairs an AI subsidy scheme, says the Cyberport's supercomputing centre will make Hong Kong more AI-driven.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Cyberport CEO Rocky Cheng said on Thursday that the park was well-positioned for low-altitude flying trials with its ample space and a pier, adding that there were plans to set up a landing port for test flights.
 <br>
  <br>
  As a venue partner for sandbox pilot projects for developing low-altitude economy, Cyberport will provide suitable locations and supporting facilities for drones and other aerial technology.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to RTHK on the sidelines of the World Internet Conference in Wuzhen, Cheng said the park had what it takes for low-altitude flight tests.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Cyberport's geographical environment is very suitable for conducting low-altitude economy trials. The new Phase 5 building, set to open in the third quarter of next year, offers a stunning sea view. There is also a 150-metre-long pier adjacent to the ocean, and ample space within Cyberport,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cheng outlined plans to set up a landing port at the pier and organise exhibitions on drones to educate the public.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the AI supercomputing centre due to start operation at the end of this year, Cheng said it was progressing well with some computing power already available for use.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cheng said the centre hoped to start off by providing 1,300 petaflops of computing power, before bringing it up to 1,700 by next year.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The government wants to develop and promote AI to help various industries in Hong Kong surpass other advanced economies, so this computing power serves as crucial infrastructure. We should see gradual increases in computing capacity in the future. I believe it will quickly exceed 10,000 petaflops,” he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hendrick Sin, who chairs the committee on a HK$3 billion subsidy scheme to help AI researchers and companies make the best use of Cyberport's computing power, said the project marked the start of a new era.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I personally believe this is the opening of the AI era… So I think if more investment and more initiatives are provided by the government, I think that will give Hong Kong a further push to give more experts, professionals, to have more chance to exercise what they want to show to innovate and to benefit Hong Kong,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sin added that the scheme, which opened for application in October, will favour firms that have expertise in research and development, and present innovative ideas that benefit the SAR.

 The MTR Corporation said on Friday that normal services are resuming on the East Rail line after an equipment fault on a train near University Station caused delays.
 <br>
  <br>
  It said the train had been moved and services were returning to normal.
  <br>
  <br>
  The problem caused delays of up to fifteen minutes on the East Rail line between Admiralty and Lo Wu/Lok Ma Chau.
