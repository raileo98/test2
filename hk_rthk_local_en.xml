<div class="itemFullText">
 Snooker star Ronnie O'Sullivan, who recently obtained residency in Hong Kong, said he will try to ramp up his form ahead of a major tournament scheduled in Kai Tak in March next year.
 <br>
  <br>
  The seven-time world champion became an SAR resident in October through the Quality Migrant Admission Scheme. Fellow snooker star Judd Trump followed suit earlier this week.
  <br>
  <br>
  O'Sullivan explained what drove the decision during an exclusive interview with RTHK in Macau, where he's headlining an invitational tournament.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I always enjoyed playing in Hong Kong, with a fantastic venue and good promoters," O'Sullivan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Rocket", as he's often referred to, is also looking forward to the World Grand Prix at the Kai Tak Sports Park, the first snooker ranking event in the city in more than three decades.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I need to play some more tournaments to be ready, I think. My aim is to play more tournaments in the new year … I need to maybe make a bit more of an effort," he admitted.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 49-year-old Englishman said he'll consider "year by year" whether to wrap up his professional career.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he already revealed plans to set up a number of snooker clubs around the world, including in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Everybody loves snooker, and everyone loves to watch snooker. Snooker is the hardest out of all the cue sports. It's very popular here in Hong Kong," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think [Hong Kong] needs a good academy, good training centre for young players to come and learn and get good coaching, and help them develop their own game."
  <br>
  <br>
  He also confirmed plans to relocate to the city, and is now looking for an apartment in Hong Kong with a harbour view.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked about Trump's decision to follow his footsteps, O'Sullivan said it was "not out of surprise".
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think it makes sense since his [Trump's] girlfriend is from Hong Kong. He likes being here more than the UK, it makes complete sense for him," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked whether he will be open to promoting snooker along with Trump, O'Sullivan gave a more reserved answer.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I don't really align myself with other players. I like to be my own boss, do my own thing. I think it's better if we both do our own career, our own stuff away from snooker," O'Sullivan replied.

    Govt blasts criticism of measures against NSL suspects

<img alt="The government says those who have fled overseas should not think they can evade criminal liability by absconding from Hong Kong. File photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1784961_2_20241225204655.jpg&q=85">

<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Wednesday expressed strong dissatisfaction and opposition against slanderous remarks made by Western countries and the United States, following the SAR's decision to cancel the passports of seven national security suspects.
 <br>
  <br>
  Seven suspects wanted here, including former lawmakers Ted Hui and Dennis Kwok, have been stripped of their SAR passports, as announced by the authorities on Tuesday, and six more people living overseas were placed on the national security wanted list.
  <br>
  <br>
  A government spokesman said it was necessary to take measures to strike a "strong blow" to combat and deter the acts of abscondment, and procure their return to face law enforcement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Foreign government officials and politicians, as well as anti-China organisations, deliberately smeared and spread irresponsible remarks on the measures and actions taken by the SAR government in accordance with the law in an attempt to mislead the public," it wrote in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In fact, all specified measures including the cancellation of SAR passports and eligibility for application align with human rights requirements, and quite a number of countries including the United States, the United Kingdom and Canada would also impose such measures on wanted criminals."
  <br>
  <br>
  The spokesman said absconders should not think they could evade criminal liability by absconding from Hong Kong, and that they would be sanctioned by the law ultimately.
  <br>
  <br>
  Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning, also expressed strong dissatisfaction to the remarks at a regular press conference in Beijing on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We strongly disapprove and firmly reject countries which blatantly attack and smear Hong Kong police taking enforcement actions. The mentioned people absconded overseas, have long been engaged in interfering in Hong Kong affairs and supporting anti-China," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They attempted to interfere and undermine Hong Kong's development and social stability, seriously endangering national security and damaging Hong Kong's fundamental interests, crossing the bottom line of the 'One Country, Two Systems' principle."
  <br>
  <br>
  She stressed that Hong Kong matters are purely China's internal affairs, and no external forces should intervene in the matters.

    Annual food festival opens at HKCEC in Wan Chai

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Food Festival kicked off at the Convention and Exhibition Centre in Wan Chai on Wednesday, with mixed feelings on business sentiment among vendors.
 <br>
  <br>
  The event runs until Sunday with over 1,000 booths offering a variety of food and drinks, including wine, bakery goods, local snacks to New Year delicacies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lin Heung Lau, a famous Chinese restaurant located in Central, is one of the vendors. They put up neon signs at their booth and decorated it with their signature menu paper for dim sum.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The restaurant re-opened on April the 1st and we hope to use this chance to promote our business at the food festival. This is our first time participating, and we’re trying to bring dim sum and yum cha culture to the exhibition,” its representative said.
  <br>
  <br>
  One vendor from Taiwan said she wants to promote its handmade ginger and brown sugar tea to the locals, and that sales were looking good on the first day.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said her brand has been kept away from Hong Kong exhibitions for years because of the pandemic.
  <br>
  <br>
  But another vendor said people appeared to be spending less compared to previous years and that most big spenders were locals.
  <br>
  <br>
  A senior couple said they spent HK$3,000 on everyday items, such as canned food, alcohol and rice.
  <br>
  <br>
  The products are a little bit cheaper than outside, but the main thing is to experience the atmosphere and to support the local economy, they said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Entry tickets for the exhibition are priced at HK$30 each. Children aged 3 or below, seniors aged 65 or above, as well as non-local tourists can enjoy free admission.

    Snooker star Trump 'much happier' playing as resident

 Snooker star Judd Trump said he is looking forward to playing in the upcoming March tournament in Hong Kong as a resident.
 <br>
  <br>
  He earlier become a Hong Kong resident through the Quality Migrant Admission Scheme.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters on Wednesday ahead of a match in Macau, Trump said he hopes to inspire the younger generation in the city to take up snooker along with local stars Marco Fu and Ng On-yee.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I hope to really inspire the next generation because there are already so many younger players coming through in Hong Kong,” Trump said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Marco Fu is doing such a good job to inspire, and in the women’s game, [we have] On-yee, I really hope that I can promote snooker to everyone in Hong Kong and make it as cool as possible, and get younger kids away from different sports and enjoy snooker,” he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said he is open to promoting the sport in the city along with Ronnie O’Sullivan, who also became a Hong Kong resident two months ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  The snooker star also shared that he loved the vibrant life Hong Kong has to offer.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Hong Kong has a fast-paced lifestyle, everyone is always on the move, and there is also so much to do, as you are so close to everyone and if you drive 15 minutes, you’re already at the beaches, somewhere more relaxing,” Trump said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “For me, it’s perfect for what I do, as sometimes I like to feel the hustle and bustle around everybody, and sometimes I want to get away and do more relaxing stuff,” he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said he lives in the city for at least six months of the year, and that his girlfriend was a major reason why he decided to move to the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  “At the moment, I only spend time in the UK for tournaments and my priority is to be as happy as possible off the table. I’m much happier living in Hong Kong,” he said.

    Hong Kong to tap drone use in healthcare
   </title>
   <link>
    https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1784925-20241225.htm

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong has the potential to make use of drones in healthcare and draw experience from the mainland, according to an industry leader.
 <br>
  <br>
  Sources say the Hospital Authority (HA) plans to test drone medication deliveries in rural parts of Hong Kong, like flying drones from Tseung Kwan O Hospital to Po Toi O Chuen, a village about 10 kilometres away, as well as from Northern District Hospital to nearby villages.
  <br>
  <br>
  The HA earlier said they were committed to the government's plan for a low-altitude economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Andy Yeung, chairman of the DNT FPV Drone Association Hong Kong, China, spoke on an RTHK radio programme on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Hong Kong has the potential for development, but in the beginning we might need to rely on existing mainland technology. We can adapt their well-developed system to fit our needs later on,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Each area has different application environments, networks, interference, and regulations. If we take cues from the mainland’s success, like field arrangement, work distribution, and problem-solving in real scenarios, it will make things easier for Hong Kong.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeung said it’s wise to start testing in less populated areas because it’s easier to demonstrate to the public how they work and help ease their worries about safety and privacy.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said that drones weighing between 5 to 10 kilogrammes should be sufficient for delivering medications.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that ionospheric scintillation - which disrupted satellite signals and led to the cancellation of the drone show on October 1 - wouldn’t affect the deliveries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeung explained that a drones performance involves hundreds of drones and any slight deviation could result in collision, but that’s not the case for medication delivery.
  <br>
  <br>
  “When you're up in the air with a drone, a shift of five centimetres to one or two metres usually just results in slower speeds. Also, when planning routes, you would avoid crowded spots and won’t fly between buildings, so minor deviations aren’t a major issue,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the same programme, Sai Kung District Councilor Christine Fong stressed that there’s a real need for drug delivery, noting that many elderly people in Po Toi O Chuen have to tackle a steep road whenever they go out, with the wait time for minibuses sometimes exceeding half an hour.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said the fee for drone delivery should not exceed the HK$65 per prescription charged by HA for its current medication delivery service, and that subsidies should be granted to low income families.

    'Spending pattern shifting in Lan Kwai Fong'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A bar industry representative on Wednesday said the sector is confident in making a strong showing over the holiday period, with reservations through New Year’s Eve reaching over 80 percent.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on an RTHK programme, the director of the Lan Kwai Fong Association, Anthea Cheung, said business during Christmas Eve was better than last year, and that there's a noticeable change in spending pattern.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Lan Kwai Fong has always been a high-spending area. We still see customers are eager to spend, whether they’re from the mainland, local, or abroad. For example, those who book rooms show strong spending,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “But this year, to appeal to a broader audience, we’ve rolled out more affordable packages, including all-you-can-eat deals, which weren’t common in Central restaurants before. Clearly, customer consumption habits are shifting.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Cheung pointed out that the big spenders remain expats and foreigners, who account for 40 percent of visitors.
  <br>
  <br>
  She also said she noticed more people with suitcases in the area.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It's quite rare to see people travelling with suitcases in Lan Kwai Fong because it’s mainly for catering and entertainment, not shopping,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We didn't interview them, but maybe it's because multi-entry visas for Shenzhen residents have been brought back. Their suitcases weren't too big, so they might have just come for a meal or a drink, to experience the atmosphere without spending a night in Hong Kong.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Cheung added that the industry can't rest on laurels and needs to continue to improve and aim to retain inbound travellers.

 Justice Secretary Paul Lam on Wednesday said the government is setting an example by including mediation clauses in all future government contracts, in order to encourage private corporations to resolve disputes by mediation first.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on RTHK programme Overview Policy, he said the government is taking the lead in promoting the mediation culture in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We have to build a mediation culture. To build a culture, you have to be persuasive and to take a step forward to change the mindset and habit in the society,” Lam said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Of course, I wouldn't say mediation will always be successful [in resolving disputes], but at least give it a try. If it doesn't work, you can try a different approach.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Lam also said the government will promote the mediation culture to the public by launching the Pilot Scheme on Community Mediation.
  <br>
  <br>
  “When people are encountering community disputes, they can sit down and discuss the problems first, instead of filing a lawsuit right away,” Lam said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The justice chief said the scheme will be launched in several districts and the government will work with the local communities, so that the public can have a better understanding of mediation and have confidence in the system.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Large crowds flocked to the waterfront promenade along the West Kowloon Cultural District on Tuesday for a spectacular pyrotechnics show to mark Christmas Eve.
 <br>
  <br>
  Many people RTHK spoke to said they were extremely impressed with the 10-minute "Winter Harbourfront Pyrotechnics", which will be on for three consecutive nights from December 24 to 26.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eunice, a resident from Macau, said celebrating Christmas Eve in Hong Kong for the first time was a delightful experience, with the pyrotechnic show serving as an unexpected bonus.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I was definitely impressed. It's just crazy to me. It's my first time witnessing an experience like this and I think it's great. I really like the excitement," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There was this family in front of me and their little baby going 'wa' every single time and it just really made my day. It's the highlight of my day trip here in Hong Kong."
  <br>
  <br>
  A woman from Guangzhou said the show symbolised Hong Kong's prosperity, and wished it could be longer.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, a group of children clad in Christmas attire enthusiastically awarded the show 20,000 points for its beauty, while saying they enjoyed spending time with each other.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government said special traffic and transport arrangements are in place to cater for those enjoying the festivities, with MTR local lines and seven light rail lines operating overnight on Christmas Eve, and KMB also strengthening services on many routes.

<div class="itemFullText">
 World snooker number one Judd Trump has become a Hong Kong resident through the Quality Migrant Admission Scheme.
 <br>
  <br>
  His move comes two months after another British superstar from the sport, Ronnie O'Sullivan, did the same.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a video released by Hong Kong Talent Engage, the government's office to attract talent, Trump, 35, said he was looking forward to making new friends in the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I love just being around the hustle and bustle of people. For me I really enjoy the energy in Hong Kong," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So I love to be around people and I love to see people thrive and go about their business."
  <br>
  <br>
  The office quoted Trump as saying he loves everything about the SAR from the food, the people and the buildings, and these are what inspired him to be in the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  A world snooker champion in 2019, Trump has won 30 major titles so far during his career.
  <br>
  <br>
  Local and British media earlier reported that Trump has been dating local show host and former figure skater Maisy Ma and that they spend time in both Hong Kong and Dubai.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Former lawmakers Ted Hui and Dennis Kwok are among seven national security suspects who have their SAR passports cancelled as the government levied a fresh round of sanctions against them.
 <br>
  <br>
  Hui and Kwok, along with Kevin Yam, Yuan Gong-yi, Anna Kwok, Joey Siu and Frances Hui – who are all living overseas – were earlier placed on a wanted list, with the authorities offering rewards of HK$1 million each for information that leads to their arrest.
  <br>
  <br>
  Secretary for Security Chris Tang told a press conference on Tuesday that the public is banned from providing the absconders with money, handling their funds, engaging in property transactions or entering into commercial partnerships with them.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dennis Kwok, Yam and Yuan also had their professional qualifications or company directorships in Hong Kong temporarily stripped.
  <br>
  <br>
  The security minister added that the authorities have initiated court proceedings to seize the money raised by Ted Hui on online platforms.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're processing with the confiscation of the crime proceeds against Hui, and the amount is around HK$800,000," Tang said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the passport cancellations are useful because the group won't be able to travel.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the authorities have placed six more people living overseas on the national security wanted list, offering rewards of HK$1 million each for information leading to their arrest.
  <br>
  <br>
  They are scholar Chung Kim-wah, former district councillor Carmen Lau, former actor Joseph Tay, and activists Tony Chung, Victor Ho and Chloe Cheung.
  <br>
  <br>
  National security police said they're suspected of inciting secession on social media, calling for sanctions against Hong Kong and mainland officials, colluding with foreign forces, and promoting a so-called referendum to achieve self-determination.
  <br>
  <br>
  Deputy police commissioner on national security, Andrew Kan, said officers are freezing their bank accounts, and that the public should not give them any money on online platforms.

    Interest in fostering rises after allowance increased

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Social Welfare Department on Tuesday said there's been a sharp increase in the number of people applying to become foster carers since a monthly allowance was more than doubled to around HK$11,000.
 <br>
  <br>
  The payment was increased in April, while those providing emergency care saw their allowance roughly double to HK$13,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tsung Ka-yee, officer in charge at the department's central foster care unit, told an RTHK programme that there are now more than 1,000 foster families in the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Since the incentive payments were increased on April 1 this year, the number of enquiries we've received has surged by more than 35 percent compared to last year," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As for the actual number of applicants we're processing, because some enquiries might not lead to an actual application, we're now handling around 20 percent more applications than a year ago."
  <br>
  <br>
  Carrie Kong, chief supervisor for foster care services at the Hong Kong Christian Service, said carers welcome the increased allowance as it gives them a sense of recognition for their work.
  <br>
  <br>
  But she told the same programme that it still takes time to place children in a new home.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Even though there are more foster families, and it's become easier for us to look for suitable families to match with the children's needs, this doesn't mean that children in need can be admitted within a short period of time, because matching a child with a family involves many factors," she said.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Association for the Rights of Industrial Accident Victims on Monday called for more safety education as it revealed a concerning trend in workplace fatalities and sudden deaths in Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  The group reported 76 fatal workplace accidents across all sectors as of Monday this year, with nearly half registered in the construction industry.
  <br>
  <br>
  Forty cases were classified as "sudden death at work", which were double the total figure from last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Safety awareness is lacking not only in the industry but also in Hong Kong society as a whole," said Venus Cheuk, an organiser from the association.
  <br>
  <br>
  She told RTHK that pre-employment training alone is insufficient to address the issue, adding that safety education should begin from childhood.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Because since childhood, we have had a deficit in safety education, which naturally hindered the development of a safety mindset," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The group's chief executive, Fay Siu, felt that the penalties meted out to some employers convicted of breaching the Occupational Safety and Health Ordinance lacked deterrent effect.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said apart from fines, there should also be jail terms for offenders in some serious cases.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, the association said six deaths or serious industrial accidents occurred during the construction of the airport's third runway system, with some taking place at night.
  <br>
  <br>
  In response, the Airport Authority said it has always adhered to the highest construction safety standards, adding that the accident rate for the third runway system project was 6.41 per thousand workers, much lower than the industry average.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government has called on the Airport Authority to improve its reporting mechanism and enhance staff training, after the body did not immediately report an incident involving the automated people mover system last year.
 <br>
  <br>
  Back in November 2023, a girl was suspected to have stumbled and fallen into the gap between the platform and the train. She was helped to safety by passengers.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the incident only came to light 11 months later in October this year, with the government saying it was not notified.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Airport Authority was then ordered to submit a report within one month.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement on Monday, the government said the authority acknowledged procedural failures in reporting and investigation, but added it found no evidence of a cover-up.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said the the authority blamed a "lack of alertness in reporting and communication among the frontline staff", and as a result the incident was not "properly recorded" back then.
  <br>
  <br>
  Disciplinary actions have since been taken against the staff involved.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government noted that airport officials have pledged to take steps to address the situation. These include organising training sessions to strengthen the incident notification mechanism, and enhancing the CCTV system at the platform.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Electrical and Mechanical Services Department also confirmed that the people mover system is safe in both its design and operation.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's Catholic leader Stephen Chow has called on people to stay hopeful for the future in his Christmas message.
 <br>
  <br>
  Cardinal Chow said amid the slower-than-expected recovery of the global and local economies, wars and geopolitical tensions, people should continue to have faith - and be extra supportive to young people.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Christmas and the New Year are a time for hope, love, peace and dreams. Without hope and dreams there will be no future, especially for our young people. We need to walk alongside them and empower their creative hope and dreams," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The cardinal added everyone can step up to provide love and hope, especially to those who are going through tough times.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We can think of those who are struggling in war zones with seemingly endless torment, displaced persons and refugees looking for a dignified future, prisoners waiting for a new life, married couples who cannot see a sufficiently stable future for childbearing, young people who fail to identify convincing reasons to envisage a hopeful future, the elderly who are lonely and abandoned, and those who are sick and lonely in hospitals," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Similarly, the Archbishop of Hong Kong Sheng Kung Hui, Andrew Chan, called for forgiveness, peace, reconciliation and service.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We know how easy it is to be blinded and distracted by the visible wealth around us, but it is even easier to be blinded by the invisible power of this world. It is easy to say that with power, comes responsibility, but far too often we see people taking power and using it without holding back," he said in a video message.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There is nothing more powerful than God, and what he does with that ultimate power is to love and forgive."

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Secretary Eric Chan on Monday said a new contactless channel at the Chung Ying Street checkpoint in Sha Tau Kok makes it easier for people to access the area and demonstrates Hong Kong's innovative technology.
 <br>
  <br>
  Facial recognition technology allows people with valid Closed Area Permits to enter and exit Chung Ying Street without stopping to show their passes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at an opening ceremony, Chan said he believes the revamped checkpoint also offers a photo opportunity for visitors.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Through this pilot scheme, we hope to replace manual checks with innovative technology – making checkpoint access easier for people, increasing passenger capacity, and showcasing Hong Kong's digital capabilities as an international hub," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The reprovisioned checkpoint also provides tourists with a new photo spot."
  <br>
  <br>
  Richard, an Ap Chau resident who buy groceries in Chung Ying Street every week, said the technology makes his life easier.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think it's instant. I'm very impressed. Very advanced progress," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The HK$50 million checkpoint features nostalgic elements including grey bricks, white pillars and wooden benches inspired by old railway stations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Edward Wong, a project director from the Architectural Services Department, said he hopes the building will attract tourists.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have to get the memory of the old station that we have in the Sha Tau Kok spur line and also we get the memory of the old station," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have some characteristics, for example rusty rail lines, so we are creating some rusty walls here. So we have to show that we can have some hotspots for the tourists to take photos here."

<img alt="Deputy District Court judge Amy Chan says the white-shirted group should not have enforced the law themselves or used violence to express dissatisfaction.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A man was on Monday sentenced to four years and a month behind bars for his role in the Yuen Long clashes in 2019.
 <br>
  <br>
  Tang Ka-man, a businessman, was found guilty last month of rioting and conspiracy to wounding with intent.
  <br>
  <br>
  In sentencing, deputy District Court judge Amy Chan said the defendant was involved in the violence around Yuen Long MTR Station on July 21, 2019, as video footage showed he held a rattan stick and stood at the front of a 100-strong group dressed in white.
  <br>
  <br>
  The judge said the group had planned their attack as many of them were armed, which showed they were expecting the arrival of a rival group dressed in black.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan described the assault as effecting hatred, bullying, intimidation and silencing, saying the white-shirted group should have called the police instead of, as she put it, enforcing the law themselves or using violence to express dissatisfaction.
  <br>
  <br>
  The judge added that while there was no evidence showing that Tang had caused injuries to those dressed in black, he provided help to others dressed in white and was at the scene to encourage others to take part in the rioting.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan reduced the defendant's jail term by five months, saying he had agreed during trial that a riot had taken place and had been involved in charity.

    'Handle Real Madrid fan complaints individually'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Consumer Council has called on organisers of a meet-and-greet session with former Real Madrid stars to address complaints about last week's event individually.
 <br>
  <br>
  On Friday, fans complained that they had paid HK$6,880 to meet the veteran players but were unable to get their autographs or take photos with them.
  <br>
  <br>
  The council said it has received 16 complaints.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The incident this time was special and has to be addressed in a more individual and targeted manner, because every case is different," the watchdog's chief executive, Gilly Wong, said on an RTHK programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If it was a big case involving lots of people, it might have to be handled in a standard manner. But here, each complainant's case can be addressed separately, and they can try to coordinate with the organisers."
  <br>
  <br>
  A man surnamed Wong told RTHK that by the time he was allowed into the meet-and-greet session, some of the players had already left.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said he wasn't impressed with the organisers' efforts to make up for the disappointment, including the offer of a group photo before Real's game against Barcelona at Hong Kong Stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're obviously dissatisfied. Actually the arrangement just kept getting worse. The arrangement of a group photo was already not particularly good, and they couldn't even arrange a new autograph session afterwards. The incident made us really sad," he said, adding that he wants a full refund.
  <br>
  <br>
  The event organisers have apologised, explaining that players left early to prepare for the match. A WhatsApp hotline has been set up for those unhappy with the arrangements.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Environmental Protection Department (EPD) on Monday said it has issued two fixed penalty tickets and 33 written warnings to premises that have violated the ban on disposable plastic products since a grace period for the new law ended about two months ago.
 <br>
  <br>
  Restaurants are prohibited from using or selling polystyrene utensils, plastic straws, cutlery and plates.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hotels are also banned from freely distributing bathroom items made of plastic, including plastic-handled toothbrushes, plastic-packed toothpaste and shower caps.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other prohibited products include cotton buds, umbrella bags and glow sticks.
  <br>
  <br>
  The EPD said it received 62 complaints and reports about non-compliance and in 33 cases no action was taken to rectify problems.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The EPD has issued written warnings requiring the persons-in-charge to make improvements within 10 working days; otherwise, a fixed penalty notice will be issued," a department spokesman said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, two catering premises were found to be persistently violating the rules and were each issued a fixed penalty ticket of HK$2,000, officials said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Having reviewed the data in these two months after the adaptation period, most of the non-compliance had been rectified within a short period of time, and only two cases with repeated non-compliance records required the issuance of fixed penalty notices at present," the spokesman said.

    Some minor works could be exempted in future: Linn

<img alt="Bernadette Linn says items that could be exempted in future include enclosed balconies as well as flagpoles that are relatively small in size.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Development minister Bernadette Linn said she expects at least a third of the 36,000 illegal housing structures subject to removal orders to be exempted, if legal amendments to the Buildings Ordinance are passed.
 <br>
  <br>
  Officials are proposing to allow certain unauthorised minor works to be kept if they have been checked and proven safe by approved professionals.
  <br>
  <br>
  The plan is to let officials focus on taking enforcement action against serious violations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a TVB programme on Sunday, Linn said the checking fee by authorised experts should cost several thousand dollars on average.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said the government is planning to give homeowners a grace period of three years – after the new laws are passed – to complete the inspection.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Buildings Department is conducting an analysis on this. It's possible that a third or half of these outstanding removal orders involve minor illegal structures," the minister said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That means that at least 10,000 of these orders could be subject to checks."
  <br>
  <br>
  Linn said items that could be exempted in future include enclosed balconies as well as flagpoles that are relatively small in size.
  <br>
  <br>
  The legal amendments also include tougher penalties for serious and major illegal structures, as well as a lower prosecution threshold.
  <br>
  <br>
  The development chief added that under the proposed new rules, people who inherit unauthorised works from the previous owner could still be prosecuted, if they didn't remove them within a certain period of time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Linn said this means that going forward, homebuyers should pay greater attention and exercise more caution when making a purchase.
  <br>
  <br>
  A two-month public consultation on the proposal is due to begin later this month, and the amendment bill could be tabled to the legislature in the first half of 2026.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police announced on Sunday that they have arrested and charged a 46-year-old man on suspicion of burglary and attempted burglary in connection with a string of cases.
 <br>
  <br>
  Senior Inspector Lau Wing-lam said the suspect is believed to have broken into 11 kindergartens, a construction site and an office in New Territories and Kowloon between May and this month, taking away cash and electronic gadgets worth over HK$230,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our investigation found that the man had acted alone. He pried open door locks or window frames using hard objects during the early hours of the day, and ransacked the place to steal cash and some electronic gadgets, such as computers, phones, and cameras," Lau said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The schools reported losses of more than HK$180,000 between them -- including HK$150,000 in cash -- while the construction site and office lost items worth about HK$43,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officers said they’ve been able to recover some of those items.
  <br>
  <br>
  The man is due to appear at the Fanling Magistrates' Courts on Monday.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A catering sector representative on Sunday said the resumption of the multi-entry visa scheme for Shenzhen residents has given restaurants a much-needed boost over winter solstice.
 <br>
  <br>
  Simon Wong, president of the Hong Kong Federation of Restaurants and Related Trades, said most eateries did “quite well” on Saturday night, with the sector recording nearly HK$400 million in sales.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Especially for Chinese restaurants, they can do two rounds of business, this has been quite good. Compared to last year, business has grown by about eight percent,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Some hotspots, like Tsim Sha Tsui, Causeway Bay and some other areas, were crowded with people.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong also revealed that he's expecting a 10 percent growth in sales over the Christmas and New Year period, with an anticipated surge in visitors from Shenzhen.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Hong Kong can provide the kind of atmosphere for Christmas. When we see that all the shopping malls and even the streets [are] filled with Christmas atmosphere, then people from the mainland would rather come to Hong Kong."
  <br>
  <br>
  The catering representative said he hopes travellers can stay in the SAR for a longer period of time to further boost the local economy.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan said on Sunday that the government will roll out more innovative products, systems and cross-border cooperation to boost the capacity and liquidity of the SAR's financial markets.
 <br>
  <br>
  He was responding to comments from President Xi Jinping that both Hong Kong and Macau need to continue to expand global connections and enhance their attractiveness.
  <br>
  <br>
  President Xi made the remarks when he attended the ceremony marking the 25th anniversary of the establishment of the Macau SAR on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among other things, the President also said the SARs have to accelerate their integration into the country's development plan, and play an even better connecting role in the new development paradigm.
  <br>
  <br>
  Writing on his weekly blog, Chan said Hong Kong therefore needs to promote more innovation, such as allowing the mainland to connect with more new emerging markets, while strengthening cooperation with traditional markets.

  <br>
  “The higher liquidity and capacity of the Hong Kong market can better satisfy the fundraising needs of firms and organisations amid the geo-political situation and technological advancement," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The finance chief noted that while the country is facing challenges such as protectionism and unilateralism, it remains unwavering in promoting policies for high-level bilateral opening up.
  <br>
  <br>
  To this end, Chan said Hong Kong -- as "a super-connector and super value-adder" -- will be even more proactive in encouraging multilateral exchanges and cooperation.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that Hong Kong will join hands with what he called other brother cities in the Greater Bay Area to go on roadshows and seek foreign investment, and create more win-win business opportunities.

 The Hong Kong International Airport said on Sunday that it is stepping up services as people begin to fly out for the Christmas break.
 <br>
  <br>
  Long queues snaked around check-in counters at Chek Lap Kok, with many travellers saying they’re excited to take a break.
  <br>
  <br>
  A woman, surnamed Koo, told RTHK she’s off to Thailand for a warm Christmas.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Five of us are joining a meditation camp there, then I'll visit Bangkok and Pattaya for six days. There's not much to do in Hong Kong. The atmosphere here isn't too good because people tend to go home early," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If we go out to Mongkok, I go home when it starts turning dark, probably because of the habits we picked up during the pandemic. But when we're away from the city, we stay up later because the atmosphere is better.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The Kwok family, meanwhile, said they’re looking forward to a white Christmas in Japan.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're going to Osaka! We're so happy! It's so much fun there - and we're going to Universal Studios Japan!" the son said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We bought the tickets way ahead, and we want our kids to experience Christmas somewhere different. If it snows, our kids will be able to look at the natural scenery," the father added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Airport Authority is advising people to travel to the airport via public transport.
  <br>
  <br>
  It had said earlier that it’s expecting to handle around 200,000 passengers daily over the Christmas period, reaching pre-pandemic levels.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Organisers of an exhibition football match between former Real Madrid and Barcelona stars have issued an apology, after arrangements for a meet-and-greet session with veteran players reportedly left some fans disappointed.
 <br>
  <br>
  On Friday, Real Madrid fans complained they paid HK$6,880 to meet the La Liga legends but were unable to get their autographs and take photos with them.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to organisers, fans could purchase an "experience set" that included a ticket to the star-studded match at Hong Kong Stadium, an autograph session with either one of the teams in the morning, and other merchandise items.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Real Madrid Hong Kong Fans Club said "an unpleasant incident" happened at the meeting and had notified the police.
  <br>
  <br>
  The club also accused the organisers of not following through with their remedial measures such as arranging for a group photo to be taken before the match, and that fans were unable to hand their own memorabilia directly to the players for a signature.
  <br>
  <br>
  In an apology on Saturday, organisers said they're keeping in close contact with the fans club and those affected to "properly handle relevant matters."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Regarding the issue that arose in [Friday's] signing event, we have done our best to deal with it immediately and are proactively working out solutions with affected fans and related parties," they said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are aware that this incident has aroused public attention, and we deeply apologise for the inconvenience and confusion caused."
  <br>
  <br>
  Organisers also vowed to make better arrangements to avoid similar situations from happening again.

    Winter solstice drives Hongkongers to spend more

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hongkongers appeared to be more generous with their spending as they prepared for winter solstice gatherings on Saturday, but wet market stall-holders remained cautious about their business.
 <br>
  <br>
  The day, in Chinese tradition, is typically celebrated with family, when people gather for a meal at home or at a restaurant.
  <br>
  <br>
  People at wet markets were looking to spend a bit more than usual, with some opting to shop for hot pot.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I plan to spend around HK$1,000... I think I should stay home to celebrate during holidays," said shopper Ma.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another shopper, surnamed Cheung, said he was willing to almost double his usual spending of HK$300 and had a budget of more than HK$500.
  <br>
  <br>
  But vendors at wet markets were not hoping for a jump in business on the festive day.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There isn't much of a difference nowadays whether it's a holiday or not... There are fewer large families and fewer people are buying ingredients at the market," said merchant Yeung. "Business has gotten worse one year after the other."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Business has been a bit quieter than before... Although there were fewer people, some still came to the wet market to shop because they know it's winter solstice," said another stall owner.

    'Voluntary reporting of illegal structure not amnesty'
   </title>

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Development Bernadette Linn said on Saturday that a proposal to bring back the mechanism for voluntary reporting of unauthorised building works in village houses in the New Territories doesn't equate to granting them amnesty.
 <br>
  <br>
  The previous reporting period lasted for eight months in 2012.
  <br>
  <br>
  Property owners who reported unauthorised building works that were built on or before June 28, 2011 and imposed less risk didn’t have to fix them immediately, but had to conduct regular safety inspections every five years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Linn said that the government doesn’t have enough staff to deal with all the cases at present, but stressed that the scheme does not mean property owners don't need to do anything.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It’s not like we won’t prosecute you for the unauthorised works even if you have find someone to conduct regular inspections,” she said on an RTHK radio programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  Linn said it may take until 2030 for officials to complete other more urgent matters in urban areas, and then they'll look at how to handle the village house situations.
  <br>
  <br>
  The development minister noted that the Buildings Department has so far checked  roughly 60,000 village houses, out of about 99,000, and found that around half had unauthorised building work.
  <br>
  <br>
  There could be over 100,000 unauthorised building works among all village houses in total, she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, Linn reiterated plans to toughen fines for unauthorised building works isn’t about punishing people, but about getting them to take the issue seriously.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government hopes to amend the Buildings Ordinance, including raising the maximum fine for unauthorised building works from HK$400,000 to HK$2 million, alongside the existing risk of a two-year prison term.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities are also proposing a fixed penalty of HK$6,000 for owners who ignore statutory building inspection notices, which apply to premises that are 30 years old or more.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The government's intention is not to punish our property owners or citizens. What we hope is that through our legislation, we can establish rigorous provisions that encourage and urge everyone to comply with the law,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have many ageing buildings. We want to prompt everyone to take the requirement for building inspections seriously."
  <br>
  <br>
  She said officials will seek input from the public and professional groups when the two-month consultation on the proposal begins later this month.

    Paediatrician warns of 'severe' flu season

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A paediatrician on Saturday has urged the public not to lower their guard this flu season, urging Hongkongers to get vaccinated for what could be a severe winter flu season.
 <br>
  <br>
  Mike Kwan, from the University of Hong Kong's Department of Paediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, said infection numbers are expected to spike in January.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kwan said the SAR's flu season might be comparable to Australia's experience earlier this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Just looking back [at] Australia, the Southern Hemisphere, the flu season in fact was quite severe. So I expect, in the Northern Hemisphere this winter, our flu season will still be quite severe," Kwan said after appearing on a radio programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is why we are advocating the flu vaccination to all our citizens. The severity of flu infections in our community really depends on the percentage of our vaccinations, what we regard as herd immunity."
  <br>
  <br>
  Kwan said the vaccination rate among children aged six months to three years was relatively low.

    Pandas proving huge drawcard at Ocean Park: chairman

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The chairman of Ocean Park said on Saturday that thousands of visitors have flocked daily to see An An and Ke Ke, the pair of pandas gifted by the central government, since their public debut earlier this month.
 <br>
  <br>
  Paulo Pong also told a Commercial Radio Programme that he's optimistic that December visitor numbers will show a significant increase.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We've noticed more visitors from Southeast Asia, and it's great to see people from Europe and the US coming back too. That's why we are expecting good results this month,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pong said tourists from India and the Philippines are surging as well.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Tourists from India are topping the charts this year, with a fourfold increase for 2023-2024. Well, the base numbers might be low, but the growth from India and the Philippines is still quite impressive,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Many local families are also expected to visit the theme park over the weekend and also the upcoming Christmas and New Year holidays, he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The theme park posted a deficit of more than HK$71 million for the financial year ending in June even though visitor numbers and revenue reached five-year high.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pong said 30 percent of the park’s spending is earmarked for conservation and education work, which he described as “hard to measure in monetary terms.”
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the park understands the importance of achieving break-even and will work hard to broaden its income sources, including launching panda-themed products and attracting new visitors.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also expressed hope of getting longer term government subsidies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Currently, Ocean Park receives government funding of HK$280 million each year to cover its expenditure on conservation and education work. But this is scheduled to end in 2026.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, Pong noted experts estimated the twin panda cubs will be safe and ready to meet the public when they turn six months old, which will be around February.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he said it might be tricky to have the twins and their parents, Ying Ying and Le Le, appear together in one venue, noting the park needs to monitor how they interact and their safety is the park's priority.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Officials said they were satisfied with the inaugural concert that was being held at the Kai Tak Arena on Friday, saying it had generally met the government's expectations.
 <br>
  <br>
  The show was aimed at testing the venue’s readiness for hosting mega events and its possible impact on the surrounding neighbourhood.
  <br>
  <br>
  Around 5,200 ticket holders attended the Chill Thai Music Festival, which featured local boy band Mirror, girl group Collar and various Thai performers.
  <br>
  <br>
  The performance kicked off at around 6.50pm -- 20 minutes behind schedule -- and ended at 10.45pm.
  <br>
  <br>
  A spectator surnamed Wong said while the acoustic system wasn’t perfect, instructions were clear and staff were helpful.
  <br>
  <br>
  "To be honest, since it's the first time, there's room for improvement. I'd give it 50 marks," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Everything was clear and plenty of people were helping out. When we went in, people voluntarily helped us check our tickets and find our seats. There were also many signboards, and this place was easy to find."
  <br>
  <br>
  "We needed to wear Airpods to protect our ears because the music was too loud," another spectator, surnamed Chan, said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Commissioner for Sports George Tsoi -- who attended the test event with Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism Rosanna Law and Acting Secretary for Security Michael Cheuk -- said authorities were generally happy with how things went.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The show today slightly overran, but we have systems and mechanisms in place to handle such situations, including communication protocols with public transport operators," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tsoi added that various audio and visual setups will continue to be fine-tuned to improve overall spectator experience.

<div class="itemFullText">
 More than 13 million passenger trips in and out of Hong Kong will take place over the Christmas and New Year holidays with the majority via land borders, officials said on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Immigration Department said about 11 million trips will likely be made through land boundary control points from Saturday to New Year's Day.
  <br>
  <br>
  The number of departures via land is estimated to peak at 595,000 on Christmas Day and the inbound figure is likely to reach a high of 626,000 on December 29, officials said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Border control points at Lo Wu, Lok Ma Chau and Shenzhen Bay are expected to be busy, authorities said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "To cope with the anticipated heavy traffic during the festive period, the [Immigration Department] has minimised leave for frontline officers for flexible deployment and operation of extra clearance counters and kiosks," the government said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Additional security guards will also be deployed to provide crowd management support."
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials also said further details will be announced "as soon as possible" regarding government requests to extend the service hours of two border checkpoints on New Year's Eve.

    HA to beef up manpower ahead of winter flu surge

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hospital Authority (HA) on Friday said it will beef up manpower and bed capacity to guard against a potential surge in patients during the upcoming holiday period.
 <br>
  <br>
  This came as the Centre for Health Protection (CHP) reported a mild increase in both Covid and influenza cases, with the numbers expected to rise further in January.
  <br>
  <br>
  The HA said it will activate special measures for peak periods from Saturday, including reducing non-urgent hospital admissions and boosting manpower in public hospitals by 10 to 20 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dr Larry Lee, a chief manager with the authority, told a press conference that he's confident public hospitals have enough capacity to cope with a surge in demand.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The most important bit of it is to increase the bed turnover, including making use of our command centre and the day centre, so that we can aim our patients not lasting too long in our hospitals so that we can cater more emergency admissions," Lee said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "According to experience, our measures have improved and enhanced our capability to cope with the increased demand. So if the situations and the service activity will be similar to last year, I think we can cope with it."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee said the HA will also relaunch a special refund arrangement at accident and emergency departments to ease the pressure on services. Patients who don't want to wait any longer to be seen can apply for a refund of the HK$180 fee within 24 hours of registration.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CHP, meanwhile, appealed to high-risk individuals to get flu vaccines to protect themselves.

    Police arrest 39 over 'staged traffic accidents'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Thirty-nine people were arrested this week on suspicion of staging traffic accidents to try to defraud the government out of money granted to injured victims, police said on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The suspects, aged between 19 and 48, are suspected of making false claims worth a total of HK$2 million in relation to 33 allegedly fake accidents.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Earlier this year, an internal audit by the Social Welfare Department found fraudsters using falsified documents to apply for the Traffic Accident Victims Assistance Scheme," Senior Inspector Lam Tsz-lim said at a press briefing.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Police investigations found some of these claims were linked to an organisation which orchestrates staged traffic accidents. One such incident involved 13 people."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lam noted that 275 people were arrested last month over suspicious claims under the scheme worth a total of HK$14 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  The police said money was not paid out in relation to most of the suspicious claims connected to the latest arrests.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Social Welfare Department said it verifies every application stringently and is carrying out more random checks on medical certificates submitted by applicants.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If false medical information, fraudulence or other criminal elements are suspected, the SWD will refer the case to the police for investigation and recover the overpaid assistance payments from the relevant applicants," a spokesperson said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The department also warned that people convicted of providing false information to obtain money from the accident victims scheme risk a jail term of up to 14 years.

    Smart system to take effect at Ting Kau Bridge
   </title>

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Transport Department on Friday said it will implement a smart highway system at Ting Kau Bridge by the end of this month.
 <br>
  <br>
  It said the system has the ability to detect traffic accidents, and make appropriate arrangements to ensure a smooth traffic flow.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on an RTHK programme, Assistant Commissioner for Transport (Strategic Studies) Leung Sai-ho said the Automatic Incident Detection System can notify staff at the Tsing Ma Control Area in 10 seconds if it notices any abnormalities.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In cases in which a car suddenly stops moving, or slows down, or drives in the opposite direction, or objects fall on to the road, the system can analyse footage and deduce that a traffic incident has happened and tell our staff to act," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If we do not have such systems, we will have to detect incidents through the human eye, which would take minutes," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Leung said on-site staff may open up the hard shoulder of Ting Kau Bridge southbound to ease traffic flow, along with lane control signals and variable message signs to allow vehicles to pass by.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added message boards have already been installed along the road, aiming to provide real-time information to drivers.
  <br>
  <br>
  The system will be in place on December 29 for a one-month trial.
  <br>
  <br>
  The department said a mid-term review would be conducted in around six months if the scheme runs smoothly.
  <br>
  <br>
  Leung said the department would analyse traffic data collected and fine tune its implementation of the system.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wesley Wan, honorary life president of the Hong Kong Automobile Association, told RTHK that the city's drivers are familiar with having variable message boards on highways.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They [drivers] are already used to the notice board and the electronic notice on the highway. But I've noticed many times the government puts on some road safety message instead of the road information on the spot. They should inform motorists of the real-time information on the highway instead of just a road safety message," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wan also said the one-month trial period may be too short for data to be collected.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They [the government] spent a lot of time to install the system for this trial. So my question is, why just a one month trial? If we are lucky that there's no accident happening during this month, then we'll have no data. So I think the trial, with all this preparation work, the trial should be longer," he said.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China's top tennis player Zhang Zhizhen has chosen Hong Kong as his training ground ahead of the new ATP season, saying the move was “deeply personal”.
 <br>
  <br>
  "When I was 15, I played in the ITF Junior Tournament (Grade 4) here," the world number 45 said in an interview with Hong Kong media.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That's why I was really looking forward to coming."
  <br>
  <br>
  Having turned pro in 2012, the 28-year-old Shanghai native had a breakthrough in 2022, by becoming the first Chinese male player in the Open era to reach the top 100.
  <br>
  <br>
  He continued to make steady progress, rising to a career-high world number 31 in July this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  As the new season approaches, Zhang has set his sights on maintaining his momentum.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I want to have a better year (in 2025). Next year, my goal is trying to keep my ranking at around 30," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Still seeking his maiden ATP title, Zhang said it would be extra sweet if he could achieve that feat in front of a home crowd at the Shanghai Masters scheduled for September.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That would be an amazing week for me," he said.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping fully endorsed the work of senior Macau officials during his second day in the SAR, while also meeting Hong Kong Chief Executive John Lee, who visited the neighbouring city on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Meeting the heads of the executive, legislative and judicial branches of Macau, the president said the three organs of government have "comprehensively, accurately and unwaveringly" implemented One Country, Two Systems.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Xi said that under the leadership of Macau SAR Chief Executive Ho Iat-seng, the branches performed their duties pragmatically and effectively over the past five years," a Xinhua report read.
  <br>
  <br>
  The news agency added that Xi expressed appreciation to the representatives across different sectors for contributing to Macau's long-term prosperity and stability, and called on them to "stay united and work for greater achievements".
  <br>
  <br>
  Apart from outgoing leader Ho Iat-seng and his successor Sam Hou-fai, the president also greeted former chief executives Edmund Ho and Fernando Chui.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, Xi received Hong Kong Chief Executive John Lee, who was in Macau to attend celebrations marking the 25th anniversary of the SAR's establishment.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to Xinhua, the president urged Hong Kong and Macau to "strive for greater accomplishments and achieve better development", while declaring One Country, Two Systems has entered a new stage.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The two special administrative regions should learn from each other, strengthen exchanges and cooperation, and create a brighter future," Xi was quoted by the news agency as saying.
  <br>
  <br>
  CCTV quoted Xi as telling Lee that the country has "very high expectations" for Hong Kong, and wished Lee and his administration sound and stable governance and create a brighter future.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee, in response, vowed to work hard to boost Hong Kong's economy, strive for development, improve people's livelihood, proactively participate in building the Greater Bay Area, and better integrate into the national development.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Property consultancy firm Cushman and Wakefield on Thursday said Hong Kong's property market will start to pick up next year, if the rate-cutting cycle continues.
 <br>
  <br>
  The company's executive director, Rosanna Tang, said transactions and prices have stabilised following three rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve since September.
  <br>

  "If interest rates continue to stay on a downward cycle and the Fed continue their rate cut policy and at the same time if the stock market could restore some of the momentum, then we expect the transaction volume in the residential market will continue to pick up and recover from this year's level. Then we can see the price rebound to follow in 2025," she told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  Major banks, including HSBC and Bank of China (Hong Kong), have announced they are lowering their prime lending rates for the third time this year, trimming the cost of borrowing to the lowest level in two years.

 Customs officers on Thursday said they had arrested 22 people and seized drugs worth over HK$160 million in a series of airport operations ahead of the Christmas holidays.
 <br>
  <br>
  Officers said around 370 kilos of drugs were seized from November to mid-December, including ketamine, methamphetamine and space oil.
  <br>
  <br>
  Traffickers made use of festive decorations to hide the drugs before the holiday season, officers added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "During the long holiday season at year-end, drug traffickers usually take the opportunity to smuggle drugs to the local market," said Wong Ngar-shan, acting divisional commander of Customs' airport investigation group.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Therefore, Hong Kong Customs has adjusted its enforcement strategies accordingly, successfully intercepting cannabis from North America and Thailand, ketamine from Europe, and methamphetamine from North America from entering the market."
  <br>
  <br>
  Officers also said they seized 18 kilos of etomidate powder shipped from India, which can be used to make around 54,000 space oil-infused capsules.
  <br>
  <br>
  Often inhaled through vapes, space oil usually contains etomidate, a regulated sedative that is prescribed by a doctor.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government wants to add etomidate to the Dangerous Drugs Ordinance by the first quarter of next year.

<div class="itemFullText">
 MTR passengers will get the chance to travel on panda-themed trains from Thursday, as part of a wider campaign to welcome the city’s four new pandas.
 <br>
  <br>
  The corporation is one of the many businesses joining the “Come and Enjoy a Pandastic Hong Kong” campaign, organised by the Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau, Hong Kong Tourism Board and Ocean Park.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two trains on the South Island Line and one Airport Express train have been decorated with pandas and will commence service on Thursday evening.
  <br>
  <br>
  “December is the month of the pandas. If we read the news in the last few days we see there’s a lot of new attractions rolled out to celebrate or to share the joy of the pandas with the public,” MTR managing director Jeny Yeung told a media briefing.
  <br>
  <br>
  “So MTR is also launching a series of activities and decorations in our trains so that when our passengers are going to different destinations including when they are visiting the pandas they can have a very joyful experience,” she said
  <br>
  <br>
  People will also be able to see panda decorations at Ocean Park Station and at Admiralty Station, where LED pillars with 3D animations of a giant panda waving its arms will also greet passengers.
  <br>
  <br>
  At Lo Wu Station, Lok Ma Chau Station, West Kowloon Station, as well as stations along the South Island Line and Airport Express, MTR staff will be attaching panda plushies to their uniforms.
  <br>
  <br>
  The campaign will run until mid-February.

    Study finds half of drug users delay seeking help

<img alt='A survey by the Hong Kong Christian Service found that around nine percent of respondents reported the use of "space oil". Photo: RTHK' src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1784169_1_20241219134307.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A recent survey by the Hong Kong Christian Service has found that half of drug users wait years before seeking help, and many downplay the negative effects of drug abuse.
 <br>
  <br>
  The organisation polled 304 drug users between September and November, and found that 55 percent only sought treatment after using drugs for more than three years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Almost 40 percent claimed that drug use had no negative impact on their lives, and the youngest drug abuser was just nine years old.
  <br>
  <br>
  Michael Ng, the group’s service supervisor, said people might be reluctant to seek help because of the stigma associated with drug use.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Sometimes it's a health issue. They cannot find any health issue in their body, or maybe they were not aware of the mental illness issue. The second point is they don't want to [publicly tell] their story,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Researchers also found that around nine percent of respondents reported using "space oil" - a regulated sedative typically inhaled through vapes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Psychiatrist Dr Matthew Wong said long-term use of space oil could cause irreversible damage.
  <br>
  <br>
  “When someone is using the drug repeatedly and also receiving a high dose, that will cause damage in the brain cells and also cause some irreversible chemical imbalance in the brain,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “That will bring all sorts of physical and mental problems the patient would be suffering from.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The group called for more prevention education in schools and more accessible support channels to help people tackle drug addiction.

    Local property market shows signs of stabilising: HKMA

<img alt="" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1784129_1_20241219102220.jpg&q=15">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) on Thursday said the local property market showed signs of stabilising with transactions increasing steadily and prices rising marginally after the US Federal Reserve started cutting interest rates in September.
 <br>
  <br>
  With another quarter of a percentage point cut overnight, the Fed has cut interest rates by an accumulative 100 basis points since September.
  <br>
  <br>
  HKMA's chief executive Eddie Yue said a lower borrowing cost environment would be beneficial to the local economy and the real estate market, reducing the loan burden of home buyers. But he stressed there are many other factors affecting the economy and the housing market.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said whether local borrowing costs would drop further following the latest cut by the Fed would depend on local funding supply.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Banks will normally take into account factors like funding supply and demand in the interbank market, the level of interbank rates, and their own funding cost structure to assess the merits and extent of adjustment if there's any," Yue said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He called on borrowers to exercise caution as the future outlook on interest rate cuts remains uncertain.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Interest rates might still remain at a relatively high level for some time and the extent and pace of future interest rate cuts are subject to considerable uncertainty. The public should carefully assess and continue to manage the interest rate risk when making property purchase, mortgage or other borrowing decisions," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The HKMA reduced the base rate to 4.75 percent with immediate effect on Thursday according to the established mechanism.
  <br>
  <br>
  HSBC and Bank of China (Hong Kong) announced cuts in their best lending rates in Hong Kong by 12.5 basis points to 5.25 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The new lending rates take effect at HSBC on Friday and at Bank of China (Hong Kong) next Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The lenders were also trimming their savings rate by the same margin to 0.25 percent per annum on deposits above HK$5,000.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Former Real Madrid and Barcelona stars said they are ready to deliver a thrilling show for fans as they face off in an exhibition match at Hong Kong Stadium on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The star-studded lineup features a mix of World Cup winners, including Iker Casillas and Roberto Carlos of Real Madrid, along with Barcelona’s Xavi Hernandez, Carles Puyol and Thierry Henry.
  <br>
  <br>
  Michael Owen, the former England striker, and Dutch star Patrick Kluivert are also part of the lineup.
  <br>
  <br>
  Barcelona Heroes’ captain Puyol said he has no plans to travel around the city and wants to stay focused for the match.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's always a special game, because you've been playing against your biggest rival for quite a long time, but not only because they are rivals, but a lot of them are also friends,
  <br>
  because they've been competing also in the national teams. So in the end, it's about the show, to try to put a good show, and people enjoy these kind of matches," he said through an interpreter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Real Madrid Legends’ captain Luis Figo also promised El Clásico would be an exciting match for fans.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think El Clásico is one of the biggest games and derbies in the world, two of the biggest clubs in the world, so the passion is high, the rivalry is very intense... For us now, of course, everyone likes to win, but everyone is retired. We wanted to show a good entertainment game, so we're looking forward to that," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The legendary Portuguese midfielder visited Hong Kong with Real Madrid during their Asia tour in 2003 and scored in a pre-season match against the local team.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Well, of course I remember... We had a great time here, and it's always fantastic to come back to a place that you feel so much support and love. And of course, every time you score is a happiness, because football is a joy. I think you work for that, to make the fans happy, so looking forward for the game," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Event organiser Legend Assemble said they are looking to bring in more football idols to the SAR when the Kai Tak Sports Park opens next year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tickets for Friday's match are still available for sale on Klook.com, and students, alongside education and sports groups can enjoy a 25 percent discount.

 Chief Executive John Lee on Wednesday greeted members of the public as he visited a panda carnival in Tsim Sha Tsui.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lee visited several stalls at the fair, chatted with their operators as well as passers-by, took selfies with them and bought 38 panda dolls.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also went to a bar, had a drink and talked to a customer from Sweden who was in Hong Kong to develop her design business.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have long stays. We have short stays. That's Hong Kong. In fact, this is the world. Looking around, people are so mobile, so they tend to really float around. It's a global village," Lee told the Swedish visitor.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So I'm very glad to see that you are bringing Swedish culture [to the city]. That is what Hong Kong people love - to try everything. They appreciate the different characteristics of different countries."
  <br>
  <br>
  It was Lee's second district visit in a week.

 Crowd control and set-up procedures are just a few of the measures that authorities will be taking note of, as Kai Tak Arena prepares for its inaugural concert on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Authorities said around 5,500 ticket holders are expected to attend the Chill Thai Music Festival, featuring local boy band Mirror.
  <br>
  <br>
  Commissioner for Sports George Tsoi said doors will open for concert goers at 4.30pm, with the performance set to start at 6.30pm and wrap up before 10pm.

  Tsoi said the arrangements for sporting events and concerts differ significantly.

  "For concert events, it involves more set-ups, the stage arrangement, which we do not have during the sports events. There's also rehearsals that we are going to test for a concert event," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Apart from the above, the spectators' arrival and dispersal patterns of concert events are quite different from typical sports events."
  <br>
  <br>
  Tsoi said concert goers should have already gotten their tickets in advance, adding that there will be no on-site ticket sales.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For the ticketing arrangements for these concerts, they are all distributed through the events organisers, so participants and spectators should have got their tickets by now. They are not required to get their tickets on site," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think this arrangement would ensure orderly pedestrian flow during the concerts and during the starting time of the concerts."
  <br>
  <br>
  He also reminded attendees that umbrellas, outside food and drink, water bottles, professional photography equipment, and support signs larger than 38cm long, 20cm wide and 30cm high are prohibited.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tsoi added these restrictions align with those at concerts held at AsiaWorld-Expo and the Hong Kong Coliseum.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Kai Tak Mall had its soft opening on Wednesday, featuring a sports recreation facility and around 200 shops with over 80 percent leased.
  <br>
  <br>
  Crystal Wong, head of retail at Kai Tak Sports Park, said the mall would discuss flexible operating hours with merchants during major events and performances, adding the mall can maintain a steady flow of visitors before and after shows and games.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The mall allows customers to come earlier to shop and enjoy meals. They don't have to come last minute just for their event. It's to give people more diverse options and creates a better experience," she said.

    'Stay alert to promises made by sports bodies'

 Sports sector lawmaker Kenneth Fok on Wednesday urged young athletes and their parents to remain vigilant when signing contracts with sports bodies.
 <br>
  <br>
  This came after the family of a young skateboarder successfully terminated a contract with a local association for the sport.
  <br>
  <br>
  It claimed to be able to nominate the athlete to compete in international competitions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The chairman of the association told me that he had the authorisation to nominate my daughter to participate in the Asian Games and even the Olympic Games. Everything went through a phone call, but this is the main reason why I signed the contract without deep thinking," the athlete's father surnamed Su said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Su signed the five-year contract back in 2021. However, no regular training was provided for his daughter, and he was asked to pay more than HK$100,000 for training and enter competitions that anyone could sign up for themselves. He said he never received any receipts regarding his payments.
  <br>
  <br>
  When Su expressed his wish to terminate the contract this February, the sports body raised harsh conditions on his daughter.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They demanded us to either pay HK$300,000 as a termination fee, or my daughter [would] not [be] involved in any skateboarding activity in a year," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  A termination agreement was made in July after lawyers got involved in the dispute.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fok said parents can refer to membership information under sports associations to verify the authenticity of various sports bodies.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If in doubt, [parents] can contact SF&OC (Sports Federation & Olympic Committee of Hong Kong, China) or responsible national sports associations, to inquire more about the association or entity that you are involved with, to make sure that they are promoting the sports in a positive way, and not making any alternative claims that may not meet their expectation," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We welcome different sports entities, stakeholders to contribute to sports in Hong Kong. Everyone has a right to push sports. But if such organisations are making claims, do double check and stay alert," he added.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Development Secretary Bernadette Linn on Wednesday shot down a lawmaker's suggestion that people fined for carrying out large-scale unauthorised building works be allowed to keep them if they aren't considered dangerous.
 <br>
  <br>
  The government is hoping lawmakers will agree to amend the Buildings Ordinance. Under its proposal, the maximum fine for unauthorised building projects will go up from HK$400,000 to HK$2 million, alongside the existing risk of a two-year prison term.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a Legco development panel meeting, legislator Wendy Hong asked whether people could be exempt from demolishing or rectifying large-scale illegal structures that do not pose any danger after they pay the fine.
  <br>
  <br>
  Linn said the government does not want to "go down such a route" or mislead future generations into thinking they can "pay to break the law".
  <br>
  <br>
  It is also difficult to guarantee the long-term structural integrity of the works, she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A professional may be able to inspect it (unauthorised building works) with the naked eye and say that it is safe, but don't forget that at the time of construction, no building plan was submitted and probably they didn't have any construction records," Linn explained.
  <br>
  <br>
  At the meeting, Linn also reassured owners' corporations that they will not be prosecuted immediately after being served a notice to carry out mandatory building inspection, as long as they begin to take action.

    25 arrests over suspected fake certificates since 2022

<div class="itemFullText">
 The government said on Wednesday that 25 people have been arrested over the past three years on suspicion of using fake qualifications to apply for places at tertiary institutions in Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  Charges were laid against eight of them, with three convictions and five people on bail pending trial. The rest of the cases are still under investigation, the government said.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a Legislative Council meeting, lawmakers said many mainland intermediaries claim they can guarantee university admissions, as well as successful entry to Hong Kong through different talent schemes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Unionist lawmaker Chau Siu-chung asked whether the government has enough manpower to conduct checks on admissions, noting that some of those who moved to Hong Kong through the talent programmes are due to have their visas renewed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Acting security minister Michael Cheuk said in response that officers will step up inspections, adding that the authorities have been working closely with their mainland counterparts and that they conduct joint enforcement action in a timely manner.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As at 10 December 2024, the police had referred information of a total of 14 mainland intermediary agencies or intermediaries to the relevant mainland authorities for follow-up," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In respect of the recent cases involving false proof and unscrupulous intermediaries, the Immigration Department has been maintaining close communication and exchanging intelligence with the relevant mainland authorities."
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister also stressed that the Education Bureau has told tertiary institutions to adopt enhanced measures, such as requiring applicants to submit third-party verification proof before admission.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Wednesday said the sports sector gets priority when it comes to booking the Hong Kong Coliseum, after a lawmaker complained that organisers turned away are instead taking their events to Macau or Guangdong.
 <br>
  <br>
  New People's Party lawmaker Adrian Ho noted that the Coliseum is also in high demand for concerts, arts and cultural events and said some in these sectors aren't sure why they find it hard to secure the venue.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a written reply to his questions, culture and sports minister Rosanna Law said 461 booking applications – around 80 percent of the total received – have been rejected since 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  But she added that throughout this period, the venue has been in constant use.
  <br>
  <br>
  Around 60 percent of the successful bookings were for concerts, while around a fifth were for large-scale sporting events.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[The Leisure and Cultural Services Department] considers the nature, significance and attraction of the events, audience appeal of the performers and booking history of the applicants, et cetera, when more than one organisation applies for the same time slot," the minister said.
  <br>
  <br>
  She added that the Coliseum is regarded as an important sports venue and events in this category therefore get priority.
  <br>
  <br>
  Law said she expects event organisers will welcome the opening of Kai Tak Sports Park next year, and officials will work with the operator to promote the site for local and international events.

    'Set up one-stop platform for after-death procedures'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ombudsman Jack Chan on Wednesday urged the government to set up a one-stop thematic website for after-death arrangements so the public do not have to go to various sites to get information.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chan's office investigated public services relating to after-death arrangements, including death registrations, mortuary services, cremations and burial services.
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted that these services are provided by different government departments, and people seeking information might have to check with each one.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department launched its own after-death arrangements thematic website in November, but the authorities should set up a website coordinating services by all the various departments.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It would be most useful and helpful to the bereaved families if there's one thematic interdepartmental website so that the family could just use that website to gather all the essential information," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The second recommendation is to provide a digital form for the bereaved family to apply for different certificates and procedures, instead of having to go to different departments and authorities to apply for different certifications or whatever document they need."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan also suggested the government provide more electronic application procedures to make services more convenient for the public.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan said on Wednesday that Hong Kong can expand into the Middle East market by providing risk assessment and financial services.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on the RTHK programme Overview Policy, he said companies in the Middle East are eager to invest in China, Hong Kong and other Asian markets due to intensifying geopolitical tensions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan earlier visited Europe, the United States, Australia and the Middle East, with the aim of strengthening ties with traditional markets, as well as exploring new markets and capital sources.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In our exchanges, business leaders [in the Middle East] learnt about the real situation of how One Country, Two Systems is implemented in Hong Kong, and what can we do for them in terms of investing in mainland China," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Entering and leaving Hong Kong is very easy, such as they can get to Shanghai and return on the same day through Hong Kong. On the other hand, we can provide them with professional services that are targeted towards the mainland and Asian markets, to be their guide and assess different kinds of risks."
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that investments from Europe and the United States have continued to pour into Hong Kong, despite negative claims by Western media.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When stock market performances improved earlier, more than 80 percent of capital came from Europe and America. Moreover, in terms of asset and investment management, a lot of international banks expanded their operations here. That's because the Greater Bay Area's economic development is quick, and people here are relatively more wealthy among all of China," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have to separate politics and the financial sector. Companies may express their own political views, but they also want returns in business."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan also said the government is working hard to improve the city's economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We discussed with mainland authorities to expand the Individual Visit Scheme to more cities, and increase their duty-free allowance. We have also been attracting strategic enterprises since 2002, offered the Quality Migrant Admission Scheme, and hosted events such as the Global Financial Leaders' Investment Summit in November," he said.

 A charity that provides health behavioural education for children and their caregivers is seeking support to help those with special education needs.
 <br>
  <br>
  Be Priceless is one of the 11 beneficiaries of this year's Operation Santa Claus (OSC), an annual charity campaign holding fundraising projects for over 35 years.
  <br>
  <br>
  The founder of the organisation, Dr Czarina Leung, said Be Priceless is supporting children and carers through its SEED programme, which stands for self-value, empower, educate, and protect from dangers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We teach them how to prevent, prepare, respond and recover from mental disorder, physical disorder, as well as relational safety issues including bullying and violence," Leung told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  Leung said her organisation provided long-term workshops for children and their carers, especially when they are transitioning into a new phase in life.
  <br>
  <br>
  She added that with more support, her organisation would expand its network and help more children, including those with visual impairments and other disabilities.
  <br>
  <br>
  The foundation said Be Priceless would support 125 children and youth with special education needs, and 195 caregivers of the children.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The government has shelved a plan to introduce technology that can detect invalid votes, a day after lawmakers expressed privacy concerns at a Legislative Council meeting.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Constitutional and Mainland Affairs Bureau had planned to table legal changes by March, in part to bring in smart ballot boxes for polls.
  <br>
  <br>
  At the Legco meeting on Monday, some lawmakers said they were concerned about confidentiality, warning that a voter suspected of casting an invalid vote could easily be spotted at a polling station.

  <br>
  Officials didn't explain how the new voting process would work, how votes could remain confidential or which elections the smart boxes would be used for.
  <br>
  <br>
  A bureau spokesman said late on Tuesday that the boxes will not be introduced after all.
  <br>
  <br>
  "After listening to the views from lawmakers and the public, the government is willing to be receptive to the views," he said, stressing that the government highly values public opinion on its governance.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The government has decided to continue to provide ballot checking devices for voters, and they can use them on a voluntary basis if that's necessary."
  <br>
  <br>
  In recent years, such checking devices have been used in the District Committee constituency in district council polls as well as Legco's Election Committee constituency.

 The MTR on Tuesday said its trains will run overnight on Christmas Eve and New Year's Eve to facilitate commuters participating in festive celebrations.
 <br>
  <br>
  It said trains on eight railway lines will run more frequently from 3pm on December 24 and 31, and overnight services will be provided, except for the Airport Express, Disneyland Resort Line and the section between Sheung Shui, Lo Wu and Lok Ma Chau on the East Rail Line.
  <br>
  <br>
  The company said 2,200 additional train trips will be provided on Christmas Eve and New Year's Eve.
  <br>
  <br>
  It added that train services will be gradually enhanced from Friday until January 1.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government earlier said it had submitted requests to mainland authorities on extending the service hours at two border checkpoints on New Year’s Eve, and the MTR said it would make further arrangements.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In alignment with the proposed extension of operating hours of the Lo Wu checkpoint to 2am, the MTR will make corresponding service arrangements."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Further details will be announced in due course," it said in a statement.

 Hong Kong, China have booked a place in the finals of the East Asian Football Federation (EAFF) E-1 Football Championship in South Korea next year after they crushed Guam in the finale of the qualifying round of the tournament, which the city hosted this month.
 <br>
  <br>
  A goal in each half from Tai Po midfielder Philip Chan, as well as strikes from Benavides Medeiros, Everton Camargo and Dudu, helped seal the 5-0 victory at Hong Kong Stadium on Tuesday evening.
  <br>
  <br>
  The win caps a perfect run in the preliminary competition, with the hosts having beaten Mongolia and Chinese Taipei in their previous matches.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was also the sixth straight win under head coach Ashley Westwood.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SAR can now look forward to the EAFF E-1 finals in July 2025, when they will face Asian powerhouses South Korea, Japan and China.

    AI oral-care app to give quick check-ups for elderly

<img alt="Researchers are hoping to give AI-powered check-ups to elderly people who have trouble visiting dentists. Photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1783892_1_20241217195648.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The University of Hong Kong has developed a new AI-powered mobile app that it says can reliably assess the oral health of patients in seconds.
 <br>
  <br>
  Over the next three months, volunteers are hoping to use the app to help hundreds of elderly patients who have difficulty visiting a dentist – by making home visits or at three service locations in Lam Tin and Kwun Tong.
  <br>
  <br>
  Students from HKU’s dentistry faculty are partnering up with legislators and district councillors to identify elderly people in need of help.
  <br>
  <br>
  The volunteers would then do a quick test simply by taking photos of the patients’ mouths and running it through the app – called GUM AI – which would then make an accurate assessment of the state of their teeth and gums.
  <br>
  <br>
  No professional training is needed – the app simply displays red for poor oral health, yellow when caution is required, and green means everything looks fine.
  <br>
  <br>
  The service teams would then give advice to the patients, or refer them to a dentist if needed.
  <br>
  <br>
  HKU researcher Walter Lam says the technology could make a real difference.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We hope the GUM AI can raise health awareness among those elderly, so that they can have a regular dental visit, and they can self-care their hygiene, which is quite important to prevent any oral diseases," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Developers of the app say it has proven to be highly reliable, with a 90-percent accuracy rate.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The accuracy of our AI system is comparable to experienced dentists," Lam said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The team is aiming to expand the use of the app to other age groups after the end of the three-month pilot project. They say the technology promises to reduce waiting times for oral check-ups, and can help people better monitor their oral health and get treatment early.

 A counter-terrorism drill held at Kai Tak Youth Sports Ground on Tuesday saw the authorities tackling terrorists opening fire from the stands and the discovery of a backpack containing a suspicious device.
 <br>
  <br>
  Police, fire, customs, immigration, prison and Government Flying Service officers took part in the simulation, aimed at strengthening their capability to handle emergencies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Senior police superintendent Peter Leung, from the inter-departmental counter terrorism unit, said the current terrorist threat level in Hong Kong is "moderate", indicating that while an attack is possible, there is no specific information suggesting the city is being targeted.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are planning to invite more different government departments and also the public and private sectors as well as the members of public to participate in this kind of CT [counter-terrorism] exercise because I think we have to promote the inter-departmental cooperation in the prevention of terrorist attacks," Leung said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said public participation in counter-terrorism exercises is crucial for raising awareness and understanding terrorism trends, adding that the drills help equip the community to prevent terrorist activities.
