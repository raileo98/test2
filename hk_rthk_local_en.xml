<img alt="The Executive Council has approved fare hikes ranging from 4.3 to 7.5 percent for Citybus, KMB and New Lantao Bus. File photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1783851_1_20241217160651.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Executive Council on Tuesday gave the green light for three bus companies to increase their fares, although the hikes are smaller than what some of them had sought.
 <br>
  <br>
  Citybus can increase fares by 7.5 percent, while New Lantao Bus and KMB can raise theirs by 6.5 percent and 4.3 percent respectively.
  <br>
  <br>
  The new fares will take effect on January 5 next year.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, a government spokesman said around 80 percent of passengers will pay no more than 50 cents extra per trip.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Although passenger volume and the revenues of franchised buses have significantly recovered after the pandemic, they have not fully returned to pre-pandemic levels due to changes in consumption and travel habits," the statement read.
  <br>
  <br>
  The spokesman added the fare hikes would help bus companies stay afloat, and that factors such as operating costs and public affordability had been considered.
  <br>
  <br>
  KMB and New Lantao Bus had asked for 6.5 percent increases, while Citybus wanted to put fares up by 9.5 percent for most routes.

 Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday said the government will seriously consider all opinions on the next budget.
 <br>
  <br>
  With a public consultation under way on Sunday, Lee said Financial Secretary Paul Chan will give serious consideration to all the advice proposed for the upcoming budget.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A lot of advice and opinions have already been provided," Lee told reporters ahead of the weekly's Executive Council meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The financial secretary has been doing this budget consultation for a number of years, and he will of course be taking serious attention to all the opinions and suggestions that are raised, examine the pros and cons, and also the reasoning and the thinking behind, so as to ensure that the eventual budget will satisfy the overall needs of Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I am sure that the financial secretary will be paying heed to different opinions and analyse all the opinions very objectively and thoroughly to ensure that the best budget is prepared for Hong Kong."
  <br>
  <br>
  The CE told businesses to grasp opportunities, thanks to stronger visitor numbers and an increase in online shopping.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Yes, we have a budget deficit, but already we have said that we will try to increase income, and also to reduce expenditure as well and to promote economic growth so the businesses will make more money, as a result of which the government will also have more income," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CE said the government will seek to make around HK$90 billion in investments each year, and he believes private investments will improve following a number of policies and measures launched by the central and SAR governments.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government has said the budget deficit for the current fiscal year could double to around HK$100 billion from an earlier estimate.

    Police warn Carousell users of bogus payment websites

<img alt="From left to right: senior inspector Victoria Ng, chief inspector Felton Leung and Carousell chief of staff Tan Su-lin. Photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1783810_1_20241217114145.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police are urging users of the popular online trading platform Carousell to be vigilant against bogus payment links aimed at hacking into their bank accounts, with 644 cases recorded in the first 10 months of the year, incurring losses of HK$36 million.
 <br>
  <br>
  The new tactic emerged as the force noted a 23.7 percent year-on-year rise in the overall number of online shopping scams during the same period, and the amount involved more than doubled to HK$332 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  To make transactions safer, Carousell introduced a Buyer Protection service in August, through which the seller only receives payment after the buyer confirms receipt of the goods.
  <br>
  <br>
  But senior inspector Victoria Ng of the Cyber Security and Technology Crime Bureau said the number of scams surged after the service was rolled out, with 330 cases recorded alone between August and October, involving HK$25 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  She explained scammers would pose as buyers and offer to pay for the item through the new payment system.
  <br>
  <br>
  The sellers, after providing an e-mail address, would then receive a phishing link, which directs them to a website asking for details of their online banking account.
  <br>
  <br>
  The sellers could then withdraw all the money from the victims’ accounts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carousell chief of staff Tan Su-lin clarified users never have to surrender their e-mail address when using the payment system, let alone click on links.
  <br>
  <br>
  “In today's day and age, it's really a very risky behaviour to click on any links that you receive, whether it's via e-mail, or through your WhatsApp,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  But not just sellers are being scammed - chief inspector Felton Leung noted buyers seeking sought-after items, such as concert tickets, can also fall prey to deception.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The scammers … play mind games with the victims. They knew that the victims want [the product] so much and it's so hard to get in any other places, so they will put on some time frame or time constraint on the victims. If they don't settle the deal as soon as possible, they will not get the tickets.' he explained.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police advised buyers to stick to official or reputable sellers, and ask to trade in person whenever possible.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday said Hong Kong is ready for an influx of tourists on New Year's Eve, with special border crossing and transport arrangements in place.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters before the weekly Executive Council meeting, Lee said the government will ensure visitors have a smooth journey home after enjoying the 12-minute fireworks display.
  <br>
  <br>
  On December 31, most MTR lines will run overnight, and the Shenzhen Bay port will operate around the clock. The Lo Wu checkpoint will be open until 2am, instead of closing at the usual time of midnight.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For the government, we will ensure that the whole arrangement for tourists to come to Hong Kong will be orderly, safe, and also it will be a pleasant experience, particularly when they go through the boundary control points," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CE added that Hong Kong has seen a 20 to 30 percent increase in tourists from Shenzhen during weekends since the resumption of unlimited entry visas, and the trend is likely to continue through Christmas and New Year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With the increase in the number of tourists coming to Hong Kong from different parts of the world, in particular those from Shenzhen, we have to ensure that first of all we will treat them nicely so that they all have a good experience and will think of coming back," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Lee said he will travel to Macau to attend the inauguration ceremony of the new term of the SAR government and congratulate Macau CE-elect Sam Hou-fai on taking office.
  <br>
  <br>
  President Xi Jinping will also be in Macau from Wednesday to Friday to attend celebrations marking the 25th anniversary of the SAR's return to the nation.

 Financial Secretary Paul Chan said on Monday that Hong Kong has to fully support its innovative industry, in order to contribute to the country's drive for the development of new quality productive forces.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at an awards ceremony for the Science and Technology Innovation Prize, Chan said the SAR has been making use of its advantage as an international financial centre to provide capital support for the innovative industry.
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted that in the past couple of years, the government has attracted more than 100 firms to the SAR specialising in areas such as artificial intelligence and big data, biotechnology, as well as new energy and materials.
  <br>
  <br>
  "These companies will invest more than HK$50 billion in total in the coming few years, creating more than 17,000 jobs, many of which are research and managerial roles," Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dennis Lo, who chairs the Hong Kong Alliance of Technology and Innovation which gives out the annual awards, said the Hetao tech zone development between the SAR and Shenzhen will become a major cooperation platform within the Greater Bay Area.
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted that the country and the SAR government are going full speed ahead with building Hong Kong as an international innovation and technology centre.
  <br>
  <br>
  The five laureates of the Science and Technology Innovation Prize this year are Chai Yang, associate dean of Polytechnic University's science faculty; Chinese University's medical school assistant dean Ng Siew-chien; mechanical and automation engineering professor Chen Shih-chi, also from Chinese University; along with City University's chemistry professor Zhang Hua and computer science scholar Wang Cong.

<img alt="Erick Tsang says the main purpose of the smart ballot box is to prevent votes that are filled out erroneously from becoming invalid. File photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1783700_1_20241216164317.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Monday sought to alleviate privacy concerns over the potential future use of smart ballot boxes that can detect invalid votes.
 <br>
  <br>
  Constitutional affairs minister Erick Tsang told lawmakers that officials are testing out the devices designed to help voters fill out ballot papers properly.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a Legco constitutional affairs panel meeting, the DAB's Chan Wing-kwong expressed concern over how the votes will remain confidential if the ballots are analysed by the smart boxes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Election Committee lawmaker Tang Fei said voters might feel embarrassed if they are informed they have made a mistake.
  <br>
  <br>
  Third Side lawmaker Tik Chi-yuen said ballot-checking might amount to election interference.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tsang said the idea of bringing in the smart boxes is to protect voters' rights in the event that they inadvertently fill out ballots incorrectly, for example if a voter fails to tick the 40 boxes required for Legco's Election Committee constituency.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are not trying to identify voters who have deliberately defaced the votes. When people are actually casting their ballot, there is no CCTV involved, and you don't have to produce your ID card. And there is absolutely no way for us to identify who you are," the minister said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So the privacy of voters is preserved. Our main purpose really is to reduce the situation where erroneously, voters tick the boxes leading to the vote becoming invalid."
  <br>
  <br>
  Tsang said similar technology worked well in two recent elections.
  <br>
  <br>
  The smart ballot box is included in proposed legal changes the government plans to table to the legislature by the end of March.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials have not decided in which elections the boxes can be used, with Tsang saying they might not be used in Legco polls next year.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A medical research team found that people with type 2 diabetes are more likely to get viral infections, emphasising the importance of keeping blood sugar levels under control for better health.
 <br>
  <br>
  Researchers from the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Hong Kong said on Monday they discovered a connection between high blood glucose levels and reduced immunity to viral infections in patients with type 2 diabetes.
  <br>
  <br>
  They analysed 40 blood samples from people with the condition at Queen Mary Hospital between 2022 and 2023, and found that Th1 cells, immune cells, from patients with poorly controlled diabetes had a significant 40 percent decrease in functionality compared with those from healthy individuals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dr Paul Lee, one of the researchers, said these patients need to improve their blood sugar management to help reduce the strain on healthcare systems during viral pandemics.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said it is important for these people to ask their clinicians what their glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) levels are, or what their average blood sugar levels should be.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They should first understand their glycaemic control, their diabetes control. [They should] know about their HbA1c level, in addition to having self-monitoring of their blood glucose, and to see whether their HbA1c level is already at target. If not, I think for those who are actually not very compliant to the medications, please adhere to the medications. And for those who are actually overweight, obese, try to optimise their body weight, improve their lifestyle, [have] more physical activity," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "These will all actually improve their sugar control. But of course, for those who have already done their best, they may have to discuss with their clinicians whether they need to add some more anti-diabetic agents to improve their HbA1c target."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee said the study paves the way for new treatment options aimed at enhancing the immunity of patients with type 2 diabetes.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Fire Services Department on Monday said it has conducted more than 8,200 inspections at around 1,000 old buildings across Hong Kong, following a blaze at a residential block in Jordan in April that left five people dead.
 <br>
  <br>
  The department said it issued more than 8,500 Fire Hazard Abatement Notices during the operation, and over 90 percent of these notices were complied with.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said most of the buildings checked were in Yau Tsim Mong, Sham Shui Po, Eastern District, and Central and Western District.
  <br>
  <br>
  Acting Deputy Chief Fire Officer Wong Yuk-ping said the department will set up a special duty team to look at improvements for high-risk buildings.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our goal is to reduce and ideally eliminate fire hazards. This is our ultimate objective," he told a press conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For the work of our special duty team, we will consolidate our data and put high-risk older composite buildings on our inspection list. We will target these high-risk buildings and ensure a risk-based approach."
  <br>
  <br>
  The department said safety issues it found in the various buildings included smoke doors being left open or broken, and escape routes being blocked.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said it carried out more than 350 prosecutions over buildings failing to comply with abatement notices.

    Time to review claw machine regulations: watchdog

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Consumer Council on Monday called for a review of claw machine regulations after seeing an increase in the number of complaints about the games.
 <br>
  <br>
  The council received 42 complaints about claw machines from January to November this year, three times more than during the same period last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Complainants alleged machine settings were manipulated, with pincers automatically loosening, and a minimum spend required in order to win a prize.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kenneth Chan, vice-chairman of the council's publicity and community relations committee, attributed the rise in complaints to the industry's growing popularity.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This market capitalises on the consumers' enthusiasm for testing their luck and attracts a dedicated clientele with a wide range of prizes. Because of the low operating costs and minimal entry barriers, these shops are getting more popular in Hong Kong," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  In one case, a customer spent HK$500 trying to grab a prize over a period of 45 minutes, but received a box of trinkets instead of the displayed waffle maker prize he wanted.
  <br>
  <br>
  Claw machines are not regulated under the Places of Public Entertainment Ordinance, which means operators do not need a licence to open a shop.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We believe it's about time, because of the popularity and also the growing concerns and issues that we found, it's about time to review whether we should regulate these kinds of claw machine businesses," said the council's chief executive Gilly Wong.

<div class="itemFullText">
 An enhanced interactive exhibition dedicated to the now-demolished Kowloon Walled City has moved from the airport to Kai Tak's airside mall, allowing visitors to fully immerse themselves in the movie sets from  "Twilight of the Warriors: Walled In".
 <br>
  <br>
  The second phase of the exhibition, which was inspired by the movie, opened on Monday and will run until April 13 of next year, featuring several new photo spots, hidden gems for photography, and dining and retail stalls, including the iconic char siu rice from the film.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at the kick-off ceremony, Deputy Financial Secretary Michael Wong said the exhibition's success at the airport demonstrated the strength of the SAR's movie tourism and local cultural exploration.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The film industry in Hong Kong has great potential, especially when you consider that many of the filmmakers involved, both directors and screenwriters, are very young. The achievements they've made are highly commendable and have garnered much attention. Many critics have also recognised them. This is what makes me the happiest," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "From the government's perspective, we will continue to work hard to support the industry. In recent years, we have allocated about HK$4 billion into the Film Development Fund."
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong added that an accompanying exhibition will be held at Kowloon Walled City Park, featuring a blend of both indoor and outdoor elements.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This exhibition is currently in the planning stages and also revolves around the 'Twilight of the Warriors: Walled In' theme. We are working hard to incorporate many different props. We hope to launch the exhibition in March or April of next year," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For now, I'll keep some details under wraps, but further information will be provided by our colleagues from the Leisure and Cultural Services Department and the Cultural and Creative Industries Development Agency."

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The governing body for lacrosse has said they will use the success of the Super Sixes tournament to develop star players in the SAR, ahead of the sport’s highly anticipated return to the 2028 Olympic Games.
 <br>
  <br>
  Japan took the top spot in the tournament held over the weekend after beating the Philippines, while the SAR squad finished fourth out of five participating teams. They fell just short of the podium after losing 21-9 to powerhouse Germany in the bronze medal bout.
  <br>
  <br>
  The head of the Hong Kong, China Lacrosse Association Raymond Fong on Sunday said the tournament’s success serves as a testament to the sport’s rising popularity in the region.
  <br>
  <br>
  "One thing that is becoming very obvious now is that everyone is improving. If you look at countries like the Philippines and China, compared to where they were last year – they've upped their game."
  <br>
  <br>
  He also said the results serve as motivation for the local squad to improve.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So for the Hong Kong team, it's not about just playing the game and maintaining the status quo – it's not the case anymore, and we have to be better and better."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lacrosse is set to make a comeback at the Los Angeles Olympics in 2028, the first time it will be featured at the world’s largest sporting event in over a century.
  <br>
  <br>
  The coach for the SAR's lacrosse squad, Chan Hon-kei, said the experience his team gained from the Super Sixes tournament was a stepping stone towards the possibility of competing at the Olympic level.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We have a lot of hope and expectation for this group to grow to be better, to compete in the world stage. So this tournament really gave us a chance to see the [level of play] that we can be at.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan added that despite the loss over the weekend, there are a lot of opportunities to develop good players in the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We started in the grassroots and with a lot of kids, usually starting them young from the age of five," Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They can learn all the skills they need, so when they grow up, they have all they need."

    Choose anti-dandruff shampoo carefully: watchdog

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Consumer Council on Monday urged people to choose anti-dandruff shampoo carefully, after finding EU-banned substances in some products on the market.
 <br>
  <br>
  The watchdog tested 25 anti-dandruff models and found that four contained zinc pyrithione (ZPT), which is banned in the European Union due to the potential harm to unborn children.
  <br>
  <br>
  The four brands are HAIR CORNER, Petal Fresh Pure, CLEAR and Philip B.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gilly Wong, the council’s chief executive, said consumers should identify the root cause of dandruff before buying products.
  <br>
  <br>
  “When you have dandruff, you have to identify probably what is the reason. Is [your scalp] too oily, or maybe too dry, or other reasons? This is something as a first screening about yourself,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “But on the other hand, if you have this problem for quite a bit of time, it's much better for you to seek medical advice before you continue to try on different products.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Over 90 percent of shampoo products also contained fragrance allergens, with two containing the EU-banned chemical BMHCA which can adversely affect both male and female fertility.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the watchdog said some products were not labelled at all or only included some fragrance allergens.
  <br>
  <br>
  The council urged manufacturers to review their formulas and improve labelling transparency.

    HA has 'zero-tolerance' over threats against staff

<img alt="The Hospital Authority says it is providing therapeutic support to its staff as well as improving protective equipment and attire. Photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1783651_1_20241216111256.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hospital Authority has reiterated its zero tolerance policy on workplace violence, including threatening staff and physical - or even verbal - abuse from patients.
 <br>
  <br>
  Dr Tung Chi-kwong, the authority's Workplace Violence Subject Officer of the New Territories West Cluster, told RTHK that cases of violence against staff fluctuated over the years.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the authority hoped to minimise such incidents by appealing to the public for a greater understanding of the issues facing its staff, and to create a culture of mutual respect in the workplace.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think this is a very valuable occasion for us to actually plead to public members that we will try to induce a mutual-respect culture in the workplace, and then hopefully it will improve communications and new ways to kind of de-escalate the tension," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The authority said cases of violence were often related to a patient's expectations not being met, such as long waiting times, or issues with the treatment plan.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said it was talking to frontline staff about their specific needs or the kinds of high-risk situations they faced, so it could provide tailor-made solutions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For example, we have been improving our designs of a forearm protector because one of the common injuries faced by our staff is when they have been doing some sort of routine nursing measures, like feeding or injection and so on. When our patients are in an abnormal mental state, they may consider the approach as threatening and sometimes they may have bitten or scratched our staff," said Dr Tung.
  <br>
  <br>
  The authority said certain departments were more prone to violence, including psychiatry, geriatrics as well as the emergency room.
  <br>
  <br>
  Training was being given to staff from these departments, including break-away techniques to learn how to escape from dangerous situations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Certain cases were also referred to the police, and the conviction rate was as high as 90 percent, the authority added.

    Beware of plasticisers in desk mats: Consumer Council
   </title>

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Consumer Council on Monday said that some desk mats commonly used as table protectors contain chemicals that can affect fertility or growth.
 <br>
  <br>
  Among 15 desk mats it tested, seven contained four plasticisers listed as reproductive toxicants exceeding a European Union limit.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the worst example, plasticisers in a desk mat by Qivation surpassed the EU limit by 222 times.
  <br>
  <br>
  The product has been referred to the Customs and Excise Department.
  <br>
  <br>
  The council also revealed that nine desk mats contain three other plasticisers that can affect children's livers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Although people are unlikely to absorb plasticisers through their skin, they are at risk if they have a cut, or put on sunscreen or oil-soluble moisturising products after touching the mats, the council said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gilly Wong, chief executive of the watchdog, urged the public not to use desk mats as place mats when they eat.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Reason being is obviously the ingredients that they used [in desk mats] may not be at the food grade, so it's much better to segregate the usage," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When you select the product, you have to make it clear about the purpose of that product. So that you can make use of it, the function of it properly."
  <br>
  <br>
  The public should also wash their hands immediately after using the desk mats in other circumstances, she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong also called on manufacturers to be careful about what ingredients they use in products.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They have to choose those that can safeguard the health of consumers and manufacture it with a very high quality control in order to produce products that shouldn't have harmful substances for consumers," she said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A charity operating in the Eastern District is hoping to involve more ethnic minorities in community activities in the area.
 <br>
  <br>
  Emily Yeung, an assistant social work officer at the Methodist Epworth Village Community Centre, Social Welfare, says many non-Chinese senior citizens live in Eastern District.
  <br>
  <br>
  But she told RTHK that a lot of them tend to stay at home and do not attend community events because of fear of not being able to communicate with others.
  <br>
  <br>
  This year, the community centre is one of 11 beneficiaries of the Operation Santa Claus (OSC) charity drive.
  <br>
  <br>
  The charity was founded in 1963.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeung said with funding support from OSC, the charity will expand its “Narrating Life Stories - Supportive Project for Ethnic Minority Elders”, which trains volunteers to listen to the stories of ethnic minority elders.
  <br>
  <br>
  “With our project, we have welfare assistants that they can speak in their languages so that the elders can know the programme, what is going on, and they can have someone to share with as well,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jointly organised by RTHK and South China Morning Post, OSC funds charitable projects that focus on children and youth, the elderly, the community, those with physical and mental disabilities, medical projects, and those concerning the environment.

 Chief Executive John Lee greeted members of the public in Central and Wan Chai on Sunday evening, a day after concluding his duty visit to Beijing.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A woman has been bailed after she allegedly stole a sculpted model panda from a Kwun Tong public display on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Police said the 37-year-old was arrested in Sau Mau Ping on Saturday. She will have to report to police later this month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police said they were called in after a security guard noticed that the model panda, valued at HK$100, had gone missing.
  <br>
  <br>
  The model was part of an Urban Renewal Authority (URA) Christmas Celebration at Yue Man Square called 'Winter Transform'. It includes 80 giant panda installations, which range in height from half-a-metre to 3 metres.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police also said another model panda had disappeared last Monday but that the case was not classified as theft.
  <br>
  <br>
  In announcing the display earlier this month, the URA said it features an industrial style panda and an astronaut panda - symbolising Kwun Tong's transformation from an industrial area to a modernised commercial centre.
  <br>
  <br>
  The URA said, after Christmas, the pandas would be displayed in festive Chinese New Year attire.

    More and more fancy a shot at joining the police

 Police say more and more young people are now interested in joining the force and it aims to recruit another 400 officers and 80 inspectors in the next few months.
 <br>
  <br>
  With almost 6,000 vacancies across various departments, the force held a recruitment day on Sunday, giving people a taste of what it feels to like to wear the uniform, and even fire a gun.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have set up a mock firearm experience station so participants can experience the shock of a pistol firing a bullet, and also see how police constables receive weapons training," Senior Superintendent Mike Kwok told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We also set up a booth that consists of AI police uniforms, where participants can try on different police attire and take photos."
  <br>
  <br>
  Almost 1,300 people attended the event, with 400 submitting applications on the spot, the force said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kwok said more than 9,000 applications for officer and inspector roles were received between April 1 and November 30, a 5.4 percent increase on the same period last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Around 600 new officers were taken on, along with about 120 probationary inspectors.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We see more and more young people being interested in police work," Kwok said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked whether a relaxation in eligibility requirements from May 2023 contributed to the increase in applications, Kwok said the force is trying to "snatch talent".
  <br>
  <br>
  "We hope our market competitiveness will suit societal demands. Of course we would want as much applicants as possible. But I think the increase was mainly due to people being interested in the job as we have held a lot of recruitment activities in local and mainland universities," he said.

    'Lack of awareness leading to migrant worker abuse'

<img alt="Domestic worker groups say some helpers are only being paid HK$1,000 per month. Photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1783564_2_20241215165703.jpg&q=65">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Domestic worker groups on Sunday warned that a lack of knowledge on rights and legal protections is leading to some helpers being abused in Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong Federation of Asian Domestic Workers Unions (FADWU) and the Union of Nepalese Domestic Workers in Hong Kong (UNDW) said that in the past two years, they received eight complaints from South Asian workers who had been severely underpaid.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sarah Pun, an executive member of FADWU and vice-chairwoman of UNDW, said many workers are only being paid HK$1,000 to HK$4,000 per month, when the minimum wage is HK$4,990.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[Some of] the workers in Hong Kong don't know any rights of what is their proper salary and what is their contract salary, so some employers take advantage," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our South Asian [domestic workers], don't have an agent in Hong Kong. The broker will tell them to come to Hong Kong because all those who want to come to Hong Kong, they also want to earn the money for themselves to support the family.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They do some agreement, I think, with some amount, but they will not tell the worker the proper amount of the contract salary. So, they will just tell them that the only important thing is the job."
  <br>
  <br>
  A Nepali woman who turned to the groups for help told reporters that she was not paid her full salary, had her passport confiscated by her employer, and suffered constant mental and physical abuse.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They did not provide me proper food. They did not provide me a room, no bed. I had to sleep on a [sofa]. They did not give me any rest days. There were no fixed working hours. I had to work 24 hours. That was what I was told," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They always found fault in my work and they were always complaining. They used to scold me with foul language and assault me."
  <br>
  <br>
  Pun said the government should arrange mandatory training for both incoming helpers and employers, to increase awareness of responsibilities and fair wages.
  <br>
  <br>
  She added that the authorities should ensure that migrant domestic workers are aware of their rights and how to seek justice in the case of violations.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Sunday urged Hongkongers to "team up for a brighter future" as he invited people to put forward suggestions for his next budget.
 <br>
  <br>
  A consultation exercise ahead of the blueprint expected in February got underway on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  It comes after the government doubled its estimated deficit for the current financial year to around HK$100 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  In his weekly blog, Chan said the government has to carefully manage public finances as the global outlook remains gloomy and the city is undergoing economic transformation. But he added that accelerating the city's economic development is of equal importance.
  <br>
  <br>
  "During this period, development is core and stability is the key. The administration has been seeking to expand into new markets and strengthen its position in technological innovation. Results of this are now beginning to flow through," he wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Let's make wise use of resources, and team up for a brighter future," he added, in a promotional video on the budget consultation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Chan said the city's market sentiment has been improving, with the central government continuously rolling out measures to support Hong Kong, including bringing back unlimited entry visas for Shenzhen residents.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 130,000 mainlanders visited the SAR last weekend, Chan said, adding that this was a 15 percent increase on the average number in November.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the number of innovative technology start-ups in the city is continuing to grow and a lot of enterprise founders from across the world agree that Hong Kong has a unique advantage in innovation and technology development.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Foreign companies are confident towards Hong Kong. The government's efforts overseas in promoting the city's advantage and telling real Hong Kong stories are yielding positive impacts," he wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Challenges are inevitable in each development stage, but we have to focus on greater opportunities and prospects. According to our past experiences, Hong Kong remains strong despite highs and lows, and we will continue to make steps forward in new developments and reach newer heights," he added.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The head of the government's investment vehicle on Sunday said the corporation will take on more projects and expand strategic partnerships next year to boost Hong Kong's economy and competitiveness.
 <br>
  <br>
  Clara Chan, CEO of Hong Kong Investment Corporation, told a radio programme that she will reach out to overseas companies that have cutting-edge technology and research capabilities.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wholly owned by the government, the corporation's mission is to attract foreign talent and businesses to the SAR while helping successful local brands expand globally, Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We need to make sure every dollar we invest creates the most value for Hong Kong. When evaluating potential investments, we look at two key things that align with our dual mission," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "First, we examine if the business meets our financial and operational requirements. Second, we evaluate their contributions and commitments to Hong Kong, including how they benefit the economy and the public."
  <br>
  <br>
  The new energy industry is showing great potential and the corporation is helping companies in the field tap into Southeast Asian markets, Chan added.
  <br>
  <br>
  She also said the companies they have invested in are doing better than expected, including an AI research centre at the University of Science and Technology which has attracted internationally renowned scholars.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Temperatures struggled to reach 15 degrees Celsius across much of the city on Sunday morning, as the observatory warned of the coldest day so far this winter.
 <br>
  <br>
  A low of 13 degrees was recorded at the forecasters' headquarters in Tsim Sha Tsui.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was even colder in parts of the New Territories, the observatory said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A strong northeast monsoon will affect the coast of southern China today. Since it will be windy, wind chill effect will be particularly significant on high ground and exposed areas. People are advised to be aware of the change in weather and keep warm when engaging in outdoor activities," it warned.
  <br>
  <br>
  The observatory added that daytime temperatures are expected to rise this week, but mornings will still be cool.

 The SAR's footballers on Saturday evening clinched a 2-1 victory over Chinese Taipei in the final Group B match of the East Asia Football Federation (EAFF) E-1 Football Championship preliminary competition at Mong Kok Stadium.
 <br>
  <br>
  Star striker Matt Orr scored for the SAR team before half-time, while defender Tsui Wang Kit scored the winning goal in the second half.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was their fifth consecutive victory under new coach Ashley Westwood.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong, China, will play Guam in the final. Guam had earlier defeated Macau 2-1 in a Group A game on Saturday afternoon. The two will square off on December 17 at Hong Kong Stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  The winner will advance to the tournament in South Korea next summer to play against the hosts, Japan, and the national team.
  <br>
  <br>
  Those three teams automatically qualify for the final round of the competition.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Some football fans from Hong Kong and Macau were left disgruntled over arrangements for a competition held at the Kai Tak Youth Sports Ground.
 <br>
  <br>
  An East Asian Football Federation Championship (EAFF) qualifier between Macau and Guam was held at the sports ground on Saturday, but the Football Association of Hong Kong, China announced a change the night before that meant registration would not be available onsite, and fans would need to reserve a ticket online.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We expected around 1,000 spectators to come and watch the match. In order to have better crowd control, it was decided by various stakeholders to implement online registration before the match. Registered individuals can collect the physical ticket at the gate," it posted online.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We understand that the arrangements were not ideal but this tournament needs to balance the requirements of and concerns from all government officials. We apologise for any inconvenience caused."
  <br>
  <br>
  Two fans from Macau said they were here to support the SAR's team.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We hope they can improve the arrangements. Even if we have to buy tickets, it's fine, but they should notify us earlier," they told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another local fan said the arrangement was unreasonable, but he wanted to have a look at the new venue.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They just announced a day earlier, at about 5 pm, and we had to reserve a ticket at 6 pm. Not everyone monitors the association's social media for ticketing," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The association said 400 tickets were distributed online, with the rest sent to local organisations, schools, and participating teams.
  <br>
  <br>
  A man said many fans were disappointed about the arrangement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If they require fans to register online, then they should do it at least two to three days in advance, and also specify the quota," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I only found out there were just 400 tickets distributed after I submitted the online form."
  <br>
  <br>
  Guam beat Macau 2-1, and will play in the final at the Hong Kong Stadium next Tuesday.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Secretary for Health Lo Chung-mau has elaborated on the plan to reform the healthcare system due to population and demographic changes - specifically boosting health management efficiency.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Health Bureau earlier pointed out that even though the overall population in the SAR will increase in 2041, that's not the case for Hong Kong Island, which might drop slightly.
  <br>
  <br>
  One of the key components of the plan, is the merging of Hong Kong East and West hospital clusters, which the health chief said would improve efficiency.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking after an RTHK radio programme on Saturday, Lo said the move aims to utilise resources.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're looking at merging the Hong Kong East and West clusters to co-care for 1.2 million people on Hong Kong Island. This will improve management and administration efficiency," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In terms of medical services, it will allow the two to have a strong collaboration through increased cooperation in terms of training and service."
  <br>
  <br>
  He emphasised that services offered by Eastern Hospital would remain unchanged.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the bureau is also looking into adjusting public hospital charges.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lo revealed that critical and emergency patients might be charged less, noting that the government is responsible for them.
  <br>
  <br>
  As for semi and non urgent patients, he said the authority will offer more a precise subsidy for them.

<div class="itemFullText">
 People flocked to Victoria Park to enjoy one of Hong Kong's largest outdoor fairs.
 <br>
  <br>
  Organised by the Chinese Manufacturers’ Association, the Brands and Products Expo opened on Saturday and will run until January 6.
  <br>
  <br>
  This year's event saw 900 booths set up, with some offering discounts, including HK$1 special deals.
  <br>
  <br>
  A woman said she had not been to the fair for many years, and this time, she bought a bag of medicinal herbs.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's a steal. I didn't line up for too long. You can't imagine how happy I am because I got so many things for just HK$1. It would originally cost at least HK$100," she told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another woman said she arrived at the venue four hours early to make sure she got what she was looking for.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Abalones and fish maw. I will make soup and other delicious dishes. It's almost new year and also the winter solstice," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Financial Secretary Paul Chan also visited the expo, and bought soup packs, shiitake mushrooms, dried shrimps and egg rolls.
  <br>
  <br>
  The association's chairman Wingco Lo said Hong Kong's retail market had been facing various challenges, but with the festive atmosphere and the resumption of the multi-entry visas for Shenzhen residents, he's confident with the sales from the fair.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Saturday wrapped up his four-day duty visit to Beijing, making a last stop at the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security in the capital before returning home.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lee, alongside Chief Secretary Eric Chan who arrived in Beijing on Friday, met Wang Xiaoping, the minister of human resources and social security, as well as other mainland officials.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to a government statement, the two sides exchanged views on issues such as the integrated development of education, scientific and technological innovation, and building the SAR into an international hub for high-calibre talent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee reported to the minister that the idea of the committee came from President Xi Jinping, who “pointed out that education development, scientific and technological innovation, and talent cultivation should be promoted as an integrated effort”.
  <br>
  <br>
  “He said he hopes that the [Hong Kong] SAR government can create joint forces with the ministry in serving the country’s workforce development strategy and make greater contributions to building a great country in all respects through Chinese modernisation,” the statement read.
  <br>
  <br>
  For his part, the chief secretary, who chairs the committee, said the group would leverage Hong Kong’s strategic positioning and advantages in its work.
  <br>
  <br>
  The committee held its first meeting on Friday and agreed to review and improve existing schemes on attracting high-performing individuals.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ocean Park chairman Paulo Pong said the debut of pandas An An and Ke Ke have boosted the atmosphere at the park, and he expects the facility to see more visitors during festive holidays.
 <br>
  <br>
  The two pandas gifted by the central government earlier made their first appearance to the public, and Pong said tourists from both home and abroad have been lining up to spend time with the animals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a television programme on Saturday, the chairman said the park was ready for a visitor boom in the coming months.
  <br>
  <br>
  "December is always a peak. We normally expect more visitors during Christmas and Chinese New Year, and now people are eagerly looking forward to visiting the giant pandas. We know they're going to visit the park during these festivals, he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pong said Ying Ying's baby twins are expected to greet visitors during the Chinese New Year holiday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked whether visitors would have to pay extra to see the twins, Pong said he had not considered it yet, but stressed that ticketing is integral for Ocean Park's income.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Ocean Park Water World has been closed for a seasonal break this winter, instead of keeping its doors open all year round as usual.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pong said this allowed better allocation of manpower, so that more staff could help out at Ocean Park when the Water World was having a slack season.

    'HK can expand its market in developing EV'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The transformation into green transportation is a new opportunity for Hong Kong to expand its market in developing electric vehicles.
 <br>
  <br>
  That's according to Secretary for Environment and Ecology, Tse Chin-wan, who told a radio programme that while many countries and regions are promoting green transportation, not many places have double-decker buses.
  <br>
  <br>
  The authorities earlier announced a green transformation roadmap of public buses and taxis, with plans to subsidise the purchase of electric buses and taxis.
  <br>
  <br>
  The environment chief stressed that it's worth investing as Hong Kong can make use of the advantage and expand its market in the technology that's involved.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This green transformation actually provides opportunities under the establishment of a new economy... If we use subsidies to help double-decker buses develop the technology, we can grasp the opportunity," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong is an international city and we can set an example for other places."
  <br>
  <br>
  The government shelved the pay-as-you-throw scheme earlier this year, and though some green groups say the scheme should still be rolled out at some point, Tse noted that the authorities would continue to promote waste reduction and recycling rates.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that there are different means to do so, but the ultimate aim is to establish a green-focused culture in society.

    Hong Kong to welcome 45 million travellers by year-end

<div class="itemFullText">
 The newly appointed Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism expects Hong Kong to see 45 million visitor arrivals by the end of 2024.
 <br>
  <br>
  The government earlier estimated that the region would welcome 46 million tourists by year-end.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a Commercial Radio programme, Rosanna Law pointed out that the tourism sector has been doing quite well recently.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said that during the first 11 months of the year, the SAR rolled out the red carpet for around 41 million travellers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Since the resumption of the multi-entry visa scheme [for Shenzhen residents], daily visitor numbers have been between 7 to 8 percent higher than the average for November," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Especially on weekends, average figures have increased by 30 percent, year-on-year."
  <br>
  <br>
  Law, who said she felt "a great responsibility" in her new role, emphasised that various industries should make good use of the benefitting measures offered by the central government.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the secretary also assured travellers that the government has already geared up for New Year's Eve celebrations, to ensure that mainland visitors have a smooth journey back home.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government had earlier announced that opening hours of border crossings will be extended that day, and most MTR lines will run overnight.

    Xi briefed on plans to achieve HK fiscal balance: CE

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Friday said he detailed to President Xi Jinping strategies to achieve fiscal balance "in three to five years", after the SAR government warned the deficit would balloon to around HK$100 billion for the current financial year.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lee, who was received by the president on the third day of his duty visit to Beijing, added the administration will aim to develop new growth points and grasp the opportunities provided by the mainland.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters after the meeting, the CE was asked if the president was concerned by the SAR government's fiscal situation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I have explained the strategies that we will be adopting to ensure that we will eventually make a balanced budget. That may take a few years," Lee replied.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said one way to strengthen the city's economy would be "expanding outside" to markets like Asean and the Middle East, or even Latin America and central Asia.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the nation still offers "the biggest opportunities" for Hong Kong, Lee stressed, and that it's up to the SAR to capitalise on them.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee revealed he and the president also discussed safeguarding national security, raising the level of governance, boosting development momentum, and improving people's livelihood.
  <br>
  <br>
  During a brief photo call at the start of the closed-door meeting, Xi had affirmed Lee's work and hailed his administration for completing the "historic legislation" of Basic Law Article 23.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think that recognition speaks for itself. I am a believer of there is never the best, only the better. That is also the doctrine advocated by President Xi. In this area, we see things in the same angle," Lee said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And I have been making reports to him as to how I can create extra synergy, new development, and also create economic growth for Hong Kong."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee and Chief Secretary Eric Chan will meet officials from the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security in Beijing on Saturday, before returning to the SAR on the same day.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee hoped the exchange would provide insight to a recently established SAR committee on education, technology and talents.
  <br>
  <br>
  The group, announced in his policy address, is chaired by the chief secretary.

    Stiffer penalties mooted for major illegal structures

<img alt="The government is proposing tougher penalties for serious illegal structures, while offering leniency for smaller works such as oversized drying racks. File photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1783391_1_20241213191930.jpg&q=40">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government announced on Friday a two-fold proposal to handle unauthorised building works, with those convicted of serious breaches facing a maximum jail term of two years and a HK$2 million fine.
 <br>
  <br>
  While stiffer penalties could be introduced for serious contraventions of the Buildings Ordinance, authorities are also rolling out a leniency scheme for minor unlawful works deemed to be low risk.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Development Bureau conducted a review of the existing regulations following a spate of incidents where chunks of concrete fell off the exterior facade of ageing buildings.
  <br>
  <br>
  There was also public concern after a landslide exposed unauthorised structures at multiple Redhill Peninsula villas last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under the proposed amendments to the Buildings Ordinance, those who ignore removal orders for "serious unauthorised works", such as an illegal basement, could be jailed for two years, double the current ceiling.
  <br>
  <br>
  The maximum fine would also be raised by 50 percent to HK$300,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  Owners, building professionals or contractors who erect structures without government approval face a HK$2 million fine, up from HK$400,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bureau is also proposing to lower the prosecution threshold, such that proceedings could be initiated even when the person concerned doesn't "knowingly" begin construction without permission.
  <br>
  <br>
  People who inherit illegal structures from the previous owner could still be prosecuted, if they didn't remove them within a certain time frame after the new law is passed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Relatively minor additions, including retractable awnings and outdoor signboards fixed to the floor, could be performed without prior approval in the future so long as the structures fit the prescribed size and height.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials also plan to relax requirements for drying racks for clothes and air conditioner support frames.
  <br>
  <br>
  There will be a three-year grace period for owners to have minor structures inspected by a certified professional. Structures which are approved can be kept.
  <br>
  <br>
  A bureau spokeswoman said the policy is aimed at minimising nuisance to the public. But the bureau was also aware of opinions that existing laws are not deterrent enough for serious breaches.
  <br>
  <br>
  "After all, our resources are limited. So we want to focus our law enforcement efforts on the most serious cases, tackling the bigger illegal structures," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities are also proposing a fixed penalty of HK$6,000 for owners who ignore statutory building inspection notices, which are served to premises aged 30 years or above.
  <br>
  <br>
  A two-month public consultation on the proposal will begin later this month, and the amendment bill could be tabled to the legislature in the first half of 2026.

<img alt="Lau Siu-kai says President Xi Jinping showed his affirmation and appreciation towards Chief Executive John Lee and his administration. File photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1783388_1_20241213183923.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A senior member of a leading national think tank on Friday said Hong Kong needs more long-term planning in connecting its development strategy with that of the mainland.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lau Siu-kai, a consultant to the Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macau Studies, said President Xi Jinping showed affirmation and appreciation towards Chief Executive John Lee and his administration during their exchanges in Beijing on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The consultant said Lee was awarded with a high evaluation due to the SAR completing national security legislation under Article 23 of the Basic Law earlier this year, and its efforts in building ties with different countries and regions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think particularly [President Xi is] concerned about Hong Kong's international development space, which has been, to a certain extent, shrunk by the United States and the West," Lau told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That's why President Xi must be happy to see John Lee and his government trying to develop, or to enlarge, Hong Kong's international economic space by developing closer relationships with countries in the Belt and Road Initiative."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lau said President Xi was optimistic on Hong Kong's economy, and he expects "reform" and "innovation" to be the major principles for the city's future governance.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he stressed that it would require long-term planning so that Hong Kong could connect its development strategy with that of the mainland's.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chief Secretary Eric Chan also departed for Beijing to join the chief executive in meeting with relevant ministries in the capital.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lau said President Xi may want Hong Kong to boost its inter-departmental cooperation and also work with the central government to tackle external threats as US President-elect Donald Trump takes office next month.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That might involve a bigger impact on Hong Kong, and may also involve Hong Kong cooperating with the central authorities so that we can jointly handle the threats coming from Trump and his new administration," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  With Lee meeting leaders from universities in Beijing, Lau said Hong Kong has to strengthen its exchanges with mainland universities to further enable the city to serve as an educational hub.

<img alt="The CE thanked President Xi and the central government for their continued support of Hong Kong." src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1783377_2_20241213174844.jpg&q=80">

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping has praised Chief Executive John Lee for implementing the city’s domestic national security law and shoring up the global influence of Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  President Xi, who received Lee on Friday during the third day of his duty visit to Beijing, also said the central government fully recognised the work of the administration.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Over the past year, you have led the SAR government to be responsible and pragmatic in completing the historic legislation of Article 23 of the Basic Law, focusing on economic development and promoting solutions to people’s livelihood issues such as housing and healthcare,” Xi said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “You have strengthened external exchanges and cooperation, which not only enhanced the international influence [of Hong Kong], but also further consolidated the great momentum of Hong Kong’s stable development. The central government fully affirms your work and that of the SAR government.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The president also said central authorities fully support the SAR government in leading Hong Kong to seek reforms and make greater contributions to the city’s prosperity and stability.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee thanked Xi for his continued care and support for Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  “This year marks the halfway point of the term for the current government. It is a critical period for leading Hong Kong to move forward, and to inherit the past and usher in the future. It is also an important moment to make great contributions to the building of a great country through Chinese modernisation,” Lee said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong has seen results in different areas over the past two and half years, Lee said, with global rankings of the city reflecting the confidence in the SAR and proving that the policy direction is correct.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among the senior leaders at the meeting were Premier Li Qiang; Vice Premier Ding Xuexiang; and Cai Qi, director of the central committee’s general office.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xia Baolong, director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, and liaison office chief Zheng Yanxiong were also present.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Friday proposed amendments to road traffic regulations to improve road safety and keep up with new technology.
 <br>
  <br>
  Among the changes is requiring electric vehicles to have acoustic warning systems to alert pedestrians. Private cars will also need to use child restraining devices, while vehicles with extendable aerial structures must have over-height warning systems installed.
  <br>
  <br>
  The proposals also include allowing remote control parking features and camera-monitor systems as alternatives to traditional mirrors. Electric commercial vehicles will also be permitted to use expressways without special permits under the new rules.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, a Transport and Logistics Bureau spokesman said the government will continue updating regulations as needed to keep pace with evolving technologies and international standards.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We aim to create a safer and more convenient road environment for road users in Hong Kong through optimising vehicle design and construction standards with the amendment regulations," the statement read.
  <br>
  <br>
  The amendments will be tabled to the Legislative Council next Wednesday for negative vetting.

    Communication vital when medical incidents occur: HA

<img alt="The Hospital Authority says good communication procedures are essential when handling crises and reporting incidents. File photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1783350_1_20241213155420.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hospital Authority (HA) said training its spokespersons on how to communicate with the public and family members after medical incidents occur is necessary.
 <br>
  <br>
  This recommendation of setting up a spokesperson preparedness programme comes from a review committee tasked with improving the authority’s management, which put forward various suggestions last month.
  <br>
  <br>
  The administration had earlier ordered the authority to review its management following a spate of medical blunders.
  <br>
  <br>
  Secretary for Health Lo Chung-mau told a Legco panel meeting on Friday that it’s impossible to avoid medical incidents entirely, highlighting the incident rate in Hong Kong is much lower than in other advanced healthcare systems.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tony Ko, the authority’s chief executive, added that proper communication to avoid misunderstanding is more important.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We must understand that adverse clinical outcomes do happen. That is the same everywhere. The point is to communicate the incident well to the public, the family members and our internal staff members to be transparent,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “On this, we think training is needed. Most of the time, we focus our training on medical training. So there's room for improvements in terms of communication skills. That's why we will follow up on this recommendation seriously.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Among the other recommendations put forward by the review committee is for a high-level reform committee, which will be formed and led by the HA’s chairman Henry Fan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Several lawmakers asked the HA for a clear timeline on the committee's formation and whether legislators could get involved.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ko said the HA has begun its work on this issue, noting that no more details can be given at the moment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liberal Party lawmaker Peter Shiu, who's also a former Eastern District Council member, expressed concern about the authority’s plan to merge the Western and Eastern Hong Kong Island hospital clusters, saying he’s heard people worry that some hospitals would be shut down after the integration.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lo assured the legislator that hospital services will remain unaffected, noting the cluster is designed to cater to the population distribution.
  <br>
  <br>
  “In 2041, there should be 8.5 million people in Hong Kong. A cluster would serve one-seventh of the population. So I think that is necessary for us to review and make adjustment. By integrating the two clusters, the Eastern Hospital services will not be affected. There could even be improvement because upon integration, the management and administrative efficiency will be enhanced,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The panel’s chair Chan Hoi-yan, for her part, raised concerns over the rising expenditure of the HA, noting the authority will receive over HK$95 billion in subsidies this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  In response, Lo mentioned that healthcare expenditures make up only 3.9 percent of the SAR’s GDP, which is quite low by global standards.
  <br>
  <br>
  The health minister said Hong Kong is well-known for the cost-effectiveness of its healthcare system, but also noted that an ageing population and implementation of new healthcare technologies are putting a strain on finances.

    Govt urged to subsidise installation of taxi cameras

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government has been urged to subsidise taxi drivers to help them install surveillance cameras while providing more education for cabbies struggling to adapt to new electronic payment systems.
 <br>
  <br>
  This follows a legislative proposal to require taxi drivers to install CCTV cameras in their vehicles by the end of 2026, and implement electronic payment methods by late 2025.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a Legco panel on Friday, newly appointed transport minister Mable Chan said the proposal had been well-received by the public and the taxi trade.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are proposing a win-win situation for passengers, taxi drivers as well as the entire taxi trade. We will be able to enable all passengers to have a better travelling experience with these systems. We will also be able to increase the deterrent effect for the black sheep in the trade," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, Ryan Wong who chairs the Hong Kong Taxi Council, said he’s worried about rising operational costs and urged the government to consider subsidising CCTV camera installations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong said while the industry generally welcomes introducing e-payment means, some taxi drivers may not be familiar with digital platforms.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Some drivers may not be very familiar with using these platforms, which is a bit worrying. But we believe that through education and even workshops to provide information, this problem can be solved," he told reporters before the panel meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  Transport sector lawmaker Frankie Yick said he doesn't think privacy is an issue as the government has implemented a system in which camera footage can only be accessed by authorised personnel.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If you look at all other public transport in Hong Kong, they already have a CCTV camera there. So I think you have to remember, even within the taxi cab, it's not a totally private place. It's semi-private. So I think the most important thing is to make sure the passengers are aware that the CCTV system is on," he said.

 Acting Chief Executive Eric Chan, along with other senior government officials, members from the legislative and executive councils on Friday paid tribute to the more than 300,000 victims of the Nanjing Massacre between 1937 and 1938.
 <br>
  <br>
  During the ceremony at the Central Government Offices in Admiralty, the national anthem was played before a two-minute moment of silence was observed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan then laid a wreath for the victims and led participants to sign the memorial book.
  <br>
  <br>
  This year marked the 11th National Memorial Day for the Nanjing Massacre.
  <br>
  <br>
  Representatives of the Central People's Government offices in the SAR, vice-chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference CY Leung, and former chief executive Donald Tsang were among those who attended the commemoration.

 The West Kowloon Cultural District is bringing the holiday spirit to life with the opening of its Christmas Market, which is set to run until December 29.
 <br>
  <br>
  The market features around 30 specialty stalls selling a wide variety of festive treats, drinks and holiday gifts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jenny, a visitor to the market, said she’s enjoying the bustling atmosphere.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's been a while since it's been this lively," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Victoria, a student from Germany, said she loves the live music performances.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's really nice because it makes for a good atmosphere, you can just sit and talk to your friends."
  <br>
  <br>
  Stall owners at the market, meanwhile, said they hope the event will attract large crowds and thus boost their sales.

 The government said it has submitted requests to extend the service hours at two border checkpoints on New Year’s Eve, and are awaiting approval from the mainland authorities.
 <br>
  <br>
  The requests include overnight service at the Shenzhen Bay port and extended hours at the Lo Wu checkpoint until 2am from the current 12am.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge and Huanggang checkpoints will operate round the clock as usual.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government’s inter-departmental working group on festival arrangements held a meeting on Thursday ahead of the upcoming festive period.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chief Secretary Eric Chan, who chairs the group, said he expects a significant influx of visitors during New Year's Eve and New Year's Day.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said SAR officials will do all they can to facilitate tourist flow and ensure smooth operations at the various border checkpoints.

 Cathay Group announced on Thursday that additional flights and destinations will be introduced in the upcoming year, as part of its two-year rebuilding plan.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, the group said Cathay Pacific and its sister airline, HK Express, will return to 100 percent pre-pandemic capacity by January.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 FTU lawmaker Bill Tang on Thursday said he hopes students here can learn more about the Nanjing Massacre, so that they will cherish peace and contribute to the country’s development.
 <br>
  <br>
  The legislator paid a visit to United Christian College in Kwun Tong and spoke to around 900 students a day ahead of the 87th anniversary of the historical event.
  <br>
  <br>
  When Japanese troops captured the city of Nanjing on December 13, 1937, they killed more than 300,000 Chinese civilians and unarmed soldiers over the next six weeks in one of the most barbaric episodes of the Second World War.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to RTHK after the sharing session, Tang said the prerequisite to patriotism is a strong understanding of the country, including its history, culture, societal development, as well as economic and technological advances.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The more you learn, the more love you will feel for the country. Regardless of whether the country is thriving or facing challenges, we will always be proud of being a Chinese,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tang added that he hopes students can understand why China places a strong emphasis on development and strives to “stand strong”, in face of the painful past.
  <br>
  <br>
  A form five student said she’s gained a deeper understanding of what the Chinese people had experienced in the past, while another said he’s come to appreciate the importance of peace and stability.
  <br>
  <br>
  A Chinese History teacher at the school, meanwhile, said the sharing session has helped students better understand the country’s past and strengthened their national identity.

    Plaza Hollywood cinema likely to close on Friday

<img alt="Many people said they have fond memories of the cinema in Plaza Hollywood. Photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1783222_1_20241212190641.jpg&q=60">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A cinema in Diamond Hill will likely cease operations on Friday, potentially becoming the seventh movie theatre to close this year.
 <br>
  <br>
  Even though the MCL branch at Plaza Hollywood hasn’t made an official announcement yet, the cinema has suspended ticket-selling on its website and its ticket counters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Spanning 38,000 square feet, the cinema has six halls with a total capacity of almost 1,600 seats.
  <br>
  <br>
  While staff members at the cinema refused to comment on the reported closure, they conceded that "operation of the cinema will temporarily pause from Friday".
  <br>
  <br>
  Among those paying a potential last visit to MCL Cinemas PLUS+ Plaza Hollywood was Shaun, a university student.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Maybe because of people heading north or the internet is growing fast, not many people are coming to the cinemas. But I love watching movies inside cinemas, that's why I'm quite distressed," she told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  Diana, who’s lived in the housing complex above the mall for over two decades, said the cinema means a lot to her.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We just get in the lift and come here within ten minutes. It's very convenient ...it's very causal and easy,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Also, during my childhood, my parents often brought me to watch movies during the weekends and so this is a habit.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Another nearby resident, 76-year-old Raymond, said he’s been a big fan of the cinema.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's such a pity. There's only this cinema in the area. I am an elderly and this cinema offers discounts for senior citizens until 1:30pm. I once watched five movies in a week," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  At least six cinemas have closed this year, including the almost six-decade old President Theatre in Causeway Bay.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Former lawmaker Lam Cheuk-ting and six other defendants were on Thursday convicted of rioting in Yuen Long during the 2019 protests.
 <br>
  <br>
  They were found guilty for their roles in clashes inside the Yuen Long MTR station on July 21 that year.
  <br>
  <br>
  In his verdict, District Court judge Stanley Chan said the former Democratic Party lawmaker had "fanned the flames" by going to the station and asking his assistant to livestream the events there.
  <br>
  <br>
  The prosecution had said that the defendant was using his capacity as a legislator to lead a group of protesters to provoke a rival group dressed in white.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lam, 47, had pleaded not guilty.
  <br>
  <br>
  He has been serving a separate sentence of six years and nine months for subversion, for his role in an unsanctioned Legco primary.

    Surge in cases involving impersonation of officials

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Thursday reported a surge in cases involving the impersonation of officials, with nearly 900 scams reported in the initial 10 months of this year, marking a 12 percent increase from the previous period.
 <br>
  <br>
  Officers said they received 874 cases that amounted to HK$1.42 billion, more than double from previous figures.
  <br>
  <br>
  Theodora Lee, the superintendent at the Anti-Deception Coordination Centre of the Commercial Crime Bureau, said that 30 percent of victims were university students, adding that scammers have adopted novel tactics to deceive people.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Scammers are getting more aggressive. In recent cases, we have seen scammers demanding students to take nude photos or videos and hide in remote areas. In one case, they even requested a victim leave Hong Kong for Thailand and cut off contact with their families," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "These tactics were aimed at pressuring the students' parents for more money."
  <br>
  <br>
  One victim who is a master's student in the SAR said she travelled to the mainland, and handed over 500,000 yuan in cash to the scammers, after she was informed by scammers dressed in police uniforms with identification that she was involved in a money laundering case.
  <br>
  <br>
  She was then directed to Thailand, where she was told she was prohibited from contacting anyone.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said the scammers later falsely informed her parents that she had been kidnapped and demanded a 10 million yuan ransom.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said her parents reported the incident, and she was eventually found in a Bangkok hotel.
  <br>
  <br>
  Overall there were 36,405 cases of fraud from January to October this year, involving a sum of over HK$7 billion.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee has urged Hong Kong business representatives in Beijing to take a leading role in facilitating exchanges between the SAR and the capital city.
 <br>
  <br>
  During a closed-door luncheon on Thursday during Lee's duty visit, the CE met members of the Beijing-based Hong Kong Chamber of Commerce in China and other business figures.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the chamber has all along committed to promoting exchanges in areas such as trade, culture and technology, among others.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I’m very pleased that the chamber has played a leading role in facilitating the complementary advantages and the sharing of benefits in resources between Beijing and Hong Kong,” Lee wrote on social media.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I hope that we will continue to strengthen cooperation and facilitate exchanges between the two places.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Chairwoman of the chamber, Judith Yu, said the chief executive called on those attending the luncheon to assist firms in both cities.
  <br>
  <br>
  “[He mentioned] we should act as a platform to help Hong Kong companies based in Beijing to adapt to the environment, and also we should help more [SAR] companies and Beijing companies use the platform of Hong Kong to list in Hong Kong, and through Hong Kong invest overseas.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Those at the meeting told Lee to consider introducing more measures, including tax concessions, to attract high-performing mainland individuals from the technology sector to come to the SAR, Yu added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee separately met leaders from universities in Beijing that are included in the list of eligible institutions under the SAR's top talent pass scheme.
  <br>
  <br>
  The representatives came from Renmin University of China, Peking University, Tsinghua University, Beijing Normal University, Beihang University and Beijing Institute of Technology.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thanking the universities for their continued support for the SAR, Lee said he looked forward to strengthening cooperation with the institutions and working together “to build a hub for high-calibre talent”.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chief Secretary Eric Chan, who has been acting in Lee’s capacity during the annual visit, will travel to Beijing “at dusk” on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan will join Lee “in meeting with relevant ministries” before returning on Saturday, the government announced.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CE is currently on a four-day duty visit to the capital.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to sources, Lee is scheduled to meet central government leaders on Friday to brief them on the city’s latest economic, social and political situation.
  <br>
  <br>
  He will also return to the SAR on Saturday.

    'HK exports to see 4 percent growth in 2025'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong’s exports will grow by four percent in the next year, according to a forecast by the Hong Kong Trade Development Council (HKTDC).
 <br>
  <br>
  The council on Thursday said with US president-elect Donald Trump taking office next month, global trading conditions may change drastically and Hong Kong will also be affected.
  <br>
  <br>
  "What the US has announced is not just tariffs on the Hong Kong or mainland-origin goods, but more towards its major trading partners. That would be potentially a significant negative impact on global trade," HKTDC's director of research Irina Fan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said some exporters arranged front-loading of shipments recently due to the uncertainties, so exports in the first half of 2025 are expected to be stronger than in the second half.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It could be like... you have a quite booming first half, but into the second half, given we have front-loading behaviour already starting this quarter, we could have a very sluggish fourth quarter," Fan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The HKTDC said Hong Kong's exports grew by about 10 percent in the first 10 months of this year, and a strong recovery of electronics exports largely attributed to the growth.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said electronics had a more than 70 percent share of the city's merchandise exports, marking a 13 percent increase year-on-year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fan said electronics will continue to play an important role in the SAR's exports next year, given the consistent demand for AI-enabled systems.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government has proposed that employees who lose their jobs after their companies go bankrupt can get as much as HK$200,000 of severance pay - double the current ceiling.
 <br>
  <br>
  They will also get half of any more money owed to them.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ex-gratia payments, that are made by the government's Protection of Wages on Insolvency Fund (PWIF), also cover unpaid wages, pay for untaken annual leave and statutory holidays, as well as payment in lieu of notice.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a paper submitted to the Legislative Council, the Labour and Welfare Bureau said it expects the move to allow 86 percent of the applicants to obtain their severance payment in full.
  <br>
  <br>
  “With an average of some 3,000 applications received annually and an accumulated surplus of over HK$7.2 billion as at December 2023, PWIF was financially sound enough to cope with the possible increase in applications,” it reads.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on an RTHK radio programme on Thursday, Lam Chun-sing, chairman of the Legislative Council's manpower panel said he welcomed the proposal.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If no one abuses the fund, I think the number of applications will remain similar at around 3,000 cases each year," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Even when the economy is poor, I think there will be only 4,000 to 5,000 cases. To a fund that has more than HK$7 billion, it's financially sound in the long run."
  <br>
  <br>
  Members of the Legco panel on manpower are set to discuss the matter on Monday.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce (HKGCC) on Thursday predicted real GDP growth of 2.3 percent in 2025, along with a headline inflation rate of 2.0 percent.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chairwoman Agnes Chan said this was a cautiously optimistic prediction, and expressed confidence in central government and SAR government measures.
  <br>
  <br>
  The HKGCC said that in a survey it carried out last month, more than 60 percent of 219 companies questioned reported increased or stable business turnover this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  About 18 percent said they had a positive outlook for the local economy in the next 12 months, while 45 percent held a negative view.
  <br>
  <br>
  Economist Doris Fung said that many unpredictable factors can be behind the firms' worries, such as uncertain growth rates in Europe and the potential for a trade war following Donald Trump's re-election as US president.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But we are also confident in the Hong Kong business community, they are more prepared this time with the new US government," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The survey also found that about half of the companies do not plan to either hire or cut staff, and about 40 percent plan to increase salaries.
  <br>
  <br>
  About 60 percent of the respondents said they don't expect to change their capital investment plans over the next year, the HKGCC said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The SAR's star badminton pair of Jordan Tang and Tse Ying-suet lost on Thursday at the World Tour Finals in Hangzhou.
 <br>
  <br>
  The national team's Zheng Siwei and Huang Yaqiong, gold medallists at the Paris Olympics in the summer, came from a game down to beat Tang and Tse 2-1.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong, China pair took the first game with ease by the score of 21-14.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was tight in the second game before Zheng and Huang finished with a 6-0 run to win 21-13.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both teams exchanged runs in the nail-biting decider, with Tang and Tse going on a 6-1 rally to take an 11-6 advantage into intermission.
  <br>
  <br>
  The China duo bounced back with a 4-0 run of their own, before the SAR pair took a 15-11 lead.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Zheng and Huang took control from then on, winning 21-18, to the delight of the Hangzhou crowd.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Paris gold medallists are playing in their final tournament after Zheng announced his retirement from international competition last month.
  <br>
  <br>
  As for Tang and Tse, they face top-seeded Jiang Zhenbang and Wei Yaxin from the national team in their final group match on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jiang and Wei have won both their matches, the SAR pair and Zheng and Huang are both 1-1, and the Chinese Taipei pair of Yang Po-Hsuan and Hu Ling-fang are 0-2.
  <br>
  <br>
  Only the top two pairs advance to the knockout stage.
  <br>
  <br>
  This could be the final tournament for the Hong Kong pair, after Tse indicated earlier she's pondering her future after battling a spate of injuries.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A human resources company on Thursday said the hiring intentions of local companies will be more conservative in the first quarter of next year, amid a slowdown of the global economy and geopolitical tensions.
 <br>
  <br>
  ManpowerGroup said it interviewed about 500 local employers and around 35 percent thought they would increase staff numbers in the coming three months, while 28 percent said they would need to downsize.
  <br>
  <br>
  A senior vice president with the group, Lancy Chui, said some sectors will face challenges, including goods and services and transport and logistics, due to a change in consumption patterns and tax-related issues.
  <br>
  <br>
  But she said various policies and events will be favourable for some sectors.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The multi-entry visas for Shenzhen residents will be an opportunity. Also, Hong Kong is now promoting a mega event economy. This will stimulate local and tourist consumption. It's also the peak season for festive spending, so it will boost the atmosphere for consumption," Chui said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The company said the employment outlook for the first quarter of next year stands at +6%, marking a two percentage point drop when compared with this quarter.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government has announced that Port Island will reopen on Thursday after the excavation of dinosaur fossils was completed there.
 <br>
  <br>
  Around 30 rocks containing dinosaur fossils have been found since late October.
  <br>
  <br>
  In October, officials announced that dinosaur fossils believed to date back to the Cretaceous period, about 145 million to 66 million years ago, were discovered on Port Island in the northeastern waters of Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  The excavation work was led by the Antiquities and Monuments Office with help from mainland palaeontologists and the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department.
  <br>
  <br>
  The team said all exposed fossils from the site have been removed, and they will study these fossils to figure out the dinosaur species and explore Hong Kong's palaeoecology.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, a spokesman from the Development Bureau reminded members of the public that "the island is remote and lacks ancillary facilities for landing and sightseeing".
  <br>
  <br>
  "Due to geographical and weather conditions that may pose risks for boat docking, members of the public are urged not to take risks to land on Port Island," the statement read.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bureau added there will be a temporary workshop at the Hong Kong Heritage Discovery Centre from December 20 for people to observe the preparation of fossil specimens.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The project director of Kai Tak Sports Park on Wednesday said the venue is well-positioned to showcase Hong Kong as a host city for mega events.
 <br>
  <br>
  At a ceremony announcing an exclusive partnership with HSBC, John Sharkey also unveiled plans to build the first outdoor AirBadminton court at a mall at the sports park.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sharkey said major facilities at the venue will be completed by the end of this year, and test events have been progressing well.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We believe that KTSB [Kai Tak Sports Park] will further leverage Hong Kong's advantages as a host city, providing more citizens with the opportunity to experience the resilience of our athletes first hand,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “At the same time, we will nurture the next generation's involvement in sports, allowing them to showcase their talents on an international stage that they can be proud to call their home.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at the same event, CEO of HSBC Hong Kong, Luanne Lim, said she thinks the partnership will elevate Hong Kong's profile as a global sports hub.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Through this partnership, we want to support this active lifestyle by making recreational and sporting activities available to everyone, every day,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Sports unites us and brings people together, not just locally but across borders and across cultures.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Lim added the bank will open a new branch at the sports park to serve the local community and international visitors.

    Hard to set sexual abuse allegation time frame: govt

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Welfare minister Chris Sun said on Wednesday that it would be rather difficult to set a time frame as to how quickly the authorities should make public allegations of sexual abuse against residents of care homes for disabled people.
 <br>
  <br>
  At a full council meeting in the legislature, Roundtable lawmaker Michael Tien noted that it took officials two months to announce an alleged incident earlier this year, and said he found it unacceptable that there is no set criteria for revealing such suspected incidents.
  <br>
  <br>
  In reply, Sun said the circumstances of each alleged incident are always different and if a time frame is set that is too short, this might cause the mishandling of cases, adding that if the time frame was too long, people might question why the announcement did not come sooner.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's impossible for us to set a fixed time frame for announcements, and we have to take into consideration the unique nature of every such incident," he told lawmakers during a Q&A session.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We do have to take care of the emotions of the victims as well as their family members, and we will try to announce such incidents as early as possible."
  <br>
  <br>
  In October, officials amended a code of practice for care homes for the disabled, including setting out policies on installing CCTV and reviewing the footage.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lawmaker Connie Lam, who's a social worker by trade, pointed out that while most care homes have installed surveillance cameras, they often are too understaffed to check the footage.
  <br>
  <br>
  In response, Sun said there could be "riskier" periods such as when there are fewer people at the homes at weekends, and staff could review footage of those periods more regularly.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sun said in the long run, officials hope artificial intelligence can help with such monitoring work.

 Hong Kong's superstar swimmer Siobhan Haughey on Wednesday advanced to the 100m freestyle semi-finals at the World Aquatics Championships in Budapest, in one of her last races before taking a break to ponder her future.
 <br>
  <br>
  Her time of 52.12 seconds topped her heat, and was good for second overall behind American Gretchen Walsh, who clocked a 51.64-second finish.
  <br>
  <br>
  Haughey, 27, was second at the first turn in the short course race and overtook Briton Freya Andersen shortly afterwards.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fellow SAR swimmer Li Sum-yiu, 15, was unable to advance after finishing eighth in the same heat with a time of 53.41 seconds.
  <br>
  <br>
  The semi-finals are due to begin at 0:48am on Thursday, Hong Kong time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Haughey will also be looking to defend her 200m freestyle title in Hungary.
  <br>
  <br>
  The four-time Olympic medallist for Hong Kong, China recently announced that she will be taking a few months off from the sport in the new year.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong has the potential to become a green technology hub, according to a study conducted by the government’s investment promotion agency and accounting firm Deloitte.
 <br>
  <br>
  They said on Wednesday that the green technology industry is worth trillions of dollars, but 41 percent of climate problems are still waiting to be addressed.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This creates enormous business opportunities for the investors and also the tech innovators, as one way to interpret this number is that 41 percent of the problems currently do not have an available solution," said King Leung, InvestHK's Global Head of Financial Services, FinTech & Sustainability.
  <br>
  <br>
  The study said the city can help China achieve carbon neutrality through five sectors, including transport, construction and waste management.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mohit Grover, the lead partner for sustainability and climate at Deloitte's Hong Kong branch, said the SAR can assist Chinese electric car companies with expanding their business worldwide.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For Chinese enterprises, Hong Kong will be used as one of the global hubs to globalise their operations and to raise capital through the exchange. We already see a lot of shift happening from Western brands to Chinese brands for the electric vehicles (EV) that we see on the road," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And for some of the technology innovation around various aspects of battery production or EV production, I think those start-ups are also being present in Hong Kong, which will get a bigger access to the [global] market," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  For construction, Leung suggested the adoption of glass materials for insulation and generating solar power to lower energy consumption.
  <br>
  <br>
  "90 percent of all the electricity consumed in Hong Kong goes to buildings. We have 8,000 skyscrapers, which is the most in a single city in the world," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Leung added that China is leading the world in green building technology patents, and Hong Kong's positioning as an international financial centre can help such companies to showcase their abilities and therefore expand to global markets through the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  In terms of waste management, Grover said a behavioural change among residents of Hong Kong will be crucial.

<img alt="Rosanna Law noted that RTHK has produced a programme providing updates on local mega events. File photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1782995_1_20241211142635.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Wednesday said that mega events in the first half of the year had attracted an estimated 550,000 visitors, who spent around HK$2.4 billion and added about HK$1.4 billion in value to the economy.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a written reply to the legislature, Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism, Rosanna Law said there were 110 mega events in the first six months of 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nearly 70 of them were conventions and exhibitions as well as cultural, arts and creative events.
  <br>
  <br>
  Business and Professionals Alliance lawmaker, Jeffrey Lam, asked the government how it could further enhance the attractiveness of mega-events and boost their economic benefits.
  <br>
  <br>
  Law said one of the administration's key purposes of compiling a Hong Kong mega event calendar in advance, is to allow the public and tourists to learn about them early.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[This can] foster collaboration between different industries and mega events, and facilitate the industries of tourism, hotel and catering to plan and design promotional activities and tourism products early," she wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister said RTHK had produced a programme called "Mega Events Mega Hong Kong", which gives daily updates on what's happening through different media platforms.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the Information Services Department has used its website and social media platforms, such as Xiaohongshu, for promotion, while inviting media from the mainland and overseas to cover the city's mega events.
  <br>
  <br>
  Law said with HK$100 million in this year's budget earmarked for boosting mega-event promotion over the next three years, officials will review and optimise resources to enhance publicity efforts, bearing in mind ongoing developments and mega-event planning updates.

<img alt="Jordan Tang (L) and Tse Ying-suet roared to a winning start at the World Tour Finals.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Shuttlers Jordan Tang and Tse Ying-suet from the SAR began their final tournament of the year on a high, defeating a pair from Chinese Taipei in straight sets in the World Tour Finals in Hangzhou on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  It was a strong performance for the long-time Hong Kong, China mixed doubles duo from start to finish, after they made it to the year-end finals for the fourth time in their careers.
  <br>
  <br>
  The annual showcase could very well be their last as Tse, 33, who has battled a host of injuries in recent years, said earlier she has been contemplating her future.
  <br>
  <br>
  The pair dispatched Yang Po-Hsuan and Hu Ling-fang in 39 minutes to take the first match in Group A, which has been described as a group of death.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tang and Tse set the tone early to claim the first game, 21-15.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Chinese Taipei pair put up a fight in the second match, though, drawing level at 17 before dropping the last four points and losing the match.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Badminton World Federation (BWF) World Tour Finals is a year-end showcase for those ranked in the top-eight in the world in eligible tournaments, with each country or region limited to sending two entries for each event.
  <br>
  <br>
  Up next for Tang and Tse are Zheng Siwei and Huang Yaqiong from the national team on Thursday, before they face top-seeded Jiang Zhenbang and Wei Yaxin, also from the national team, on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Only the top two pairs in each group qualify for a spot in the knockout stage, which will take place on Saturday.

    'Passengers won't pay for transition to e-buses'

<img alt="The government says its subsidies will cover the additional costs involved as bus companies switch to electric vehicles. Photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1782969_1_20241211114826.jpg&q=30">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Environment and Ecology Tse Chin-wan said on Wednesday that he believes the additional costs incurred in Hong Kong's planned transition to electric buses will not be passed on to passengers.
 <br>
  <br>
  Under its Green Transformation Roadmap of Public Buses and Taxis, the government plans to subsidise the purchase of 600 electric buses and 3,000 electric taxis.
  <br>
  <br>
  The aim is for the SAR to achieve carbon neutrality, with all franchised buses and taxis to be zero emission vehicles by 2050.
  <br>
  <br>
  On an RTHK radio programme, Tse said the subsidy is sufficient to cover the extra costs that will be incurred by bus companies.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the past, electric double decker buses were much more expensive than regular ones, double the price of a normal bus. Regular buses cost about two million dollars, and electric ones cost four to five million dollars each. As technology advances, in recent months we have seen the price has reduced drastically. But they still cost millions of dollars each," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Therefore, the government will offer subsidies that cover the additional costs that are incurred from changing to electric buses. In that way, companies won't have to pass the additional costs incurred on to passengers."
  <br>
  <br>
  The government also plans to offer 500 more high-speed charging stations for taxis by the end of 2027.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tse said the government will encourage petrol stations to build charging spots and offer discounts to taxis.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on the same programme, Wong Yu-ting, chairman of the Hong Kong Tele-call Taxi Association, questioned whether the government will be able to achieve all these goals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong said he made an application to install charging spots in Tsing Yi around a year ago, but this has yet to be approved.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You said more charging stations will be available by the end of 2027, it's so vague. Shouldn't you talk about your goal for each year? It would be better. Or you can say by which month a certain number of charging spots will be available. In this way, it's more concrete," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ryan Ip, vice president of the Our Hong Kong Foundation, said he welcomes the government's plans.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the government should provide more high-speed charging spots, to benefit both the transport industry and the public.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ip said the government should also consider promoting the use of hydrogen vehicles.
  <br>
