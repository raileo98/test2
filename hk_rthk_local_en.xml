<div class="itemFullText">
 Police said on Saturday that they've laid a holding charge of murder against a 52-year-old man on suspicion of setting a Tsim Sha Tsui karaoke parlour on fire 27 years ago, leaving 17 people dead.
 <br>
  <br>
  The case will be mentioned at West Kowloon Magistrates' Court on Saturday morning.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officers said they were informed by their mainland counterparts earlier this week that the suspect had been apprehended. The man, now 52, was sent back to Hong Kong on Thursday through the Shenzhen Bay border.
  <br>
  <br>
  Superintendent Lam Kai-chor from the Organised Crime and Triad Bureau said the force had verified the man's identity through his fingerprints.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The force has evidence to show that the suspect played a major role in the case," he alleged.
  <br>
  <br>
  The hooded suspect was brought back to the scene on Friday night to re-enact the case. He was given a plastic bottle which resembled a Molotov cocktail.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police said Molotov cocktails were thrown at the now-shuttered Top One Karaoke on January 25, 1997, days after two gangs got into a quarrel at the scene.
  <br>
  <br>
  Seventeen people died due to smoke inhalation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Five other culprits have been arrested earlier. Four of them have been jailed for life, while another received 11 years for manslaughter.
  <br>
  <br>
  The remaining suspect, Chan Fok-ching, is still on the run. Police said a HK$400,000 reward continues to be offered for information leading to his arrest.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 New World Development announced on Friday that Chief Executive Officer Eric Ma has resigned with immediate effect, just a little more than two months into the job.
 <br>
  <br>
  Echo Huang, who's the head of the group's property business in mainland China, has been named as his replacement.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a filing to the local bourse, the developer said Ma, who was also the executive director, wished to pursue "other personal commitments".
  <br>
  <br>
  The former development chief took over from scion Adrian Cheng in September, after the company reported a net loss of more than HK$17 billion the previous financial year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cheng's father and the developer's chairman, Henry Cheng, said "timely phased changes needed to be made" after reviewing the group's development direction.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added he was glad to have found a "more suitable" CEO, citing Huang's experience in real estate and corporate management.
  <br>
  <br>
  The company also appointed Gilbert Ho and Edward Lau as executive directors.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shares of New World Development and sister company, New World Department Store China, fell by around six percent before trading was halted in the afternoon pending the personnel announcement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trading for both firms will resume on Monday.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government announced on Friday that the Director of Broadcasting, Eddie Cheung, will become the new permanent secretary for the environment and ecology early next year.
 <br>
  <br>
  He'll replace Janice Tse on January 2, when she will begin her pre-retirement leave.
  <br>
  <br>
  In another senior appointment, deputy secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury Manda Chan will head the Leisure and Cultural Services Department from next Wednesday, taking over from the retiring Vincent Liu.
  <br>
  <br>
  Civil service chief Ingrid Yeung described the two appointees as seasoned administrative officers with proven leadership and management skills.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I have every confidence that they will continue to serve the community with professionalism in their new capacity," she said in a statement, while also thanking the two retiring officials.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cheung joined the government's administrative service in October 1993, and rose to the rank of administrative officer staff grade A in April this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  He has served in various bureaus and departments, including a three-year stint as the special representative for Hong Kong Economic and Trade Affairs to the European Union from 2019, before heading RTHK since October 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan, meanwhile, joined the administrative service in September 1995 and rose to the rank of Administrative Officer Staff Grade B1 in April this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  She was the Commissioner for Narcotics of the Security Bureau for more than three years from 2016, and was the Commissioner for Rehabilitation of the Labour and Welfare Bureau for around three years until October 2022.

    Northern Metropolis projects to invite tender in 2025

<img alt="The Development Bureau says it will solicit views from the industry on three Northern Metropolis projects next month. File photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1781445_1_20241129192157.jpg&q=70">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government says it will start accepting tenders for three pilot development areas in the Northern Metropolis as soon as the second half of next year, and the projects could be completed in a decade or so.
 <br>
  <br>
  The plots, in Hung Shui Kiu, Fanling North and San Tin, range from 12.5 to 18.6 hectares in size. Each will have its own residential, industrial and public facilities.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hung Shui Kiu has been earmarked as a "high-end professional services and logistics hub". A Technopole is planned in San Tin, while Fanling North is mainly designed to provide housing.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Development Bureau said baseline scenarios it set for the three sites have been deemed as financially viable by a consultant.
  <br>
  <br>
  A bureau spokesperson said developers will be asked to largely adhere to the scenarios in regards to development.
  <br>
  <br>
  But officials will also listen to feedback for potential adjustments, before the projects are put up for tender.
  <br>
  <br>
  Developers will have to carry out site formation as well as engineering infrastructure works, such as building roads and drainage. They'll have exclusive rights to residential blocks within the development site.
  <br>
  <br>
  The spokesperson said the three sites will provide some 630,000 square metres of residential gross floor area.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The large parcel development mode is a new concept in Hong Kong, but it's been widely adopted on the mainland. So we look forward to attracting not just local developers, but also those from the mainland," the spokesperson said, later adding that overseas firms are also welcome.
  <br>
  <br>
  The person pointed to existing mechanisms assessing whether participating developers are financially robust. In the event they run into capital trouble, there will be safeguards to ensure delivery of the projects.

<img alt="The Hong Kong Retail Management Association says it will take time for all sectors to fully benefit from the multi-entry visa scheme for Shenzhen residents. File photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1781432_1_20241129181641.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Retail Management Association on Friday hailed the mainland authorities' move to bring back multi-entry visas for Shenzhen residents visiting Hong Kong, saying it will boost consumption.
 <br>
  <br>
  "This policy, along with the increase in the duty-free allowance for mainland visitors and the expansion of the individual visit scheme, will stimulate the flow of visitors to Hong Kong and contribute to the local retail market," executive director Bond Law said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "However, [due to] the change in tourist consumption patterns, it will take some time and effort from all sectors to enable the multiple entry policy to fully take effect."
  <br>
  <br>
  Agnes Chan, chairwoman of the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce, said it will now be more convenient for Shenzhen residents to come to the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  “This will inject fresh momentum into sectors such as tourism, food and beverage, and retail, while boosting market confidence,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kenny Shui, vice president of the Our Hong Kong Foundation, said the measure will boost the region’s economic growth through attracting more visitors, and broaden the SAR's appeal as a destination for mega tourism events.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shui said the arrangement will not only help with the recovery of the tourism industry, but will also foster cultural and economic exchanges in the Greater Bay Area.
  <br>
  <br>
  Marcos Chan, head of Research at CBRE Hong Kong, said retail, food and beverage businesses near MTR stations in the New Territories will particularly benefit from the arrangement.
  <br>
  <br>
  “This, together with the expanded capacity of the Hong Kong International Airport via the commissioning of the third runway will warrant sustained and accelerating inbound tourism recovery for Hong Kong,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said he also expects leasing demand for shops at sightseeing spots to improve.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Should interest rates further lower, domestic consumption will also strengthen as household burdens reduce. A fuller retail market recovery is expected for 2025.”

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Enterprise representatives said on Friday they are confident about the development of the Northern Metropolis.
 <br>
  <br>
  A total of 85 companies were present at a signing ceremony for enterprise participation, including developers such as Sun Hung Kai Properties, Swire Properties and China Resources Land.
  <br>
  <br>
  They signed an expression of interest regarding the Northern Metropolis development, along with separate agreements for various projects worth some HK$100 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters after the ceremony, Bank of China's Deputy Chief Executive Wang Huabin said the Northern Metropolis' planning compliments Hong Kong's positioning as an international finance, aviation, trading and innovative hub.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We believe the Northern Metropolis will act as a new force to drive Hong Kong's development in the future. Our corporation highly values the building and development of the Northern Metropolis," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As early as 2022 when the metropolis plan was first suggested, we had already formulated and announced that we will establish a comprehensive financial services plan for the area," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang said the bank will strengthen its efforts to attract more investors to the area to complement the Hong Kong government's plan, by providing financial services to companies that invest in the Northern Metropolis.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bank signed a cooperation agreement with nine corporations, with one agreement worth more than HK$20 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Also present at the signing ceremony was Daryl Ng, deputy chairman of real estate corporation Sino Group. He said the group will support the development of the Northern Metropolis.
  <br>
  <br>
  "From the government's plan, we see there will be a third medical school in the Northern Metropolis. We also see it involves a lot of innovative technology projects and the building of a university city. I think the potential of the Northern Metropolis is very high and our group is confident in the development of the region," he said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Friday called on the business sector to get on board with the development of the Northern Metropolis, adding that the government will roll out large parcels of land in Hung Shui Kiu, Fanling North and the San Tin Technopole.
 <br>
  <br>
  "The three sites are different in scale and components, suiting varying commercial interests and risk appetite. I'm confident that this would provide the private sector with a brand new and efficient way to participate in our development and in return benefit our society as a whole," Lee said at a signing ceremony for enterprise participation.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CE added that while the development of the Northern Metropolis will be government-led, market participation is just as vital.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With the [Lok Ma Chau] loop and other development areas in the pipeline, the Northern Metropolis will become a region that radiates beyond geographical boundaries. Taking forward a development of this scale and gravitas requires the efforts and resources of all sectors of our community."
  <br>
  <br>
  Zheng Yanxiong, director of the liaison office, told the same ceremony that business leaders should take the initiative in taking forward projects in the Northern Metropolis.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The development of the Northern Metropolis is a major initiative for Hong Kong's innovative development. It represents a focal point for economic growth and breakthrough innovation, and is also a key strategic move for Hong Kong to better integrate into the development of the Greater Bay Area and the country."

 Two political parties on Friday expressed support for the mainland's move to bring back multi-entry permits for Shenzhen residents to visit Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  Visits will still be limited to seven days, but from December 1, Shenzhen residents can apply to come to the SAR as often as they like, rather than just once a week.
  <br>
  <br>
  National People's Congress Standing Committee member Starry Lee, from the DAB, said the move shows Beijing's support and care for the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are very, very much thankful for the central government's support and attention for Hong Kong," she told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We hope different sectors in society can make good use of the central authorities' support measures to revitalise the local economy."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Federation of Trade Unions, meanwhile, said the move will boost exchanges between the people of Shenzhen and Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This of course also helps local tourism and drives the development of related industries. Our federation very much welcomes this," its president, Stanley Ng, told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Of course we hope that Hong Kong's capacity to receive visitors can improve, for example our border transport, our facilities and tourism hotspots."
  <br>
  <br>
  The federation said it hopes sporting and cultural events at Kai Tak Sports Park and the West Kowloon Cultural District will attract more tourists to the city.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Travel Industry Council (TIC) on Friday welcomed the mainland's move to allow Shenzhen residents to visit Hong Kong as many times as they want in future, rather than only once per week.
 <br>
  <br>
  Executive director Fanny Yeung said the visa change, which comes into effect on December 1, is "very significant" for the tourism sector.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said she expects the number of visitors from Shenzhen to increase by at least 20 percent over Christmas.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have all these kinds of beautiful Christmas decorations...the atmosphere, the vibes, you cannot find it in any mainland city," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeung said the TIC has come up with new ways to attract tourists from across the border.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are encouraging our travel agents to offer more half day in-depth tours to attract these groups of visitors because these are experienced visitors here in Hong Kong. They know a lot of places in Hong Kong already. But most of them, they don't know about the history, or some back-end stories of some particular spots."
  <br>
  <br>
  Tourism sector lawmaker Perry Yiu also said he believes the multi-entry permits will boost the sector, adding that they will allow more people to join the SAR's mega events.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wholesale and retail sector lawmaker Peter Shiu said the move provides a shot in the arm for businesses, but they also need to make improvements such as offering more specialty products to encourage spending.

    More flights, cheaper fares on the way: airport boss

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The new three-runway system will enable more flights to and from Chek Lap Kok and will bring down air fares, Airport Authority chief Steven Yiu said on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  All three runways came into operation on Thursday, with officials eyeing a boost in capacity to 120 million passengers per year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yiu, the authority's executive director, told RTHK that airlines are queuing up to get hold of additional departure and arrival slots.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The airlines are excited about the three-runway system because they want to be able to operate more trips. If short-haul flights that take around four to five hours for a round-trip leave in the morning, that means they may be able to make three trips a day. From an operating point of view, this increases airlines' efficiency," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yiu said the authority is hoping to attract more airlines to use Hong Kong for lay overs and is hoping for more long-haul routes to be opened up.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the past six months, we have provided incentives to airlines if they are willing to provide flights to places that were not available before, or if they add flights to some of our strategic destinations," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that Hong Kong will remain an international aviation hub even if competition from other airports in the Greater Bay Area intensifies.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If we look at the economy in the Greater Bay Area, there is a total population of 86 million people, which is 10 times the Hong Kong population. The area also has the most vibrant economy in China. Even with the opening of all 11 runways in the area, I believe it will not be sufficient to satisfy all demand," he said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 More than 10 million people in Shenzhen will be allowed to visit Hong Kong as many times as they like from December 1, the authorities said on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Mainland officials have reversed their 2015 decision to limit such visits to once per week, allowing Shenzhen residents to apply for multi-entry permits to make repeated trips to the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  The maximum length of each visit will remain at seven days.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chief Executive John Lee expressed his gratitude to the central government for making the move.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee previously said he had requested a return to the earlier arrangement, which was scrapped due to concerns over parallel trading and overcrowding.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, from next year Zhuhai residents can apply for weekly trips to Macau, while those living in the Guangdong-Macau In-Depth Cooperation Zone in Hengqin will be able to go to Macau as many times as they like for up to seven days at a time.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong Premier League side Eastern on Thursday night crashed out of contention in the AFC Champions League Two – Asia's second-tier club football tournament – suffering a 4-1 defeat to Australian side Sydney FC in their Group E match-up at Mong Kok Stadium.
 <br>
  <br>
  Sydney jumped out to a commanding 3-0 lead in the first half, thanks to an early goal from Moroccan striker Anas Ouahim in the fifth minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  That was followed up by a 16th-minute half-volley by Patryk Klimala, as Ouahim deflected a shot for Sydney's third goal to close out the half.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eastern striker Noah Baffoe pulled one goal back for the home team with a glancing header from a free kick in the 49th.
  <br>
  <br>
  But it was Ouahim's individual brilliance that sealed the victory for the Australians, scoring a penalty in the 62nd minute to secure the first-ever hat-trick of his career.
  <br>
  <br>
  With one round left, the win guarantees Sydney's progression to the last 16 of the continental competition for just the second time in the club’s history.
  <br>
  <br>
  They next face Philippine side Kaya FC in their final group match on December 5, while Eastern will travel to Hiroshima to play Japan side Sanfrecce on the same day.

    Zeman calls for 'panda island' attraction

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A former chairman of Ocean Park says the theme park needs to make the most of its unique panda attractions to boost returns and get back to profitability.
 <br>
  <br>
  Allan Zeman, chairman of Lan Kwai Fong Group, told RTHK's
  <a href="https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/news-programmes/this-episode.htm?cmsid=77" target="_blank">
   Hong Kong Today
  </a>
  programme that outside of the mainland, nowhere else in the world had six pandas and Ocean Park should create a 'panda island' to capitalise on this.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The fact that we have six pandas, if they do a panda island, they find a piece of land... have all the six pandas together... panda restaurants, panda shops... panda games... really create something that no other part of the world has. And I think that would really drive a lot of business," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The park unveiled its latest full-year result on Thursday, saying it recorded a deficit of more than HK$71.6 million for the financial year ending in June, despite revenue and visitor numbers hitting five-year highs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zeman said promoting the "panda economy" would be key to the park's success going forward, especially after the government's time-limited subvention – capped at HK$280 million a year – ends after the 2025-2026 financial year.
  <br>
  <br>
  He pointed out the limitations facing Ocean Park in setting its own admission fees.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Ocean Park Corporation is a statutory board that is a not-for-profit organisation, aiming to provide education and conservation at an affordable price.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong government said on Thursday that it rejects and strongly disapproves of the European Parliament’s so-called resolution on Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  The European body earlier passed a non-binding resolution, calling for the “immediate and unconditional” release of all opposition figures who had been sentenced on national security charges.
  <br>
  <br>
  It called for sanctions to be imposed on Hong Kong and mainland officials, and demanded that Hong Kong’s favourable customs treatment be revoked.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, the SAR government said it strongly condemns the baseless claims made against its officials.
  <br>
  <br>
  A spokesperson stressed that as an inalienable part of the People’s Republic of China, Hong Kong needs to put in place a complete and effective set of national security legislation to safeguard national security.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that many other common law jurisdictions also have their own national security legislation, and that the European Parliament should not interfere in Hong Kong matters and China's internal affairs.
  <br>
  <br>
  The spokesman stressed that all trials in Hong Kong are being conducted in an open, fair and independent manner.

 Police said a 75-year-old man has been arrested on Thursday in connection with a fire that broke out along a road in Tsuen Wan the day before.
 <br>
  <br>
  The blaze, which destroyed part of a six-metre-tall noise barrier on Cheung Pei Shan Road near Shek Wai Kok Estate, disrupted traffic for much of the day on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chief inspector Law Sai-to of the Tsuen Wan district crime unit said the suspect was identified after reviewing CCTV footage and interviewing nearby residents.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He lives near the scene of the crime. When he was arrested, we found three medium-sized lighters and a utility knife on him. He was arrested on suspicion of arson and possession of offensive weapon, and is currently being detained for questioning," Law said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Investigations are continuing, he added.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Commissioner's Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Hong Kong on Thursday said it strongly disapproves and rejects a decision by Washington to update its travel advisory for Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  The office made the remarks a day after the US Department of State issued a “Level 2” alert for those intending to travel to Hong Kong, saying people should “exercise increased caution” due to the “arbitrary enforcement” of national security legislation in the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  A spokesperson for the office stressed Hong Kong is one of the safest and most livable cities in the world, adding that national security legislation – the formulation and implementation of which are in line with international practice and the rule of law – has brought stability to the territory.
  <br>
  <br>
  The spokesman pointed out that the SAR has welcomed 21 million visitors during the first half of this year, 64 percent more than the same period last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Foreign funds, enterprises and talented individuals also continued to pour in, showing the international community’s trust in Hong Kong,” he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The office called on the US to stop smearing Hong Kong through repeatedly issuing travel advisories, saying the SAR – as an open and free international city – will continue to welcome international visitors with open arms.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SAR government also issued a separate statement, calling on the US to stop using its travel advisories as a political tool to smear Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  A spokesperson stressed there are clear lines being drawn when it comes to the city's national security legislation, and tourists will not unwittingly fall foul of the law.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Tourism Board and certification authorities are encouraging restaurants, hotels and attractions to enhance their Muslim-friendly offerings by obtaining Halal certification, with the aim of enriching the experience of Muslim visitors to Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  The board said on Thursday that the number of certified Halal and Halal-friendly restaurants has risen from approximately 100 at the start of the year to around 130.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SAR now has its first ever high-end Chinese restaurant certified as Halal-friendly.
  <br>
  <br>
  Saito Chau, culinary director of Chinesology, said the certification process was extremely detailed, encompassing everything from menu design and the procurement of cutlery and cooking utensils to selecting appropriate ingredients.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said that achieving the Halal-friendly status was a significant milestone in making Chinese cuisine more accessible to Muslim consumers.
  <br>
  <br>
  For example, the restaurant has recreated the popular "char siu", or Chinese barbecue pork, with beef instead.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Muslim diners do not know much about Chinese cuisines, many of whom have never tried Chinese cuisine before. This inspires us to offer a culinary experience to Muslim visitors that allows them to explore the sophistication of the Chinese culinary culture by getting to taste the dishes themselves," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Becky Ip, deputy executive director of the board, said the SAR is committed to expanding its outreach to visitors from Middle Eastern and Asean markets, recognising the significant potential and spending power of Muslim consumers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have just started the whole support to our agencies and also the [Incorporated Trustees of the Islamic Community Fund of Hong Kong] Board of Trustees for making Hong Kong more Muslim-friendly, particularly in the dining scene," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's just a beginning as we just started in June this year, so so far we have about 30 new restaurants joining as Halal-friendly restaurants. So hoping by doing so, we will have more. We'd like to see more restaurants participate in the scheme."
  <br>
  <br>
  Ip added that they have intensified promotional efforts in Muslim source markets to draw more visitors from Southeast Asia and the Middle East to Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[It is] very important to let Muslim travellers understand well [that when] they come to enjoy Hong Kong, it will also be very safe for them to eat the food in Hong Kong, where they stay will be very safe for them," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have actually brought a few delegations to the Middle East and quite some delegations to promote Hong Kong together with our trade partners in these areas, Middle East and Southeast Asian countries. Apart from that, we also have invited over the past few months a series of KOLs, media and trade partners to come and see Hong Kong themselves.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Particularly let them have a chance to sample our hotel facilities and sample the Hong Kong food they look forward to. It's very, very important."

<div class="itemFullText">
 The HK$141 billion three-runway system at Hong Kong airport went into operation on Thursday, with authorities hailing it as a historic moment for the city's aviation development.
 <br>
  <br>
  Three flights - two taking off and one landing - were handled simultaneously at Chek Lap Kok in the afternoon, witnessed by top SAR and mainland officials attending a ceremony.
  <br>
  <br>
  Guests included Chief Executive John Lee, Vice Minister of Transport Xu Chengguang and the director of Beijing's liaison office Zheng Yanxiong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The various airlines also need to fully enhance their services, strengthening major routes and to explore more new destinations for Hong Kong, especially to countries of the Belt and Road Initiative in order to raise industry competitiveness," Lee said.
  <br>
  <br>
  One of Hong Kong’s largest infrastructure projects in recent years, the three-runway system involved the reclamation of 650 hectares of land to house the 3.8 kilometre-long extra runway.
  <br>
  <br>
  The new system boosts the airport's capacity to 120 million passengers per year, on top 10 million tonnes of cargo.
  <br>
  <br>
  Airport Authority chairman Fred Lam pledged to continue to implement the Airport City blueprint unveiled in 2019.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It will attract travellers from all around the world, boost the flow of people and goods, and act as an engine of Hong Kong’s economic development," he said at the commissioning ceremony.
  <br>
  <br>
  The authority said that it is now taking forward the phase two development of AsiaWorld-Expo, while a large-scale storage facility and other new projects will be completed from 2026 to 2031.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Labour and Welfare Chris Sun said on Thursday that the government cannot make the lives of carers better on its own and all sectors must work together to support them.
 <br>
  <br>
  Sun said he is pleased to see that various NGOs have already cooperated with the Social Welfare Department to help carers.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that carers who need help should not hesitate to phone the government's 182 183 hotline.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The person answering the call doesn't only chat with you to calm you," Sun said at an event.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If you are looking for temporary short-term care, the hotline will arrange it for you. If it's a very urgent situation, there will also be social workers rushing to help you."

<img alt="Chief Executive John Lee has asked Beijing to bring back multi-entry visas for Shenzhen residents and to expand the number of cities that grant visas for weekly visits to the SAR.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Thursday hinted there would soon be news on the administration's request for changes to visa arrangements for mainland residents visiting Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  In his latest Policy Address, Lee said he had asked Beijing to bring back multiple-entry visas for Shenzhen residents and to expand the number of cities that grant visas for weekly visits to the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm grateful that central government departments are studying the proposal to expedite the implementation. I believe there will be news soon," Lee said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "All units of the SAR government will do their utmost to coordinate the implementation of such measures, promote people-to-people exchanges, and inject new momentum into the tourism, catering and retail industries."
  <br>
  <br>
  Beginning in April 2009, Shenzhen residents were allowed to apply for Individual Visit Endorsements, with holders able to enter and exit the SAR freely within a one-year validity period.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the scheme was replaced with a "one-trip-per-week" arrangement in 2015 following concerns over parallel trading and overcrowding.

    Men feel less included in society, survey finds

<img alt="The Hong Kong Christian Service found that the city has an inclusion score of about 70 out of 100. Photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1781206_1_20241128131553.jpg&q=60">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Men feel they are less included in society than women, according to a survey conducted by the Hong Kong Christian Service.
 <br>
  <br>
  The group surveyed 1,026 people between May and June to gather their views on eight attributes affecting their sense of inclusiveness. These areas are employment, recreational facilities, housing, family life, social connections, education, healthcare and culture.
  <br>
  <br>
  The overall inclusion score was about 70 out of 100, which the group views as "average".
  <br>
  <br>
  But men scored lower than women in every aspect.
  <br>
  <br>
  A single father surnamed Wong said gender stereotypes have made parenting of his seven-year-old daughter difficult.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I have never seen any father help with changing a baby's diaper in the shopping mall’s baby care room. To avoid embarrassment, I would knock on the door to 'seek approval' from the mothers inside," Wong said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that he sometimes feels he is treated unkindly, saying he has overheard people talk about whether he might be a kidnapper when he holds his daughter's hand when they are out.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wilson Yung from the Hong Kong Christian Service called on society to be more accepting and to appreciate men's decisions over their family roles.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We analysed that maybe due to Chinese culture, which mainly sees a man taking the role of family income [earners], and childcare will rely on women. In the current situation the society is not too accepting for men to be child caregivers," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The survey also found that interviewees considered education to be the least inclusive area.
  <br>
  <br>
  The group said while the government has recently invested a lot resources in special needs students, there's a need for more tailored support, stressing that the current approach is too generic.

<img alt="Paul Chan says Hong Kong can connect mainland China and the Global South with the markets worldwide. Photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1781207_1_20241128132121.jpg&q=1">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Thursday called on business leaders to help with Hong Kong's bid to join the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), the world's largest free trade agreement.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a speech at the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce International Business Summit, Lee said with growing partnership between Hong Kong and Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean), it's clear that the SAR is ready to join RCEP.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I believe that the next natural step in our growing ties with Asean is for Hong Kong to become a member of RCEP," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  RCEP is a free trade pact for the Asian-Pacific region that includes all 10 Asean member states.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong is fully prepared to join RCEP. Doing so will boost our ties in trade and benefit companies and investors throughout the nations of Asean and also RCEP," the CE said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And I continue to count on business leaders like your good selves, people who know Hong Kong well and appreciate the value that Hong Kong can add to RCEP, to speak up in support of our accession bid."
  <br>
  <br>
  Financial Secretary Paul Chan, who also attended the summit, said Hong Kong has a unique role in connecting the markets in the Global South, including mainland China, to the rest of the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan noted that many mainland companies have established supply chains in the Global South and Belt and Road countries, and Hong Kong can play the role of a super-connector.
  <br>
  <br>
  “[Mainland firms] need project and trade financing. They need world-class professional services. They need global capital and global talent. In order to do this, Hong Kong would be a very unique platform,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We are encouraging mainland companies coming to Hong Kong to set up their regional offices, even international offices, to support their global ambition.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The financial secretary also spoke about challenges facing the world "underscored by geo-economic fragmentation", such as threats by US President-elect Donald Trump to raise tariffs on goods from China, Canada and Mexico.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite that, Chan said the US and Europe remain important and valuable partners for the SAR and China as a whole, saying cooperation remains possible in "non-sensitive areas" such as infrastructure and climate-related activities.
  <br>
  <br>
  He stressed the SAR needs to engage proactively with the West and reach out to their markets to tell the true Hong Kong story, to tackle misconceptions and biases.
  <br>
  <br>
  Standard Chartered's President, International, Benjamin Hung, said business people he'd spoken to around the world were discussing the possibility of higher US tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said with China having the world's largest production capacity, firms shifting their manufacturing elsewhere may lead to rising costs and higher inflation, adding to consumers' burden.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Right now, diversification is the name of the game... This is like insurance, this is like buying protection, because nowhere in the world, unfortunately, can produce the quantity, the quality, and at the cost level that China can," Hung said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So 'China+1' is never going to be enough because 'China+1' isn't enough to compensate the volume of China. You need 'China+2', 'China+N'."
  <br>
  <br>
  He said Hong Kong’s role amidst the challenges isn't just to be a centre for supply chains, but also to manage capital.

    Ocean Park sees deficit despite visitor, income surge

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ocean Park has recorded a deficit of more than HK$71 million for the financial year ending in June, despite revenue and visitor numbers hitting five-year highs.
 <br>
  <br>
  Announcing its results on Thursday, the theme park also said it will capitalise on the presence of six giant pandas to drive park attendance and income.
  <br>
  <br>
  From December 8, the public will get to meet two pandas sent by the central government as gifts to the SAR, followed by locally-bred twin cubs as early as February next year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will capitalise on the presence of six giant pandas in the park to drive citywide excitement, thereby increasing visitor numbers and revenue while promoting panda tourism and ecological conservation in Hong Kong," said Ocean Park chairman Paulo Pong.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the 2023-24 fiscal year, the theme park's total revenue increased 41 percent year-on-year to HK$1.18 billion, primarily driven by a 54 percent growth in admission income.
  <br>
  <br>
  Revenue from merchandise jumped 27 percent, while catering income rose 32 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The park also welcomed 33 percent more visitors at 3.14 million in 2023-24, when compared with the same period last year. Visitors from the mainland, India and the Philippines showed significant year-on-year growth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Still, the theme park recorded a financial deficit of HK$71.6 million in the period ending June 30.
  <br>
  <br>
  Excluding government subsidies and depreciation, its net operating loss narrowed for a third straight year to HK$297 million, with the park saying the figure reflected "sustained upward momentum in operations and business performance" with cost-saving and revenue-generating measures in place.
  <br>
  <br>
  As of the end of June, the park's bank balance and cash totalled roughly HK$1.66 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will continue to pursue diverse revenue sources and aim for continued improvement in our financial performance over the medium to long term, despite prevailing external economic uncertainties. Through our operating income, we seek to contribute to society, future generations, and environmental conservation, thereby reducing reliance on public finances," Pong said.

 The government on Thursday warned that technology-related crimes are on the rise in Hong Kong, while vowing to work with other jurisdictions to take on the challenges new technology poses.
 <br>
  <br>
  At the Asia and Pacific Regional Conference of the International Association of Prosecutors, Chief Executive John Lee said the SAR attaches great importance to ensuring the security of cyber infrastructure.

  "In Hong Kong, a highly developed international financial centre where technology is easily accessible by all, criminals are increasingly turning to the use of cryptocurrencies, virtual assets and technology in committing traditional crime. And crimes executed solely through technology are also on the rise," Lee said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That's why Hong Kong places great emphasis on the security of cyber infrastructure, in fighting technology crime, locally and internationally."
  <br>
  <br>
  Secretary for Justice Paul Lam told the same conference that crimes involving modern technology present "novel challenges" to prosecutors, adding that it can be difficult to bring offenders to justice.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Modern technology is, of course, not inherently evil. It becomes evil only when it is misused and abused by criminals," Lam said. "Our overriding objective is not only to prevent, suppress and punish such misuses and abuses, but also to outwit the criminals by becoming better users of modern technology and make modern technology our close ally in our war against the criminals."
  <br>
  <br>
  Tong Jianming, first deputy prosecutor general of the Supreme People's Procuratorate, said it is important for jurisdictions to adapt to changes brought about by technological developments.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that Beijing is willing to collaborate with others on using modern technology in strengthening prosecutions and looking into effective ways to tackle crime.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A property analyst says housing prices are bottoming out and should stabilise next year, with possible growth of under five percent.
 <br>
  <br>
  Hannah Jeong, head of valuation and advisory services at CBRE, was commenting after official data showed that home prices went up in October after declining for five months.
  <br>
  <br>
  Data showed private residential prices were up 0.6 percent month-on-month. In September, prices dropped to their lowest level in eight years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rents in October recorded their first fall since February, falling 0.3 percent month-on-month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jeong said the major reasons for the upswing in prices were local banks lowering their prime rates after the US central bank began cutting interest rates in September.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government relaxing the maximum loan-to-value (LTV) ratio for all residential properties to 70 percent, regardless of the value of the property and whether it is for self-occupation, also had an impact, she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think we only have three or two months to go. So the decline or the overall negative growth will continue within this year," Jeong said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But 2025, possibly we are bottoming out and then see slight positive growth, possibly less than five percent, or remain stable or flat. So that's the forecast for 2025."
  <br>
  <br>
  The analyst noted the rental market was performing quite well, with a yield reaching about 3.3 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said she expected this upward trend to continue in 2025, due to the number of people entering the city under various government talent schemes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jeong also said there was a very strong desire for home ownership in Hong Kong, and next year, when the supply of new flats was expected to peak at around 26,000, this would provide a good opportunity for potential homebuyers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So I think we are facing the supply peak, obviously, at the wrong time. But this will give a good opportunity to homebuyers. People were waiting a very long time and unfortunately during Covid, people thought the market will be soft. But we had a 2020 price peak and people are losing money, whoever bought at that moment," she explained.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So now people learned a lesson and expect that if the price is much more affordable at this moment, people want to have a home."
  <br>
  <br>
  She also said developers were keen to get rid of their new units and were offering good incentives in the first-hand market.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Secretary Eric Chan on Wednesday said a three-day visit to the Greater Bay Area has offered authorities insight into developing the Northern Metropolis project in the New Territories.
 <br>
  <br>
  Concluding the three-day visit to Guangdong province attended by government officials and business leaders, Chan said the trip had met its goal.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This trip to different major cities is purely an introduction, an exchange. We do not require business representatives to make any investments," Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I hope that they are able to see business opportunities, because they are truly the experts in doing business. When they see business opportunities, naturally, they will hold discussions [with others]."
  <br>
  <br>
  During the trip, enterprises from Guangdong and Hong Kong signed 126 economic and trade cooperation projects worth a total value of more than 100 billion yuan.
  <br>
  <br>
  The delegation also learnt about a “large-scale, land-disposable” development model used in mainland cities, which the SAR administration hopes can be used to expedite development in the Northern Metropolis.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan also said the government will hold a "promotional event" relating to the mega project on Friday, with local, mainland and foreign companies expected to attend.
  <br>
  <br>
  Finance chief Paul Chan is hammering out the details and will make an announcement in due course, the chief secretary added.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Banker Peter Wong has been named the new chairman of the University of Hong Kong (HKU) governing council, succeeding barrister Priscilla Wong after her term ends next month.
 <br>
  <br>
  The government on Wednesday announced the appointment of the banker, who was previously the Asia-Pacific chief executive officer at HSBC, for a term of three years with effect from January 1, 2025.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chief Executive John Lee, in his capacity as the university's chancellor, also appointed five new members to the governing council.
  <br>
  <br>
  They include former director general of civil aviation Simon Li; Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) Standing Committee member Irons Sze; lawmaker Rock Chen; former president of the Hong Kong Institute of Human Resource Management Wilfred Wong; and CPPCC delegate Samuel Yung.
  <br>
  <br>
  Five other current members will also leave the governing council, alongside the outgoing chairwoman.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The newly appointed members are all elites in the community, possessing outstanding capabilities and rich experience," the government said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The chief executive hopes that the new appointments will provide the HKU's governance with a new outlook and new impetus, begin a new chapter in governance, steer the HKU towards striving for excellence and provide fresh momentum to the university."
  <br>
  <br>
  The university, for its part, said it respects the appointments made by the administration.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The university will continue to pursue excellence and make contributions in academic excellence, talent cultivation and international cooperation," HKU said.
  <br>
  <br>
  In June, a task force was established amid a conflict among the university's leadership, with vice-chancellor Zhang Xiang complaining that he was left in the dark about appointments made by Priscilla Wong.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the government statement, the chief executive thanked the task force “for its unremitting efforts in coordinating the HKU's internal operations, enhancing communication, assisting in resolving issues, reaching a consensus, and achieving a positive outcome”.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The group will continue its work to facilitate collaboration between the new council and the management for the continuous enhancement of the HKU's governance effectiveness."

    Auditor finds hitches with care home voucher scheme

<img alt="The auditor said welfare officials need to resolve some administrative issues with the Residential Care Service Voucher Scheme. File photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1781061_1_20241127153405.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Audit Commission said on Wednesday that it has found a number of administrative issues with a government voucher scheme for elderly people to pay for care homes, such as incorrect charges and widely varying application processing times.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a report, the commission said more than 5,700 applications for the Residential Care
  <br>
  Service Voucher scheme were received in 2022-23 and 2023-24, and as of the end of March this year, 3,179 vouchers had been issued.
  <br>
  <br>
  Welfare officials haven't given a timeline on how long applications should take, but the auditor found it can vary greatly, from issuance the same day all the way to a wait of seven months. The average time was 43 days, it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The auditor also found that some voucher recipients were wrongly sent bills for charges that were supposed to be covered by the government, or were overcharged by homes for extra items like nutritional drinks.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Social Welfare Department is tasked with inspecting service providers, as well as carrying out visits to check various aspects of the voucher scheme, such as the fees being charged.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the auditor found that in the previous three financial years, inspections were carried out 41 days late on average, while visits were 232 days overdue. The department blamed the delays on the Covid pandemic.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[The social welfare director should] take measures to ensure that service monitoring visits and inspections are conducted in accordance with the timeframes stipulated in the department's guidelines," the commission said.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also made a series of other recommendations, such a specific timeframe for processing voucher applications and a mechanism for vetting care home charges.
  <br>
  <br>
  The department said it agreed with the recommendations and will take the necessary follow-up action.

 Four people who were jailed for conspiracy to commit subversion in Hong Kong's largest national security trial to date have appealed against their convictions and sentences.
 <br>
  <br>
  Former activist Owen Chow, former lawmaker Helena Wong, former district councillor Clarisse Yeung and ex-hospital worker Winnie Yu filed their appeals to the High Court on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The hearing date has not been scheduled, according to the judiciary website.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last week, the High Court handed down jail terms to 45 people for their roles in a scheme aiming to bring down the government by organising an unsanctioned Legco primary poll, with sentences ranging from four years and two months to 10 years behind bars.
  <br>
  <br>
  The four who lodged the appeals were among those who pleaded not guilty but were convicted after trial.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chow was slapped with a jail sentence of seven years and nine months; Yu received a prison term of six years and nine months; and Wong and Yeung were each sentenced to six-and-a-half years in jail.

    Auditor urges closer scrutiny of drone registrations

<img alt="The Audit Commission says it found numerous cases of " src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1781056_1_20241127152110.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Audit Commission has urged the Civil Aviation Department (CAD) to improve its verification procedures when registering drones, after finding multiple cases of "odd data" in the system.
 <br>
  <br>
  The commission said it looked at some of the more than 24,000 drone registrations recorded via the Electronic Portal for Small Unmanned Aircraft (eSUA) as of June this year, and found numerous discrepancies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rules on flying drones in Hong Kong, such as whether permission is needed from the authorities, vary depending – among other things – on the weight of the aircraft in question.
  <br>
  <br>
  But in some cases, the recorded weight of drones registered in the database did not match the standard weight for their model and appear to have ended up in the wrong category, the commission said in a report released on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also found that while drones should have a unique serial number, dozens in the database had duplicate numbers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another issue flagged up in the report was eSUA account holders deleting their accounts without deregistering their drones.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If an eSUA account has been deleted, there may no longer be any responsible person for the valid SUA [Small Unmanned Aircraft] held under the deleted account," the commission warned.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also discovered that as of June 30, several thousand registrations were "under verification" – with more than 1,250 languishing under this status for more than two years.
  <br>
  <br>
  The commission linked this to an earlier move by the authorities to streamline the registration process by scrapping a requirement for owners to provide a photograph of the registration label attached to their drone.
  <br>
  <br>
  "While CAD has drawn up plans and taken measures to handle the SUA under verification by 30 November 2024, CAD needs to continue to closely monitor the handling of the SUA under verification and take measures to ensure that those cases will be properly followed through," the commission said.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also found that as of the end of June, the CAD had dealt with 38 cases of suspected violations of the SUA Order under the Civil Aviation Ordinance, of which 13 involved tourists.
  <br>
  <br>
  "These indicated that visitors might not be well aware of the requirements under the SUA Order. With a view to enhancing the awareness of visitors on the SUA Order, CAD needs to make sustained efforts in arranging publicity and education targeting visitors," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Director-General of Civil Aviation, Victor Liu, said he generally agrees with the commission's recommendations.

    Police investigate cause of noise barrier fire

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Wednesday launched an investigation after a six-metre-tall noise barrier along a road in Tsuen Wan caught fire.
 <br>
  <br>
  Emergency personnel were called to Cheung Pei Shan Road near Shek Wai Kok Estate when the force received multiple fire reports at about 11am.
  <br>
  <br>
  Firefighters took about half an hour to put out the flames.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officers believe the blaze began beneath a footbridge near Shek Kuk House of Shek Wai Kok Estate, before spreading to the barrier.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chief inspector Law Sai-to of the Tsuen Wan district crime unit said emergency personnel did not find any accelerant at the scene.
  <br>
  <br>
  "During our investigations, we noticed some security cameras had captured the incident. However, since the location of the incident was accessible to anyone and was frequented by residents, and due to limited distance of the security cameras, the real cause of the fire is still under investigation," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The force added that though a 40-metre stretch of the road was burnt, the noise barrier structure was not at risk of collapsing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Videos posted online showed the structure engulfed in flames. "Wow, it's burning through the top," one driver in a video remarked.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another said: "There's no way we can drive through this."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Highways Department said it aims to fully reopen the road by early Thursday.

 Chief Executive John Lee on Wednesday told the banking sector to gear up and help realise the government's vision of turning Hong Kong into a regional green finance hub.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a luncheon session hosted by the Hong Kong Association of Banks, Lee pointed out that the government has issued HK$220 billion worth of green and sustainable bonds since May 2019.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee said a roadmap will soon be released to guide financial institutions in meeting international sustainable standards.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the coming weeks, we will launch a roadmap on the adoption of the International Financial Reporting Standards on Sustainability Disclosure. We aspire to make Hong Kong among the world's first jurisdictions to align local requirements with international sustainability reporting requirements," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, the chief executive noted that the government is just as committed to supporting the financial sector in innovation and adopting new technologies.
  <br>
  <br>
  He cited a new subsidy scheme launched earlier this year which gives a maximum grant of HK$150,000 for each approved fintech project.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The establishment in June of a dedicated proof-of-concept subsidy scheme for green fintech makes that clear. Among other things, it will provide early stage funding support for pre-commercialised green fintech projects,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Beyond its value in green and sustainable finance, fintech can help companies tap into new technology, including AI and blockchain, to boost efficiency and stay abreast of the competition.”

<div class="itemFullText">
 Customs officers on Wednesday said they arrested five men and two women in a series of anti-drugs operations this month involving "space oil" and an anaesthetic called etomidate, which is illegal to posses unless prescribed by a doctor.
 <br>
  <br>
  Officers said their operations led to the seizure of space oil capsules and etomidate powder with a total estimated market value of around HK$17 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The gaining popularity of space oil or etomidate, which is currently a part one poison abused by the young people, has aroused our enforcement attention," said acting assistant commissioner Wong Ho-yin.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The success of our enforcement in November demonstrates the strong determination of Hong Kong Customs in detecting the crimes relating to illicit etomidate or space oil," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong added that etomidate can cause tremors, dizziness, hallucinations and even brain damage.

    HKU to ensure Hong Kong's doctor supply

 The head of the University of Hong Kong's medical faculty said on Wednesday that it is important to ensure that support for all medical schools will continue after the establishment of a third such institute in the city.
 <br>
  <br>
  The government said earlier that a medical school will be set up in the Northern Metropolis. So far, three universities have submitted proposals to run it.
  <br>
  <br>
  Professor Lau Chak-sing said HKU will help ensure there are enough doctors to serve the people of Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will continue to do our very best in training the best doctors with diversification, so they will not just be good in looking after patients, but also have a good understanding of disease mechanism, medical and health research, and be able to contribute to research development in Hong Kong and beyond," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lau added that the university's plan to establish a new graduate-entry medical programme can help produce the right doctors for the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have been receiving students who have completed a first degree before joining us in studying medicine [as a second bachelor's degree]. We have some experience in these students, and these students are more mature, more empathetic, and we find this is a useful development within the medical faculty," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Lau said the faculty's new clinical trial centre in Hetao which opened last week will provide a one-stop platform for training medical talent in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the centre aims to increase the standards of clinical trials by coordinating different stakeholders' needs, including the two existing medical schools, and public and private hospitals.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The institute is a common platform to facilitate clinical trials development in Hong Kong, we hope to attract industry investment in Hong Kong, attract clinical trials to be performed and conducted in Hong Kong as well as the Greater Bay Area," Lau said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that the centre will train as much talent as possible so the city's medical industry can continue to thrive.

    Three-year jail terms proposed over substandard flats

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government is proposing that landlords who rent out poor quality subdivided flats face prison terms of up to three years and fines as high as HK$300,000.
 <br>
  <br>
  Plans to regulate such cramped homes include a minimum flat size of 86 square feet, or eight square metres, with rooms having a minimum height of 2.3 metres.
  <br>
  <br>
  Documents submitted to Legco on Wednesday set out proposals for further requirements, including fire detectors and fire-resistant walls, as well as a ban on toilets being placed on balconies or outer corridors of buildings.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials say as well as proper ventilation and lighting, each subdivided flat should have its own water and electrical meters.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Housing Bureau says renting out a flat that isn't certified would also be illegal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lawmakers are due to discuss the plans on December 2, with a public consultation exercise beginning the following day and lasting until February 10.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bureau says it hopes the bill will be passed next year and that registration of subdivided flats can get underway in the final quarter.

    Lawmaker labels new arts blueprint 'a breakthrough'

<img alt="Works by German artist Markus Lupertz on display at this year's Art Basel Hong Kong. Under the government's blueprint, the city will strive to become an East-meets-West cultural exchange hub.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A member of the government's Advisory Committee on Arts Development says a new blueprint for the sector is a big leap forward.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lawmaker Johnny Ng told Hong Kong Today's Ben Tse that the development plan was very comprehensive and could build up the city as an East-meets-West centre for international cultural exchanges, as expressed in the National 14th Five-Year Plan.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government unveiled its Blueprint for Arts and Culture and Creative Industries Development on Tuesday, with dozens of measures for the city's creative industries.
  <br>
  <br>
  It spells out four key directions, including promoting Chinese culture, building an international platform for cultural exchanges, and refining the ecosystem for creative industries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ng told RTHK that the overhaul of arts funding was a "big breakthrough" that would see greater support towards individual artists or smaller groups.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We can see that some small and medium-sized artist groups will be funded by the ADC (Arts Development Council), while the nine largest major performing arts groups will be supported by ACAD (Advisory Committee on Arts Development). I think we can see that in between, there's some mobility we can enhance in order to support individuals, small artists to get funding," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Currently, government subventions are given to nine major performing arts groups - including the Hong Kong Ballet, the Hong Kong Philharmonic Orchestra and the Chung Ying Theatre Company - and grants to small and medium arts groups.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ng said that by striving to become an East-meets-West regional arts hub, tourism and other sectors in Hong Kong would also benefit.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was hopeful that more film festivals, art auctions and art tech exhibitions could be hosted in the SAR.

 The public will get to meet two pandas sent by the central government as gifts to the SAR on December 8, a day after a greeting ceremony at Ocean Park.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chief Executive John Lee said the names of the giant pandas, which arrived here from Sichuan in September, will be unveiled by officials at the ceremony, following a naming competition organised by the government.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee added that he and his wife recently visited the pandas with Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism Kevin Yeung.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We saw that the pair of giant pandas were energetic and lively," he wrote on social media.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The park told me that the pair have adapted to their new environment very quickly, and they're doing well."
  <br>
  <br>
  The pair's addition raises to six the number of giant pandas currently in the SAR, after Ying Ying gave birth to a pair of cubs in August.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A former inmate has credited a local charity with helping him reintegrate into society and overcome many challenges in his life.
 <br>
  <br>
  John has now become one of the ambassadors of the Sports Change Life Foundation, which provides sports companionship and mentorship to inmates, rehabilitated individuals and those facing adversity.
  <br>
  <br>
  The foundation is one of the beneficiaries of this year's Operation Santa Claus (OSC) and has organised the project "Free Running Peer Exercise Reform Plan - Join Together to Save Calories for the Warmth Campaign".
  <br>
  <br>
  The idea is that the number of calories burnt during the exercise is exchanged for food and Christmas meals to be donated to the needy.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Before, I don't believe that I can keep running for 10 kilometres. But through this kind of practice, step by step, I can break through some obstacles and make me to build up my confidence and let me to believe that I can stand up again. It's very important to me to build a positive mindset to myself that helps me to reintegrate into the society," said John (not his real name).
  <br>
  <br>
  Fundraising director Chu Ki-sum said peer-running programmes were designed to train inmates and rehabilitated individuals as ambassadors, who eventually visit schools to share their experiences, inspire youth to steer clear of drugs and crime, promote healthy values, and prevent delinquency.
  <br>
  <br>
  John added that the funding would cover expenses for professional coaching, running equipment, resources, and school visits.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For the training and also after the training we have some gathering so this gathering can build a friendship to support them and just like the guardians to help them to integrate into society," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jointly organised by RTHK and South China Morning Post, OSC funds charitable projects that focus on children and youth, the elderly, the community, those with physical and mental disabilities, medical projects, and those concerning the environment.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong government on Tuesday strongly disapproved and opposed a letter from US politicians to the country’s treasury secretary, saying that it damages the SAR’s reputation as an international financial centre.
 <br>
  <br>
  An SAR government spokesman stressed that the allegations had no factual basis and the letter was a “crude and reprehensible attempt to spread lies and misinformation about Hong Kong for personal political gain”.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the government “has been enforcing the sanctions imposed by the United Nations Security Council fully and vigorously to fulfil our international obligations”.
  <br>
  <br>
  The spokesman added that maintaining the integrity and robustness of the city's financial systems is a top priority for the SAR government.

  "Hong Kong has been recognised by the Financial Action Task Force, the international standard-setter on anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism, to be overall compliant with the relevant international standards, with a robust legal framework and effective system in this area, especially in the identification and understanding of risks, law enforcement, asset recovery and international co-operation," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The letter by US lawmakers alleged Hong Kong is playing an "increasing role as a financial hub for money laundering, sanctions evasion, and other illicit financial activities".

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Tuesday said they arrested 59 people, after officers busted syndicates allegedly linked to loan shark and illegal debt collection activities involving a total of more than HK$39 million.
 <br>
  <br>
  The force said the suspects, between the ages of 20 and 76, are alleged to have targeted foreign domestic helpers
  <br>
  <br>
  They said syndicate members used different methods to deduct the amount of money the borrower actually received, such as forcing them to purchase goods or pay administration fees. The victims then had to repay the loan at a high-interest rate.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The syndicate took advantage of lenders who have borrowing needs,” said Ho Yan-ki, the Chief Inspector of Hong Kong Island Regional Crime Unit.
  <br>
  <br>
  The force said officers seized over HK$1 million in cash, passports, employment contracts and loan agreements during the operation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho encouraged foreign domestic helpers and their employers to contact police if they encountered such loan shark syndicates.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A renowned theatre producer and curator on Tuesday welcomed the government's new roadmap on promoting arts and culture development in Hong Kong, saying it provides a comprehensive plan for the sector's growth.
 <br>
  <br>
  Mathias Woo, co-Artistic director and executive director of Zuni Icosahedron, said the 71 measures in the Blueprint for Arts and Culture and Creative Industries Development are very comprehensive, covering almost all aspects.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It covers venues, it covers exchange, it covers personnel training, facility, [role of West Kowloon Cultural District Authority]. Somehow I think it's a very, very good start,” he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  Woo said he hopes the West Kowloon Cultural District Authority can more proactively reach out to art groups and allow them long-term use of its performance venues.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The blueprint mentioned that the authority should pick up a stronger role in facilitating culture and creative industry. I think it has to strengthen its connection with the industry and also to build a more content-based venue, which means, like in London, you have the Royal Ballet, the art groups have their own venue and their own home base,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tam Kwok-kan, a member of the Arts Development Council, also welcomed the news, especially the idea of industrialising the sector.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The industrialisation of art and culture makes it something that can involve people, involve talents, involve artists, not just in their own production, in their own creativity, but also make their work marketable,” he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tam, who’s also the dean of the School of Humanities and Social Science at Hang Seng University, said he believes this focus can help showcase the work of arts groups to the outside world.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Many of the art groups in Hong Kong do not know how to market their products. So this blueprint has a focus on marketisation, not just let the different art groups to work alone, but to create synergies among them, and to build a platform for them to market their work, not just in Hong Kong, not just in China, but also in places outside Hong Kong,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tam added that he thinks the government should accord priority to developing the theatre and film industries, saying theatre performances and movies are good ways to attract tourists and showcase Hong Kong.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ombudsman Jack Chan announced on Tuesday that he has launched an investigation into construction waste recycling services provided by the government, as well as its work in combating illegal dumping.
 <br>
  <br>
  The government implemented the Construction Waste Disposal Charging Scheme almost two decades ago and also rolled out a pilot scheme in 2021 for people to make reservations for recycling construction waste through the app "HoHoSkips".
  <br>
  <br>
  But Chan noted that waste is still illegally disposed of in public places.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This not only causes inconvenience and safety hazards for the public and road users but also affects environmental hygiene and requires additional public resources for disposal," he said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan also said data suggests the app might be underused.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Therefore, I have decided to launch this direct investigation operation to scrutinise the existing management of construction waste, including the EPD's control and preventive measures against illegal disposal of construction waste, specific details and operating situations of the 'HoHoSkips' service, how its effectiveness is monitored, and relevant promotion and publicity initiatives."
  <br>
  <br>
  The public have until December 27 to submit any views they have on the matter.

    Govt 'respects' CFA ruling on same-sex couples

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government and the Housing Authority on Tuesday both said they respect the top court's ruling that grants subsidised housing benefits to same-sex couples.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Court of Final Appeal affirmed lower court rulings made earlier, saying that it also finds current policies discriminatory and unconstitutional.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will study the judgment thoroughly and seek legal advice from the Department of Justice for appropriate follow-up actions," a government spokesman said.
  <br>
  <br>
  A Housing Authority spokesman also said it will study the judgment in detail and seek legal advice where necessary for taking follow-up actions.
  <br>
  <br>
  One of the litigants involved in the case, Nick Infinger, said he is happy he won the case after a six-year legal battle, saying this means same-sex couples have the right to live together.
  <br>
  <br>
  He told reporters that he hopes Hong Kong can become more equal and fair. "I feel quite excited because the court made the judgment in favour of us," he said outside court.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think the most important thing is not only fighting for me and for my partner, but this is fighting for all the same-sex couples in Hong Kong."
  <br>
  <br>
  DAB lawmaker Holden Chow expressed concern over the verdict, saying it might affect public housing resources.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We would foresee following the verdict today there might be a lot of same-sex couples
  <br>
  getting married abroad and then they come back to Hong Kong and apply for public housing."
  <br>
  <br>
  So the question now is what is the impact on the public housing resources to be allocated to traditional families? These are the concerns shared by the general public," he said.

    Govt unveils arts and culture industry blueprint

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government has vowed to leverage Hong Kong's strengths to make the SAR an international cultural exchange centre, as it unveiled a development plan with dozens of measures for the city's creative industries.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Blueprint for Arts and Culture and Creative Industries Development spells out four key directions -- promoting Chinese culture, developing diverse creative industries, building an international platform for cultural exchanges, and refining the ecosystem for creative industries.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also includes 71 measures covering industries such as film, music, and performing arts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Around half of the initiatives have commenced, with the remaining beginning from next year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ultimate goal, the administration said, is to turn Hong Kong into an "East-meets-West" centre for international cultural exchange.
  <br>
  <br>
  Culture, sports and tourism minister Kevin Yeung on Tuesday said the blueprint is a "macro policy document" that is not "cast in stone".
  <br>
  <br>
  "One unique aspect of art and creative industries is that they evolve over time with social development. The specific measures won't remain unchanged," Yeung said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We'll keep an open mind when discussing with industry stakeholders. We'll review priorities for individual development paths and measures, explore new ideas aligned with the blueprint's vision and principles, and provide support with our resources."
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities hope the economic benefit generated by creative industries will go from HK$122 billion in 2022 to HK$200 billion by 2034.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another goal is for the number of jobs generated by such sectors to rise from more than 220,000, to 264,000 over the same period.
  <br>
  <br>
  The measures include establishing a museum in the Northern Metropolis on the nation's development and achievements; displaying works of local artists and designers in government offices and buildings as a bid to make Hong Kong the "capital of creativity"; and promoting the city's unique pop culture on the mainland and around the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  On enhancing the ecosystem, the blueprint mentions a comprehensive review of the current funding mechanism for arts groups.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeung said groups could be added to, or removed from, the subsidised list, although not based on one individual factor.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Over time, we aim to maintain a balance in our different funding systems by considering various factors, and we plan to keep this approach in the future," Yeung said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We look at things like the individual art level, audience response, the impact on promoting sector growth, and whether the ideas are innovative. All these factors could serve as criteria when we update the funding mechanism."
  <br>
  <br>
  The blueprint puts an emphasis on participation from the whole of society and it shouldn't only be the government that pours in resources for arts and culture, the minister added.

    CFA affirms housing rights of same-sex couples

<img alt="The five-judge panel of the top court unanimously rejects the appeal from the Housing Authority. File photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1780848_1_20241126121312.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's top court has affirmed earlier court rulings granting subsidised housing benefits to same-sex couples, after finding current policies discriminatory and unconstitutional.
 <br>
  <br>
  The five-judge panel of the Court of Final Appeal (CFA), led by Chief Justice Andrew Cheung, unanimously rejected an appeal from the Housing Authority.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lower courts had granted the rights to subsidised housing benefits to two same-sex couples married overseas.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CFA on Tuesday rejected the Housing Authority's argument that under the Basic Law, only opposite-sex married couples are entitled to apply for public housing, overriding provisions on equality.
  <br>
  <br>
  The judges held that while only opposite-sex couples can obtain the legal status of marriage under Hong Kong's constitutional framework, this doesn't shield housing policies from scrutiny under equality provisions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Entitlements to apply for [public rental housing] units and [Home Ownership Scheme] flats are only some of those [legal] rights, but they do not go to the status of marriage itself," the judgement read.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[The Basic Law article on marriage] therefore does not remove the subject Housing Authority policies from the purview of the equality provisions."
  <br>
  <br>
  The housing body had also argued that same-sex and heterosexual married couples weren't comparable because the latter can give birth, therefore supporting the government's policy objective on population growth.
  <br>
  <br>
  The judges rejected this argument, saying same-sex couples can adopt children or have children through artificial means.
  <br>
  <br>
  They also said they found the authority's policies aimed at supporting traditional family to be "disproportionate and unjustified", saying it didn't offer enough evidence over their arguments.
  <br>
  <br>
  The judges said the authority did not address the likely effect on housing supply or the impact on opposite-sex couples if the policies were relaxed.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CFA dismissed the authority's appeal and ordered it to pay for the legal costs of the respondents.
  <br>
  <br>
  The court also ruled against the government in a related case regarding the inheritance of property.
  <br>
  <br>
  Edgar Ng, now deceased, had wished to add his same-sex spouse as a registered occupant and joint owner to a Home Ownership Scheme flat.
  <br>
  <br>
  The secretary for justice had argued that foreign same-sex marriages aren't comparable to heterosexual marriages when it comes to inheritance rights.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CFA judges ruled that excluding same-sex spouses from inheritance amounted to unlawful discrimination.

<div class="itemFullText">
 University of Hong Kong (HKU) researchers on Tuesday said stress levels of employees in the service industry must be dealt with for the SAR to further promote the hospitality sector.
 <br>
  <br>
  HKU's business school, together with the Hong Kong Association for Customer Service Excellence (HKACE), conducted three rounds of studies during and after Covid, involving about 1,000 employees in the service industry.
  <br>
  <br>
  They said they found that employees are now more stressed out, with almost 45 percent reporting they frequently experienced burnout in the post-pandemic period, up from 15 percent during the Covid crisis.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bennett Yim, a marketing professor with the school, described the survey findings as "shocking", adding that people had had high hopes for society to rebound after Covid.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Businesses have not improved substantially. A lot of the organisations and companies on one hand want to rebuild their business, and at the same time, customers also have high expectations in the post-Covid period," Yim said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When the two things come together, they're putting a lot of pressure on employees who are providing services to customers."
  <br>
  <br>
  Yim said the stress issues of employees, especially frontline workers, must be addressed for the city to further promote the hospitality sector.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We see more tourists returning to Hong Kong. At the same time, we see a manpower shortage, particularly in the service industry. Because of that, it adds more stress to the employees which certainly affects the service provided to tourists," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  HKACE honorary advisor Buston Chu said employers should provide workers with flexible arrangements, and also enhance their engagement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Get your employees involved. Let them know their purpose and that they are a very important stakeholder to make Hong Kong a place of hospitality. I think this is something the management have to do," Chu said.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Senior Citizen Home Safety Association on Tuesday said it has been proactively informing and advising elderly people about an impending cold spell, and has bolstered manpower to support those requiring assistance.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on an RTHK programme, the group's head, Maura Wong, said there has not been a notable uptick in requests for assistance from the elderly lately, adding that a surge in help requests typically occurs approximately three days after a sharp temperature decline.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong urged senior citizens to prioritise their well-being, cautioning that a significant temperature decrease could greatly affect their health.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Generally, when the temperature drops, we notice several things. The elderly may complain of intensified pain, their blood circulation may not be that good, or they don't exercise or they find they lose their balance and fall, or suffer from dizziness," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In more serious cases, they may experience problems with their trachea."
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Cheng Yuen-chung, an assistant director at the observatory, said on the same programme that temperatures could dip as low as 16 degrees on Wednesday and 15 degrees on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said temperatures in southern China are still within the normal range despite the impact of global warming.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our preliminary forecast is that the number of cold days this winter will be close to normal. What is considered normal? Generally speaking, the normal range of cold weather days in Hong Kong is 9 to 17 days. Last year, there were 14 cold days, which is within the normal range," he said.

 The innovation and technology chief on Tuesday expressed confidence in the use of artificial intelligence and robotics, saying these are “immensely promising”.
 <br>
  <br>
  Sun Dong, the secretary for innovation, technology and industry, also told a summit on AI and robotics that such technologies not only enhance productivity and service quality, but also offer greater convenience and better quality of life.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Coupled with the vast market size and population in the Greater Bay Area, the benefits of AI and robotics applications, alongside the associated business opportunities, are immensely promising and substantial,” Sun said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also said the SAR offers a “perfect setting” for the technologies to flourish, and that the city is moving towards becoming an international IT centre.
  <br>
  <br>
  The event, organised by the Hong Kong Productivity Council, explores the trends and applications of AI and robotics.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The director of the central government's liaison office on Monday urged Hong Kong and Guangdong to work together to bring positive developments for the Greater Bay Area (GBA).
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at the Guangdong-Hong Kong Deepening Economic, Trade and Investment Cooperation Conference in Guangzhou, Zheng Yanxiong said Hong Kong's economy and society have seen improvements with the help of the central government.
  <br>
  <br>
  He hopes the SAR and Guangdong could lead the GBA on the development of innovation and technology.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I hope Guangdong and Hong Kong can make good use of the advantages of the innovation and industrial chains of the GBA, focusing on emerging fields like artificial intelligence, life sciences, low-altitude economy and green development," Zheng said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The two places should accelerate the cultivation and creation of new industries, and develop new quality productive forces."
  <br>
  <br>
  Guangdong party secretary Huang Kunming said the GBA has unlimited prospects, with the size of the economy reaching over 10 trillion yuan last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I hope everyone can improve together with Guangdong, making use of different advantages, with Hong Kong serving as a super-connector and a super value-adder, and helping Guangdong and Hong Kong go global together," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chief Executive John Lee, who is leading a delegation of government officials and business leaders on a visit to the GBA, also attended the conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said Hong Kong and Guangdong reached agreement on 126 economic and trade cooperation projects totalling more than 100 billion yuan at the meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  Of these projects, 101 involve Hong Kong businesses investing in Guangdong, with a total value exceeding 91 billion yuan.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They cover areas like financial cooperation, modern logistics, smart productions, biomedicine and artificial intelligence, demonstrating the love for the country and family as well as practical actions by Hong Kong entrepreneurs in actively serving the development of Guangdong and the mainland," Lee said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The delegation arrived in Foshan on Monday night on the next leg of their visit. Lee will return to Hong Kong on Tuesday, with Chief Secretary Eric Chan continuing to lead the delegation that will also visit Dongguan, Huizhou and Shenzhen.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Labour officials on Monday said they plan to start using drones in around a year's time to check safety issues at construction sites.
 <br>
  <br>
  In the first half of this year, there were 11 fatal industrial accidents, two more than during the same period last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials said they will use drones for taking photos from the air and will then use the pictures to generate 3D models to help with law enforcement and evidence collection.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With the advantage of being able to fly, [the drones] can collect evidence and take photos for us," an assistant labour commissioner, Wan Chi-ping, told lawmakers at a manpower panel meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're now working along this line to see how we can help our staff in patrolling and inspecting various sites in Hong Kong."
  <br>
  <br>
  Wan said officials are now buying the drones needed, and some 20 members of staff are being trained to control them.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials also said they will look at eliminating risky work tasks or lowering workers' exposure to such activities by helping the sector use technology to improve occupational safety and health.

 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Monday said Hong Kong will continue to play an important role in helping companies in the Greater Bay Area (GBA) go global.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Greater Bay Area Listed Companies Summit, Chan described the GBA as a developed economy, and said companies in the area are vital for the country's opening-up.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the SAR, as an international financial centre, can help create more opportunities and add value for GBA companies.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Under the geopolitical haze, mainland companies are facing unprecedented challenges when they raise funds in the Western markets. Hong Kong will reform the financial market in response to the situation to gather more domestic and overseas funds to support projects and companies in the GBA," Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As long as they are beneficial to companies, the development of Hong Kong's financial market, and the development of the country, we will actively study and push forward the policies."
  <br>
  <br>
  Qi Bin, deputy director of Beijing's liaison office, said there are 5,000 listed companies in the GBA, and they help promote cooperation in areas like finance, economics and trade.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I hope listed companies in the GBA could actively make use of Hong Kong's advantages, and treat the city as a base for overseas expansion. While consolidating the American and Western markets, we should work together and expand into emerging markets like the Asean, Middle East and Latin America," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong's member of the National People's Congress Standing Committee, Starry Lee, meanwhile thanked the country for supporting the city's development as an international financial centre, international aviation hub and offshore renminbi hub.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A Hospital Authority director on Monday said holding senior managers to account for any medical blunders at public hospitals won't mean that lower-ranked staff involved will be off the hook.
 <br>
  <br>
  Bosses have pledged to improve governance and spell out the responsibility of staff of all ranks, after a special committee submitted 31 recommendations following a three-month review.
  <br>
  <br>
  As part of the reform, the authority said it will develop a framework to strengthen the accountability of senior staff.
  <br>
  <br>
  Michael Wong, the authority's director of quality and safety, said a reform committee will look at a reward and penalty system.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Senior management under the accountability framework include hospital chief executives and department heads. Although they're the ones who'll mainly be held responsible, it doesn't mean that no other colleagues should take responsibility," Wong told an RTHK programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Those overseeing hospital wards have their corresponding responsibilities, which will be evaluated during the employees' annual appraisals."
  <br>
  <br>
  The authority's chairman, Henry Fan, previously said authorities might freeze the pay of senior managers for blunders, but firing employees might not be an option due to a manpower crunch faced by the public healthcare sector.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alex Lam, from Hong Kong Patients' Voices, said Fan's comment gives a bad impression.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If there's no dismissal mechanism when an employee makes a grave mistake, it seems to be like a 'get-out-of-jail free card', which says the employee can keep their job regardless of their mistake, and at worst, may only have their salary frozen," Lam said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong Sports Institute cycling head coach Hervé Dagorne on Monday hailed as a success Sunday's cross-border road race, an event that was largely seen as the first major test ahead of the 15th National Games to be held next year.
 <br>
  <br>
  Dagorne said the organisation of the race, which featured dozens of cyclists traversing a 230-kilometre route that included a crossing of the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge, was behind the positive result.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I was very impressed with how smooth it all turned out," Dagorne said. "This was the first time we could hold such a race passing through a bridge.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's one of the longest bridges in the world, so for us, we were able to gain more knowledge on how we can manage the actual race come next year. We were all very excited, and interested to see what we can achieve in the National Games."
  <br>
  <br>
  Dagorne also highlighted the obstacles that came with organising the large scale sporting event, and noted what needs to be done ahead of the Games.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The matter of immigration is an important aspect when it comes to organisation [of the race]." he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We must also determine how wind and slope can affect athletes – as such factors can be difficult to predict while passing a bridge compared to when on a car or bus."
  <br>
  <br>
  The race is set to be the first national sports event that connects Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macau.

  "The cyclists rode slightly faster than we thought. At first, we expected them to take around an hour and 30 minutes to complete the Hong Kong section of the race. But it turned out they completed the leg in an hour and 22 minutes," Yeung said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That meant that for the whole event, whether heading to Hong Kong Disneyland after passing the bridge as well as heading back to the mainland, it was faster than we anticipated."
  <br>
  <br>
  He said cyclists and their supporting crews told the office after the event that the race distance of 230km posed a challenge for them, and they also struggled with strong winds on the bridge, as well as light rain in Zhuhai and Macau.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Yeung said the cyclists managed to go faster once they had adapted to the environment.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also said the race route is suitable for the National Games, but did not rule out the possibility of making adjustments.

    HA looking to use AI to identify high-risk patients

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Public hospitals hope that artificial intelligence will help them identify and treat high risk patients at an earlier stage.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Hospital Authority's head of information technology and health informatics, Dr Cheung Ngai-tseung, said the authority was looking to incorporate AI into the existing clinical management system, which contains more than 10 million patients' records, to create automated tools to tailor individual treatments.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hospital services have been digitalised, including having paperless patient records that allow for real-time information updates on the authority's HA Go app, which enhances patients' self-care abilities.
  <br>
  <br>
  AI could be used to remind patients of specific prescriptions and laboratory results in the form of a blue elf on the screen.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dr Cheung spoke about future plans to further develop the system.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So the general capabilities as described is perhaps things like, more use of AI, more use of personalisation, more communication techniques, that sort of thing. Plus specific targeted interventions that will be maybe disease-specific or specific workflows that exist in today's hospitals," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dr Cheung added that more work was needed on specific cases and they were working on a fifth generation of the system.

    OSC funding helps promote inclusiveness in hiking

<div class="itemFullText">
 A charity advocating for the conservation of the city's countryside through connecting the public with nature is one of the beneficiaries of this year's Operation Santa Claus (OSC).
 <br>
  <br>
  Accessible Trails - a programme dedicated to promoting the benefits of nature to all walks of life - was started in 2017 by Parks and Trails Limited. The charity was founded in 2014 as a mobile application TrailWatch, which gives hikers a platform to track their hikes and report incidents of damage to trails.
  <br>
  <br>
  Its head of communications, Kwong Sum-yin, said the project also helped wheelchair users enjoy greater access to the countryside.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In Hong Kong, the countryside is actually very convenient. But for some groups of people, it is not as accessible as we think, especially those with disabilities," Kwong said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The project comprises two parts; first it identifies suitable hiking trails for wheelchair users and then it brings participants, their family members and volunteers to the field.
  <br>
  <br>
  17 hiking trails have been verified, and more than 180 wheelchair users and their carers have benefited from the programme since it started.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Some of the participants tell us that they've never been to the countryside of Hong Kong, or even the New Territories, because it is very inconvenient for them. [Through the programme], they say they can actually enjoy the environment. They feel peaceful and are very happy about that," Kwong said.
  <br>
  <br>
  But she said limited resources had prevented the programme from organising larger-scale activities.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hiking season in Hong Kong depends on the weather, so it may not be that long. For example, there was one particular trip - we wanted to see the Autumn village - and we have a time concern there as well. Given the limited resources, we cannot organise enough [activities]," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Sometimes, wheelchair users tell us it is very difficult to get into the programme, so they can't really go. We really want to expand this programme and have more resources to let more people to enjoy [the nature]," Kwong added.
  <br>
  <br>
  She also said the funding would be used not only to recruit more wheelchair users, but also volunteers to understand the difficulties of those with disabilities and contribute to create an inclusive experience.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jointly organised by RTHK and South China Morning Post, OSC funds charitable projects that focus on children and youth, the elderly, the community, those with physical and mental disabilities, medical projects, and those concerning the environment.

    Carbon monoxide poisoning leads to government warnings

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) on Sunday said people should only use gas water heaters in well-ventilated areas. It made the comment after a 56-year-old man, and two of his family members, were hospitalised on Saturday with carbon monoxide poisoning after he took a shower.
 <br>
  <br>
  All three were sent to Yan Chai Hospital. The man was later transferred to Pamela Youde Nethersole Eastern Hospital. His two family members, including a 13-year-old, were discharged.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Electrical and Mechanical Services Department (EMSD) also reminded people to only use gas water heaters which have a 'GU' mark, meaning they have been approved by the department.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, the government said all windows in the apartment were shut and the exhaust fan had not been turned on. An on-site inspection conducted by the EMSD showed that the flueless gas water heater at the home was not suitable to be used in bathrooms. The heater model also lacked approval from the department.
  <br>
  <br>
  The EMSD has seized the gas water heater. It will investigate whether any person has contravened the Gas Safety Ordinance.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CHP said that carbon monoxide is a colourless, odourless and tasteless gas which is a by-product from incomplete combustion of any fuel which contains carbon, such as wood, natural gas and gasoline.
  <br>
  <br>
  Exposure to a low concentration of carbon monoxide can lead to a range of symptoms such as dizziness, headache, tiredness and nausea. Exposure to a high concentration of carbon monoxide can lead to impaired vision, disturbed co-ordination, unconsciousness, brain damage or even death.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 American golfer Patrick Reed has won the Hong Kong Open in style, shooting a 22-under overall to clinch the title on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The overnight leader entered the final day with a three-shot lead, after notching a 59, an 18-hole record at the historic Fanling course.
  <br>
  <br>
  The PGA Tour professional ended up edging defending champion, Ben Campbell from New Zealand by the same margin.
  <br>
  <br>
  This was Reed's fifth time playing in Hong Kong, and he told reporters that he was glad to have finally triumphed.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's awesome playing this golf course, to come out and learn from the mistakes from the past on this place, and to go out and really feel like I was in command and control around a golf course," he told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I was able to hit quality golf shots after quality golf shots, which has always been a tough thing around here for me in the past."
  <br>
  <br>
  Local sensation Taichi Kho finished six shots behind Reed, good for a tied-sixth overall.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said he didn't have the best of starts on the final day, but he felt he bounced back well and there were still plenty of positive takeaways.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think I was just really focused out there and I was able to let myself play golf. You know, towards the start of it, I wasn't too comfortable to swing, so I was aiming away, aiming at the middle of the greens," the Hong Kong, China golfer said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But once I felt like I'd gone in the groove of it, I was able to aim at flags a bit more and get a bit more aggressive."
  <br>
  <br>
  Thousands of spectators were on hand for the tournament at the Fanling Golf Course, with many families bringing their children for a nice day out.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among them was Queenie, a mother of two who managed to share a photo moment with Kho.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I’m so excited, I got an autograph, a photograph with him. He’s so nice, very friendly,” she told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tournament was also a test event for next year’s National Games, when golf will be one of eight sports Hong Kong will be hosting while other events take place in Macau and Guangdong.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong Golf Club captain Andy Kwok said both local and mainland officials have been at the site in the past few days to gauge the operation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They assess various aspects of the tournament. My feeling is I think they are quite happy with what the club and the organisers have put forward in this tournament," Kwok told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hopefully we can carry this momentum forward to the National Games next year and put together a very good show for both Hong Kong and spectators from afar."
