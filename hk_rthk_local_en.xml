  <div class="itemFullText">
   Another monkey at the Hong Kong Zoological and Botanical Gardens has died, bringing the death toll to 12.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Leisure and Cultural Services Department said a De Brazza’s monkey that had been put under isolation died on Tuesday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A necropsy has been carried out to determine the cause of death.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It followed the deaths of 11 monkeys since the middle of the month, caused by sepsis after they caught melioidosis.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Officials said earlier workers had dug up the ground near the monkey enclosure and might have brought in contaminated soil on their shoes.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The government said the zoo's mammal section remains closed.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It also said the health conditions of 78 mammals and staff caring for the animals there are normal.

    Fresh bid to draw tourists to shopping malls

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The Travel Industry Council (TIC) on Tuesday announced a new programme to arrange in-depth tours for tourists at shopping malls during mega events in Hong Kong.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In collaboration with the hotel and retail sectors, the TIC has put 14 itineraries from six travel agencies on the China Mobile "MyLink" app targeting mainland visitors.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A bar-hopping tour in Tsim Sha Tsui during the Wine and Dine festival and a tour featuring Hong Kong's urban legends are among those on offer.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Fanny Yeung, the TIC's executive director, said the programme aims to leverage the city's mega events and encourage visitors to explore shopping malls.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Because right now a lot of individual travellers seldom visit shopping malls, and it didn't help us in our retail area. So we would like to include the retail part into this kind of in-depth tour to target this group of travellers," she said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Annie Yau Tse, chairwoman of the Retail Management Association, said five shopping malls will be covered, namely the IFC mall in Central, K11 Musea and THE ONE in Tsim Sha Tsui, Langham Place in Mong Kok, and the Temple Mall in Wong Tai Sin.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Tse said participants will receive gifts and discounts.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "After the pandemic, individual travellers come to Hong Kong for tourism experiences rather than shopping, so the current capacity is enough. [The new initiative] to bring group tourists to shopping malls is well within our capacity to accommodate," she said.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Police on Tuesday said they are investigating whether two men arrested in Tai Po for suspected burglary are connected to Sunday's break-in at the home of former police commissioner Andy Tsang.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Officers received a report at 10.30pm on Monday that a flat at the Wonderland Housing Estate was burgled, with three watches worth around HK$290,000 being stolen.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Two men, aged 31 and 36, were arrested on suspicion of burglary and attempted burglary, criminal damage and assaulting a police officer.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We found that the two suspects were hiding under a motorcycle cover outside a house in the village. When police identified themselves to the suspects, one of them tried to struggle and flee. He even pushed the police, causing the officer to suffer from a broken finger," said chief inspector Tam Tsz-wai.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Police said both suspects are two-way permit holders.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Tam added that the burgled flat is 1 kilometre away from Tsang's home, which was broken into on Sunday evening. A small amount of jewellery, watches and cash were stolen.

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Cathay Pacific has announced that its employees will receive a bonus equivalent to one month's salary, after the flag carrier said it saw good results this year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Alex McGowan, Chief Operations and Service Delivery Officer on Tuesday said he felt the company has to find ways to keep the best people in the industry.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Moving forward, of course, we always want to keep our remuneration competitive so that we can attract and retain the best people. We're very pleased, I think, over the course of the last year to have seen our turnover rates, our attrition rates, particularly in our pilot community, to come down to levels that we haven't seen for decades, not even pre-pandemic," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "But pilot turnover is now at historic lows, and I hope that that's testimony to the fact that our pilots enjoy working for Cathay and the opportunities that working for Cathay provides."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The group had in August posted a net profit of HK$3.6 billion for the first half of the year, but that was down 15 percent compared with the same period in 2023. It recorded a 14 percent on-year rise in revenue to HK$49.6 billion for the same period.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   McGowan was speaking to reporters after the celebration ceremony for the order of up to 150 aircraft with Airbus, during which the group's CEO, Ronald Lam said the expansion and modernisation of the Cathay fleet come as Hong Kong International Airport prepares to open its three-runway system at the end of the year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "From 2026, we'll start to take delivery of the second order of our narrow-body passenger aircraft, which will consist of A321neo as well as A320neo into both the Cathay Pacific, as well as HK Express fleet," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Then from 2027, we'll start to take delivery of A350 freighter to expand our cargo fleet so that we can continue to strengthen Hong Kong's number one air cargo hub status. From 2028 onwards, we'll start to take delivery of A330 new aircraft, the new generation A330," Lam added.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   MTR officials have warned that services on the Tung Chung Line are expected to be curtailed late on Saturday night, with no trains travelling between Tung Chung and Sunny Bay.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Free shuttle buses will be provided for people to travel between the two stations as major track diversion works take place as part of the Tung Chung Line extension in the two hours before the line's usual closure time.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The railway company said the last train from Tung Chung will depart at 11.01pm, while the last train going all the way to Tung Chung will leave Hong Kong Station at 11.07pm.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Trains from Hong Kong to Sunny Bay and vice-versa will run as usual.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The company’s chief of airport segment, Ben Lui, said services might also be affected on Sunday if there is any delay to the works.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “We have done a lot of preparation and planning, and our team will work closely together. Hopefully, we will have all the works completed before the next traffic day,” he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “We will try our best, and strive for the early completion of the works, without affecting train services on the next day.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   With a tropical cyclone expected to move closer to Hong Kong, the works may be postponed to the following Saturday if the weather is too bad, Lui said.

    Auctions for Lunar New Year fair stalls kick off

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Four fast food stalls at Victoria Park's annual Lunar New Year fair were auctioned off on Tuesday for a total of more than HK$600,000 with authorities saying the result reflected the current market sentiment.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Bidding for the stalls – one of which would have cost more than HK$500,000 before the Covid pandemic – saw two of the successful offers reaching the base price of HK$124,700. The amount for the most expensive stall reached HK$182,000, while the fourth stall was sold at HK$2,000 less than that amount.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department, which is in charge of the auction, said the prices reflected the current market situation.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The top bidder, surnamed Ng, said there were just a handful of bidders this time around, compared to more than a dozen in the preceding year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I will probably earn less of a profit compared to last year. But it's still worth a shot," he told reporters.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The bidding was less competitive because I know some fellow snack sellers are having a tough time making a living out there. So they didn't join the bidding."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A florist who successfully acquired a stall at the fair also thought the competition for flower stalls was not too fierce, because some sellers ended up with a lot of unsold stock last year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Auctions for other stalls, including those for dry goods, will be held in the next two days.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The fair will feature nearly 400 stalls at Victoria Park for a week starting from January 23.

   The observatory says it will issue the Standby Signal No 1 late on Thursday or early Friday, if Tropical Cyclone Trami follows its projected path and edges closer to Hong Kong.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "According to the present forecast, Trami to the east of the Philippines will intensify gradually and enter within 800 kilometres of Hong Kong," meteorologists said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Trami, which is Vietnamese for a type of Camellia, is expected to move west towards the vicinity of Hainan in the coming days.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The observatory said a higher typhoon warning signal could eventually be possible, depending on the storm's movement and wind conditions.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Forecasters also warned that the weather will deteriorate this weekend.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Under the combined effect of Trami and the northeast monsoon, it will be windy and become cloudy with a few showers over the coast of southern China later on Friday and over the weekend."

  <div class="itemFullText">
   The Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data (PCPD) on Tuesday accused the South China Athletic Association (SCAA) of having inadequate policies and a lack of care, after a data breach affecting more than 72,300 members.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   An attack by a hacker in March resulted in a breach of members’ personal information, including ID card numbers, passport details, phone numbers, photos and addresses.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The privacy watchdog said the SCAA accidentally exposed its servers to the internet, which the hacker took advantage of to infiltrate the network and launch the attacks.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The association was also accused of lacking a proper detection system for attacks. The watchdog said the attacker made over 20,000 attempts to log in to one of the servers for four hours, without being interrupted.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The PCPD said the same hacker had successfully installed malicious software on the sports organisation's system two years ago, although no data was stolen at the time.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Privacy Commissioner Ada Chung criticised the SCAA for failing to spot that attack until the data leak this year, saying it didn’t carry out regular checks or risk assessments
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “The association, as a long-established sports association holding a significant amount of personal data, should be vigilant about cybersecurity and data security. I am very disappointed that the association failed to implement effective information system security measures to safeguard members' personal data prior to the incident.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “I believe that if the association had deployed sufficient detection measures or alert tools back in 2022, there would have been a good chance of detecting the malicious activities at the early stage of the [March] hacking attack,” Chung said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The PCPD ruled that the SCAA violated the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance, and an enforcement notice was issued to the association to fix the issue.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In response, the SCAA said it acknowledged the investigation findings and will adhere to the PCPD’s enforcement notice.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It said it imposed a series of remedial measures after the incident in question, and pledged to prevent similar incidents from happening again.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Separately, the PCPD said it has observed a concerning rise in data breaches involving non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and schools.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The watchdog received 61 data breach notifications from schools and NGOs last year, an increase of about 1.5 times compared to 2022.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Chung said NGOs and schools often hold a lot of sensitive personal data, making them attractive targets for hackers.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   She urged them to stay vigilant against cyber attacks and bolster their data security resources.

    Kevin Yeung praised for 'swift' monkey deaths response

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday praised the Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism for his quick response over a spate of monkey deaths at Hong Kong's zoo, after two more of the apes died over the weekend.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The latest squirrel monkey deaths at the Hong Kong Zoological and Botanical Gardens takes the total number of fatalities to 11.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Speaking to reporters, Lee said Kevin Yeung did exactly what was expected of him.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "[In] the first instance, the problem was contained to stop it from spreading. Monitoring measures were put in place. Autopsy examinations and tests have been expedited. The result was instantly disseminated to the general public," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Authorities are still determining if the two monkeys that recently died were infected with melioidosis like the other nine.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Chief Executive's praise came after Yeung was seemingly put on notice last week, when Lee unveiled in the annex of his third Policy Address that he had 'instructed' the minister to complete the blueprint for the Arts and Culture and Creative Industries Development, which is behind schedule.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Yeung had told reporters he did not feel that he was being pressured, adding he will finish the blueprint soon.

    Govt KPIs helped HK climb in global rankings: CE

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday said key performance indicators (KPI) that he introduced after assuming office have helped Hong Kong climb in some international rankings.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Speaking to reporters before an Executive Council meeting, Lee noted that Hong Kong went up in a number of global assessments, including in one report published last month by think tanks based in Britain and Shenzhen, in which the SAR surpassed Singapore.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I'm glad to see that in almost two-and-a-half years' governance, and also the new measures that we've introduced, the position of Hong Kong as an international financial centre has increased one position, so we've come back to top three."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   When asked by reporters about officials not completing six of the 150 tasks Lee set out in last year's Policy Address, he explained that there were reasonable causes for the delays and that he is satisfied with the overall KPI results.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Indicators are means. Indicators are not themselves an end. We must see how these indicators will work for us," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Chief Executive also stressed that the people in general agree with the need for reform, which was the main theme of his policy blueprint last week.

    First phase of plastics ban went smoothly: John Lee

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday said a six-month "adaption period" following the start of a ban on various single-use plastics went smoothly.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The end of a grace period means violators can now face fines of up to HK$100,000.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Talking to reporters ahead of an Executive Council meeting, Lee said the aim is to bring about behavioural change rather than punish people.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I am glad to see that there are good results in the catering sector, in the building management sector, in the hotel sector, which indicated that there has been a lot of disposable cutlery saved as a result of this plastic-free culture we want to build," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lee said the government needs to consider a range of factors before moving on to the next phase of the plastics ban which will cover takeaway items, among other things.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We will, first of all, prepare society and the businesses, particularly when we decide as to how we will go to the next stage, i.e. whether there will be sufficient alternative products available in the market for society to move smoothly into the next stage, and, more importantly, affordable prices, because what we learned from the first phase is, despite the fact that we all subscribe to this plastic-free culture, it is an important change of behaviour," the CE said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We also want businesses to be able to go through the process in a smooth manner, and people will be paying an affordable price for all this change of behaviour."

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The Alice Ho Miu Ling Nethersole Hospital said on Tuesday that it's expanding its services providing "upgraded" benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) surgeries, so more patients can be treated.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A new service model, used to treat BPH, has been in use since late 2022, and has treated about 250 patients since then.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Ng Chi-fai, a cluster service coordinator at the New Territories East Cluster, said a minimally invasive procedure had been adopted, allowing patients to be treated outside the operating room.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We are using water steam to heat up the prostate tissue, to make the prostate tissue die, and it will shrink the size of the prostate, or using some small pins to compress on the prostate tissue so that the prostate lumen, the channel, can be widened. Therefore, the patient can void better," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Traditionally, we are doing this procedure in the operating theatre. In our new surface model, we are using local anaesthesia, and we also perform the procedure in our day treatment centre."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Ng added that patients normally have to stay at the hospital for two days if they undergo the traditional surgery, but this is unnecessary with the upgraded service model.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Patients have the procedure done within 15 to 30 minutes, and then after we observe them for maybe one or two hours, they will be discharged," he said, adding that whole process is completed within half a day.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Ng said the new service model enabled them to double the number of patients being treated, and the waiting time for patients had fallen to four months, from 12 months originally.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He said about 65 percent of patients using urinary catheters could receive the surgery within two months.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Hong Kong Tennis Open organisers on Monday said that four-time Grand Slam champion Naomi Osaka is pulling out of this month's tournament due to injury, though the Japanese star will still meet fans in the SAR.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The former world number one injured her back during the China Open earlier this month, and has since skipped multiple tournaments, including the Japan Open.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “I love visiting the [SAR] tournament and despite the obvious disappointment of not being able to play, I want to reassure all my wonderful Hong Kong fans that I will still be attending the event," Osaka said in a statement through the Hong Kong China Tennis Association.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I am very much looking forward to meeting you all."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The association expressed disappointment, but stressed that the event will still be highly competitive.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Participating players include defending champion Leylah Fernandez, two-time Grand Slam champion and former world number one Simona Halep, as well as former US Open Champion Emma Raducanu.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Qualifiers for the local tournament, a WTA250 series, are due to take place at Victoria Park on Saturday. (Additional reporting from Reuters)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The head of a major trade exhibition company in Hong Kong on Monday said he wants to see more measures to revive the struggling convention and exhibition industry.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Last week’s Policy Address outlined plans to spend HK$500 million on launching the Incentive Scheme for Recurrent Exhibitions 2.0, to help the sector stay afloat and promote the mega-event economy.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But Duncan Cheung, director of ComAsia Limited, said geopolitical tensions and manpower shortages are hindering recovery.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “In Hong Kong, the exhibition business also suffers from the lack of manpower. For the recovery of the industry, I think it needs more time because you saw so many geopolitical problems,” he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Cheung said the government should allocate more money to the international exhibition industry and extend the scheme beyond 2026.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "International exhibitions can bring international exhibitors and also international buyers and visitors to come to Hong Kong. These kinds of visitors or exhibitors have to live in hotels and [benefit] the hotel industry, food and beverage industry and also travel industry."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Cheung said the exhibition industry has downsized due to the pandemic and has now only resumed to around 70 percent of pre-Covid levels.

    Arabic learning drive a ticket to success: scholar

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   A misunderstanding over the government’s apparent ambitions to require taxi drivers learn Arabic has been a hot topic of discussion in recent days, and has even been a target of derision by some in the trade.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But the head of the University of Hong Kong’s Arabic programme, Amjad Refai, says this is actually a great idea for Hongkongers – and learning Arabic isn’t as difficult as some may think.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Chief Executive John Lee had said in his latest Policy Address that relevant sectors should provide service information in Arabic to lure in more Middle Eastern tourists, but officials have since clarified that this doesn’t mean cabbies will be expected to learn to converse in Arabic.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development Algernon Yau said on Monday that they just want more information to be made available in Arabic to help travellers find taxis or Muslim-friendly facilities more easily.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Transport chief Lam Sai-hung also said it would be a good thing if drivers could learn a few simple Arabic phrases such as greetings.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Refai agrees that learning to say hello: أهلاً (ahlaan) or thank you: شكراً (shkraan) isn’t the toughest thing in the world.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “I don't believe there is an easy language or there is a difficult language. There is no such thing,” he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The academic, who has written a textbook for people learning Arabic as a second language, says while learning a language that’s very different from the mother tongue of students makes things challenging, it’s far from insurmountable.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “We need to make an easy approach for the students,” Refai said. “I don't think Arabic is a difficult language – it's different… new… so students may face challenges and they need to [make] efforts to be familiar with it.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Refai said more and more universities and even private schools here have been offering Arabic courses in recent years, and there was a spike in the number of students learning the language between 2016 and 2019.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   However, he says since Covid hit, there has been a “shocking” decline in student numbers in Hong Kong in contrast to the mainland, where people seem to be more aware of the advantages of learning a language spoken in countries that are becoming increasingly important trading partners both to the territory and the nation.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “I was expecting that everyone will try to compete to learn Arabic and the numbers are increasing but I don't see this on ground,” Refai lamented.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “In [the] mainland for decades we know the importance of Arabic language and nearly all universities –  even the regional universities – teach Arabic as majors, and a lot of students are studying Arabic on the mainland because they can see the potential of the Arab world.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He says the advent of artificial intelligence may have affected peoples’ appetite for learning new languages, as AI makes translation and communications much easier. But he’s still shocked that people here aren’t seizing the career opportunities that would be afforded by learning Arabic.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “It's still a decent amount of people are learning Arabic, but less than the years I'm talking about – 2016 and 2019 – which has not only surprised me, it shocked me actually, because the Hong Kong and China governments, as part of the initiative of the New Belt and Road, are extending hands towards the Arab world.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He says the best way to learn a new language is via in-person classes, where teachers can best use the human element to communicate face-to-face with their students.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   The Hong Kong Trade Development Council on Monday said the government's decision to reduce the city's spirits duty came just in time for the Wine and Spirits Fair, with more vendors expected to showcase a wider selection of liquor.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Six hundred exhibitors from 20 countries and regions will take part in the fair, and it comes on the heels of the government's decision to cut the duty on liquor with an alcohol content of over 30 percent and with an import price of more than HK$200 to 10 percent from 100 percent for the portion above HK$200.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Speaking at a media preview for the event, the council's Deputy Executive Director, Sophia Chong, said more than 20 percent of vendors would be bringing hard liquor to the fair, which takes place from November 7 to 9.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Like this time, we have whiskey from Ireland as well. All these liquor, brandy, tequila, and all these spirits and liquor can also be traded via Hong Kong to the rest of Asia, including mainland China," she said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Vendor Andrew Wong said more people will have the chance to taste high-end spirits.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "People may be drinking medium or low-level [spirits], and they now can have more room to drink good quality [spirits] with a reasonable price," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But fellow vendor Simon Disler said the duty reduction was not big enough to give him the wiggle room to offer more discounts.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "For five or ten percent of my items, I would be able to offer discounts to my customers. But for the other 90 percent, there won't be a discount," he explained.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The fair will be held at the Convention and Exhibition Centre where wines and spirits, including baijiu, sake and vodka will be showcased.

    Civil servants to get three days of childcare leave

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The government says it plans to offer three days of childcare leave a year to civil servants with children under three, a move expected to benefit some 12,000 employees.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The administration on Monday said the family-friendly policy is expected to start in April.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   At a Legco public service panel meeting, several unionist lawmakers asked why officials have decided on three days and then only for parents of children under three.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   They asked whether more days off could be offered and whether the leave could be extended to parents of older children.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Federation of Trade Unions lawmaker Kwok Wai-keung said Singapore offers six days of childcare leave.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Civil service chief Ingrid Yeung said officials are already striking a balance between several factors, adding that the scheme will be reviewed after implementation.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We roll out government-friendly measures for government workers, but then there's also a need for manpower, and operational needs for departments. We have to be prudent with this new measure," she said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "At that preschool age below three, children usually stay at home. They need more care at home. That's why we set the threshold at three years old."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Finance sector lawmaker Ronick Chan and former minister Lai Tung-kwok of the New People's Party asked whether civil servants could be given a day off for their birthday, with Lai saying this would provide a morale boost to those who don't have children.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Yeung said officials will consider the suggestion, but providing leave does come with a financial burden for the government.

    'Function over price when eateries buy cutlery'

  <img alt="Alvis Yip says the prices of his company's non-plastic cutlery have dropped by 10 percent. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=1&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1775450_2_20241021142141.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   A company that supplies wooden and bamboo forks, knives and spoons to restaurants on Monday said price has become a far less significant factor for eateries when making purchases of cutlery.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “Maybe I can use the knife as an example. At the beginning people are just concerned about the price. They choose a wooden knife and fork but because of the functionality of the wood it cannot cut like a harder steak. So people now choose the bamboo fork and knife which can be used to cut the steak easily,” Alvis Yip, founder of Supply Ching Company said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He said his products were initially about 20 percent to 30 percent more expensive than the plastic ones, but his prices have now dropped by about 10 percent, benefiting from economies of scale.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Yip was one of four suppliers invited by the Environmental Protection Department to showcase their products to the press six months ago.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   During the event, another supplier demonstrated how its knife and fork can be used to cut steak, but the fork snapped during two attempts.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Asked whether the issue affected his sales in any way, Yip said it actually gave customers more confidence in his products.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “At the beginning we were concerned about that incident, that will it affect the reputation of sustainable food packaging. But after that event it kind of benefits us because while the citizens are often laughing at the presentation, the restaurants are actually more concerned about the functionality. That event created chances or situations for us to explain more of our products' details to our customers,” he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Yip said he also noticed a significant drop in reliance on one-off cutlery as people adapt to more sustainable options, but stressed he is not worried about his sales.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “It’s like that restaurants are preparing for, for example, 10,000 sets of cutlery because they are using the assumption from plastic cutlery, but then they end up just using 5,000 for a month. So monthly usage can drop by 50 percent,” he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “But I can draw more customers using our quality and new designs and new materials by increasing our functionalities… We will just have some good quality supplies left in the market in the end.”

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism Kevin Yeung on Monday said the authorities will consider reopening the mammals section of the Zoological and Botanical Gardens when a health scare involving monkeys there comes to an end.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A De Brazza’s monkey, three common squirrel monkeys, four white-faced sakis and three cotton-top tamarins have died in the past week or so, with tests on some of them revealing they had melioidosis, an infectious disease caused by a type of bacteria in soil.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Officials said workers had dug up the ground near the monkey enclosure earlier this month and may have brought in contaminated soil on their shoes.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   On a radio programme, Yeung said one monkey is still undergoing quarantine.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "When the situation is back to normal, we'll consider reopening the area. We've observed their behaviour and sometimes it was a little unusual compared to normal," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The condition of the monkey in quarantine fluctuates. Sometimes it is bad and sometimes it is good. It's receiving medical treatment."

    Single-use plastics ban running smoothly: EPD

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The Environmental Protection Department says the first phase of the city's single-use plastics ban has been implemented smoothly and orderly, with a six-month adaptation period concluding on Monday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In an interview with RTHK, deputy director of the department Kenneth Cheng said 80 percent of customers of chain restaurants have stopped using takeaway cutlery, while 30 percent of eateries have chosen not to offer any takeaway utensils.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The department estimates that 30 million fewer sets of disposable cutlery than usual have been given out by the catering sector since the ban took effect in April, Cheng said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He praised the hotel sector for being “ahead of the international trend” by reducing its use of plastics by 80 percent over the past six months.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Cheng said shopping malls and office buildings have stopped giving out disposable umbrella bags and few people have been using glow sticks or party hats during festive events, showing that a culture of reducing plastic is gradually developing.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The end of the grace period means that people who fail to comply with the rules now face fines of up to HK$100,000, but Cheng said the department will prioritise education over punishment.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “We can see that the culture of reducing plastic is progressing. We don't believe that heavily penalising businesses is the right way to implement this culture. Instead, we think it should be achieved through promotion and education. But of course we will enforce the law after the adaptation period, but the focus will be on primary suppliers,” he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “We inspected the selling points in the past and identified those that have not yet met the requirements. We will inspect them again and will issue a written warning to them if they haven’t improved. We will give them 10 more days to make the necessary changes.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Asked when the second phase of the ban, which will cover items including takeaway plastic lunch boxes and cups, will be introduced, Cheng said there is currently no specific timetable.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He said the move will depend on factors such as social acceptance, available replacements and international trends.

    We want to make better use of cruise terminal: Govt

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Culture, sports and tourism minister Kevin Yeung on Monday said officials will study how to make better use of the Kai Tak Cruise Terminal.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In last week's Policy Address, Chief Executive John Lee said the SAR will publish an action plan on developing cruise tourism to enhance the terminal's role as a hub for conventions and exhibitions.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We now hope to see if we can better utilise the space of the cruise terminal. For example, can we make use of the rooftop area? It's currently a park. Is there anything else we can do there? How can we promote more convention and exhibition activities?" Yeung told a radio programme.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Asked about Singapore receiving more cruise ships than Hong Kong in July and August, the minister said it's not a fair comparison.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Traditionally, Hong Kong's typhoon season runs from May to August. This doesn't exist in some places, for example Singapore. So, comparing cruise ship numbers in July and August is not the best," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It's not about how many typhoons we have in July and August, but because cruise lines won't take risks in their scheduling during the typhoon season."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Yeung also said more will be done to develop "horse racing tourism" as outlined in the policy blueprint, such as working with the Jockey Club to promote international horse-racing events.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But he said authorities need to carefully consider whether the current 18-year-old age limit for racegoers would be lowered.

    'HK ready to extend ban on single-use plastics'

  <img alt="Edwin Lau of The Green Earth says Hong Kong should push ahead with its ban on single-use plastics. File Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=1&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1775377_1_20241020185910.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The head of a green group believes Hong Kong is prepared to extend its ban on single-use plastics, as the six-month adaptation period under the first phase of the ban ends on Monday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The end of the grace period means that people who fail to comply with the rules face fines of up to HK$100,000.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   According to the rules, restaurants are prohibited from using or selling polystyrene utensils, plastic straws, cutlery and plates.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Hotels are also banned from freely distributing bathroom items made of plastic, including plastic-handled toothbrushes, plastic-packed toothpaste and shower caps.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Other prohibited products include cotton buds, umbrella bags and glow sticks.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Edwin Lau, founder and executive director of The Green Earth, said eateries and hotels are generally adapting well to the new regulations.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “Through my observation, I gathered that most of the restaurants... I think most of them have done a good job to follow the single-use plastics ban, and they quickly can find the alternative.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “I am aware that for the hotel industry they are still trying to find an alternative for shower caps. But apart from this item, the rest of the items, I heard them saying that hotels are quite alright in getting all those other alternatives or advising customers to use their own private sets,” he told RTHK.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The second phase, set to begin in 2025, will extend the ban to include plastic cups, food containers for takeouts, as well as plastic dental floss and tablecloths.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lau sees no difficulties for businesses to adjust to the regulations, adding that phase 2 should be rolled out as soon as possible.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “I'm sure with the first phase, they have adapted to the changes quite well. And I believe they are well-prepared for the introduction of the second phase of the single-use plastics ban. You can see there are many non-plastic alternatives for takeaway lunch box, congee bowl, and this is no big problem for them,” he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lau also noted that currently, many alternatives for plastic products are still of the single-use type, and officials should enhance promotion and encourage people to bring their own lunch boxes and cutlery.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Environmental Protection Department estimated that the catering sector has cut down on the use of 30 million sets of disposable cutlery since April.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In a statement, the department also noted that 80 percent of customers at chain restaurants have stopped using takeaway cutlery, while 30 percent of eateries have decided to stop providing disposable cutlery for takeaways.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   The government on Sunday said the second isolated common squirrel monkey from the Hong Kong Zoological and Botanical Gardens had died, taking the monkey death toll to 11.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The death of the common squirrel monkey followed earlier news of a tenth death, also of a common squirrel monkey. Both had been in isolation following a spate of monkey deaths at the gardens that began about a week ago.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   On Friday, the government said nine monkeys had died of sepsis after catching melioidosis, potentially because workers dug up soil near their habitat. Autopsies found a large amount of a bacteria that causes the disease in the monkeys' organs.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department will conduct necropsy to see whether the cause of death was the same as the other cases earlier.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   One monkey, a De Brazza Monkey, remains in isolation.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Officials added that the bacteria are unlikely to be transmitted from animals to humans.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   While ethnic minority job seekers said language barriers remain their biggest obstacle, some companies have improved their prospects by adding more English to training materials and lowering their Chinese language requirements.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Various government departments and firms were recruiting staff at a job fair held on Sunday by the Equal Opportunities Commission (EOC). One of them was a franchised bus company offering positions such as bus captains, technicians and customer service officers.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Citybus said all Chinese guidelines have been translated into English to accommodate ethnic minority workers. It also said the requirement for bus captains now is basic communication in Cantonese, compared with reading and writing Chinese and speaking fluent Cantonese in the past.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The firm has about 30 ethnic minority staff.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I think they are quite embedded in our whole population, our local bus captains are happy to work with them. All the people in the company, they know that the company is an inclusive employer," said Citybus general manager Roger Wong.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Rojal, who's from Nepal and has been in Hong Kong for almost a decade, submitted an application with a bank.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He said he found it hard to land a job here because of language barriers.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The employers are really looking for someone who actually can speak the language," he said. "I'm not exactly sure why that's the case, perhaps the clients want you to speak in Chinese or the documents could be in Chinese."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Another job seeker, Bharvani, echoed the sentiment.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Even though I studied here, my Chinese reading and writing skills are not that great. So it (throws out) at least half or three-fourths of the job opportunities," said the ethnic Indian who was born and raised in Hong Kong.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The head of the EOC, Linda Lam, said more should be done to create job opportunities for ethnic minorities.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "In fact, there are many young ethnic minorities with qualifications, outstanding attitude, and are [highly-skilled], and they are suitable to work in various levels of an organisation," she said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "In the future, we will be organising other activities to continue our efforts, to promote the breaking down of stereotypes, to help the ethnic minorities to have more opportunities to participate in different levels in the workforce."

    'Landlords of shoebox flats to face the music by 2026'

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Housing minister Winnie Ho said on Sunday that the government could start prosecuting landlords of illegal subdivided flats by the end of 2026 at the earliest, with the possibility of jail terms.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In his Policy Address last week, Chief Executive John Lee announced plans to regulate subdivided units, renaming the vetted flats "basic housing units" (BHUs) and making those smaller than 86 square feet illegal.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Ho said if all goes smoothly, laws would be passed by the end of next year, and that would be followed by a period for landlords to register and a grace period for them to renovate the flats to meet the new requirements.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "[If] a one-year registration period is enough, that would take us to the end of 2026," she said on a Commercial Radio programme.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "If landlords don't register during the period and continue to operate homes that violate our regulations, then law enforcement could begin at the end of 2026, or at the start of 2027 at the earliest. That's within the term of the current administration."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Deputy Financial Secretary Michael Wong, who heads a government task force on the matter, said the timeline is not set in stone, citing an upcoming public consultation exercise and discussion with lawmakers.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Wong also said he doesn't think there'll be a significant drop in supply, pointing to the availability of more BHUs in the market in future.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He added that among tenants of current subdivided flats, 60 percent of them are eligible to apply for public housing and the rest could look for BHUs or transitional housing units, insisting everyone will have a roof over their heads.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   On a TVB programme, Lee said landlords of subdivided flats are allowed to raise rents by a maximum of 10 percent under existing rent-control laws. The CE also said tenants can move from one BHU to another in future, in the event rents go up.

    'Fair to revise allocation ratio for subsidised flats'

  <img alt="John Lee says public housing tenants should be given a chance to climb the housing ladder. File Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=1&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1775355_1_20241020125545.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Chief Executive John Lee said giving public housing tenants a greater chance to buy Home Ownership Scheme units is a step towards helping them climb the housing ladder and should not be deemed unfair to the broader public.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In his Policy Address on Wednesday, Lee announced a revision of the allocation ratio for the subsidised flats, changing it from 4:6 to 5:5 between green form, or current public housing residents, and white form applicants.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   During a TVB programme aired on Sunday, the CE was asked whether the move was intended to "pressure" the general public into pursuing private property to boost the market, given the quota for green form applicants had not been fully utilised in the past two years.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Don't resort to conspiracy theories,” Lee said in response.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “Frankly, when you're allocating housing, flexibility is crucial.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “The ratio between green and white form applicants could be different every single time. If one side doesn't use up the quota, then it could be re-allocated. There can easily be differences, and it's the role of the government to adjust these.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lee also rejected suggestions the revised allocation favours well-off public housing tenants, who are being urged to move out in accordance with government policy.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Typically we expect a duration of about 10 years for residents to make progress. Then we'll give them the opportunity to return the public housing units to those who need them. I believe this approach is reasonable,” he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Meanwhile, Lee said the relaxation of mortgage rules as announced in this year's Policy Address was based on the assessment that the private housing market is developing in a healthy manner.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Under the new policy, the maximum loan-to-value ratio for all homes has been adjusted to 70 percent, regardless of their value, and the maximum debt servicing ratio has been raised to 50 percent.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The CE said he has not detected speculation following the change, and stressed that the chances of speculative activity under present market conditions are very low.

  <img alt="Paul Chan echos the Chief Executive's idea of further developing Hong Kong's gold market. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=1&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1775354_1_20241020125513.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Financial Secretary Paul Chan said on Sunday gold trading in Hong Kong has great room for growth amid global market developments, and building up the SAR's market is of great strategic significance.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In announcing his Policy Address last week, Chief Executive John Lee spoke of the vision to turning Hong Kong into an operating centre for international commodity trading, including storage, delivery and shipping.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Chan, for his part, said commodities trading is an important part of economic activities as it could play a pivotal role in ensuring the stable supply of raw materials.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Creating a commodity trading ecosystem can become a new point of support for the development of Hong Kong as an international financial, aviation and trading hub," he wrote on his weekly blog.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The minister said this could drive the development of aviation and trading for the Greater Bay Area, and offer stability to the supply chain in the region.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The priority is to boost trade volume in the short to medium term, Chan said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The minister said as geopolitical uncertainties rise, demand for gold is expected to stay high for risk-averse investors, and some market players expect trade volume to multiply.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He said once the local infrastructure for gold storage and trading is built up, the SAR can further look into fostering closer links with the mainland gold market.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Chan said developing more risk-management and derivative products can help boost the country's global influence in the gold market in the long run.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   This, he said, has great strategic significance in raising Hong Kong's status as an international financial centre.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Deputy Chief Secretary Warner Cheuk said a new government body aimed at developing tourist hotspots will hold its first meeting next month.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Chief Executive John Lee announced in his Policy Address on Wednesday the setting up of a Working Group on Development Tourist Hotspots, which involves at least seven government departments.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Speaking on a radio programme on Sunday, Cheuk, who leads the group, said it wants to develop projects that are inventive, attractive and feasible, and it's open to suggestions from the public.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Hong Kong has a lot of resources for tourism, such as Victoria Harbour, food, films, etc. We will develop new projects involving the use of these resources," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "For example food, you can see from YouTube a lot of tourists look for food in Hong Kong. This might be familiar to us but for tourists, it is very attractive. We can think about developing night markets, or building a food city.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Hong Kong also has its film culture and natural environment. We can also consider developing new photo-taking spots."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lee said on Saturday the working group will uncover must-see destinations across Hong Kong as it hopes to unearth hidden gems beyond Victoria Harbour.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Cheuk also said consumption habits of tourists have changed since the Covid-19 pandemic, and businesses have to think of new ways to attract tourists to spend.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We cannot only complain about why tourists don't come here to spend. It's not that people don't spend money, there have to be places where they think it's worth spending money," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The official said tourists are more demanding nowadays and it is crucial to find products that are unique to Hong Kong to attract more visitors.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Separately, Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism Kevin Yeung said he's confident his bureau will announce the Blueprint for Arts and Culture and Creative Industries Development soon.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The CE said in the Policy Address that the Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau needs more time to come up with the blueprint.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We received a lot of opinions, and we made big changes due to changes in the economy. In this case, we hope to have thorough discussions with the Culture Commission, and there may be changes after that. We will also have to include good suggestions in the blueprint. We still hope to announce the blueprint as soon as possible," Yeung said.

    Adequate measures taken over monkey deaths: Govt

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Culture, sports and tourism minister Kevin Yeung said the government has taken sufficient preventive measures at the Zoological and Botanical Gardens on news of the death of a tenth monkey there.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The latest death involves a common squirrel monkey, which had been put under isolated surveillance since nine other animals died about a week ago.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Officials said a necropsy will be conducted to find out the cause of death.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Two other animals, a common squirrel monkey and a De Brazza's Monkey, are in isolation.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Speaking to reporters after attending a radio programme on Sunday, Yeung said there are no abnormalities among some 70 monkeys at the zoo in Central.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Because of the latest death, the relevant departments have held another meeting and we visited the gardens. Overall, we think [the preventive measures] in place are sufficient, and we'll continue with this plan," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "There are still two other monkeys in isolation, and we'll take care of them. We know their condition may go up and down, sometimes they're better and sometimes worse. If there's anything new we'll definitely update the public."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   On Friday, the government said the nine monkeys died of sepsis after catching melioidosis, potentially because workers dug up soil near their habitat.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Autopsies found a large amount of the melioidosis-inducing bacteria in the monkeys' organs.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Officials added that the bacteria are unlikely to be transmitted from animals to humans.

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The first phase of pilot projects on developing the low-altitude economy will focus on using drones for food delivery and transporting cargo with Cyberport and Science Park being in the pipeline, the government said on Saturday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In this week's Policy Address, the chief executive said the government will set up a working group that will explore how the city can benefit from the use of drones and other aerial technology to provide services such as transporting goods and people.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Deputy Financial Secretary Michael Wong, who led the working group, told a press conference that officials will work with industry partners on pilot projects, starting applications at the end of this year and launching "regulatory sandboxes" early next year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We expect that the first phase will mainly focus on aerial monitoring and some drone cargo delivery, such as delivering food and transporting lightweight goods like mail and medications," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We also hope that the pilot locations and routes can cover areas in Hong Kong with different terrains, landscapes, and densities. Some areas that could be considered include Science Park, Cyberport, outlying islands, and the Northern Metropolis."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   This plan requires amending existing laws and creating new ones, especially a regulatory framework for drones over 25 kg.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Wong said the government aims to submit a draft bill to the Legislative Council in early 2025.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He said while the mainland's low-altitude economy is growing rapidly, it's too early to estimate Hong Kong's potential revenue from this sector.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "As our work is in its initial stages, it would be somewhat unrealistic to mention many specific figures at this point or to predict future economic contributions. This is because the mainland is a bit ahead of us in this area, and their data comes from big data."

  <div class="itemFullText">
   The Secretary for Environment and Ecology Tse Chin-wan said the government's plan to reduce waste in Hong Kong remains unchanged despite the shelving of the waste charging scheme, adding that raising public awareness and increasing recycling facilities instead has achieved great results.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The government announced earlier this year that they would not implement the citywide waste charging scheme in August as originally planned, but the environment chief said at a press conference on Saturday that good recycling and waste management practice has increased immensely.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He said that the total amount of recycling has increased by more than half in the past six months.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We saw when we were advertising the waste scheme that even though public opinion was to postpone it, people were very supportive of waste reduction and recycling practices. So we are now seizing the opportunity by enhancing recycling facilities and strengthening public education to promote a good waste reduction and recycling culture in society," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We will also study how to optimise the waste charging scheme so that people can be more adaptable and accepting of waste reduction and recycling measures when implemented in the future."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Tse said that they will optimise a plan and share their progress with the Legislative Council in the middle of next year.

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Greenpeace on Saturday said more than 3,200 pieces of rubbish have been collected in its clean-up operations along two of Hong Kong's riverbanks in the past four months, with 97 percent of it being plastic.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The top items found in the Lam Tsuen and Pui O Rivers were food and beverage packaging, disposable plastic tableware, and shipping materials, the environmental group told RTHK.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Greenpeace campaigner Leanne Tam said microplastics from these sources can enter ecosystems and food chains, potentially affecting human health.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It easily get into the ecosystem because they are small, maybe eaten by animals. Or even when we drink it or we eat through the food chain, they will enter our blood system or even our brain," she said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Tam said the government should implement a HK$1 deposit system for beverage bottles, rather than the proposed 10-cent incentive, to better tackle plastic waste.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The government should add the reduction target on single-use packaging and also the reuse target for the overall package and overall beverage packaging system," she added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The advocate added that individuals and companies can also play a part by choosing packaging-free items and changing their business models to phase out single-use plastics.

    Bus parade, exhibition mark PRC's 75th anniversary

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Buses ranging from museum pieces to state-of-the-art machines on Saturday rolled through the city to mark the 75th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The parade, organised by the Transport Department and three franchised bus operators, featured retired and in-service buses.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The procession started in Victoria Park, passing along the northern shore of Hong Kong Island and finishing up at the Central Ferry Piers.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   There is also a four-day bus exhibition underway at Victoria Park.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Speaking at the departure ceremony, transport minister Lam Sai-hung said buses have long been an indispensable part of people's livelihoods.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The rapid development of new energy technologies of our country in recent years has enriched Hong Kong's choices of new energy public transport," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Numerous electric double-decker buses and hydrogen fuel cell buses introduced into Hong Kong in the past few years were China-made models."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Many bus lovers gathered to take photos of the parading buses, including Mr Lee, who purposely came from Guangzhou, to see some of the SAR's antique buses.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I have never seen these discontinued buses in a public event parading before, so I think this opportunity is very rare. I purposely came from the mainland to see them," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Another spectator, Mr Chan, was ecstatic to see history passing through the streets of Hong Kong.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I didn't think they would host a bus tour. I saw some new buses. It turns out that one of them is a new Citybus that is probably not in service yet. I couldn't believe that new buses would be featured in the parade. It’s really exciting. I hope the government will organise more parades in the future."

    Skilled technicians to come and fill manpower shortage
   </title>

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Chief Secretary Eric Chan said the government plans to bring in 10,000 skilled technicians to ease the manpower shortage, adding that they hope to attract younger workers to bring down the average working age in the industry.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Speaking on a radio programme on Saturday, he said that Hong Kong is projected to face a shortage of approximately 180,000 workers across different sectors in the future, with about 60,000 vacancies earmarked for skilled technicians.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He stressed that the remaining 50,000 spots would be reserved for locals who are interested.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "There are certain conditions for the people coming in. They must first have a licence, and secondly, they can only engage in their own industry when they come to Hong Kong. They cannot work in another field. This is the way to go," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We hope to choose younger people because we hope that they can work for a long time, and we want to make the workforce younger. That is very important for our future."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He added that labour importation schemes are short-term solutions, and that they would continue to train local workers to alleviate the problem in the coming years.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Stated in the new Policy Address, the government will build a campus for the Hong Kong Institute of Information Technology, under the Vocational Training Council, and develop its Lift and Escalator Technology Centre.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Chan said that both universities and the Vocational Training Council would also focus on the demand for high-tech talents, with institutions increasing incentives for research.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "High technology plays a huge role in the development of our future, so whether it is in our universities, or through the Vocational Training Council, there will be courses catered to this type of demand. Even in our universities, we will add more scholarships for students to do some research and study for master's and doctoral degrees," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It is mainly for the industries that we need. We will encourage them to do their best and provide them with more incentives to train and study in the future, and it's all towards high-tech development."

    New tourism working group to uncover hidden gems: CE

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   A new working group on developing tourist hotspots will uncover must-see destinations across Hong Kong and will ease the workload of the Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau, Chief Executive John Lee said on Saturday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In his third Policy Address, Lee said the working group, led by Deputy Chief Secretary Warner Cheuk, will strengthen cross departmental co-ordination and leverage community efforts in identifying and developing tourist hotspots.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Speaking on an RTHK radio programme, the CE said officials hope to unearth hidden gems beyond Victoria Harbour.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "For example, the Champs-Élysées in France... it has many unique features, and everyone goes there. Hong Kong of course has its own attractions. We already have Victoria Harbour, which we'll continue to develop," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "But we also have many other treasures. How can we showcase our Geopark? We've discussed this before. There are many various aspects. We hope to pay more attention to public opinion."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The policy blueprint also outlined plans to develop the SAR into an international tertiary education hub by creating the "Study in Hong Kong" brand and encouraging more local students to pursue advanced studies.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Asked how to attract exchange students with the city's high cost of living, Lee said Hong Kong has much to offer with its freedom, convenience, and cultural diversity.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Sometimes I like a girl because she's beautiful, sometimes because she's virtuous, and sometimes because of her knowledge. Hong Kong also appeals in many ways. Of course, we're not as big [geographically] as other big cities. That's the reality. But we still have many other appealing features," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   On another radio programme, the CE was asked if he was dissatisfied that cultural and tourism officials failed to announce its Blueprint for Arts and Culture and Creative Industries Development as scheduled.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In response, Lee said, "When you look at the 2023 Policy Address, around four to five items are behind schedule. When I set indicators, I look at whether there are reasons for the delay and if those reasons are justified. The purpose is to make sure that we accomplish what we have promised to do."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It comes as, in the Policy Address annex, Lee pointed out the bureau "requires more time to revise the draft blueprint to cater for the long‑term development of the sector".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In response to queries about the matter on Friday, cultural and tourism minister Kevin Yeung said the blueprint is "nearly complete" and he didn't feel that the CE had publicly urged him in any way.

    Melioidosis to blame for monkey deaths: officials

  <img alt="Officials say there is no need to shut down the whole zoo, as the melioidosis-causing bacteria do not easily transmit from animals to humans. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=1&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1775197_2_20241018200137.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Nine monkeys from the Hong Kong Zoological and Botanical Gardens died of sepsis after catching melioidosis, authorities revealed on Friday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Part of the zoo has been shut down since Monday after eight monkeys, including three critically-endangered cotton-top tamarins, were found dead the previous day.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   One more death was registered later, while another monkey was taken away for observation.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Subsequent autopsies found a large amount of the melioidosis-inducing bacteria in the monkeys' organs.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Culture and tourism minister Kevin Yeung offered a possible explanation of where the bacteria came from.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He said works performed at the zoo earlier this month required the digging up of soil near the monkeys' habitat. Workers were then believed to have brought contaminated soil into the cage through their shoes.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   According to the Centre for Health Protection, the bacterium is particularly common in moist clay soil. It can affect both humans and animals.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But Yeung stressed that it is not necessary to seal off the whole facility from the public.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We have taken all the cleansing and disinfection measures on the cages. With all these measures, we believe that it's now clean and free of the bacteria," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We have also cordoned off the whole mammals section for the time being, so there will be no sort of contact between normal citizens with the animals."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Protective gear has been provided to staff after the incident, and those who may have had contact with the monkeys tested negative for the bacterium.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Thomas Sit, assistant director of Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation, said operators had performed check-ups for the animals as soon as possible.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Before the animals lost appetite, they were a bit incompetent, quiet, abnormal, and the time of onset of all the clinical signs only took two days, and then there was a sudden death of the animals," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The vets already took measures to treat the monkeys. However, the affected monkeys could not make it and [we] had to perform post-mortem and isolate [them] to prevent the spread of the disease."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sit said the facility has been instructed to step up cleansing work, and staff should maintain good hygiene to avoid a repeat of the incident.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   An infectious disease expert said the bacteria usually lie deep down in the soil, meaning contact with humans and animals was unlikely.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "But if there had been work done to this soil with digging, and also if these bacteria in the deep soil had been elevated to the surface, then the animals there could have been exposed to a large number of bacteria, so that would probably have contributed to this outbreak in these monkeys," Wilson Lam told RTHK.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It would be prudent to shut down the area temporarily, the doctor said, as the bacteria may still be present in the environment.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But he played down fears of humans contracting the disease from monkeys.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Transmission from animals to human is really, really rare, so we are more worried about the presence of bacteria in the soil, and also the environment in the park at this moment."

    Kai Tak Sports Park to host test events this month

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Cultural and tourism minister Kevin Yeung on Friday said there will be various test events at the Kai Tak Sports Park starting as early as the end of this month, to check transport facilities and crowd dispersal measures.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   With mega events such as Coldplay concerts lined up for the sports park when it opens in the first quarter of next year, there have been calls for officials to improve transport solutions.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Yeung told a press conference that such efforts are underway.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We may start with some small-scale games. For example, we have a smaller sports ground at Kai Tak with 5,000 seats. Some competitions will start to be held there," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Of course during these so-called test events, we will try out the venue and its supporting facilities, and also things like crowd dispersal to see how we can do it best."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Asked about a review of the redevelopment plan for Hong Kong Stadium – a move mentioned in this week's Policy Address – Yeung said officials need to examine how it can keep up with the city's development needs, and whether there are sufficient venues for mega events even after the Kai Tak site opens.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In the Policy Address annex, Chief Executive John Lee pointed out that the Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau failed to announce its Blueprint for Arts and Culture and Creative Industries Development as scheduled.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In response to questions about the matter, Yeung said the blueprint is nearly complete and he will follow the CE's instructions to finish it as soon as possible.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I don't think the chief executive has publicly urged me to do anything... I think everyone needs to be pragmatic. When the CE mentioned me yesterday, it was in response to questions about tourism work. He used tourism as an example. I was there yesterday too. He talked about the division of work between the relevant working groups and the bureau. I don't feel there was any urging there," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The blueprint, expected to be promulgated later this year, will outline the vision and initiatives for developing high-quality arts, cultural and creative industries.

   Hong Kong's unemployment rate remained steady at three percent in the three-month period ending in September, which is the same as the June-to-August period.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Official figures from the Census and Statistics Department on Friday showed the underemployment rate also remained unchanged at 1.2 percent.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In a statement, the Secretary for Labour and Welfare, Chris Sun, said the unemployment rates of various sectors showed diverse movements during the period, although the changes were not significant.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The overall labour market should remain tight in the near term alongside the sustained economic growth, though the employment situation may vary across sectors depending on their business performances,” he said.

    'Spirits tax cut won't burden public health system'

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Hong Kong's reduction in duty on premium spirits is not intended to encourage consumption and won't create an extra burden on the public health system, the government said on Friday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Duty on liquor with an alcohol content above 30 percent and with an import price of over HK$200 has been cut from 100 percent to 10 percent on the portion above HK$200.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Despite concerns that the move will lead to increased alcohol consumption, Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development Algernon Yau said the right balance has been struck.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We believe that a two-tier system can balance various considerations and create a more balanced measure. It reduces concerns from the medical community regarding alcohol abuse, while on the other hand aiming to boost trade in high-end spirits," he told a radio show.
   <br/>
   <br/>

   </a>
   on his Policy Address, Chief Executive John Lee said the the government is very conscious about protecting public health, but is at the same time creating extra opportunities for Hong Kong.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I do see the potential here, not just because of what we learn from the cancellation of wine duty, but in fact there is a big market for high-end liquor such as whiskey, and also brandy, and also a lot of Chinese liquor," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Yau also said Health Secretary Lo Chung-mau backed the duty cut.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We have also consulted Secretary Lo. This measure has his approval and support, which is why we are able to implement it," Yau said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Also speaking on an RTHK programme, Financial Secretary Paul Chan said the duty cut won't have a huge effect on prices, noting that around 85 percent of hard liquor in the market is priced under HK$200.

  <img alt="Travel Industry Council chair Gianna Hsu says the tourism industry has to up their game to attract more high-end travellers. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=1&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1775125_2_20241018124511.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The tourism industry is eagerly seeking ways to attract more tourists from the Middle East and Asean countries, according to Travel Industry Council chairman Gianna Hsu.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Hsu said on Friday these tourists only account for a small percentage of all the city's tourists.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Speaking on a radio programme, she also hoped that the expansion of multiple-entry visas would not just be limited to Guangdong province.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The visa for Shenzhen residents, they can come to the city at any time and this would definitely increase manflow and consumption in the city. We also see the possibility for weekly visas. We hope it would not only be granted to Guangdong province, but also to cities that are further away, which require tourists to fly to Hong Kong, so they will have to stay here for two to three nights. This would help the industry to boost the economy," Hsu said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   She said Hong Kong has a lot of tourist spots and facilities to offer, but industry workers would have to do more to attract high-end tourists.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "For example, equestrian tourism has been around for years. The Jockey Club could consider improving the experience brought to tourists, such as adding photo-taking spots so tourists can take a picture with the horses if they won, or allow them to enter the paddock, or to see the horses at a closer distance," Hsu said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Separately, Hsu said the reduction in the liquor tax, which was announced in the Policy Address, would not necessarily translate into increased visitor numbers.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "When tourists come to the city, they drink wine with their meals or during evening activities. Liquor prices might be more competitive now and it may attract tourists to have a drink because the prices are more attractive, but I don't think more tourists will come here just because there's a tax reduction," she said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Hsu added that with the stabilisation of the tourism industry in recent years, those who left the sector previously would return gradually, and the industry was also seeking new talent to join by strengthening communication with hospitality schools.

   Chief Executive John Lee on Friday said innovation and technology is the way forward for Hong Kong to remain competitive and prosperous.
   <br/>
   <br/>

   </a>
   on his latest Policy Address, Lee said the good research being carried out needs to be turned into marketable products that can help society.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He said the territory has attracted a lot of I&T talent to grow the field.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We have created platforms for people to gather together and so far, we've got two platforms, which we call InnoHK. [They] have gathered altogether 2,500 very top leading researchers from different parts of the world. They gather both physically in Hong Kong and also online," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "That is some of the things that we do. We want to set up more laboratories so that there will be more possible projects to be transformable and then we want more money to be put into research."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lee added that the government cannot be the only source of investment in the field.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We're still only investing about 1.07 percent of the whole GDP of Hong Kong, but for many successful countries, you have to at least have 5 percent to talk about a level that will ensure that we can really go ahead. So we are working very hard," he said.

    'Enhanced capital scheme to attract more talent to HK'

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Friday said he was confident that improvements to the New Capital Investment Entrant Scheme would attract more talent to Hong Kong.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In his policy blueprint, the chief executive announced that successful applicants to the cash-for-residency scheme are now permitted to invest in residential property worth at least HK$50 million, with up to HK$10 million counting towards the total capital investment.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Previously, residential property investments were not allowed under the scheme.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Speaking on an RTHK programme, Chan said this change aims to lure high-net-worth individuals while still protecting the local housing market.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Our policy goal is not to prop up the property market for units worth more than HK$50 million. That's not my objective. My aim is this: when people come to Hong Kong and want to invest in property, they can. However, we don't want this to disrupt our local residential market," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The finance minister also said he hopes the government's move to ease mortgage lending restrictions would foster a more stable and positive market outlook for the property market.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Policy Address outlined that the maximum loan-to-value ratio for homes would be adjusted to 70 percent regardless of their value, while the maximum debt servicing ratio would be raised to 50 percent.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The property market is becoming more stable. Recent transaction volumes have been lower than before, which we see as a positive sign of orderly adjustment," Chan said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We hope that after the property market returns to normal in this way, everyone will have more positive expectations for its future development."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Chan stressed that property prices and transaction volumes were influenced by many factors, including economic conditions, the stock market, and the external environment.

    Abundant land supply helps keep prices in check: CE
   </title>

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Chief Executive John Lee on Friday said Hong Kong has enough land alloted for housing that should prevent any acute shortages over the next few decades, and also help keep prices in check.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He was responding to a caller on an RTHK
   <a href="https://www.rthk.hk/radio/radio3/programme/ce_phonein " style="font-size: inherit; color: #1a0dab" target="_blank">
    phone-in programme
   </a>
   asking whether the government’s reserve prices for land sales effectively keeps prices largely unaffordable.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lee stressed that land is a precious asset that belongs to the people and should be valued accordingly.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He also noted that he had in his Policy Address this week introduced measures to help prospective homebuyers by increasing how much they can borrow from banks for mortgages.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   While noting that there is “still more” the government needs to do, he stressed that the government has accelerated its pace in securing land for housing, and the 7,000 hectares of land now available for residential use over the next three decades means there shouldn’t be any shortage.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “If there's more land supply, then the price of land will be suitably set according to [the actual] market situation. The big shortage that appeared previously should not happen that abruptly now,” Lee said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Chief Executive also said developers will have to keep prices tethered to reality as everyone knows there’s adequate supply.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “Everybody knows how much land and when it will be available, and the price set by the developers will have to be in accordance with the actual situation and then all the calculations can be done by even the normal citizen,” he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lee also played down the possibility that new proposed restrictions on subdivided flats could create a shortage and drive prices up, as the government is set to propose new legislation requiring all flats to be at least 86 square feet in size, have windows and an individual toilet.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He said there are clear financial incentives for people to supply small, affordable units for rent, as research shows they would earn several times more from renting out subdivided units compared to one single apartment.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “There is a strong business case for the market to develop,” he said. “Once the rules are clear, then I think it’s only natural for those who have been benefiting or who see this as a beneficial business will then develop it.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He said there should be ample time for this new supply to emerge, since the entire process of legislation and registration, along with a grace period, means the new rules would only fully be in place in “a few years.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “I think the market will ensure that the right rent is set,” Lee said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The CE also repeated his call for various business sectors here to reform and evolve to  adapt to the changing conditions.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “The economy isn't doing badly because we are still strongly in the belief that the overall economy will grow between 2.5 to 3.5 percent,” he said. “That means the macro economy is positive, but micro-economy, particularly for some sectors, they may have to think of new ways of doing things as to make themselves attractive.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   While the Chief Executive spent most of the hour-long phone-in programme explaining his new policies, he got some new ideas from callers as well, including from Jeffrey – who asked John Lee if he could do anything to pave the way for motorcyclists to ride their bikes directly across the border.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The questioned appeared to stir up the CE’s passion as a car enthusiast.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “Obviously, I enjoy driving as well,” Lee responded. “So I do look forward to the time when I do retire, then I will personally drive to different parts of the world, in particularly the GBA and other mainland cities.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “So I do understand why you want to have your own bike and drive up to the mainland – it's easy and also China being a big country you really have a lot to see, really a lot to enjoy. I can't make my promise but definitely you have made a new point which I find attractive”, he said.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Chief Executive John Lee said it is important to promote Hong Kong's brand as a good education hub around the world to encourage more people to study in the SAR.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Speaking on an RTHK
   <a href="https://www.rthk.hk/radio/radio3/programme/ce_phonein " style="font-size: inherit; color: #1a0dab" target="_blank">
    phone-in programme
   </a>
   on Friday, he said the territory was working on becoming a global education hub, with five of its universities in the top 100.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He said it was important to maintain a strong educational standard among all institutions.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I will introduce the law to ensure that the standard is set, to ensure the Hong Kong education standard is a standard that has been as good as always has been, so to attract more people to join the education sector and allow more students to come to satisfy their individual needs," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The whole game plan is to ensure that we grow in different areas, be attractive to students around the world, to satisfy different aspirations of students in different parts of the world, particularly Belt and Road countries."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Meanwhile, Lee said that additional support centres for ethnic minorities groups have been set up in different districts, to provide interpretation and translation services to reduce language barrier concerns for those looking for a job in the SAR.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He added that reform has been made to the Employees Retraining Board to ensure that people are equipped with the right skills and training for employment.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Instead of just training people for jobs, then we have now think that it's more appropriate to design courses to train people with skills. When we talk about skills, we need to know what kind of skills are required for employees to get good jobs in Hong Kong," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Rather than trying to learn to chase for jobs, we increase the potential and abilities for every employee, so that they have skills and they can pick the jobs."

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The government on Thursday said it is confident that its plan to get rid of poor quality subdivided flats will not leave residents homeless and there'll be plenty of public housing available for them.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In his Policy Address on Wednesday, Chief Executive John Lee said a registration system will be introduced, and subdivided units will have to be at least eight square metres in size, with a window and separate toilet.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   At a media briefing on Thursday, officials added that other requirements will include that rooms have a height of at least 2.3 metres, that the window opens into an area that isn't enclosed on all sides, and that the toilet has a ventilation system.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The units must also comply with fire safety regulations.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   About 30 percent of the city's 110,000 subdivided units are expected to fall foul of the new rules.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A 12-18 month registration period is expected to begin in the fourth quarter of next year, with owners given a grace period of up to two years following registration to comply with the new rules.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Deputy Financial Secretary Michael Wong, who leads the Task Force on Tackling the Issue of Subdivided Units, said there's an abundant supply of public housing for residents of flats that don't make the grade.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “We've looked at the current composition of the residents of subdivided units. About 60 percent will be eligible for public housing. So the key is to provide an adequate quantity of public housing units, and that's something, I will say, where we are succeeding,” he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “For the coming five years, even if we do not count the number of light public housing, we're able to provide more than 30,000 public housing units every year.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He said tenants affected could also move into transitional housing or subdivided flats that do meet the minimum standards.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Meanwhile, Permanent Secretary for Housing Rosanna Law said rewards of about HK$3,000 will be offered to people who provide tip-offs about public housing tenancy abuse.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The move will be part of the "Cherish Public Housing Resources Award Scheme" to be launched by the Housing Authority in January.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Law said people will only get a reward once a recovery notice for a flat is issued, saying the authorities are setting conditions to deter indiscriminate reporting.

  <img alt="The three-year pilot programme would allow up to 1,000 elderly people who are currently receiving CSSA to receive monthly subsidies of HK$5,000 to live in designated homes in Guangdong.

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   A professor in geriatric medicine said the new pilot scheme to subsidise elderly welfare recipients to live in special homes in Guangdong would be attractive to those who are relatively healthy and fit, but she said the option is not ideal for those who cannot care for themselves.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Jean Woo, from the Chinese University's Faculty of Medicine, made the comment after Chief Executive John Lee said in his new Policy Address on Wednesday that the three-year pilot programme would allow up to 1,000 elderly people, who are currently receiving Comprehensive Social Security Assistance (CSSA), to receive monthly subsidies of HK$5,000 to live in designated residential care homes in Guangdong.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   She told RTHK that it may be very difficult for the elderly with serious illnesses or disabilities to cope with a new environment.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "What happens as you get older and older, nobody really knows, because we don't know what the healthcare support is like. If you have various chronic diseases, how easy is it to access primary care, follow-up, and so on," she said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Healthcare vouchers could be used on the mainland and certainly in some of the hospitals there, so I think that's a great help. So when you start to decline with your brain not working too well and physically you're not moving so well, what would be the situation? What about your social network, your family? There are a lot of unknowns," she added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I suspect the plan is not to move this group, but to have an option for people who are now living in the community, but wanted to be in an environment where they don't want to cook or do housework, or they want some social activities."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Meanwhile, she said the quality and services in local residential care homes (RCHs) would go up, after the chief executive said there would be additional manpower support through the Special Scheme to Import Care Workers for RCHs.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I think we need to do something further upstream to slow down the decline into dependency by having initiatives in the community. But as I said, it's better than nothing," she said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It's a good direction to go because we are very short of people, the training and so on. But I think the salary needs to perhaps go up a bit more to attract people."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In terms of the government's plan to step up support for caregivers by extending their current service of sending community care teams to households in need to other parts of the city, Woo said care teams are great for the elderly because they are equipped with the right training.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "From a geriatrician's point of view, we're used to screening multiple domains and we've been doing this using an automatic format and we have created an app so that we can train people in terms of what to look out [for], and watch out for things," she said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "There's a lot we can do before we even get to the doctors and the nurses, and the medications."

    LME looking into listing HK as a delivery point: govt

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury Christopher Hui on Thursday said the London Metal Exchange (LME) is looking into listing Hong Kong as a delivery point.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Hui told reporters that the LME had earlier expressed a desire to set up a warehouse in the city, and it is exploring practical ways to do so.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Now the process is on their side, in terms of assessing the legal environment here, in terms of whether and how it can meet the criteria to be admitted as a delivery point by LME. I think that's the first step they need to take, before other warehouse companies can choose to locate their warehouses here," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We have been in discussion with them, at the same time through our InvestHK, to facilitate any information and any assistance that they need from the government."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Asked if a site has been chosen, Financial Secretary Paul Chan said existing warehouses could be used if suitable, and it is not essential to build new facilities.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   LME, owned by Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing, is a centre for the trading of industrial metals, with the majority of non-ferrous metal futures business transacted on its platforms.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In his Policy Address on Wednesday, Chief Executive John Lee said the government will capitalise on opportunities to establish supporting facilities for the storage and delivery of commodities.

    FS hopes for public confidence in property market

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Thursday said the government had taken into consideration factors like property prices, the supply of housing and the city's economy, before it reduced the down payment needed to buy a flat.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   As announced in the chief executive's Policy Address yesterday, the maximum loan-to-value ratio for residential properties would be adjusted to 70 percent, regardless of their value, whether the properties were for self-use or not, or were being purchased by first-time buyers.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Chan said property prices had come down and there would be sufficient housing supply, with over 108,000 first-hand units available in the next three to four years.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We should let the market forces play. We should not unduly impose measures to suppress the demand, or try to prioritise different demands. Also, taking into consideration, at the moment, our banking sector is very healthy, very well-capitalised. The [number of] negative equity cases compared to 1998, for example, is much lower," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We do feel confident to remove those restrictions so that we would be able to project a more positive expectation... about the healthy and stable development of the Hong Kong property market in the coming future."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Chan added that government revenue from land sales and stamp duties was lower than expectations, but it was too early to revise estimates on the fiscal deficit for the financial year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He expects Hong Kong to record further growth for the remainder of the year, with the start of the US Federal Reserve interest rate easing cycle giving the economy an added boost.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Six police officers have been jailed for 25 to 41 months each for perverting the course of justice relating to an operation involving homeless people in 2020.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The officers – Leung Fei-pang, Pong Chun-sze, Lam Wah-ka, Mok Chi-shing, Wan Pak-sze and Chan Sau-yip – were convicted last month of falsely accusing a man of possessing drugs, and blocking CCTV cameras during the operation in Sham Shui Po.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   At Thursday's sentencing, District Court judge Kathie Cheung said perverting the course of justice is a serious offence, and the officers had abused their powers and undermined public confidence in the force.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lam, a sergeant and the most senior officer at the scene, was imprisoned for 41 months; Mok, Wan and Chan each received 37-month sentences; and Leung and Pong were each given 25-month jail terms.

    CE says he hopes for good news soon on mainland visas

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Chief Executive John Lee said on Thursday that he hopes the SAR government's ideas to get more mainlanders to visit Hong Kong will "materialise soon".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In his Policy Address on Wednesday, Lee said the central government is pro-actively studying suggestions including the resumption of multiple-entry visas for Shenzhen residents and expanding the number of cities that grant visas for weekly visits to the SAR.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   At a Legco question and answer session on the address, retail sector lawmaker Peter Shiu brought up the issue of visas, saying restaurants and shops are facing major challenges amid a sluggish economy.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lee said he hopes announcements can be made soon.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "In our discussions with the central authorities, we adopt a pragmatic attitude, so we only put forward measures that work. Of course, we are not at liberty to reveal the measures that we are exploring," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Meanwhile, Third Side lawmaker Tik Chi-yuen expressed concern that the wealth gap in Hong Kong is widening.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He said economic development might be hindered because "a good number of residents" don't actively participate in society and lack a sense of belonging.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In response, Lee said it's normal for there to be various views in society and there is no need to exaggerate the differences.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He stressed that he wants to build an inclusive and caring society, and said the government always keeps an open mind and is willing to listen to different views.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "There are always pointed questions or critical questions raised at press conferences and we will always try to answer those questions," Lee said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "If you come up with suggestions on ways to improve, some are well-intentioned and some are really poignant criticisms. And many of these actually become a part of the new measures in the Policy Address."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The CE also noted that Canada's Fraser Institute has ranked the SAR as the world's freest economy in its latest report, saying this means people can engage in any economic activity in Hong Kong and be afforded the greatest level of freedom under local laws.

    Quit dwelling on HK's past success, CE tells firms

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   It would be unrealistic to try to stop people from spending their free time across the border and abroad, Chief Executive John Lee said on Thursday, amid complaints from local retailers and restaurants over flagging business as more Hongkongers choose to spend their money elsewhere.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lee advised the retail industry to acknowledge the structural change in consumption patterns, and address the problem by seeking reform.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   On a joint radio phone-in programme, one day after delivering his third Policy Address, Lee said the SAR is undergoing a period of transition.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It’s time to stop dwelling on the past success, he told businesses.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Overall speaking, the retail industry isn’t doing really well. Even as we boost inbound tourism, we must first acknowledge the structural change of their consumption pattern," Lee said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Everyone needs to keep improving – not just the one in front of you or next to you. Start with yourself. Of course the government will try to help, but there will be ups and downs," he said, adding that he aims to compress this "transition period" as much as possible.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Many Hong Kong retailers and restaurants also say they are struggling to compete for customers against rivals in Shenzhen, Zhuhai and other parts of the Greater Bay Area.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Nearly one and half million Hong Kong residents left the city via various land border checkpoints over the Chung Yeung Festival long weekend, dealing a fresh blow to local businesses.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But Lee said this is only normal market behaviour, and the government will do its best to help local businesses, including looking at ways to tackle high rent and costs.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He said that being as Hong Kong’s economy is undergoing a period of change, one of the government’s roles is to look for new growth areas.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Authorities will now look into building a commodity trading ecosystem, leveraging on Hong Kong’s safe and free environment, he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A “global trader” has signalled its intention to establish a metal warehouse in Hong Kong, Lee said, describing this as the perfect starting point.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   On a separate note, the chief executive pledged to forge full speed ahead with a plan to regulate subdivided homes.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He has proposed a bill which will set a minimum size and other conditions for the units, and landlords which don't register their properties will be prosecuted.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   With an estimated 110,000 such units, Lee said one headache would be deciding how long the registration period should last.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I'm an impatient man...I said, how about 12 to 18 months? But with 110,000 units to deal with, and divided by 12 months, we have to register about 9,000 each month. Is this pragmatic? I would need to discuss this with my colleagues," he said.

  <img alt="John Lee says the Housing Authority will allocate an extra ballot number to young families and single-person applicants aged below 40. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=1&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1774925_1_20241017101330.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   An analyst at a local think-tank has welcomed this year's Policy Address as one focused on improving the quality of people's lives, saying the increased chances for young people to attain an apartment under the Home Ownership Scheme would motivate them to climb up the housing ladder.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Jason Leung, the Head of Land and Housing at the Our Hong Kong Foundation, made the comment on RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme on Thursday after Chief Executive John Lee said the Housing Authority would allocate an extra ballot number to young families and single-person applicants aged below 40.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "In the past, if we are talking about Home Ownership Scheme flats, the numbers offered for sale each year is very low. It's about 3,000 to 4,000 a year perhaps. Now it's getting more and more and moving to about 8,000 to 9,000 per year. So it's slightly easier to get a flat in the balloting right now and especially with the new mechanism that people who previously were unsuccessful in the balloting could get you know more ballots," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Youths could get a more preferential treatment as well. So the Home Ownership Scheme flats, these are more accessible to these people right now, and I think that this will be a positive direction for people to attain home ownership."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Meanwhile, Leung said residents living in subdivided units that do not meet the minimum standards could potentially be moved to transitional housing given its flexible conditions, after Lee said the government would propose a new set of standards which include the provision of windows, an individual toilet, and a floor area of no less than eight square metres.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "If you look at the distribution of transitional housing, actually there are quite a number of them that are in the urban areas as well, and as the government constructs more light public housing and public rental housing in the coming few years, existing tenants in the transitional housing could move on to these government-run housing programmes," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The space in these transitional housing in the urban areas can then be released and hopefully used to house these people that could be affected by these subdivided units."

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Mainland authorities on Wednesday further relaxed visa rules for non-Chinese Hong Kong residents, allowing for more people to apply for multiple-entry visas that allow individual visits of up to six months.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Back in July, mainland authorities announced a five-year card for non-Chinese permanent Hong Kong residents, allowing them to travel to the mainland. The card allows stays of up to 90 days and use of the speedier e-gates at immigration.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Commissioner's Office of the Foreign Ministry in Hong Kong said that with immediate effect, both permanent and non-permanent residents of Hong Kong who are non-Chinese can apply for the visas of up to five years, with each trip lasting a maximum 180 days.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "[This is] to facilitate personnel exchanges between Hong Kong and the mainland, [and] support Hong Kong’s integration into the overall development of the country," the office said in a statement.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It said that this applies to applicants going to the mainland for business, travel, visiting family members, as well as cultural and academic exchanges.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Applicants will not need to submit a receipt for return transport tickets and hotel bookings. They also will not have to get their fingerprints recorded again if they underwent the procedure during a previous visa application.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The office added that the new policy does not apply to foreign domestic workers.

    Principal moratorium will help SMEs: chamber

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce on Wednesday welcomed the measures unveiled in the Policy Address to support small and medium enterprises (SMEs).
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I think most important to note is that the proposal to revive the mortgage moratorium, to allow the SMEs to repay the interest rather than the capital for the month borrowed for the mortgage," the chamber's CEO Patrick Yeung told RTHK.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I think it's a way to help them to address the current financial challenges."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Chief Executive John Lee announced in his policy blueprint that SMEs can apply for a principal moratorium for up to 12 months to ease their cash-flow pressure, if they borrow money under government-backed loan schemes. Authorities will also offer partial principal repayment options.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   On government plans to kick-start the city's low-altitude economy by exploring the use of aerial technology, such as drones, Yeung said officials need to overcome technical challenges if they are to make use of low-altitude airspace for economic activity.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We have to look into the infrastructure, then where will be the good place to put up a space, and where to put up charging facilities, et cetera," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "So, it's a good idea, but definitely not an easy one to tackle with all those technical challenges possible facing this low-altitude economy."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The government will set up a cross-departmental task force led by the deputy financial secretary to explore the use of technologies at the airspace within an altitude of up to 1,000 metres.

    'Liquor duty cut won't have big effect on prices'
   </title>

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The wine and spirits industry on Wednesday said Hong Kong's reduction in duty on premium spirits won't have a huge effect on the sector, or the public.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The duty on liquor with an alcohol content above 30 percent and with an import price of over HK$200 has been cut from 100 percent to 10 percent for the portion above HK$200.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Hong Kong General Chamber of Wine and Spirits welcomed the move, but said the change will only be noticed when it comes to luxury products.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I think it's not easy for the industry, also for the catering sector to slash prices at this moment. I think it only benefits those expensive items, for example, [those with a] retail price of over HK$1,000," Raymond Luk, who chairs the chamber's economic policy and social affairs committee, told RTHK.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Eric Man, general manager at Wai Shing Wine and Spirits, said only around 20 percent of customers buy spirits that are priced over HK$1,000.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We originally hoped that citizens would be able to use around HK$500 to HK$800 to buy and enjoy liquor of better quality. But the policy now... consumers will still have to increase their budget to get better spirits, it is hard to tell whether they will be willing to do that," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Man said he would like to see the HK$200 threshold for the duty cut reduced by half, so more kinds of liquor would be covered.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Luk added that such a move would increase the competitiveness of Hong Kong's liquor market.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "For the current rates under the new policy, we are still the highest in East Asia. But in the long term, I think it's possible that we'll gain an increased appeal as a high-end spirit destination due to the reduction in taxes, as well as the speeding up of the development of activities related to high-end prestige spirits like trading, distribution and auctions," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Chief Executive John Lee said officials moved to slash the tax on hard liquor because they saw market opportunities similar to the ones that followed after the duty on wine was abolished in 2008.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Speaking at a press conference, Lee said officials made the decision considering that around 85 percent of hard liquor in the market is priced under HK$200.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He said the objective was to boost the trade in high-end liquor and hoped it would have a similar effect to the abolition of wine duties.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lee noted the import and re-export value of red wine last year rose by 375 percent compared to 2007, the year before the product became tax free in Hong Kong.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Over one year after wine duty has been reduced, we saw an increase of about 350 operators of wine, and an increase of about 1,000 jobs. The income for that sector increased by about 35 percent," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lee stressed the government isn't encouraging people to drink, saying it has struck a balance between public health and the need to develop the hard liquor market.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Licensed Bar and Club Association, meanwhile, said that though bar operators support the tax cut, it might not bring immediate benefits.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The association's founding president, Ben Leung, said he thinks the measures can boost Hong Kong's competitiveness in the global liquor market in the long run, because more brands and different types of spirits would enter the local market.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "But bars cannot benefit immediately because above them [in the chain], there are importers and agents, they themselves might need some time to digest [the news] and make adjustments. They might not have room to lower prices immediately," he said in a statement.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Leung also called on the Chief Executive to review how to better promote the local night economy, saying that would "expand the room for survival" for small to medium enterprises.

    'Tenants who lose substandard shoebox flats need help'

  <img alt="A concern group says the government needs to think of ways to settle affected residents. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=1&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1774796_1_20241016154136.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Reactions to the government’s plan to eradicate poor quality subdivided units (SDUs) were largely supportive, although there were also calls for the administration to ensure adequate follow-up actions to support affected tenants during the transition.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The proposed new laws require each unit to be at least eight square metres, or 86 square feet in size and have its own toilet and windows.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A concern group said it estimates that 20 percent of the city's 110,000 subdivided units would be affected under the scheme.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Kenny Ng from the Concerning Grassroot Housing Rights Alliance called on the government to come up with ways to make sure affected tenants had a place to live.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “The government didn't mention how to relocate those residents who are living in subdivided flats who will be affected under this scheme."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Will they be arranged to some other housing for their relocation, or will they just let them rent other private housing themselves? If so, I think those deprived groups will rent some other subdivided flats which will be illegal,” he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Ng said the government could consider using unused public housing or transitional housing units to settle affected residents.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Meanwhile, an NGO that connects deprived groups with landlords said the government should establish a clear timeline for when the law will be in place.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lai Kin-kwok from the ComHome Social Housing Platform also called for more detailed criteria regarding the minimum living standards for subdivided units.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “We can't find the timeline, especially when the law will be established and then how long the grace period is."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “I think from the information now, we don't know whether the windows can be opened or not... And regarding the eight square metres, I think that's the minimum standard, but it depends on how many residents are inside the eight square metres,” Lai said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He anticipated that landlords of subdivided flats not affected by the proposed laws would consider increasing rents, saying he was disappointed the Policy Address did not address the need for a rent cap.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sources said a two-month consultation will take place in December, with the aim of submitting related legislative proposals to Legco next year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Speaking in a media briefing after the Policy Address, Chief Executive John Lee said it would take a few years to root out the problem.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "First of all, we'll have to pass the legislation, which I think the earliest will probably be next year. Then, we will introduce the registration period. My suggestion is either 12 months or 18 months," Lee said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Then we'll introduce the tolerance period for adjustments, structurally, to be made. That may be one year, two years, again subject to discussion by Legco."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   According to the sources, penalties for landlords who fail to make improvements after the grace period would include possible imprisonment and fines.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But for a subdivided tenant surnamed Au, the law enforcement actions might not pose a deterrent effect to her landlord.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   She pays a monthly rent of HK$2,500 for 20-square-foot room with no individual toilet and kitchen, a space that falls in the sub-standard SDU category.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “In this flat, if they combine two rooms and provide more than 90 [square] feet, I’m fine. They have a window, I’m fine. I don’t mind if there is no air conditioning. But I think my landlord will not change, he'll just pay the penalty without doing anything if the government penalises him,” Au said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “The environment I have now, if I have to be honest, what difference is there from sleeping on the streets? It’s bad that there is no air con on the streets and dust and dirt is emitted from cars, but at least you feel more comfortable and have more space,” she added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Au said she had doubts about whether the government could carry out its plan successfully and would stay in her unit until she gets allocated public housing.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “I have no idea what is going to happen tomorrow. Like if tomorrow I buy a lottery ticket, I don’t know if I will win,” she said.

    Property sector welcomes mortgage rules relaxation

  <img alt="The property sector is happy about the relaxation of mortgage restrictions, saying it will boost the property market and overall economy.

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The property sector on Wednesday welcomed the government's move to ease mortgage restrictions, saying it will significantly boost the property market and the overall economy.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In his third Policy Address, Chief Executive John Lee announced that the maximum loan-to-value (LTV) ratio for homes will be adjusted to 70 percent regardless of their value, while the maximum debt servicing ratio (DSR) will be raised to 50 percent.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Hannah Jeong, from real estate services firm CBRE, said she thinks the relaxation will boost transaction volumes, especially in the luxury market.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "This will give a better liquidity for the homebuyers, the people who are looking for the upgrading demand, or they want to enter the market [for the] first time given the good discount offering from the developers. And their down payment amount has been reduced by utilising this LTV ratio increase," she said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "So this improvement will affect, in a possible way, the luxury residential [market] more, because previously it was only 60 percent."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Joseph Tsang, chairman of real estate services company JLL, said the LTV move will boost transaction volumes for new residential projects, but it won't be strong enough to reverse the downward trend in housing prices.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The future trend of Hong Kong housing prices will largely depend on the effectiveness of economic stimulus measures introduced by the mainland government," he wrote in a statement.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Real estate and construction sector lawmaker Louis Loong also welcomed the changes, adding that he is happy to see the maximum LTV ratio and DSR limit back to pre-2009 levels.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "This sends a very positive message to the entire property market. We have always told the government that a weak property market is not beneficial for Hong Kong's overall economy," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I believe this will have a very positive effect on Hong Kong's entire property market and even on the economy as a whole."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Still, the founder and chief executive of Centaline Property Group, Shih Wing-ching, said some remained concerned about potential declines in property values despite the relaxation in mortgage rules.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "What now worries people is no longer the difficulty to get a mortgage loan. People worry about the risk of further declines in property value. So quite a lot of people now choose to rent rather to purchase. If they choose to rent, the relaxation of this ratio could not do them any good," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "This policy of course can help a little bit, but the property market is more complex. You need to also look at interest rates, supply and demand. The problem now is that people have not really established their faith in the future, so they are not willing to commit too much at this moment."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Shih added the move alone is not enough to boost developers' appetite for land because it also depends on improvements in transaction volumes and inventory levels in the primary market.

    Govt to subsidise care-home spots in Guangdong

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The government is launching a new pilot scheme to subsidise elderly welfare recipients to live in care homes in Guangdong, while it will also expand an existing subsidy programme to include more facilities in the province.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Chief Executive John Lee said in his new Policy Address that a three-year pilot programme will allow up to 1,000 elderly people who are currently receiving Comprehensive Social Security Assistance (CSSA) to receive monthly subsidies of HK$5,000 to live in designated residential care homes in Guangdong.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The existing Residential Care Services Scheme in Guangdong, meanwhile, will be expanded, with seven more residential homes joining the programme in November 2024.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The government is also providing more help to needy elderly people who want to remain in Hong Kong.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lee said there will be a 20-percent increase in the number of vouchers given out to elderly people in need of care, but are still waiting for a subsidised spot in a home.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Six-thousand vouchers will be given out to allow beneficiaries to be admitted to homes of their choice without the need to wait further.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Chief Executive also announced other poverty-alleviation measures in his Policy Address, including more than doubling the number of schools offering after-school care services for primary students to allow their parents to work; and expanding its existing “Strive and Rise” programme, where underprivileged children are matched up with mentors.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The School-based After-School Care Service Scheme will increase from 50 to over 110 schools, Lee said, and more schools will be encouraged to join, such that there’s no planned cap to the number of students who can benefit from the programme.

   Chief Executive John Lee said on Wednesday that the government will step up its support for young people hoping to buy subsidised flats.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He announced in his Policy Address that the Housing Authority would allocate an extra ballot number to young families and single-person applicants aged below 40, to increase their chances of getting an apartment under the Home Ownership Scheme.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lee added that starting from the next White Form Secondary Market Scheme (WSM) exercise, the quota for those flats will increase by 1,500 -- all of which will be allocated to young family applicants and one-person applicants under the age of 40.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   And in a bid to encourage more public housing tenants to buy Home Ownership Scheme units, the government said it will revise the allocation between green form, or current public housing residents, and white form applicants from its current ratio of 4:6 to 5:5.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Meanwhile, as part of efforts to crack down on tenancy abuse, the Housing Authority will launch the "Cherish Public Housing Resources Award Scheme" in January next year, offering rewards to anyone providing intelligence that helps to identify such cases.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The CE also said the government hopes to cut the average waiting time for public rental housing from the current 5.5 years to 4.5 years in 2026-27.
