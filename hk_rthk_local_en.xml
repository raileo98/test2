<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hospital Authority (HA) on Monday announced a series of smart measures in accident and emergency departments and wards to better monitor patients and reduce medical mishaps.
 <br>
  <br>
  Among them is a geofencing system aimed at preventing dementia patients from wandering off which will be used in all hospitals by the end of this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  If a patient with a special wristband walks too close to an exit door, an alarm will sound to alert hospital staff, said the authority's director of quality and safety Michael Wong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If they get away from our accident and emergency departments, it will be very difficult for us to find them. And they might have some accident or deterioration during the missing period," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong said the authority will expand its use of smart oxygen cylinders with alarms that activate when the main switch isn't turned on before use.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If the gas is nearly empty, it will also have an alarm. It will ensure that our staff will turn on the main switch and ensure that if the gas is running out, we will replace a new one as soon as possible."
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the authority is also implementing a new reporting system that will use AI and big data to analyse trends and patterns in medical blunders.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We can make use of the data to have early trending and to find out the common contributing factors to incidents so as to prevent future similar events from happening," said Raymond Cheung, a chief manager with the authority.

 Four of the world’s top football teams will be coming to Hong Kong this summer for pre-season friendlies as they gear up for the 2025-26 season, organisers said on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  English Premier League giant Liverpool and Serie A side AC Milan will face off on July 26 for the Standard Chartered Trophy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, two other English Premier League teams Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur will meet on July 31, marking the first north London derby outside of the UK.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two games will take place at the new 50,000-capacity Kai Tak Stadium, with the retractable roof closed and air conditioning under each seat to make the upcoming hot and humid weather more bearable.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rachael Carroll, managing director of TEG sport, organiser and promoter of the festival, said the Hong Kong Football Festival will attract at least 100,000 fans both locally and from outside the SAR, which will generate great value for the local economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's a wonderful opportunity to really launch Kai Tak Sports Park globally, really put this on the map, and these are fantastic rivalries and to have these two big matches, two great rivalries to really celebrate the opening of Kai Tak Sports Park and have the eyes of the world on Hong Kong, we thought that that was appropriate," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Of course in the future, we would love to see international teams play local teams here in the market as well, so we think that this is going to be a great location for football in the future."
  <br>
  <br>
  The organiser also said the three Premier League clubs will also hold open training sessions on July 24, 29 and 30 for fans to watch before the two exhibition matches.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ticket details will be announced shortly by the organiser.

 Hong Kong has become a lot cleaner in recent times with scores of rear lanes tidied up, dog mess issues resolved and waste dumping brought to an end in various locations, the government said on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The administration said it has removed more than 600 sites from its "hygiene black spot" list after tackling issues that also included wild birds congregating, graffiti, rodent infestations, abandoned vehicles and shop front extensions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Only around 100 problem sites remain on the list that was first compiled in 2022, suffering from the above problems and other headaches such as illegally parked bicycles and dripping air-conditioners
  <br>
  <br>
  "The hygiene conditions at 94 percent (696) of the hygiene black spots on the list have been markedly improved and could be considered for removal from the black spot list," said Deputy Chief Secretary Warner Cheuk.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The government's work on tackling hygiene black spots is ongoing. The departments concerned will continue to sustain their efforts and closely monitor the hygiene conditions of these spots. Prompt actions will be taken in case of any change of circumstances."
  <br>
  <br>
  Cheuk also expressed gratitude for efforts over the past two years to revamp the cityscape and hygiene conditions.

 Officials have brushed off concerns that landlords might be hesitant about getting their dwellings declared as basic housing units under the planned new regulatory regime for subdivided flats, saying they would not consider extending a registration period.
 <br>
  <br>
  The administration on Monday also suggested the possibility of establishing a reporting mechanism on homes breaching such rules.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to the government proposal, landlords will be given 12 months to register their properties before having three years to make necessary improvements to be certified.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I don't see why owners would not register if they intend to continue to operate," Deputy Financial Secretary Michael Wong told lawmakers when asked if registration numbers are low.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're not going to extend the [registration] period... The consequence of not registering is serious."
  <br>
  <br>
  To be certified as a basic housing unit, owners must hire a building professional who checks if the flat meets a set of prescribed requirements.
  <br>
  <br>
  A fee is also payable to the government.
  <br>
  <br>
  Secretary for Housing Winnie Ho said the administration is considering charging landlords by residential units and that officials will study suggestions that fees should be based on home sizes.
  <br>
  <br>
  She also addressed worries from lawmakers that some landlords might not comply with the regulations and operate subpar homes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The design of the [basic housing unit] regime comes with a very sufficient grace period and registration period," Ho said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our requirements are very pragmatic... These are all doable.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We may need a reporting mechanism to catch the most serious cases."
  <br>
  <br>
  The government is hoping to introduce a bill on regulating the compact homes in the latter half of this year.

    HK 'remains art hub despite global market decline'

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong just wrapped up another year of art festivals, including Art Basel and Art Central this month, and they have led an investor to say the city remains an important hub for the market.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on
  <a href="https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/news-programmes/this-episode.htm?cmsid=77&episode_id=1014051&livetime=20250331000000" target="_blank">
   <u>
    <b>
     RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme
    </b>
   </u>
  </a>
  , ArtTactic chief operating officer Lindsay Dewar said last year was a tough one for the market since its peak back in 2022 and despite its recovery from the Covid pandemic.
  <br>
  <br>
  The year saw a decline of 27 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, she said there is "a new normality" in the market and "people are finding their footing again."
  <br>
  <br>
  On a notable decline in modern and contemporary art sales in the SAR and the mainland, Dewar says Hong Kong remains the third largest art centre worldwide for auction sales and that market sales globally has doubled over the past 10 years.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think it's really remarkable to see a market grow so much in such a relatively short period and that really speaks to the confidence the art community sees in Hong Kong," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dewar also noted that Hong Kong still accounts for up to 81 percent of total art sales in both the SAR and the mainland, showing its importance in this portion of the market.
  <br>
  <br>
  Reflecting on a decline in auction turnover at Art Basel Hong Kong recently, Dewar thinks it reflects more of the general world market trend.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is kind of a broader trend that we're seeing, and it's worth bearing in mind that the sale we had in London at the beginning of this month was also down," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dewar also noted that a new generation of art collectors is emerging that is seeking more affordable artworks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Latest tariff uncertainties and reduced returns over assets recently have impacted the global art market, and Dewar believes there are two main impacts.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said shorter holding periods are one of them, with people being less speculative and wanting to hold on to their artworks longer.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another is that market may become more regional.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For a while after Covid people are looking at the market and thinking where's the best part of the market for me to sell in... whereas now we might see people saying I'm in Hong Kong and I'm going to stay in Hong Kong... so like the American market may become more American," Dewar said.

    Data breach of 128,000 'due to system fix and neglect'

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data says a data breach incident by ImagineX has led to nearly 128,000 people’s information being compromised.
 <br>
  <br>
  Failing to delete temporary accounts in a timely manner and the use of end-of-support operating systems were the main factors leading to the breach, the Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data (PCPD) said on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The privacy watchdog said in May it received a report from ImagineX Management, a brand management company, about a ransom note related to stolen personal data.
  <br>
  <br>
  After an investigation, the office found that the hacker had exploited a temporary user account and then used it to access the company’s intranet.
  <br>
  <br>
  Around 68GB of personal data – involving names, email addresses, phone numbers, birth months, genders and nationalities – of the nearly 128,000 people were compromised.
  <br>
  <br>
  The PCPD said those affected were mostly from brands who participated in ImagineX Management ‘s two membership programmes.
  <br>
  <br>
  So far, there’s no evidence indicating the stolen data is being circulated or misused, it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chief personal data officer Brad Kwok said the company had set up a temporary account with remote access to fix a system problem but forgot to delete it afterwards.
  <br>
  <br>
  “This allowed the threat actor to exploit the account to compromise the network 10 days after the account was set up,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “In the investigation, we also found that ImagineX lacked standard procedures for creating and managing temporary accounts.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This made the deletion of the temporary account solely dependent on measures taken by individual staff members.”
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted the company had also used an operating system that had no longer been updated since 2020, making it vulnerable to attacks.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is also accused of having inefficient detection measures and not conducting sufficient security risk reviews and audits for its system.
  <br>
  <br>
  The PCPD said it issued an enforcement notice to ImagineX as it contravened the data protection principle and urged the company to take measures to prevent similar contraventions.

    Privacy watchdog issues AI guidelines for employees

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data (PCPD) on Monday issued a checklist to guide organisations in regulating their employees’ use of generative artificial intelligence.
 <br>
  <br>
  Privacy Commissioner Ada Chung said the checklist is important as the secure use of AI is an essential part of national security.
  <br>
  <br>
  “In the areas of technological development and industrial innovation, the country has all along stressed the equal importance of development and safety,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “In order to implement the spirit of the Two Sessions… and in order to facilitate the safe and healthy development and use of AI in Hong Kong, my office published the checklist on guidelines for the use of generative AI by employees today.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Organisations must specify tasks in which employees are allowed to use AI, with examples including drafting documents, summarising information and creating video and audio content.
  <br>
  <br>
  They should also clearly define which AI tools employees can use, which may include publicly-available or internally developed systems.
  <br>
  <br>
  The devices that can access the AI tools should also be regulated, the PCPD noted, as organisations are advised to establish clear distinctions between work devices and personal devices.
  <br>
  <br>
  Organisations should also spell out the penalties or review mechanisms for employees who don’t adhere to the guidelines.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chung said organisations need to be particularly careful if they want to train their AI models with data from clients.
  <br>
  <br>
  “For example, when you first collect the data, you did not tell them that it would be used for training AI but subsequently you want to [do so],” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “And you will need to obtain the customer's expressed and voluntary consent to do that under the Privacy Ordinance.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The full checklist of the newly released guidelines is available for download on the  PCPD’s website.
  <br>
  <br>
  The office said a hotline has been set up for organisations to make enquiries about how to use AI safely and properly.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chung also pointed out that the privacy watchdog has initiated compliance checks on 60 private-sector organisations and government departments to assess how responsibly they are using AI.
  <br>
  <br>
  The results will be finalised by summer.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The City University of Hong Kong (CityU) and the University of Cambridge signed a global research collaboration deal on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  As part of the deal, 18 top post-doctoral researchers from around the world will be based in Cambridge, taking advantage of its laboratories and resources under supervision by principal investigators from both universities for three years.
  <br>
  <br>
  CityU council chairman Michael Ngai said the collaboration aligns with the strategic goals of the Hong Kong government.
  <br>
  <br>
  'It serves as a vital step in further establishing Hong Kong as a premier international hub of higher education," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Six colleges and departments from each university will be collaborating together.
  <br>
  <br>
  Key research areas range from 3D medical data to creativity in an age of intelligent machines.
  <br>
  <br>
  CityU said the institution plans to offer attractive presidential assistant professorship positions to postdoctoral fellows upon the completion of their research contracts.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This collaboration now represents a single largest postdoctoral fellowship programme between University of Cambridge in Asia and an Asian university," CityU president Freddy Boey said.
  <br>
  <br>
  At the signing ceremony, University of Cambridge vice-chancellor Deborah Prentice said "this partnership will enable these outstanding scholars to have the freedom to continue to push the frontiers of research in addressing global challenges."
  <br>
  <br>
  She added that CityU has recently been recognised as the world's most international university by Times Higher Education in both 2024 and 2025.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government is looking into the possibility of having a single contractor design, build and operate a planned cross-border railway in the northwestern New Territories and says officials will start gauging developers' interest later this year.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong-Shenzhen Western Rail Link, which is a key component of the Northern Metropolis, is aimed at connecting Hung Shui Kiu with Qianhai.
  <br>
  <br>
  Estimated to come into operation in 2035, the proposed 18-kilometre cross-border railway is expected to take residents from one place to the other in 15 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Transport minister Mable Chan said the administration is considering different options for the project, including a "design, build and operate" contract.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the second half of the year when we invite intentions and expressions, we will then know whether [it can be] a design, build and operate [model] or whether it is [having] design and build as a contract and then operation as another contract," Chan told lawmakers on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Experienced operators can take up the operation solely, or they can partner up with other operating companies."
  <br>
  <br>
  Three stations along the proposed link will be in Hong Kong and two will be across the border. A co-location arrangement is expected to be adopted for immigration and customs facilities on the Shenzhen side.
  <br>
  <br>
  While some lawmakers called for both of the stations in Shenzhen to have checkpoints, the transport chief said officials are still hammering out details of the arrangement with mainland counterparts.

    Kai Tak operators 'inexperienced in serving big crowd'

<img alt="Allan Zeman believes operators will learn a lesson from the Sevens, after some fans complained about not being able to get food at the venue. File Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798224_1_20250331112814.jpg&q=35">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Kai Tak Sports Park will "learn a good lesson" from hosting the Hong Kong Sevens and be better prepared in the future following complaints by fans over their inability to get food at the venue, a business tycoon said on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Some rugby fans had complained over the dearth of food at Kai Tak Stadium, where the three-day tournament was held, after the government had told operators to enhance their food supply services.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They're inexperienced at handling a crowd that big and I think they will learn a good lesson," said Lan Kwai Fong Group chairman Allan Zeman on RTHK's Backchat programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was the first time they were slammed over three days with that many people, and not expecting how much food they could sell, how much drinks they could sell... They probably would stock up in the future."
  <br>
  <br>
  The tournament has welcomed more than 110,000 visitors in total.
  <br>
  <br>
  The figure fell short of Hong Kong China Rugby's 139,000 expectation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lawmaker Vincent Cheng, who is also the vice chairman of the Major Sports Events Committee, told another RTHK radio show that this might be due to the event being held in the Hong Kong Stadium for decades.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think that's because the Kai Tak venue is much bigger than Hong Kong Stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  "My understanding is that 90 percent of the tickets were taken up but there's still room for more ticket sales," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I believe the event will now have made its reputation and I hope there will be more visitors in the future."
  <br>
  <br>
  Cheng, who was among those attending the Sevens, said the atmosphere was very good and that overall operations had been very smooth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kowloon City district councillor Cheung King-fan said there were some complaints by Kai Tak residents about noise coming from the fans' village located on the east side of the stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I have reflected the issue to the organiser, park operator and the Environmental Protection Department," he added.

<div class="itemFullText">
 An SAR government rescue team is on its way to quake-hit Mandalay in Myanmar.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 51-strong team, including firefighters, doctors and nurses, had earlier arrived in the country's capital, Naypyidaw.
  <br>
  <br>
  There, they rested briefly at the Myanmar National Centre for Disease Control and met diplomats from the Chinese embassy.
  <br>
  <br>
  While they originally planned to work in Naypyidaw, Myanmar officials asked them to go to Mandalay instead – which is near the epicentre of the 7.7-magnitude quake on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The rescue squad departed overnight but had to pause their journey due to a night curfew on the roads, according to a Facebook post by the Security Bureau on Monday.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The board of Hong Kong conglomerate CK Hutchison said on Monday it has not made any decision on its global telecommunications business, in response to media reports about a potential spin-off listing of the assets.
 <br>
  <br>
  "From time to time, the Group receives proposals and explores and evaluates opportunities that may be available, with a view to enhancing long term value to shareholders, including possible transactions relating to the assets and operations of the company's global telecommunication businesses," the board said in a stock exchange filing.
  <br>
  <br>
  A spin-off listing would be among those options, according to the filing.
  <br>
  <br>
  The board said no decision has been made about any transaction and there is no certainty a transaction will take place.
  <br>
  <br>
  Reuters reported on Friday, citing sources, the company is mulling a spin-off of global telecom assets and would list the business on the London stock exchange. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A fireworks display capped off a three-day rugby extravaganza at the Kai Tak Stadium on Sunday, bringing an end to the Hong Kong Sevens at its new home.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chief Executive John Lee, who was there with his wife, said he had a great time with tens of thousands of fans.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The first major tournament at the Kai Tak Stadium has successfully 'scored a try'," Lee wrote on social media.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Next, let's wait for more exciting sports and cultural activities to take place, giving full play to the venue's enchantment, while looking forward to future mega events one after the other."
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 38,000 spectators were on hand for the third and final day of the Sevens, according to organisers, with total attendance topping 110,000 visits over three days.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Transport Department said overall traffic conditions were mostly smooth after the event drew to a close.
  <br>
  <br>
  Spectators were advised to take the MTR by going to either Kai Tak or Sung Wong Toi station.
  <br>
  <br>
  There were also special bus routes, as well as a number of taxis to pick up passengers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, some fans complained on Sunday that they could not get food, with some stalls and vendors said to have run out of supply.
  <br>
  <br>
  During a tour of the venue in the afternoon, culture, sports and tourism minister Rosanna Law said she had told operators to enhance their food supply services.
  <br>
  <br>
  She also said the atmosphere and operations at the venue were very good in general.

 An SAR government rescue team is set to begin inspection work on the ground in earthquake-stricken Myanmar as they arrived in the country's capital Naypyidaw.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 51-member team, led by deputy chief fire officer Cheu Yu-kok, were greeted by diplomats from the Chinese Embassy in Myanmar.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a video posted on the Security Bureau's Facebook page, Cheu said his squad will work with other rescue teams to assess the situation and make further action plans.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chief Executive John Lee said earlier the SAR government has earmarked HK$30 million from the Disaster Relief Fund to help victims of the tremor.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, a number of international rescue organisations called for support for the quake victims.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kyi Minn, national director of World Vision International Myanmar, talked about the devastation in a video message on Facebook.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was quite a prolonged quake compared to the previous one, like nearly four to five minutes is shaking. So staff were quite nervous and could not contact anyone because all the phone lines were cut off," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also expressed concerns about the safety of children, particularly those separated from their parents.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong Red Cross, for its part, said it has allocated HK$200,000 in relief support.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The head of the Hong Kong, China Rugby Association, James Farndon, on Sunday hailed the first-ever Sevens at the Kai Tak Stadium, calling the event a massive success for the SAR.
 <br>
  <br>
  Farndon stressed the importance of the upgraded fan experience at the new venue, following nearly half a century at the Hong Kong Stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's been an amazing experience for all involved," Farndon told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The main point I'd make is what the experience is like for the fans -- and from what I see, it's obviously a bigger house, bigger party. The fan experience has been fantastic."
  <br>
  <br>
  He also spoke about the popularity of the stadium's South Stand.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The South Stand's been rocking, and the entertainment has been fantastic too," he added. "If you look at the other aspects of the stadium we've been able to add in... it's just a lot more for the fans to experience, and I think they really enjoyed it."
  <br>
  <br>
  Farndon also highlighted the work to bring the showpiece tournament to Kai Tak, having gone through multiple stress tests in the run-up to the three-day sporting event.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's been a real journey for us, but a real positive one," Farndon explained. "We've had test events at various stages, which have been able to give experience to our event operations team -- to learn the back of house and how [the Sevens] is going to work for the players, coaches and the international teams coming in."
  <br>
  <br>
  Brett Robinson, the chairman of World Rugby, also spoke highly about new Kai Tak experience.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For those of us who had the chance to be around [the stadium], and also from an athlete's perspective, it's purpose-built for the game of Sevens," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You've got women that are singing songs, and athletes that are just really enjoying the experience and really feeling quite valued."

 Culture, sports and tourism minister Rosanna Law said operators of Kai Tak Sports Park made improvements every day during the three-day Rugby Sevens tournament.

  "I also had to wait in line for some time when buying a hamburger yesterday, so I told the venue operators to enhance their food supply services. The operators increased their supplies today, and I know that more staff were arranged to help out at vendors at the arena and youth sports ground," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Law added that more improvements can be made in terms of the variety of food available, and whether to allow more taxis there to help disperse visitors.
  <br>
  <br>
  She also called on fans to make use of the MTR and buses to leave the venue when the Sevens draw to a close.

 A Cathay Pacific aircraft on Sunday flew near Kai Tak during the Hong Kong Sevens, an area where the city's former international airport began operations 100 years ago.
 <br>
  <br>
  The A350 operated by the flagship carrier took off for its tour over Hong Kong at around 4pm, flying over Victoria Harbour and passing the old Kai Tak Airport runway.
  <br>
  <br>
  The aircraft flew at an altitude of as low as 1,100ft.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some at the Kai Tak Stadium were able to see the plane through giant windows near the South Stand, while others viewed the flyover on a big screen.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stuart Morton, who's lived in Hong Kong for decades, said he felt nostalgic when he saw the plane.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I first came here in 1985 with the military. I landed at Kai Tak," he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It brings back memories of coming in over [Checkerboard Hill], turning around and then coming and landing at Kai Tak."
  <br>
  <br>
  Visitor Mavi Mbochay said the flyover served as a reminder of what the stadium used to be.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It just symbolises the history. It's important to connect the past and the future," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The flyover marked the centennial of the old airport.

 Rugby lovers from Hong Kong and beyond filled up the Kai Tak Stadium on Sunday to enjoy a final day of sport and partying at the Hong Kong Sevens.
 <br>
  <br>
  Now in its new home, the annual rugby showcase isn't just about the action on the pitch. The food and drinks, the raucous atmosphere and the people are also what attracted fans to the stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brian Hopkins, who supports Great Britain, said the Sevens is the perfect occasion to celebrate his 40th birthday.
  <br>

   "There's no better place to do it. It's a great atmosphere, great rugby, great stadium as well," he told RTHK. "We tried the food, we tried plenty of drinks... It's going to be a keg of Guinness against my name."
   <br>
   <br>
   For Donna Hopkins, the stadium was friendly to wheelchair users.
   <br>
   <br>
   "Down and around here, I could get to the food, the toilets were really accessible. I could see the pitch really well," she said.
   <br>
   <br>

    Brett Muntz, who grew up in Fiji and now lives in New Zealand, stuck to his roots and supports the Flying Fijians.
    <br>
    <br>
    "It's all about the people, connecting and enjoying a magnificent occasion and this magnificent venue," he said. "Everyone seems to come for the right reason - have a good time, meet people, enjoy, and leave the results on the field and celebrate together."

     Epeli Buliciri, also a Fiji fan, was adding this year's Hong Kong Sevens to his impressive resume.
     <br>
     <br>
     "This is my 122nd tournament. It's my 17th Hong Kong Sevens tournament," he said.
     <br>
     <br>
     "Hong Kong is always special for Fiji. Even sometimes when life gets down and all that, you can always rely on the Hong Kong Sevens and the Fiji team to get you back up there."
     <br>
     <br>
     His hat with a glistening pin collection was not the only one competing for attention at the stadium.

      "The dedication we've put in is really great, because we have to put paint on us. I think we have the best costume," said one of them.

       Others drew inspiration from Freddy, an animated weatherman on local TV.
       <br>
       <br>
       The group said they planned for their costume one month or two ago, and chose one relating to rainy conditions.

    'Hutchison deal won't stop family offices coming here'

<img alt="Christopher Hui says the SAR is an attractive destination for capital and family offices. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798116_1_20250330155453.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The controversy over CK Hutchison's plans to sell dozens of ports won't affect family offices' interest in investing in Hong Kong, financial services minister Christopher Hui said on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a TV programme, Hui said those attending the Wealth for Good in Hong Kong Summit last week did not raise concerns about the deal.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said 160 family offices from around the world indicated they will or are planning to set up shop in Hong Kong, of which a quarter are from Europe and the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So as you can see, I think there has been absolutely no impact. We continue to be an ideal destination for attracting capital and especially for family offices and other institutions to establish themselves here."
  <br>
  <br>
  Hui also said the government is planning to amend legislation to expand tax concessions for family office investments, covering loans, virtual assets and carbon credits.
  <br>
  <br>
  He expressed confidence that the number of family offices in Hong Kong would increase from 2,700 to over 3,000 in the short term.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sources said the US$23 billion port deal between CK Hutchison and a consortium led by American investment firm BlackRock, which includes strategic assets along the Panama Canal, won't be signed as expected this week.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing officials in charge of SAR affairs have reposted a number of commentaries at the Ta Kung Pao newspaper, criticising the proposed sale.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the latest piece reposted by the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office on Sunday, political and business leaders were quoted as saying that the impact of the proposed deal extends beyond commerce to national security.
  <br>
  <br>
  The article said various sectors in Hong Kong support the move by the State Administration for Market Regulation to examine the deal, adding it is critical for safeguarding fair competition and national interests.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also urged CK Hutchison to reconsider the deal, quoting a number of Hong Kong lawmakers as saying it's naive to view it as a business matter only, given the complex international environment.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan said "Super March" has attracted more than 3.4 million visitors to Hong Kong, a 12 percent increase from a year ago.
 <br>
  <br>
  As of Friday, non-mainland arrivals this month reached 960,000, accounting for almost 30 percent of the total.
  <br>
  <br>
  Writing on his weekly blog, Chan also said hotel occupancy at popular areas was near 90 percent, while the retail sector also said the increased foot traffic helped their business.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong has hosted more than 10 major events this month, including snooker's World Grand Prix, the Rugby Sevens and the Art Basel art fair.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan wrote on his blog that when he spoke to visitors and exhibitors at the Art Basel, he expressed hope that more people will do business in Hong Kong apart from enjoying art.
  <br>
  <br>
  The financial secretary also said the new Kai Tak Sports Arena has provided a larger venue and finer facilities for events such as the Rugby Sevens.
  <br>
  <br>
  Attendance at the Sevens is expected to top 140,000 from Friday to Sunday, and all hospitality boxes have been sold out.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Many business representatives attending financial events in Hong Kong this week told me that they look forward to watching matches and participating in other cultural events to experience the vibrancy of the city, in addition to having business meetings," he wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan also said the administration will continue to promote its mega-events economy to attract more high-end business travellers to the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that the government will encourage and support businesses to develop more special products and services, to make Hong Kong a prosperous and enjoyable place.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police Commissioner Raymond Siu on Sunday said the force's efforts to raise its image among young people were bearing fruit.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a Commercial Radio programme, Siu said the police have been spreading the message that the force is acting for the benefit of young people.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We asked a university to conduct public opinion research last year and the results are encouraging. It surveyed young people aged 18 to 29 on their views towards the police force and the force's ratings have increased by almost 38 percent. This shows that our efforts over the past few years have not been wasted," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said that the force had faced unprecedented challenges during the 2019 social unrest but that officers had remained united while under great pressure.
  <br>
  <br>
  Siu also said frontline staff had contributed greatly to the city moving from chaos to order.
  <br>
  <br>
  Siu will step down from his post on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I hope the force will continue to work hard and tell citizens clearly what kind of a team we are. I think the Hong Kong Police Force is the most efficient, empathetic and passionate in the world when it comes to police work," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Siu said he would miss working for the force.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee says the SAR government has earmarked HK$30 million from the Disaster Relief Fund to help victims of the severe earthquake that struck central Myanmar on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a Facebook post on Saturday evening, Lee said the government was in close contact with rescue groups to provide swift relief assistance to affected communities.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Disaster Relief Fund Advisory Committee will promptly process related funding applications from organisations," he wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CE added that officials are coordinating with Myanmar's Consul-General in Hong Kong to collect and deliver necessary relief supplies.
  <br>
  <br>
  A 51-member SAR rescue team, including personnel from various departments and two search dogs, arrived in Yangon on Sunday morning.
  <br>
  <br>
  The team, carrying nine tonnes of relief supplies, will drive for 10 hours to the affected area.
  <br>
  <br>
  The number of dead in Myanmar and Thailand stood at nearly 1,700, while thousands were hurt.
  <br>
  <br>
  About 200 people were unaccounted for in both countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among those injured were 13 Chinese nationals in Myanmar, according to the Chinese Embassy in Myanmar.
  <br>
  <br>
  The embassy also said as of Sunday morning, it had received and handled hundreds of requests for help from Chinese citizens and assisted dozens of people in finding their missing relatives and friends.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, rescuers from Myanmar and Yunnan province joined hands in plucking to safety an elderly man who had been trapped for nearly 40 hours under the rubble in the capital, Naypyitaw.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was the first survivor rescued by the 37-member Chinese team that arrived at the quake-hit area on Saturday. (Additional reporting by Xinhua)

 Fans soaked up the raucous atmosphere at the new Kai Tak Stadium where the Hong Kong Sevens are being held for the first time.
 <br>
  <br>
  Applause and cheers filled the air as day two of the tournament got underway, with many fans praising the party-like mood at the new stadium.
  <br>

   <br>
   One Australian spectator, Dan – who has been to many previous editions of the Sevens in Causeway Bay's Hong Kong Stadium – said he really likes the new venue.
   <br>
   <br>
   "It feels like the old stadium's atmosphere, just in a much more upgraded arena. It's a great new stadium."
   <br>
   <br>
   He said that besides Australia, he has thrown his support behind the Hong Kong, China squad in the Melrose Claymores competition – after both the men's and women's sides won big in both their respective matches earlier in the day.
   <br>
   <br>
   "[The SAR squad] is always my next best team," he said. "The atmosphere when they play is amazing. I can't wait to see the stadium packed out, it's gonna be a great time."
   <br>
   <img src="https://rthk-s3-nps-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/mfile_1798035_4_L_20250329183213.jpg">
    <div class="image-title-1">

    </div>
    <br>
    Another fan, from the United Kingdom, shared similar views on the new arena.
    <br>
    <br>
    "I think it's absolutely fantastic," he told RTHK. "Not only is [the stadium] bigger, you've got all those fancy light shows and the tech and everything. All the amenities and everything is so much better – absolutely amazing atmosphere."
    <br>
    <br>
    The stadium's South Stand – where many fans are known to gather in large numbers at the Sevens each year – reached maximum capacity just after 1pm.
    <br>

     <br>
     "It's a great vibe here," another Australia fan, named Justin, said.
     <br>
     <br>
     "There's space, you can walk around and meet all your friends and your mates. It's unreal."
     <br>
     <br>
     Meanwhile, rugby players said the roar of the crowd was electrifying.
     <br>
     <br>
     "We were so excited to be on the pitch. The crowds were very enthusiastic, cheering us on." Jiang Yutong, who plays for the national women's squad, told RTHK.
     <br>
     <br>
     "It feels so good."

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police Commissioner Raymond Siu revealed on Saturday that the force has arrested 157 people in relation to the space oil drug.
 <br>
  <br>
  He pointed out that 37 of the arrestees were aged below 21, and 16 of them were students.
  <br>
  <br>
  The figure was recorded between February 14 – when etomidate, the drug's main ingredient was classified as a dangerous drug – and Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Siu told reporters that police have stepped up enforcement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Apart from stepping up street patrols, we also have a lot of intelligence-led operations," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Among the 120 cases, the arrests for 70 of the cases were carried out on the streets, and another 50 were made in non-public places."
  <br>
  <br>
  He emphasised that all stakeholders, including school principals and teachers, as well as social workers, play a crucial role in tackling the space oil drug issue.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Constitutional and Mainland Affairs Erick Tsang said on Saturday the government will step up its promotion on national security education next month, to achieve patriotism everywhere.
 <br>
  <br>
  His remarks came as the SAR prepares to mark National Security Education Day on April 15.
  <br>
  <br>
  In an interview with a local newspaper, Tsang pointed out that the Constitutional and Mainland Affairs Bureau will coordinate with relevant departments to promote national security at various levels.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister pointed out that since the Working Group on Patriotic Education was set up last year, it has strengthened national history and culture, as well as national affairs education on different fronts to widely promote the spirit of patriotism.
  <br>
  <br>
  Looking ahead, the group will adopt short-, medium- and long-term goals and measures, Tsang said, adding that his bureau will continue to attach great importance and enhance national security education.

<img alt="Members of the Fire Services Department, along with the Security Bureau and the Hospital Authority are part of the SAR's 51-strong rescue team.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Saturday said Hong Kong will send a search and rescue team to Myanmar, after a magnitude 7.7 earthquake struck the country.
 <br>
  <br>
  The massive quake which struck central Myanmar on Friday, also affected neighbouring Thailand, with the death toll passing 1,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee, along with Secretary for Security Chris Tang sent the rescue team off at the airport in the afternoon.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CE said the team is made up of professionals from multiple departments.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This rescue team has 51 members, including the team leader, who is a deputy chief fire officer. Other members come from the Security Bureau, the Fire Services and Immigration Departments and the Hospital Authority. There are also two doctors and two nurses,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier in a Facebook post, the CE expressed condolences to the victims on behalf of all Hongkongers and the government.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tang, for his part, said the rescue team would first fly to Yangon and then make a ten-hour drive to reach central Myanmar.
  <br>
  <br>
  “After arriving, the team will get in touch with the local commander in charge of the rescue operation. Then they will assess to situation and determine which areas and aspects of work the team can help with,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tang added the administration has so far received enquiries from 55 Hongkongers as of 5pm, but none of them required assistance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, a Hongkonger currently in Bangkok, which was also hit by the devastating earthquake on Friday, said he would not cancel his travel plans.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mr Siu said he was shopping with his wife when he felt the tremor, and the shaking had made people around panic and rush outside for safety.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It has been a day since the earthquake, and there haven't been many aftershocks. Unless something significant happens, I don't plan to change my itinerary,” he told RTHK on Saturday morning.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another tourist who flew to Hong Kong from Bangkok on Saturday morning said that normalcy was being restored in the Thai capital after the quake.
  <br>
  <br>
  “[Transport] is back. Everything is fine today, It’s better than yesterday. But I am still sad about the earthquake. I was working on the 25th floor. I felt the earthquake, [I was] so shocked,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Immigration Department said it would continue to monitor the situation and work with Chinese Embassies in Thailand and Myanmar.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, local travel agency, WWPKG, said it will cancel all tour groups to Thailand in April. It said about 150 affected customers can either choose to switch to a different tour or receive a full refund.

    Some people need to seek alternatives to A&amp;E, Lo says

<img alt="Health chief Lo Chung-mau hopes the public can turn to other choices than A&E when the new fees take effect next year. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797998_1_20250329122451.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Secretary for Health Lo Chung-mau says he hopes some people can find alternatives to accident and emergency wards at public hospitals at all times when new fees take effect.
 <br>
  <br>
  From next year, non-critical and non-emergency patients - or those who are classified as category three to five patients - will have to pay HK$400 when they visit A&E, up from the current flat rate of HK$180.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities hope higher fees for non-critical and non-emergency patients will deter them, so urgent cases can receive prompt care.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lo said some patients abused A&E services, such as heading there to get a sick leave certificate.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Apart from the low charges, A&E are open 24 hours a day, 365 days a-year. It's very convenient, and people don't need to make a booking in advance. You only need to go straight to the wards, which is very convenient. This is necessary for those who are critically ill or need resuscitation," he told a Commercial Radio show.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I said a small group of people abused the system, but some people really misused it... I believe the public need to change this mindset."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lo pointed out that if A&E doctors - who were specially trained to save critically ill patients - had to take care of patients with mild illnesses, that would be a waste of resources.
  <br>
  <br>
  Patients with minor problems should head to their family doctors instead, the health chief said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lo also told an RTHK radio programme that almost half of the semi- and non-urgent - or category four and five patients - showed up at A&E between 8am and 4pm.
  <br>
  <br>
  During this period, there are definitely other choices than A&E, he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lo emphasised that the revamp was not aimed at helping the government tackle its budget deficit.
  <br>
  <br>
  We are only aiming to better safeguard patients and reduce wastage, he added.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Both the men’s and women’s squads for the SAR on Saturday kept their winning streak alive on day two of the Hong Kong Sevens, which also saw an end to New Zealand's campaign to win a third-straight title.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong China men’s squad beat Japan 43-21 in the Melrose Claymores competition.
  <br>
  <br>
  The team’s captain, James Christie – who came up big in the second half – said team effort played a big role in their victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  “You know it’s all about scoring tries and we all got people who could finish them off, you know, but it’s nice to come on on the end of a nice team try, and that’s what makes us good,” Christie told RTHK after the match.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also described the atmosphere at the new stadium, which has a retractable roof, as “crazy”.
  <br>
  <br>
  “With the roof open, it’s still as loud, so it’s pretty crazy, especially some of [the people] at the South Stand [who have been here] since 8am I think…Thank you all for coming out, means the world to us.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier, the SAR women’s squad easily saw off their Thai opponents 47-0, with the crowd “absolutely pumping from start to finish," Pete Laverick, RTHK's sports correspondent who watched the match at Kai Tak Stadium, said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both squads have secured a spot in the Melrose tournament’s finals which will be held on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the main Sevens tournament, there has been a major upset in the men's Cup quarterfinals, where France beat defending champions New Zealand by 21-14, denying the Kiwis' attempt to win a third consecutive title in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  France – who had trailed New Zealand by 14 points before coming from behind to take the win – will now take on Fiji, with Australia facing Argentina in the semifinals on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  And on the women's side, it will be Canada versus New Zealand, while Australia take on France in Sunday's semifinals.

<img alt="The administration has introduced a countdown period to penalise landlords who enter new tenancy contracts for units that haven’t been certified.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Housing Winnie Ho on Saturday said she hoped landlords of subdivided flats would take action to upgrade them, even though they now had a longer grace period to comply with new criteria.
 <br>
  <br>
  Under the Housing Bureau's latest proposal for a regulatory framework to manage the city’s subdivided units, landlords will be given a 36-month grace period to make necessary improvements so they can be certified as Basic Housing Units.
  <br>
  <br>
  The grace period was previously proposed as 12 - or up to 24 months - after a 12-month registration period.
  <br>
  <br>
  The administration has also introduced a countdown period, starting six months before the end of the grace period.
  <br>
  <br>
  During the countdown period, landlords who enter new tenancy contracts for units that haven’t been certified may face a maximum fine of HK$300,000 and be jailed for up to three years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho told a Commercial Radio programme that she hoped landlords wouldn't leave their renovations until the last minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Just like when we were in university and the lecturer gave us two extra weeks to finish our coursework, some students would just go watch a movie, thinking they had plenty of time. We want to avoid that with landlords. Even though the grace period is extended, we need to introduce some kind of enforcement to ensure they stay on track and don’t get too relaxed,” said Ho.
  <br>
  <br>
  Landlords also have to hire a certified professional to assess their units in order to obtain the Basic Housing Unit recognition, which will be valid for five years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho noted that the list of certified professionals has been expanded to include some 8,000 engineers, which now also feature specialists under the disciplines of fire and building services.
  <br>
  <br>
  A fee is payable to the government for the certification process and the housing minister said the charge would be around a few thousand dollars, although the exact amount has yet to be finalised.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government’s revised Basic Housing Units legislation will be discussed in Legco's housing panel on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the first group of 50 light public housing tenants moved into their flats in Yuen Long on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho said about 50 to 100 tenants would move in every day and the plan is to get all 2,156 tenants for the Yau Pok Road project to move in by the end of May.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development Algernon Yau on Friday said the SAR government is taking forward a series of initiatives to protect intellectual property rights to help develop the city into a regional IP trading centre.
 <br>
  <br>
  He was speaking after visiting a company in Beijing that had developed toys with proprietary intellectual property that had found success in both domestic and overseas markets.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yau noted that the effective protection and efficient transaction of IP is crucial to promoting the development of cultural and creative industries as well as technological innovation.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister also met with representatives of the China Alcoholic Drinks Association to promote opportunities for wine merchants in Hong Kong following the deduction in liquor duty announced in last October’s Policy Address, which had resulted in increases in both the quantity and value of liquor imported into the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yau said Hong Kong could serve as a key hub for trading and distribution of high-end liquor, including Chinese baijiu, and Mainland wine merchants are encouraged to use Hong Kong as a platform for Chinese baijiu to go global.

    CK Hutchison ports deal 'won't be signed next week'

<img alt="A source with close links to CK Hutchison suggests that the conglomerate will not sign a deal for the sale of its ports next week.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A controversial ports deal between CK Hutchison and a consortium led by US investment firm BlackRock won’t be signed as expected next week – according to a source with close links to the Hong Kong conglomerate.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong-based firm owned by tycoon Li Ka-shing announced earlier this month that it had entered into a in-principle agreement to sell 45 ports from 23 countries – including two ports near the Panama Canal – in a US$23 billion deal.
  <br>
  <br>
  A filing to the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing stated that the negotiations would last 145 days, with reports suggesting both sides were planning to sign "definitive documents" on April 2.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the source on Friday revealed that the signing will not happen next week, saying, “Everyone knows why.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the State Administration for Market Regulation's anti-monopoly branch told the Ta Kung Wen Wei Media Group that it will conduct a review of the deal in accordance with the law to protect fair competition and safeguard the public interest.
  <br>
  <br>
  A local deputy to the National People’s Congress and chairman of the Federation of Trade Unions, Stanley Ng, said anything irregular that’s discovered in the review should be halted immediately.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ng further stressed that influential businessmen here must have a sense of national security and consider matters from the perspective of the nation.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office and the central government’s liaison office here have both repeatedly reposted articles from Ta Kung Pao criticising the deal.

<div class="itemFullText">
 There were winning starts for the Hong Kong, China men's and women's squads on Friday as the Rugby Sevens got underway to much fanfare at the Kai Tak Sports Park.
 <br>
  <br>
  The SAR men's representatives - who are looking to defend their Melrose Claymores title - cruised to a 31-7 victory over the national team.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[We're] feeling pretty good, we went down early there, so we [had] good composure, good fightback to score some good tries out there," men's captain James Christie told RTHK after the win, who also credited the support of home fans at the stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You have to be here to witness it. It's nothing like I've seen before. Obviously [the fans are] the eighth man on the pitch, so it really helps us, inspires us."
  <br>
  <br>
  They will look to keep their winning momentum going when they take on Japan on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The women's side, meanwhile, held on for a 29-14 win over Kazakhstan in the opener. They will next face Thailand.
  <br>
  <br>
  Co-captain Chloe Chan was confident that the squad can clinch the top prize, having finished as runners-up last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We trained hard in and out every day," Chan said. "Once we're on there, it's all the same stuff – if we all do our job well, then we'll be okay."
  <br>
  <br>
  The two matches were separated by an official opening ceremony featuring a dragon and lion dance, a performance by cheerleaders of South Korean baseball team Kia Tigers, and a laser show on the pitch.
  <br>
  <br>
  Irish rugby legend Brian O'Driscoll and former Hong Kong winger Salom Yiu also made an appearance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Outside the Melrose Claymores, 12 teams in the men's - and another 12 for the women's - fought to reach the knockout round.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both the New Zealand men's and women's are aiming to defend their Hong Kong Sevens titles for a third successive year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The women's squad, who are 12-time champions in the SAR, began the day with a 45-0 demolition of the national team.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was a really good game, and I thought we played pretty well," captain Sarah Hirini said after the match.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[We] did some pretty cool things out there, and obviously very stoked to get a win like that against China who are a very quality team."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Kiwis men's, meanwhile, also took care of business by beating Australia 21-12 in the opener.
  <br>
  <br>
  Argentina, which fielded only a men's team, are also emerging as favourites. They were dominant on Friday, with big wins over Ireland and the United States.

<img alt="Cathay Pacific says other flights operated by the airline to and from Bangkok are expected to experience delays. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797916_1_20250328190210.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A Cathay Pacific flight to Bangkok was forced to return to Hong Kong after take-off on Friday after a deadly earthquake that hit Thailand and Myanmar.
 <br>
  <br>
  The powerful tremor left at least several people dead and dozens wounded in the two Southeast Asian countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to flight tracking websites, CX751 took off at Hong Kong International Airport just after 3pm, and was near Hainan island when it made a u-turn. It landed at Chek Lap Kok just before 5pm.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Airport Authority's website suggested the flight will set off again at 8.15pm on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Other Cathay Pacific flights to and from Bangkok today (Friday) are expected to experience delays," the SAR flag carrier said. "We are assessing the situation and will keep our customers informed with the latest updates."
  <br>
  <br>
  Another Bangkok-bound Cathay flight CX630 also returned to Singapore after take-off.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other flights on Friday between the SAR and Thailand were unaffected, according to the Airport Authority.
  <br>
  <br>
  Greater Bay Airlines said in a statement that services remain normal, while offering to change flights for passengers who have booked trips to and from Bangkok between Friday and Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another local carrier, Hong Kong Airlines, cautioned that its flights to and from Bangkok "may be affected" due to the earthquake, advising passengers to check the latest information before heading to the airport.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong Airlines will waive all charges on rebooking, reissue and refund for all tickets issued for travel on Hong Kong Airlines flights with confirmed booking," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, the Travel Industry Council said there are around six Hong Kong tour groups in Thailand, consisting less than 100 people. All of them are safe, the council confirmed.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Rugby fans from around the world showered praise on the brand new stadium in Kai Tak as this year's Hong Kong Sevens got underway on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  After decades at the Hong Kong Stadium in Causeway Bay, the three-day tournament has moved to Kai Tak Stadium, which can accommodate a larger crowd.
  <br>
  <br>
  People in the South Stand told RTHK that the new stadium modernises the tournament with new facilities and a large variety of food and drinks, all while preserving the event's rich traditions, including vibrant costumes, lively music and a passionate crowd.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zwelethu Kala from South Africa said he loves the new venue and that the fans have brought the same energy from the old stadium to Kai Tak Sporks Park.
  <br>
  <br>
  "What a beautiful stadium, wow! Biggest thing is, one, it now has a roof so it can close, get full-running rugby. And two, outside, the village, wow," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You also have a DJ outside, nice space for the kids to play in as well. It's just awesome. It's looking really, really good."
  <br>
  <br>
  Alexane, who travelled from Belgium with friends for her second Sevens, said Hong Kong is the ultimate destination for international rugby.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong is the main place. It's so interesting. It's the main city to go for rugby. I don't know anything about rugby, but Hong Kong is like the best place," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[The stadium is filled with] amazing colours. I really like the colours and everything is so practical. Honestly, there's so much room for tourists, and it's really nice."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Larger crowds. More cosy because we have aircon. I would like them to open [the roof], so the atmosphere would be better," said local fan Damon Wong, who was sporting a headpiece from the Japanese manga Chiikawa.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another fan from the SAR, Matt Grange, highlighted the improved amenities, praising the stadium's additional toilets and impressive food and drink outlets, including one of Asia's longest bars.

<div class="itemFullText">
 There is relief for MTR passengers after the fare adjustment formula – which takes into account factors such as inflation and median household income – showed that fares would freeze for the coming year.
 <br>
  <br>
  Under its operating agreement with the government, the MTR Corporation (MTRC) is entitled to an annual fare review using figures published by the Census and Statistics Department.
  <br>
  <br>
  Based on the department's latest figures on Friday, transportation sector wages rose 3.1 percent year on year, while inflation stood at 1.4 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The mean value of 2.25 percent is then curtailed by a so-called "productivity factor" linked to the MTRC’s profit from property development. The more it earns in a particular year, the higher the productivity factor.
  <br>
  <br>
  This year the productivity factor amounted to a deduction of 0.8 percent, bringing the increase down from 2.25 percent to 1.45 percent, below the threshold of 1.5 percent required to trigger an actual adjustment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Even if it exceeds the threshold, there is still another "affordability cap" where the actual fare adjustment cannot be higher than the change in median monthly household income, which recorded a slight drop last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  As a result of these constraints, fares will be frozen for the first time since 2022-23.
  <br>
  <br>
  The intended 1.45 percent increase, together with another 1.91 percent rise supposedly brought forward from last year, will both be rolled over to 2026-27, which means commuters could face a steep hike next year.

 The Hong Kong Sevens tournament kicked off with a bang at Kai Tak Stadium on Friday, as the Canadian and Japanese women's squads faced off.
 <br>
  <br>
  More than 1,000 spectators watched the inaugural Hong Kong Sevens match played at the new venue at 10:30am.

   <br>
   A Canadian fan said she was excited to watch the tournament in Kai Tak and that it was easy getting to the stadium.
   <br>
   <br>
   Another rugby fan also said it is now comfortable to watch the matches because there is air conditioning.

    Kai Tak Sports Park director of strategic planning, Tang King-shing, meanwhile, said the spectator flow was smooth with frequent MTR train services.

    ICAC chief lays down law on calls for invalid votes

<img alt="Danny Woo says the ICAC has started using an AI system to improve work efficiency. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797856_2_20250328151239.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The city's top graft-buster, Danny Woo, on Friday warned that authorities will take tough action against those who call for invalid votes to be cast during the upcoming election for the city's legislature at the end of the year.
 <br>
  <br>
  His remarks came after Chief Executive John Lee last week announced that the general election for the Legislative Council will be held on December 7, with a by-election to be held on September 7.
  <br>
  <br>
  In an interview with local media, Woo, who heads the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC), reminded the public that disrupting the electoral process is a legal offence.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Never ever try to challenge the law because it's clearly written that it's an offence for any person to incite others not to vote or to cast invalid votes through any public activities during the election period," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And also do not share or repost these remarks as there is a chance of breaking the law as well."
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, Woo noted that the number of complaints reported to the ICAC rose to 2,058 last year, three percent higher.
  <br>
  <br>
  Forty-four of the cases were made against the Hong Kong Correctional Services, and that was more than double that of a year earlier.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, Woo pointed out, only a small number of the cases reached the prosecution phase.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ICAC, he said, is seeking to use artificial intelligence to improve work efficiency and has launched an AI system, Dr Deep, based on mainland firm DeepSeek's AI models, to help combat corruption.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I want to emphasise that many of our own systems are developed by ourselves because many of them contain confidential and sensitive information," Woo said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So our computer systems are studied and maintained in-house and not operated on by outsiders.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This means our development of AI is also done by ourselves.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Since DeepSeek unveiled its large AI models, it's been a real eye-opener," Woo said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He hinted that the Dr Deep system could be available for public use in the future and that residents could search for corruption-related information on the system.

 Public transport operators are boosting services to accommodate the large crowds of passengers expected during the Hong Kong Sevens tournament.
 <br>
  <br>
  The three-day event at the new Kai Tak Stadium started on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The MTR said it was increasing the frequency of trains on the Tuen Ma Line and deploying more staff than usual at Kai Tak and Sung Wong Toi stations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Citybus and KMB, meanwhile, said 11 special routes would be in operation at the end of each day of the tournament.

    'Use AI chatbots in triage system to avoid mistakes'

<img alt="A patients' rights group has proposed the use of AI chatbots in triage system at public hospitals to help patients gain a better understanding of their conditions. File Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797824_1_20250328114303.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A patients' rights group says it hopes the government can use AI chatbots in its triage system at public hospitals to help patients gain a better understanding of their conditions and symptoms.
 <br>
  <br>
  “I have used the UK emergency service as well,” WeCareBill Foundation co-founder Kelly Yim said in RTHK's Backchat programme on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I find it quite useful when they have the AI chatbot to do the challenging bits, like differentiating the level of emergency of a patient.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I'm just thinking maybe we can do this with nurse consultations or triages, and try with more advanced technology so that maybe this risk [of misjudgements] can be mitigated.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Some people have expressed worries about being charged more because of being categorised wrongly during triages when the revamped healthcare charges come into effect from January 1.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under the changes, "critical" and "emergency" patients being treated at  accident and emergency (A&E) wards will have their charges exempted, while fees for “urgent”, “semi-urgent” and “non-urgent” patients will be raised to HK$400 from HK$180.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government has relaxed income and asset limits to expand eligibility for medical fee waivers and said about 1.4 million people are expected to benefit from the tweaks, up from 300,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the same programme, an official from the Hospital Authority reiterated that the revamp is aimed at focusing resources on serving those in need.
  <br>
  <br>
  “With all these measures, we are trying to reserve our healthcare resources [in order to help, in particular, acute, serious and critical patients]," the authority’s chief manager in allied health,  Priscilla Poon, said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “But at the same time, we won't forget [the less well-off sections of the public].
  <br>
  <br>
  “So that's the reason why we need ... balance.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We need to impose some kind of relaxation of our waiver mechanisms and safety net in order to help ... the poor, who are not really actually supported by other, say, private services.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, a former A&E doctor also urged the government to prioritise the implementation of advanced technology to help cope with a manpower shortage.
  <br>
  <br>
  Aaron Lee, who’s now a clinical assistant professor at the University of Hong Kong, said the new fees planned for emergency wards at public hospitals could reduce the burden on staff.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he stressed that the effect may only be short-term.
  <br>
  <br>
  “This effect will tail off," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We saw it with previous increases in fees in the departments before,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “So there must be some implementation of more important measures in the departments...
  <br>
  <br>
  "There may be implementation of the AI system, not only in the A&E departments, but also maybe at the primary-care level.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee said a big burden would be lifted from the public healthcare system if patients were able to conduct some sort of tests themselves before deciding whether to seek medical attention at hospitals.

    'Kowloon City won't be congested during the Sevens'

<img alt="" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797820_1_20250328112333.jpg&q=70">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A Kowloon City district councillor believes the area will not be congested when Hong Kong Rugby Sevens tournament games end every evening.
 <br>
  <br>
  The three-day tournament that kicks off today will be staged at Kai Tak Sports Park for the first time ever, having been held at Hong Kong Stadium in Causeway Bay for decades.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on an RTHK radio programme on Friday, Vivian Wong, who also chairs a working group on boosting the local economy in the district, said previous test events at the new grounds had gone smoothly.
  <br>
  <br>
  "During the Hong Kong Sevens, spectators will be coming in and out at all times," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They won't enter or leave at the same time.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Therefore, it's kind of different than, say, the opening ceremony on March the first when they could test out what problems would arise if people left the venue all at once."
  <br>
  <br>
  Apart from visiting nearby malls and Kowloon City, Wong expects spectators will also head for the new Sevens fan village for live music, meet-and-greet opportunities with rugby teams, as well as drinks and food booths.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said the inaugural Kai Tak Dining Cove Carnival next to the Kai Tak Stadium will also be a lure for revellers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, a Kowloon City restaurant owner revealed on the same show that businesses near the stadium are already seeing a boom in business.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mark Lam pointed out that business in the area had gone up 20 percent whenever tests events were held, as well as during the stadium's opening ceremony.
  <br>
  <br>
  His eatery has been flexible with its opening hours whenever events are scheduled at the city's largest sports venue.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the past, before the pandemic, our restaurant closed at 3am," Lam said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Business was booming at that time.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But after and during the pandemic, the catering business was sluggish. We had to close by 10:30 or 11pm.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With the Kai Tak Sports Park opening, now we close around 1 o'clock in the morning, and we open at 11:30am, with no breaks during the day.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So customers can come during lunch, tea, or after shows at the venue."
  <br>
  <br>
  Pedestrian traffic in the district had surged by 20 to 30 percent during the stress tests and the opening ceremony, Lam added.

 When Hong Kong artist Movana Chen moved to Lisbon in 2021, she started knitting together maps collected during Covid isolation in an attempt to unravel physical boundaries.
 <br>
  <br>
  She transformed the maps into large pieces of garment donned by herself and her partner, dancer Francisco Borges, as part of a performance art piece at Art Basel Hong Kong.

   <br>
   The inspiration for the performance – which sees the pair cocooned in the weaved-together maps – came from Chen’s time living near the Portuguese seaside, when she experienced pandemic-induced solitude.
   <br>
   <br>
   "[The act of weaving together] the maps is like inviting people and my friends during the lockdown period. So like in 2020, people can't send me the maps during that time. Everything was closed," she said.
   <br>
   <br>
   Chen said their performance, titled "Questioning the Line", also explores the entanglement between human and nature and the roles of borders and nationality.
   <br>
   <br>
   "For us it has different layers of lines, different lines to question. For example, one of the lines is this, between human and nature. Where is that line really?" Chen's partner, Borges told RTHK.
   <br>
   <br>
   "We are born from the land, we eat the food from the land, we drink the water from the land. And when we poison the land, and we poison the water, we poison ourselves. So where is really that barrier, that clear line?" he said.
   <br>

     <span>
     </span>
    </div>
    <br>
    To show human unity and interdependence, Chen also collects expired passports and gives them new life by knitting them together in a separate project called "Beyond the Surface".
    <br>
    <br>
    She is not the only artist exploring humanity and nature at this year's Art Basel.
    <br>
    <br>
    American painter and writer Alec Egan lost his home and studio to the Los Angeles fire in January. Despite the devastation, he created five new paintings to depict LA coastal scenes in a temporary studio provided by Anat Egbi Gallery, which is showcasing his works at Art Basel.
    <br>
    <br>
    Egan's new works – which reflects both disaster and nature – pays homage to his lost work and captures the eerie beauty of ash-filled skies.
    <br>

     <br>
     "In the face of something really traumatic, he continues to focus on beauty and there is quiet solitude. So I hope that [audiences will take away] hopefulness," said the gallery's sales director Amanda McMorran.
     <br>
     <br>
     Adding another compelling voice to the fair is first-time exhibitor Shin Min from Seoul's P21 studio.
     <br>
     <img src="https://rthk-s3-nps-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/mfile_1797813_4_L_20250328104141.jpg">

      Drawing from her experience working in the service industry, her "Ew! There is hair in the food!!" exhibition highlights misogyny in Korea, and challenges the notion of never saying no to customers.
      <br>
      <br>
      "I talk about workers' hair because we are not robots. We are human and we are not machines. We have hair. We have spit," Shin said in explaining the central message of her work.
      <br>

      Art Basel, the SAR's largest international art fair, brings together more than 240 galleries from around the world this year.

<img alt='The SAR government urged the UK to "respect international law" and "immediately stop interfering in Hong Kong matters." File photo: RTHK' src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797769_1_20250328093204.jpg&q=90">

<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Thursday said it strongly disapproved of and must resolutely refute the untruthful remarks, slanders and smears against various aspects of the SAR in the UK's six-monthly report on Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  "The HKSAR Government strongly condemns and rejects the UK's attempt through a so-called six-monthly report to make misleading and irresponsible remarks about Hong Kong matters, wantonly put politics above the rule of law and attempt to interfere in Hong Kong's law-based governance by despicable political manoeuvres," a government statement said.
  <br>
  <br>
  It urged the UK to discern facts from fallacies, respect international law and basic norms governing international relations, and stop interfering in Hong Kong matters.
  <br>
  <br>
  The statement said Hong Kong enjoyed a high degree of autonomy under the 'one country, two systems' principle, pointing out that the Sino-British Joint Declaration did not authorise the UK to interfere in Hong Kong's affairs after its return to the motherland.
  <br>
  <br>
  The statement also rejected UK criticism that laws safeguarding national security in the SAR had eroded rights and freedoms.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With at least 14 pieces of laws safeguarding national security in the UK, those remarks by the UK are not only totally distorting and confounding right and wrong, but they also entirely disregard the constitutional duty and practical needs of the HKSAR to legislate, and the positive effects brought by the enactment of the relevant national security legislation on economic development and protection of human rights," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government statement highlighted Hong Kong's number one ranking in the Economic Freedom of the World 2024 Annual Report, among 165 economies. It said it was evident that international funds and investments were confident in Hong Kong's development.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government spokesman stressed that "the rule of law in Hong Kong is strong and robust, and withstands the test of time", while human rights in the city have always been guaranteed constitutionally by both the Constitution and the Basic Law.

    Work under way to boost night-time services: HA
   </title>

<img alt="" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797727_2_20250327205242.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hospital Authority (HA) has stressed that decisions on how and where to beef up public healthcare services will "depend on the actual situation", amid calls to offer more general outpatient services at night.
 <br>
  <br>
  Tony Ko, the authority's chief executive, also said on Thursday reforms to the city's public healthcare system should be looked at "in totality".
  <br>
  <br>
  At present, less than one-third of 74 government general outpatient clinics offer evening consultations, with services running until 10pm.
  <br>
  <br>
  During a Legislative Council meeting on Wednesday, health chief Lo Chung-mau was asked if authorities were planning to boost evening services so people need not seek help at accident and emergency wards.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lo responded by saying that work is being done to increase capacity.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked about offering more night-time services, Ko said that the HA is working to expand general outpatient clinic capacity.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We work closely with not only our primary healthcare colleagues to provide more sessions both during daytime, holidays, weekends as well as night time, and at the same time, we have close liaison with our private medical practitioner counterparts, encouraging them to do more sessions during holidays, during weekends, giving more general support to patients," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  With the administration facing a budget deficit, chairman Henry Fan said the HA is looking at ways to trim its expenditure. The body is set to receive some HK$100 billion in government subvention for 2025/26.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fan said the authority should focus on boosting productivity, including cutting administrative work for frontline staff, further using technology and simplifying procurement procedures.
  <br>
  <br>
  The most painless way to save money is to reduce waste, he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, public hospitals recorded a turnover rate of 5 percent for full-time doctors in the 12 months ending in January. Nearly 340 doctors left the public workforce, while some 7,200 doctors remain.
  <br>
  <br>
  There are now over 29,500 nurses, with a departure rate of 7.2 percent during the same period.

 The chairman of Polytechnic University (PolyU)'s governing council on Thursday said Hong Kong must make use of its super-connector role under One Country, Two Systems to support the nation's diplomatic efforts.
 <br>
  <br>
  At a seminar focusing on China's diplomacy in the new era, Lam Tai-fai said Western countries such as the United States are creating problems through unfair practices like sanctions and protectionism.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the other hand, Lam added, Beijing continued to promote peace and cooperation through building friendships with countries. He said one of PolyU's missions is to nurture patriotic students with a global perspective.
  <br>
  <br>
  Also at the seminar was Huo Yuzhen, former Chinese ambassador to the Czech Republic and Romania.
  <br>
  <br>
  The veteran diplomat was involved in a Foreign Ministry initiative aimed at fostering cooperation between China and Central and Eastern European nations, such as Poland, Greece and Serbia.
  <br>
  <br>
  She described the initiative, which began in 2012, as a success, pointing to achievements in many areas which benefitted the people of both sides.
  <br>
  <br>
  Looking ahead, Huo suggested focusing on new areas of cooperation, such as green energy, advanced technology, and artificial intelligence.
  <br>
  <br>
  At the same event, former Chinese ambassador to Georgia and Tajikistan Yue Bin spoke about the development of Sino-Russian relations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yue described how the bond between the two neighbours has grown stronger over time, evolving into a comprehensive strategic partnership building on mutual trust.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong will continue to deepen international co-operation and integrate into national development despite a complex external environment, Chief Executive John Lee said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Writing on his Facebook page after attending the opening ceremony of the Boao Forum in Hainan, Lee said he was encouraged by Vice Premier Ding Xuexiang's remarks.
  <br>
  <br>
  In his speech, Ding pointed out four suggestions for Asia and the world's future and "three perspectives" on China's economic development.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee said the SAR must move forward steadily by leveraging its unique position of supporting the country's development while connecting with the rest of the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Under One Country, Two Systems, Hong Kong is the world's only open economy that simultaneously enjoys both Chinese and international advantages," he wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  The chief executive outlined plans to continue pursuing reforms with breakthrough thinking, including advancing projects like the Northern Metropolis and Greater Bay Area development.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee met the director-general of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, Qu Dongyu, earlier in the morning.
  <br>
  <br>
  During the meeting, Lee discussed the city's potential for developing its fisheries and agricultural sector with diverse food industries.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also expressed interest in working with the organisation on water quality simulation systems and sustainable aquaculture development, according to his Facebook page.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Thursday said they are investigating a suspected assault at a flat in Sham Shui Po after a video shared online appeared to show an elderly woman being physically abused by a helper.
 <br>
  <br>
  Officers said a woman reported last week that her mother, 81, had been abused in a flat at Lai On Estate.
  <br>
  <br>
  Footage reportedly from a surveillance camera appeared to show the elderly woman tied up in bed and being gagged with a towel.
  <br>
  <br>
  She was later taken to hospital with injuries to her face and hands, police said.
  <br>
  <br>
  No arrests have been made over the alleged incident.

    Thais give green light to draft law for casinos

<img alt="Protesters rally near Government House in Bangkok against the casino-entertainment complex bill. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797665_1_20250327133509.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Thailand's cabinet on Thursday approved a draft law for casinos and entertainment complexes, as the government looks to attract more tourists and build a major gaming industry.
 <br>
  <br>
  Gambling is mostly banned in Thailand apart from state-controlled horse racing, the lottery and on some sports but successive governments have pressed the case for allowing casinos to draw in more foreign visitors and create more jobs and state revenue.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the latest draft approved by cabinet will significantly limit how many Thai punters can go to casinos, with an entry fee of 5,000 baht and proof of at least 50 million baht in bank deposits, effectively blocking large swathes of the population, where per capita gross domestic product is about US$7,300.
  <br>
  <br>
  A deputy finance minister said this month the assets requirement for Thai nationals would be dropped because it would exclude too many people.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another restriction is that the casino area may only occupy up to 10 percent of the entire space of an entertainment complex, according to a government statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The draft law will be sent to parliament, and if passed, will also need approval from the Senate and the king.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra said details of the law were not final as parliament would have the final say.
  <br>
  <br>
  A Citi report late last year estimated that about half of people aged 20 and more in Thailand could be casino players, providing a base for the country to potentially become the world's third-largest gambling destination.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government, led by the populist Pheu Thai party, hopes to attract at least 100 billion baht in new investment in casinos and entertainment complexes and see an annual boost to foreign arrivals of 5 to 10 percent, while generating revenue of more than 12 billion baht a year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite most betting and gambling being outlawed in Thailand, illicit operations have operated for years.
  <br>
  <br>
  A January opinion poll in Thailand indicated there was opposition to the plan, however, and some political parties have argued that building a gambling industry would worsen social problems.

<img alt='Irina Fan, director of research at the Trade Development Council, says the impact of US tariffs on Hong Kong is "relatively mild".

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Trade Development Council said Hong Kong exporters are well-prepared for the new round of US tariffs set to take effect on April 2.
 <br>
  <br>
  The council's export confidence index for the first quarter stood at 51, up 1.8 points from the fourth quarter of 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  The expectation index, which shows exporters’ expectations for the next quarter, also rose. It climbed one point to 51.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on RTHK’s
  <i>
   Backchat
  </i>
  programme on Thursday, the council’s director of research Irina Fan said the city’s export performance is driven by strong sales and procurement, as well as higher prices.
  <br>
  <br>
  Regarding the impact of US tariffs on local exports, Fan described it as “relatively mild” compared with some of Washington's major trading partners, including China, Canada and Mexico.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Hong Kong's exporters are quite well-prepared for higher US tariffs," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Our exporters took a very agile and flexible business strategy also actually in the past few years to mitigate the risk from higher US tariffs, which actually started in the year of 2018.
  <br>
  <br>
  “They already adopted strategies like diversifying their sourcing, engaging with new partners and new markets, relocating some of their production lines, and also continuing to reduce their reliance, the selling to the US markets."
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite trade tensions, Fan said 75 percent of exporters expect their profits to remain stable or grow, and that industries such as jewellery, equipment and materials, timepieces, electronics and toys remained positive in their outlook.

    'Art Basel, Art Central a barometer for art market'

    <![CDATA[<div>
<img alt="Daniel Kwok, an independent art consultant, says that art fairs and auctions will give the city's art market a boost. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797660_1_20250327130541.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An expert has said that ongoing art shows and upcoming auctions will give the mainland and Hong Kong art scene a boost, and serve as a barometer for future market performance.
 <br>
  <br>
  Last year, the broader art market suffered a notable hit, with sales of modern and contemporary works declining by about 40 percent year on year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sales of traditional Chinese artworks also fared poorly, with transactions for Chinese painting and calligraphy auctions dropping by more than 20 percent year on year to 12.6 billion yuan last year, according to independent consultant Daniel Kwok.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I would say the traditional Chinese art market remained depressed last year, as the weak performance of the real economy and financial markets has clearly reduced buyers’ interest in the art market," he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Even though stock markets in mainland China and Hong Kong seem to be recovering, collectors and buyers still need time to rebuild their confidence," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, Kwok said that events such as Art Basel and Art Central, as well as auctions next month, will offer more clues on whether sentiment in the art market has improved, and if Beijing’s recent stimulus measures have had any effect on collectors.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I believe Art Basel and Art Central will create an exciting weekend for Hong Kong, providing a direct boost to both our cultural and tourism industries. These events also showcase the strength of the Hong Kong art market," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, the art specialist noted that despite the economic downturn, interest in Chinese porcelain antiques have been growing.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Because those imperial porcelain made for the emperors are all produced with exceptional craftsmanship, so even by today's standards, these pieces remain stunning to us," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kwok said another hot trend is Ming-style wood furniture famous for its intricate designs and Huanghuali wood – which comes from a rare species of rosewood. He noted that a Huanghuali wood table was sold for more than 45 million yuan on the mainland last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Looking ahead, Kwok cautioned that the heightened tension between China and the US might weigh on the art market.
  <br>
  <br>
  He pointed out that US tariff hikes may affect art shipments between the two countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I believe the unstable international climate will make buyers more cautious and conservative,” he explained.

    Govt 'pays almost all drug costs despite fee hike'
   </title>

<img alt="" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797648_1_20250327115415.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hospital Authority's chief pharmacist said on Thursday the upcoming hike in medication fees will help to subsidise the purchase of new drugs, as well as those used to fight cancer or rare diseases.
 <br>
  <br>
  Starting January, patients have to pay HK$20 for a four-week supply of drugs, up from the current HK$15 for a 16-week supply.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on an RTHK radio programme, William Chui pointed out that the government is still covering nearly all healthcare costs even with the hike.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The government now subsidises 92 to 93 percent of the cost of a drug," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Even after increasing the fees, 90 percent of the cost is still covered.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Therefore, we cannot actually recover the cost of the drug, we can only hope to reduce waste.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We hope patients will understand that – when there is medicine they do not need or when they have a lot of drugs left over at home, they can let their doctors know."
  <br>
  <br>
  He emphasised that even though each prescription is set to be for a maximum for four weeks, this does not mean patients have to return to hospitals and clinics for another prescription after the period.
  <br>
  <br>
  Otherwise, the workload of pharmacies will be much heavier, he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chui added that patients can still be dispensed a maximum supply of 24 weeks each time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the consultant of the accident and emergency wards of the New Territories East cluster believes higher fees for A&E wards will not discourage patients from turning up.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If you ask whether the higher charge will cause patients to not come, I believe it won't," Cheng Chi-hung said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Because they will gradually know how to assess the situation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Sometimes patients might not be clear about their condition.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Obviously, for a cold, they will turn to primary healthcare.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But when it comes to cases like a sprain after exercising, or a suspected bone fracture, I believe patients will still choose to head to accident and emergency wards."
  <br>
  <br>
  Non-critical and non-emergency cases, or those deemed as category three to five patients, will need to pay HK$400 per visit – up from the present flat rate of HK$180 – starting next year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hung noted that it is difficult to predict that there will be a decline in the number of A&E patients, even though the figure dropped by five percent after the previous fee increment in 2017.

    'Winter flu season over but summer poses new threat'

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) says the winter influenza season has come to an end after about 11 weeks, but people should next get jabs to protect themselves against a possible summer flu season.
 <br>
  <br>
  Around 800 severe and fatal cases were recorded among adults over winter, while 10 children became seriously ill after catching the virus, the centre said on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a press briefing, CHP controller Edwin Tsui said the predominant strain of the virus during winter, A (H1), was also prevalent in 2018/19, but the number of severe and fatal cases among adults this time decreased by 15 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tsui said severe cases involving children dropped by 60 percent when compared with six years ago, thanks to a higher vaccination rate.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said people should also get vaccinated in case flu strikes again this summer.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think the risk or the probability of having a summer influenza season in Hong Kong is still present, and usually the summer influenza season will come in July and August," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "After this winter influenza season, we have to guard against any respiratory infections, especially the summer influenza activities and seasons. So what members of the public should do is to get vaccinated."
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the Hospital Authority said it will increase manpower around Easter.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For Easter, according to previous experience, the attendance will slowly grow along the four days of the public holidays. After that, there will be the peak in the following weekend," chief manager Larry Lee said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The good thing about this year is we don't bundle the Easter holiday together with the Ching Ming Festival."

    Online applications set for healthcare bills waivers

<img alt="The Hospital Authority’s chief manager of allied health, Priscilla Poon, says there are ways to ensure the expanded fee waiver mechanism will not overwhelm medical social workers.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 People who have financial difficulties would be able to apply online for waivers of healthcare charges in a few months' time.
 <br>
  <br>
  The online applications will be possible under an expansion of waiver mechanism for healthcare charges as part of reforms to the city’s healthcare sector, the Hospital Authority said on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  To apply, patients must at present submit documents at public hospitals or social service centres for assessment.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, Priscilla Poon, the authority’s chief manager of allied health, said officials are looking to utilise technology.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We are thinking that at about the end of this year we would be able to release a simple version of this waiver app, that the patients are able to access [via] ‘HA Go’ to see how long their waiver period is and what the validity period is,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “By around the second quarter of next year, we should be able to launch this online application.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Under the reforms, the government will relax the income and asset requirements for people to qualify for a fee waiver, meaning an extra 1.1 million people will be eligible.
  <br>
  <br>
  The validity period of each waiver application will be extended from 12 to 18 months, which Poon said is a way to alleviate the workload of medical social workers.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It reduces the frequency of visits of patients to the medical social worker department,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among other changes to the fee waiver mechanism are the inclusion of people aged under 65 who use general outpatient services occasionally and the revision of the definition of “family” to exclude members living with the patient who have no direct financial ties from asset reviews.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Wednesday said a renewed capital investment migrant scheme could bring investments worth HK$27 billion to Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  The New Capital Investment Entrant Scheme was launched in March last year, with the minimum amount of investment for applicants tripled to HK$30 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a written reply to Legco, financial services minister Christopher Hui said more than 900 applications have been received for the scheme.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said about 750 applications have been approved in principle, and some 340 cases have been officially greenlit.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister said HK$27 billion of investments will be brought into the SAR if all cases are approved.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hui said none of the applicants have invested in residential flats so far, and that among the more than HK$10 billion of approved investments, some HK$5.1 billion have been made in collective investment schemes, HK$3.6 billion were put into equities, and HK$1.8 billion were made in debt securities.

    HK, Hainan to cooperate in promoting trade ties

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee said on Wednesday a cooperation deal between Hong Kong and Hainan will contribute to the nation further opening up on the back of the free-trade advantages from the two regions.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lee made the remarks as he signed a memorandum of understanding with officials from the southern island province to boost trade and economic ties between the two sides.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee, who is attending the annual Boao Forum for Asia on Hainan, said Hong Kong has been the region's major source of foreign investment and that Hainan has also invested heavily in the SAR with the issuances of more than 13 billion yuan worth of offshore bonds.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the cooperation deal will make use of the free-trade advantages to be found on both sides and covers five key areas – trade and investment, finance, data flow, tourism and personnel exchange.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We very much welcome Hainan to expand the scope of recognition of Hong Kong professionals in Hainan, so as to provide more development opportunities for Hong Kong's professional services sector in the region, and to complement the advantages of Hainan's international level of its professional services, while serving the vigorous development of Hainan Free Trade Port," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee also said the cooperation deal will help the two regions to create new synergies in their supply chain expansions and explore the Asean markets together.
  <br>
  <br>
  Specifically, the deal offers support for Hong Kong firms in setting up processing factories in Hainan for premium consumer brands and also encourages Hainan to open up its finance, law, accounting, consulting, exhibition and construction sectors to professionals from the SAR.

 The Housing Society on Wednesday announced two subsidised flat projects in Fanling and Kwun Tong, with units to be sold at 70 percent of market value, will go on sale in April.
 <br>
  <br>
  The "Hemma Fab" project on Jockey Club Road in Fanling offers about 650 units with saleable areas ranging from 302 to 616 square feet, and prices from HK$2.3 million to HK$5.4 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the "Hemma Emerald" project on Anderson Road offers 960 units with saleable areas ranging from 302 to 664 square feet, and prices from about HK$2.5 million to HK$6.3 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  And although the Housing Authority will change the ratio for quota allocation between Green Form and White Form applicants under the Home Ownership Scheme from 40:60 to 50:50 in October, the ratio for the two projects will remain at 40:60.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will take reference to [the Housing Authority's] implementation, and we may add these new arrangements in the next phase," the Housing Society's development and marketing director Monita Ko said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ko added that about 40 percent of units will be reserved for families with elderly members or newborns.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eligible people can apply for the two projects from April 1 to 14.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Discounts will be offered to landlords who get their subdivided homes certified early under a proposed certification system, according to housing minister Winnie Ho.
 <br>
  <br>
  The government announced last year a regulatory regime to manage the city's subdivided units and hope to kick-start the process by the end of this year or early 2026, depending on the legislation process.
  <br>
  <br>
  Landlords will first have 12 months to declare their dwellings as "basic housing units". A grace period of 36 months will follow, not just to help owners complete certification, but also give tenants ample time to relocate if their flat is deemed unsuitable for living.
  <br>
  <br>
  To certify as a basic housing unit, owners must hire a building professional who checks if the flat meets a set of prescribed requirements. If not, modifications will have to be made.
  <br>
  <br>
  A fee is also payable to the government, and Ho explained why this was necessary in an interview with RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The administrative fees generated by this exercise should not be borne by all taxpayers. We expect to fix the problems involving around 110,000 units within 36 months. There will be a lot of documents for my colleagues to go through. This is the duty of affected landlords, so we’re merely trying to recoup the costs," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The housing chief said landlords who complete the certification in the first 12 months of the grace period will pay the least – or even nothing.
  <br>
  <br>
  The fee then goes up in the second year, and rises again in the final year.
  <br>
  <br>
  She expected the fee to be "a few thousand" dollars, with a final decision to be made later.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked about the likelihood that landlords will offload such costs to tenants, Ho pointed out they could turn to public housing units.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There will be a lot of options for tenants. We have 20,000 transitional homes and 30,000 light public housing units. As for traditional public rental housing, 158,000 units will be completed in the next five years… If the rents (for basic housing units) become unreasonable, tenants will have a choice of moving elsewhere," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government has announced that each basic housing unit must also have a window facing the street or semi-enclosed light well for ventilation and lighting reasons. But after hearing views from stakeholders and conducting site visits, Ho confirmed officials may also consider accepting windows facing fully-enclosed light wells, citing constraints of old buildings.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said there are about 2,000 such units around the city, and believes they won't constitute a hygiene issue as long as the light wells are kept clean.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lawmakers will discuss the proposal at a Legislative Council panel next Monday, and Ho said she looks forward to any feedback to fine-tune the arrangements.

    GBA cities need to maximise tourism synergy: survey

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Findings from a study led by the Polytechnic University’s School of Hotel and Tourism Management have indicated there’s great potential for cities within the Greater Bay Area (GBA) to collaborate further in their tourism strategies.
 <br>
  <br>
  The project, which also involved the University of Macau and Sun Yat-sen University, started about two years ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  Researchers conducted site visits to Hong Kong, Macau and nine other GBA cities on the mainland to look at their tourism resources.
  <br>
  <br>
  They also analysed 200,000 comments from popular online platforms and interviewed 182 residents, tourism officials and business owners in local communities to better understand travel experiences in the GBA.
  <br>
  <br>
  The study found that GBA cities share many similarities in their tourism strengths, such as food, cultural heritage and natural resources.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Professor Tony Tse from the study team said the region has failed to take advantage of them, noting that there is a dearth of long-haul travellers in many GBA cities.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The 11 cities have all their attractions, they have their own unique points about tourism... I think they can work together in a very complementary way to attract visitors from both within and outside the region," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Professor Hung Kam, the principal investigator, said GBA cities should build a "regional tourism brand," such as by coming up with travel itineraries that include multiple destinations.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong has a very unique cuisine with its [cha chaan teng] and others, such as Michelin restaurants," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Macau has a very unique cuisine with Portuguese cuisine fusioned with Chinese.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Zhongshan has its famous roast pigeon, and Guangzhou has double-skinned milk dessert.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So every destination has its uniqueness," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And we can organise this gastronomy tour, not only to explore cuisines in Hong Kong but across the region.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And that could be more appealing to those who only offered Hong Kong cuisine, for example."
  <br>
  <br>
  The PolyU professor said that even though Hong Kong is a well-developed tourism destination, there are still many opportunities for growth through working more closely with others in the GBA.
  <br>
  <br>
  She proposed authorities in different cities establish a central unit to coordinate regional branding efforts and set up a one-stop online platform to distribute travel information to travellers.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The organiser of Art Basel Hong Kong said on Wednesday this year's edition aims to strengthen Hong Kong's position as an arts and cultural hub while connecting creative ecosystems across the globe.
 <br>
  <br>
  In an exclusive interview with RTHK, director Angelle Siyang-Le said the event brings together 240 galleries from 42 countries and places, including 23 newcomers.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, "it's not only about the number of galleries, what we focus on is the content of what the gallery is bringing," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think our galleries continue to bring top quality artworks to our regions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That also shows how much the galleries really value the support from the collectors in Asia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Siyang-Le said she expects a good turnout especially from Southeast Asia, noting that collectors from the region were showing strong interest.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Apart from Hong Kong and mainland China, which remain the [biggest groups of people attending], people from the Philippines and Singapore are definitely on the rise," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under moves unveiled in the Budget this year, Art Basel is also partnering with the Tourism Board to create "immersive experience zones" and promote local culture and tourism.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We want to make sure that locally people understand the importance of culture, but more importantly we want to [take the Hong Kong brand international] through all our Basel shows," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We want to promote the living culture of Hong Kong and most importantly to remind people outside of Hong Kong constantly and regularly that Hong Kong is such an amazing place to visit."
  <br>
  <br>
  The premium art fair will run from Friday to Sunday at the Convention and Exhibition Centre in Wan Chai.
  <br>
  <br>
  With the fair expanding into public spaces like M+ Museum and Tai Kwun, Siyang-Le said the moves are happening because she wants to make art accessible beyond just the convention centre.
