<div class="itemFullText">
 The top Beijing official on Hong Kong affairs has urged the local business community to see the SAR as their home base, while consolidating the city's traditional advantages, during a closed-door exchange in Shenzhen, according to Xinhua New Agency.
 <br>
  <br>
  Xia Baolong, director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office (HKMAO), on Friday also told business magnates and entrepreneurs that they are the "main force" in promoting economic development.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[Business leaders] must stand firm in treating Hong Kong as their home and utilising Hong Kong to prosper, consolidate and enhance Hong Kong's traditional advantages," Xia was quoted as saying by the report.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong's business community and entrepreneurs are the main force in promoting economic development. They have made outstanding contributions to maintaining Hong Kong's prosperity and stability, and assisting in the country's modernisation."
  <br>
  <br>
  The report also said Xia told those at the exchange to support the SAR government in implementing its long-term development plans, and tell the good Hong Kong story and safeguard the city's international image, among other things.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chief Executive John Lee, who was in attendance with his principal officials, said his administration will unite and lead all sectors of Hong Kong to implement reforms and "break new ground" in the city's development, according to Xinhua.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sunwah Group chairman Jonathan Choi, who was at the meeting, said discussions focused on the role of business leaders in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As Hong Kong's economy relies on entrepreneurs, [Xia] hopes that entrepreneurs will go all out and follow the central government's strategy," Choi said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pui Kwan-kay, president of the Hong Kong Chinese Importers' and Exporters’ Association, said the Beijing official noted that the city had gone through trials and tribulations.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[Xia said] the current situation in Hong Kong has been stable, and we should take advantage of this period of transitioning from stability to prosperity to do our best," Pui said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other business leaders and property tycoons included Richard Li, who chairs Pacific Century Group; Peter Lee, co-chairman and managing director of Henderson Land; and Raymond Kwok, chairman and managing director of Sun Hung Kai Properties.
  <br>
  <br>
  They attended a full-day symposium and joined a dinner, with HKMAO executive deputy director Zhou Ji and the head of Beijing's liaison office in Hong Kong, Zheng Yanxiong, who also took part in the meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  During a trip to Hong Kong in February, Xia also focused on the city's economic developments. Last month, the senior Beijing official separately met executives of Jardine Matheson and HSBC in Beijing.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A local bartender on Friday reigned supreme in a Greater Bay Area mixology competition, which showcased the best flairtenders from Macau and Guangdong province.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong International Mixology Showdown 2024, organised by the SAR's Bartenders Association, hosted its inaugural GBA region competition in conjunction with this year's International Wine and Spirits Fair held at the convention centre in Wan Chai.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thirty-six competitors from the two SARs, as well as Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Nansha, Jiangmen and Zhuhai, impressed the judges at the bar table with their flair and finesse.
  <br>
  <br>
  Champion Kenneth Tsang, from the Hong Kong Jockey Club, said he was ecstatic to win on home soil.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think this is a great opportunity to see other competitors from other [regions] because you can learn a lot during the competition because you can see every technique, skill and other things that you can't see in Hong Kong," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think we can join more competitions [in the future] to make friends with each other, communicate with other bars or restaurants to build [each other] up."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Bartenders Association's Ken Chau said the purpose of the event is to promote the exchange of bartending culture among the different regions, adding that more competitions can help elevate the SAR's status as a regional trading hub for wine and spirits.
  <br>
  <br>
  And even though the government has relaxed duties on liquor, Chau said many bars have suffered significantly due to different consumption habits in Hong Kong. He hopes that this will change soon.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The spirits tax doesn't help a lot of sales to be honest, but it does help start a new path, especially Chinese Baijius because Chinese Baijius will be the next big trend in Hong Kong," he added.

<img alt="Organisers of the job fair said  more than 4,000 people signed up for the event. Photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1778152_1_20241108152756.jpg&q=75">

<div class="itemFullText">
 About 2,500 people on Friday attended a job fair, where about 70 companies are looking for top talents in Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  The fair – the second recruitment event that the Hong Kong Top Talent Services Association has held this year – is offering over 1,500 jobs.
  <br>
  <br>
  The association’s founder Shang Hailong pointed out that this edition of the fair is “totally different” in terms of its reach.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Today, this job fair is totally different. We cooperated with the Hong Kong Talent Engage Office, we cooperated with Oases (Office for Attracting Strategic Enterprises)…Different committees joined this job fair, that’s a big difference.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Shang added that more than 4,000 people had signed up for the event.
  <br>
  <br>
  Property giant Sun Hung Kai Properties was one of the companies offering jobs at the fair.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bonnie Soo, Assistant Manager of Human Resources revealed that the group is targetting candidates from the mainland.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The businesses of Sun Hung Kai Properties are not just in Hong Kong – we have a lot of property projects on the mainland. We recruit people from the mainland to understand more about the customers there – what they need and what they want."
  <br>
  <br>
  One jobseeker from the mainland, Scarlett Chen, said she hopes to find a better job at the fair.
  <br>
  <br>
  “On the mainland, for example for the IT industry, there is an age limit. And in recent years, the economic situation wasn’t good, [so] there are no promotion prospects or wage increases.”

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong will participate in organising the cross-border events of the National Games, including marathon and road cycling competitions, organisers said on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  To be held next year from November 9 to 21, it will be the first time for the National Games to be co-hosted by Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macau.
  <br>
  <br>
  The event’s coordination office head Yeung Tak-keung told a countdown press conference that apart from hosting eight competitions, the SAR will also help organise the athletics marathon hosted by Shenzhen, and road cycling hosted by Zhuhai.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gao Chao, the publicity department director for the General Administration of Sport of China, said Guangzhou and Shenzhen have finished planning for the games’ opening and closing ceremonies, and that authorities are planning out the route for the torch relay.
  <br>
  <br>
  Guangdong sports bureau director Cui Jian, meanwhile, said renovation and construction of venues in the province will be completed in March of next year.

<img alt="The Standby Signal No. 1 was issued this afternoon as Tropical Storm Yinxing nears Hong Kong. Image courtesy of Hong Kong Observatory" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1778122_2_20241108144246.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Observatory issued the Standby Signal No. 1 at 12.40pm today as Tropical Cyclone Yinxing edges closer to the coast of southern China.
 <br>
  <br>
  It said the T1 signal is expected to remain in place until at least noon on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Depending on the distance between Yinxing and the Pearl River Estuary, intensity of Yinxing and the local wind conditions, the Observatory will then assess the need for issuance of the Strong Wind Signal No. 3," the forecaster said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A tropical cyclone warning signal is expected to remain in force at least until Sunday morning."
  <br>
  <br>
  It added that under the combined effect of Yinxing and the northeast monsoon, it will be windier over the coast of Guangdong and on high ground over the weekend.
  <br>
  <br>
  Seas will be rough with swells and there will be showers, the observatory said.

    Save time and cut costs with mediation clauses: SJ

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Justice Paul Lam on Friday said incorporating mediation clauses in all future government contracts would not only save time, but also reduce costs for all parties involved.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters on the final day of Hong Kong Legal Week, Lam stressed the government's intention to promote mediation as a means of resolving conflicts amicably.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The government is willing to take the lead in the hope that we can cultivate the culture in the society as a whole. So that when the people encounter disputes, the first thing that they would consider is not to go to court, but instead to try to resolve this view by mediation, by a means which in our belief is more economical, more time-saving, and resulting in a more harmonious result,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The justice chief added he wants the government to be an example for the private sector to follow as well.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, Lam said he had initial discussions during his first meeting with the Hong Kong International Legal Talents Training Expert Committee, composed of three advisory boards, with 17 legal experts and scholars from prominent international, mainland, and local legal organisations and universities.
  <br>
  <br>
  He expressed his hope to leverage this platform for greater capacity-building efforts and to emphasise more practical applications when developing training programmes and strategies.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Paralympics double gold medallist Ho Yuen-kei on Friday said she hopes to raise public awareness of people with special needs, after a Thai restaurant refused to admit her because of her wheelchair.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on an RTHK programme, the boccia player said she was refused entry to a Causeway Bay restaurant, with the staff saying her wheelchair could block other diners.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho said attitudes towards the disabled had improved over the past decade, but more needs to be done.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Can there be more training for staff to improve awareness? Not just for wheelchair users, but restaurants may also think of how to help those who are visually impaired," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We understand that there may be difficulties - especially for small shops in Hong Kong - but we can work together. For example, some small restaurants have ramps for people with disabilities or wheelchair users."
  <br>
  <br>
  Simon Wong, head of the Federation of Restaurants and Related Trades, said the incident was not common, but it showed that some restaurants may not be familiar with the city's anti-discrimination legislation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Most restaurants have training for their staff, but some small-scale ones may have overlooked [this] during the training process. We hope the catering sector and the government could do more promotion," he told the same programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho said the Thai restaurant’s manager apologised to her and she accepted the apology.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong on Thursday hosted the inaugural Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Greater Bay Area Lawyers Exchange Reception.
 <br>
  <br>
  More than 150 people from the legal sectors of the mainland, Macau and Hong Kong, including Director-General of the Department of Justice of Guangdong Chen Xudong, attended the reception.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at the event, Deputy Secretary for Justice Horace Cheung said that the establishment of a platform to enable the industry to better participate in the development of the bay area is an important measure in the Department of Justice’s Action Plan on the Construction of Rule of Law in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Greater Bay Area.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that the platform aims to consolidate the professional strengths of the legal services to give full play to the unique strengths of lawyers in the GBA.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cheung also said that the platform, along with the Hong Kong International Legal Talents Training Academy – which will be launched shortly – will enable Hong Kong to fully harness the institutional strengths of the "One Country, Two Systems" framework.

 The Hong Kong Observatory on Thursday said it will issue the Standby Signal No 1 between noon and 3pm on Friday, as Tropical Cyclone Yinxing edges closer to Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  Forecasters said the weather system will enter the SAR's 800-kilometre warning radius at around midnight on Friday, adding in a Facebook post that two more potential storms are forming over the Pacific Ocean.
  <br>
  <br>
  The observatory said Yinxing’s circulation is relatively small, so it has to observe changes in intensity, local wind conditions, and how close it is from Hong Kong before it decides to issue a higher warning signal.
  <br>
  <br>
  It added there will be a few showers over the coast of Guangdong during the weekend under the combined effects of Yinxing and the northeast monsoon.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A concern group has set an ambitious target of eliminating school bullying in Hong Kong over the next decade.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Council of Early Childhood Education and Services said according to its survey of 500 primary students, parents and teachers in July, one in three pupils have been bullied at school.
  <br>
  <br>
  The group called for society-wide effort to fight the problem.
  <br>
  <br>
  “In the next decade, we want to reduce the number of bullying to zero. So this is quite a challenge for Hong Kong and we call upon everybody, Legco members, our bureau chiefs, our influencers, our mass media, to help us,” Sansan Ching, the council’s director, told a conference on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The group has launched an "anti-bullying month" during which a series of activities will be held to raise awareness, including a casual wear day, a drawing competition and family workshops.
  <br>
  <br>
  And a petition signed jointly by parents, teachers, lawyers and medical professionals submitted to the government at the end of the conference called for a legal framework to protect pupils as well as more training for teachers to identify and intervene in cases.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to guidelines issued by the Education Bureau, school are required to intervene and follow up on bullying incidents as soon as possible.
  <br>
  <br>
  Psychiatrist Doris Chan said bullying can lead to long-term psychological impact on victims, and a more positive school environment is needed.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Most of them have lower self-esteem, and they feel they are worthless. And some of them suffer from mood problems. And a minority have some other diseases, such as post-traumatic stress disorder," she said.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Thursday said they arrested 14 men on suspicion of illegal road racing.
 <br>
  <br>
  Officers said the races allegedly took place over the past two months on main roads, including Route Twisk, Tuen Mun Road, and Tolo Highway.
  <br>
  <br>
  They arrested people aged between 20 and 33 years old, with some claiming to be teachers, nurses and professional drivers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police made the arrests between Monday and Friday last week, seizing 14 private vehicles.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a press briefing, chief inspector Ng Hing-cheong criticised people who engaged in illegal street racing, saying it will endanger other drivers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Some of the vehicles involved raced back and forth at high speeds on the narrow and winding section of Route Twisk. They reached a speed of up to 135 kilometres per hour in a section with a speed limit of 50 kilometres per hour. They often crossed the double white lines to chase each other," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ng added that the operation against illegal street racing is still underway.

    HK uncorks trade potential at Wine and Spirits Fair

<img alt="More than 600 global exhibitors joined the fair this year. Photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1777973_2_20241107142109.jpg&q=30">

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong’s premier wine and spirits fair, which aims to establish the SAR as the regional trading hub for alcoholic drinks, opened on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Boasting more than 600 exhibitors from around the world, the three-day International Wine and Spirits Fair will feature exhibitions, seminars, tastings and a mixology showdown at Wan Chai’s convention centre.
  <br>
  <br>
  And with the government recently relaxing duties for drinks with an alcoholic strength of 30 percent or more, exhibitors are hoping this development will bolster their global sales.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I’m certain Hong Kong is the best city and the best way for Chinese liquor to go abroad,” Keith Lau, a representative of a mainland spirits trading company said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Maotai, Xi Jiu, or other brands, they have set up local companies in order to supply overseas [demand], so it is quite important that we have the right policy for the brands to go abroad.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Fellow exhibitor Julia Klimczak, who’s selling Scottish whisky, said she is expecting an increase in sales during this year's fair. Klimczak said she believes Hong Kong offers an ideal setting for promotion and networking.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There's a lot of international contacts and I'm very excited about the networking possibilities here in Hong Kong. It's incredible, and I believe we have people from all over the world."
  <br>
  <br>
  Teddy Tse, who works at a local wine and spirits distribution company also said he is expecting better sales this year, but said he hopes authorities could further relax duties.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The starting point at HK$100 is better because over 85 percent of the products is below HK$200, the import cost. Last year was good, so I think this year will be better because of the fruits of the Wine and Dine Festival."
  <br>
  <br>
  The government last month cut the duty on liquor with an alcohol content of over 30 percent and with an import price of more than HK$200 to 10 percent from 100 percent for the portion above HK$200.
  <br>
  <br>
  Also at the fair was Pieter Hermans, a local buyer. He said the fair is a lot smaller than it used to be.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Let's hope that due to the new spirit tariffs and all these types of things, Hong Kong will get on the map a little bit more and that the internal trade is starting to move again. I guess it's just the general economy that's also suffering a little bit at the moment," he said.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Organisers of the cross-harbour swim scheduled for Sunday said the race will be cancelled in the event of a tropical cyclone warning signal.
 <br>
  <br>
  They said the annual swim will be called off if the Standby Signal No 1 or above, or the red or black rainstorm warning, is in force at 6am that day.
  <br>
  <br>
  It will also be cancelled if there's a red tide at the harbour, or any other condition that deems the race unsuitable to take place.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Observatory said it will issue the Standby Signal No 1 between noon and 3pm on Friday as Super Typhoon Yinxing enters within 800 kilometres of Hong Kong, and according to its current forecast track, the storm will be within 400 kilometres of the SAR from Saturday until Sunday morning.
  <br>
  <br>
  Organisers of the cross-harbour swim called on all participants to pay attention to the latest situation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If the race is cancelled, an official announcement will be made shortly on [our] official website and on [our] social media channels," they said.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 4,000 swimmers have signed up for the event due to take place on Sunday morning. They'll make their way from Wan Chai to Tsim Sha Tsui.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The transport sector on Thursday urged authorities to finalise details of a plan to bring in outside workers, especially for the aviation industry, as soon as possible.
 <br>
  <br>
  Officials have revealed plans to bring in 10,000 skilled technicians over the next three years, but have not specified which job categories or professions will be included.
  <br>
  <br>
  It comes after Chief Executive John Lee in his Policy Address projected Hong Kong will have a shortage of about 60,000 skilled technicians across different sectors.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vivien Lau, the chief executive officer of the Hong Kong Business Aviation Centre said her industry is expecting more than 6,000 vacancies in the next five years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lau said the need for mechanics and technicians will increase with the three-runway system set to open later this month.
  <br>
  <br>
  "What we are tackling now is the technical side, the technician and mechanics. Because even though these categories were covered in the previous [labour importation] scheme, but we still think that there's a challenge in recruiting those technical staff because of their qualification, the level of experience that we are requiring, and also sometimes the language is also our key consideration," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Transport sector lawmaker Frankie Yick for his part said the government should place more focus on bringing in workers from Southeast Asia.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Particularly for the aviation industry, if they need to communicate with the pilot, with other people in the airport, and they normally speak in English. So [recruiting workers] from countries like the Philippines, Malaysia, I think that will be helpful,” he said.

    'Trump re-election casts shadow over HK economy'

<div class="itemFullText">
 An economist on Thursday said Donald Trump's return to the White House will add uncertainty to the local economy even as confidence among small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) improved in the fourth quarter.
 <br>
  <br>
  According to research conducted by the Productivity Council and Standard Chartered Bank, the Standard Chartered Hong Kong SME Leading Business Index rose 3.2 points to 45.7 points for the October-to-December period from the previous three months.
  <br>
  <br>
  Figures below 50 indicate a negative outlook, and those above 50 a positive one.
  <br>
  <br>
  A reading of 52.8 in the second quarter of 2023 was the highest in the past decade.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a press briefing, Kelvin Lau, a senior economist from Standard Chartered Bank, said local businesses are expected to be cautious moving forward over concerns that Trump may raise tariffs on Chinese goods, which could have an impact on Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If Trump starts talking about much more milder tariff hikes to begin with, we think that it could actually be not as bad of a news for a lot of the SMEs who have been expecting the worst," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So I think overall, we are looking at more subdued SME index performance, more cautiousness, prolonged cautiousness, but nothing more substantially worse than where we are now."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lau also said Hong Kong's economy is on track towards recovery, but the pace is slower than what the market expects.

 City University has made it into the top 10 in the latest rankings of Asian tertiary institutions, jumping seven spots from a year ago.
 <br>
  <br>
  The University of Hong Kong remained second in the latest QS rankings, which is compiled by a higher education analytics firm based in Britain.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chinese University and the University of Science and Technology both moved up four spots, to rank sixth and 11th respectively.
  <br>
  <br>
  Polytechnic University moved up slightly to 17th, while Baptist University slipped to 71st.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Breaking into the top 10 in the QS Asia university rankings 2025 highlights our steady progress in academic research and our pursuit of innovation and excellence," said the president of City University, Freddy Boey.
  <br>
  <br>
  The University of Hong Kong, for its part, said the rankings highlight its world leading status in academia and innovation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[We are] committed to shaping the future through transformative education, cutting-edge research, and a pronounced emphasis on AI-readiness," it said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Polytechnic University head Teng Jin-guang, meanwhile, said the university was pleased with the result, describing it as impressive and encouraging.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Peking University retained the top spot in Asia, while the National University of Singapore was ranked third, the same as the year before.

 Five more people have been arrested in connection with an attack on a corrections officer outside Pik Uk Prison last week.
 <br>
  <br>
  That brings to 13 the number of people arrested over the case.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police said of the latest arrests, three were suspected to have carried out or planned the attack and two others allegedly provided assistance to the assailants.
  <br>
  <br>
  At least one of them has been charged.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eight others were taken into custody earlier and three of them have been charged.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officers have not ruled out making further arrests.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to the police, the officer was attacked by three masked men carrying "long hard objects" while waiting for a bus outside the prison in Sai Kung on Friday.

    'Specific licences needed for bamboo scaffolding work'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A concern group for industrial accident victims on Wednesday urged authorities to issue specific licences to contractors that carry out scaffolding-related work.
 <br>
  <br>
  Siu Sin-man of the Association for the Rights of Industrial Accident Victims made the comment after a worker fell to his death on Tuesday while dismantling bamboo scaffolding from a To Kwa Wan building.
  <br>
  <br>
  Currently, bamboo scaffolding workers must be accredited by the Occupational Safety and Health Council – and their licences have to be renewed.
  <br>
  <br>
  But contractors do not have similar requirements. They only need to be registered under the Buildings Ordinance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Siu said having a more specific licensing system for contractors could enhance regulations.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Scaffolding is a high-risk industry. If we only use business registration, [there’s not enough] regulation for this kind of work. So people can easily open a company to do this high-risk [job],” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Siu added that she is unsure whether the worker who died was wearing proper safety equipment when the incident occurred.
  <br>
  <br>
  The worker’s relatives held a mourning ceremony earlier in the day.
  <br>
  <br>
  His wife said her husband operated a company with several partners, and that he spent more than 20 years in the field and was always very careful.

    Police nab 275 over 'staged traffic accidents'

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Wednesday said they arrested 275 people who allegedly staged traffic accidents to obtain financial assistance from the government.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Social Welfare Department, which arranges financial assistance for traffic accident victims, requires these people to provide documents certified by a registered medical practitioner.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officers said the suspects were involved in 121 traffic accidents from February last year to April this year, and had obtained about HK$14 million in financial assistance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chief Inspector Tse Yu-ngai said a majority of them belonged to different syndicates and some even staged accidents involving public transport.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Eleven out of 14 victims in one accident were from the same syndicate... They got on the double-decker bus at different stations. When the bus travelled to Tung Chung, the mastermind arranged a private car to collide with the bus, staging a traffic accident," Tse said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that some debtors were being forced by creditors to participate in these staged accidents in order to pay off their debts.
  <br>
  <br>
  The suspects, aged between 18 and 64, were arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to defraud and fraud.

    Govt contracts to include mediation clauses: DoJ

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Department of Justice on Wednesday said it has issued a policy statement to incorporate mediation clauses in government contracts.
 <br>
  <br>
  Officials said the statement sets out the government's stance on promoting the use of mediation to resolve disputes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a Legal Week event, Secretary for Justice Paul Lam encouraged people to seek mediation when disputes arise, before resorting to arbitration or litigation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The government will incorporate mediation clauses in all future government contracts, and departure from that policy will need to be justified by exceptional circumstances, for example the existence of an inconsistent statutory provision," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Through this policy, we do not only aim at ensuring that contractual disputes involving the government may be resolved in a flexible, economical and time-saving manner.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We also hope that with the government taking the lead, the policy will also encourage the private sectors to follow suit."

<div class="itemFullText">
 Two Shanghai-based firms that are taking part in a national expo said they plan on expanding their reach into Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  TMiRob Technology and Faraconix are among the firms that have signed cooperation agreements at the China International Import Expo.
  <br>
  <br>
  TMiRob produces AI-powered robots that can be sent into isolation wards to conduct simple medical procedures, such as checking the temperature and radiation levels of cancer patients.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With the effort of letting our robots running inside Hong Kong hospitals, hopefully we can combine with more technologies in the world," the firm's founder, Pan Jing, told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  Faraconix – which produces semiconductors for smartphones and computers – plans to expand into Hong Kong this month and invest more than HK$100 million in the coming three years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Its founder, Chi Law, is from Hong Kong and started the firm in Shanghai four years ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The purpose of coming to Hong Kong is to bring some communication products for use in the future, such as what's known as millimetre wave, or [products] in the 6G era, as well as satellite communication chips," he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  Law said despite the global competition in chip making, he expressed confidence that his company can come up with chips and tech that are better than those in the US in two to three years.

    Hong Kong watches as America decides

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Many people in Hong Kong were keeping a close watch on the unfolding results of the hotly contested US elections on Wednesday, with opinions here as divided as those in the United States.
 <br>
  <br>
  Dozens of people attended a watch party organised by the American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  One of them, Chris Growney, who works in the financial services sector, thinks a win for Republican candidate Donald Trump would also be a victory for American businesses.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The businesses that are in the States would be treated with better tax efficiency, have better opportunities to create new jobs,” he said. “And ideally, if there are potentially higher tariffs on imports then that could potentially help American businesses."
  <br>
  <br>
  But Diana Parusheva-Lowery, who works in the same sector, believes a Trump victory could mean more restrictions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If there are more tariffs, if there are more investment restrictions, this is going to affect trade flow, investment flow and ultimately capital flow," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But equally, if Kamala Harris wins, she also has her policies towards China, which will also have an effect to which might be similar, might be different."
  <br>
  <br>
  There were also a number of people who still don’t have a preference either for Trump or Democratic candidate Kamala Harris, including businessman Mark Wise.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The US and Chinese economies are intertwined... One candidate is a bit more protectionist in their approach, and another is more in line with traditional, open and free trade between the countries. That could a material difference in the economic situation for both countries, depending on the outcome," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But I'd say that having an election that takes longer than a day is going to be something that no one wants."
  <br>
  <br>
  Eden Woon, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong, said the result will determine the future development of Sino-US ties, which will also have a direct impact on the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It is very important for Hong Kong because Hong Kong has a very close trade relationship with the United States. Historically, it has a very good connection with the United States' civil society and here many people, many businesses have an interest in the United States. So we are also watching to see what happens in this election,” Woon told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other watch parties were being held elsewhere in the territory, including at a pub in Central.
  <br>
  <br>
  Raj, a British shipping worker in Hong Kong, said he's not surprised to see Trump leading early but believed the Democrats will take over eventually.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Republicans always take an early lead... Typically whenever you watch an election like this it always looks like the Republicans are winning, but it's going to be very close, so I think at the end, we're going to see the Democrats coming forward," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I want to follow the results of this election because I think it has an impact geopolitically all over the world.”
  <br>
  <br>
  For James Lockett, chairman of Democrats Abroad and organiser of the event, the early results came as a surprise.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Compared to 2020, by this time, Joe Biden had a big lead because of early voting,” he noted. "My main concern is gun control, it's very important, and also women's rights are very important. Diversity in the workplace is very important to me."
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, a group of university students was paying attention to the elections on the University of Hong Kong campus on Wednesday morning.
  <br>
  <br>
  Peter Lee, an HKU undergraduate, told RTHK that he was at the event to get to know what others thought about the race.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think in here you can [listen] to different voices and you will listen to different people with different opinion or predictions," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think it will be better for me to come here to interact with people rather than just staying at home, just thinking by myself, because election somehow you can predict it, but maybe the real outcome is different from your predictions."
  <br>
  <br>
  Another student, Zhang Yiqiu, said she backs Harris because of her support for women's reproductive rights.
  <br>
  <br>
  She also described the winner-take-all electoral system in the US as "absurd".
  <br>
  <br>
  "To me, it's not fair if someone gets more votes but still they are the losing party... From quite an idealistic point of view, it will be good to eradicate that and just by counting votes only based on the number."
  <br>
  <br>
  Zhang Jiarui, a master's student, said a Trump win would be a bad sign to China's exports.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Trump said they will bring manufacturing industry back to the United States which implies that they will implement some tariffs to China's exports."

<div class="itemFullText">
 Housing director Rosanna Law said an iconic rainbow wall of Choi Hung Estate will have to be demolished, but officials will seriously look at restoring the spot after redevelopment.
 <br>
  <br>
  Officials plan on moving the first batch of affected tenants to an estate in Kowloon City as early as four years from now, as an estimated 15 years will be needed to complete the phased renewal of the estate.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to RTHK, Law said the "rainbow" block of Tan Fung House and the sports courts next to it, which is above a multi-storey car park, would have to go.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If we say we retain the rainbow wall and the car park, not only will we have fewer flats in the redeveloped estate, but I think it would be rather difficult in terms of having enough space, to improve the traffic conditions nearby," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But we understand how the public loves this photo spot. Our team of architects will seriously think about ways of restoring this 'rainbow' at the new Choi Hung Estate."
  <br>
  <br>
  Law said authorities made the redevelopment announcement early, so that tenants can be psychologically prepared about having to move out and take part in the process.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said if they don't want to move to Kowloon City and stay nearby, officials will try to accommodate if there are suitable flats available.
  <br>
  <br>
  Law stressed that the second and third phase of the redevelopment - due to begin around 2035 - are still in a conceptual stage.
  <br>
  <br>
  She explained the new blocks were meant to be up to 50-storeys high and officials cannot conduct works such as exploring the ground's foundation until after tenants have moved out.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chief Executive John Lee also announced in his Policy Address last month plans to regulate sub-divided flats while requiring landlords to turn them into "basic housing units".
  <br>
  <br>
  Law said it is illegal for landlords to break existing rental contracts early and force out tenants in the name of renovating the flats and she said tenants can report this to the authorities.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In fact, the government has yet to set the standards [for basic housing units]. We haven't completed our public consultation and enact new laws. Do landlords have to rush to [renovate]?" the director of housing said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I appeal to the landlords, even if you're eager to make sure your flats comply with the new standards, you really should wait a little bit until we have promulgated the new standards. Otherwise you may waste your money."
  <br>
  <br>
  Law said around 40 percent of tenants currently living in the potentially affected sub-divided flats, or around 40,000 households, should be ineligible to apply for public housing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities, she said, will not conduct large-scale law enforcement in future unless officials are confident they can find re-settlements for affected residents.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Labour Department (LD) said it was investigating a fatal industrial incident in Kowloon City in which a worker fell to his death while dismantling scaffolding at a building.
 <br>
  <br>
  The incident happened on Tuesday afternoon, when the man fell onto the canopy on the first floor while dismantling a bamboo scaffold at the external wall of the building on Ma Tau Kok Road.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was declared dead in hospital.
  <br>
  <br>
  The department said it issued suspension notices to the contractors involved and stopped all scaffolding work.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The contractors cannot resume the work until the LD is satisfied that measures to abate the relevant risks have been taken," it wrote in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The department added that it will try to find out what caused the incident and who might be responsible, and take legal actions if there is any violation of work safety legislation.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong Construction Industry Employees General Union expressed regret over the tragedy.
  <br>
  <br>
  It urged employers to provide workers with safety equipment such as full-body safety harness and lifelines to prevent similar cases.

    'Oct saw most non-mainland visitors to HK this year'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Tourism minister Kevin Yeung said on Tuesday that Hong Kong recorded nearly a million arrivals of non-mainland visitors last month, the most so far this year for a single month.
 <br>
  <br>
  He said total visitor arrivals in October topped 4 million, with non-mainland tourists exceeding 950,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  For the first 10 months of the year, tourist arrivals reached 36.6 million, a 37 percent jump from the same period last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a Legco panel meeting, lawmakers discussed the idea of promoting horse-racing tourism, which was included by Chief Executive John Lee in his Policy Address.
  <br>
  <br>
  Third Side councillor Tik Chi-yuen expressed concerns that the move could encourage gambling, especially among the younger generation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeung said the aim is not to encourage people to gamble.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our target is the tourists... Horse-racing is an attractive event in their eyes," the secretary for culture, sports and tourism said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He described the SAR as the only place in the region that can host world-class, distinguished races.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the Kai Tak Sports Park which is set to come into use in the first quarter of 2025, Election Committee councillor Chan Siu-hung asked whether officials can ensure that shops and facilities near the park will enjoy a high usage rate during days when mega events are not being held.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan noted the nearby cruise terminal could go very quiet at times.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeung said you can't compare the two. He said the sports park is a public facility, and individuals and groups can book and use the facilities there on non-game days.

    'Preserve collective memory of Choi Hung Estate'

<img alt="Wong Tai Sin district councillor Godfrey Ngai says a colourful exterior wall and a basketball court at Choi Hung Estate should be preserved. File photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1777676_1_20241105175551.jpg&q=20">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 District councillors have urged officials to think of ways to keep alive the heritage and collective memory of Choi Hung Estate, which is set to be redeveloped in three phases over about two decades.
 <br>
  <br>
  The first phase of the facelift for the rainbow-themed housing complex, built in the 1960s and famous for its colourful exterior wall and photogenic basketball court, involves three blocks and two vacant school sites.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a Wong Tai Sin district council meeting on Tuesday to discuss the redevelopment plan, councillor Godfrey Ngai said the exterior wall and the basketball court should be preserved.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We propose setting up a Choi Hung museum in the new [Choi Hung] estate, which would include the estate's existing iconic signage, retro vending machines and nostalgic items... This would help preserve the unique features and collective memory of Choi Hung Estate,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another councillor, Deannie Yew, said she is worried about the wall effect, after Secretary for Housing Winnie Ho revealed earlier that the blocks at the future estate will be over 50-storey high.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If each building is going to be 50 storeys high, it would be like a 'giant' in the district because many buildings in the area aren't that tall. In such a densely populated area, wouldn't this potentially create the wall effect?" she questioned.
  <br>
  <br>
  In response, chief architect Tim Li from the Housing Department said a study has already taken the wall effect into consideration, and 50-storey designs are not new.
  <br>
  <br>
  Li added that each redevelopment cycle of Choi Hung Estate would take about seven years, which includes moving residents out, tearing down old buildings and building new foundations.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A senior Beijing official overseeing Hong Kong affairs on Tuesday said the territory’s economic development has been recognised internationally and that the SAR has unlimited opportunities.
 <br>
  <br>
  Zhou Ji, executive deputy director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, also hailed Chief Executive John Lee’s leadership in supporting the economy, seeking development opportunities and improving people’s livelihoods.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong's economy has continued to expand. Its external economic and trade relations have also continued to improve. And the capital market is full of vitality," Zhou told the China International Import Expo in Shanghai.
  <br>
  <br>
  “These achievements have also been fully recognised and highly praised by the international community.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Citing recent data on the city’s economy and competitiveness, Zhou added that Hong Kong is full of business opportunities and development potential.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also said Beijing would continue to work with different departments to roll out measures beneficial to the SAR, while supporting cooperation between the city and Shanghai.
  <br>
  <br>
  At the same event, Chief Executive John Lee said Hong Kong could become a financing platform for mainland enterprises. He said there are more than 2,000 mainland firms in the city with more than 1,400 listed on the city’s bourse.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Among them were nearly 200 Shanghai companies that had a market value of more than HK$2 trillion. This fully demonstrates that Hong Kong can become an investment and financing platform serving the development of Shanghai and mainland enterprises," Lee said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We welcome more Shanghai and mainland enterprises to use Hong Kong to go global and achieve mutual development."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee led a delegation that included Financial Secretary Paul Chan and commerce minister Algernon Yau to attend the seventh edition of the expo, where he toured the Hong Kong exhibition area and reported to Premier Li Qiang on the city's development.
  <br>
  <br>
  The finance chief, for his part, said Hong Kong is a prime treasury centre with a free flow of capital.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan added that the SAR could facilitate the allocation of funds for mainland firms that set up their headquarters in Hong Kong, while providing tax concessions.

<div class="itemFullText">
 RTHK has learnt that Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office director Xia Baolong will hold a seminar on Hong Kong’s development in Shenzhen on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Sources have suggested Chief Executive John Lee, the director of Beijing’s liaison office Zheng Yanxiong, representatives of Hong Kong’s chambers of commerce and some international firms will participate in the seminar.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last month, Xia met HSBC group chairman Mark Tucker, and expressed the hope that the bank could actively participate in the nation’s high-quality development, and contribute to Hong Kong’s prosperity and development.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xia also met Jardine Matheson’s executive chairman Ben Keswick last week and said he hopes the group could help boost the international community’s understanding of Hong Kong.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Tickets for the upcoming Hong Kong Rugby Sevens – the first to be held at the Kai Tak Stadium – went on sale on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The tournament, scheduled for March 28 to 30, will be among the first major sporting events held at the 50,000-seat stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  Organisers said three-day passes for the tournament – which took place at the Hong Kong Stadium for decades – are priced at HK$1,950 for adults, and HK$950 for children 12 and under.
  <br>
  <br>
  A small amount of single-day tickets are also available via online ticket-seller, Klook, priced at up to HK$1,200.
  <br>
  <br>
  Event organisers Hong Kong China Rugby said prices are frozen at 2019 levels and that a HK$750 pass will grant priority access to the new South Stand and cover a free flow of drinks.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[We hope] the opportunity to be at one of the first events at the stadium, as well as the increased stadium capacity of the venue, will draw thousands of new fans to experience Hong Kong’s biggest party in the city’s biggest stadium," organisers said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tickets for last year’s sevens were sold out for the first time since the end of the pandemic.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Federation of Hong Kong and Kowloon Labour Unions on Tuesday urged bosses to give their workers a raise of 5.5 percent next year.
 <br>
  <br>
  The group noted its recent survey of more than 1,100 workers showed that more than six out of ten interviewees got an average pay rise of 4.5 percent this year, while most of the rest saw their salaries frozen.
  <br>
  <br>
  Over half of all respondents said they were unhappy with the salary adjustment, and over 70 percent think their pay should be adjusted based on inflation, the group said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The federation’s chairman Lam Chun-sing said the group had scaled back its expectations compared to last year after looking at factors such as inflation, the business situation and economic growth.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We suggest a salary increase of 5.5 percent, which is a little bit lower than last year because last year we suggested an increase of six percent,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Because last year the inflation was much higher than this year and also this year some of the sectors also face some challenges because of the economic situation.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Lam noted while the transportation sector saw bigger salary increases, some employees in industries like construction and catering faced a salary freeze.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think this is because of the economic situation... Also for the construction industry, some private construction projects are also delayed.”

<div class="itemFullText">
 Deputy Financial Secretary Michael Wong on Tuesday said the airport’s three-runway system, which opens on November 28, will strengthen Hong Kong’s status as an aviation hub.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at the Super Terminal Expo, Wong said the Hong Kong International Airport would be able to handle 120 million passengers and 10 million tonnes of cargo annually after the launch of the third runway, more than double the current figures.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the airport currently connects the SAR with nearly 200 global destinations, and that he expects airlines to make use of the new runway to introduce new routes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It will make Hong Kong an even stronger aviation hub and allow us to serve the region and beyond even better. And for you as key stakeholders in the world's aviation and logistics communities, this means Hong Kong will provide you with a lot of business and profit opportunities," Wong said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[The authorities] will proactively engage new and existing aviation partners, and markets in Belt and Road countries, including those in the Middle East and Asean."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Airport Authority said it successfully conducted safety checks at the airport in the past few months.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Airport Authority continues to take forward the preparatory work for the commissioning of the three-runway system, including an aircraft crash and rescue exercise on the Centre Runway in the early hours of October 15," it wrote in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  It added that the airport’s expanded Terminal 2 will be put into service in phases from the end of 2025.

    Kowloon City court ramps up security

<div class="itemFullText">
 Security at Kowloon City court on Tuesday was ramped up a day after a man was arrested for allegedly attempting to attack a magistrate who had earlier convicted him.
 <br>
  <br>
  The judiciary said it will “progressively implement enhanced security measures”, such as bag screenings and deploying extra manpower.
  <br>
  <br>
  An RTHK reporter at the Kowloon City Magistrates' Courts saw security personnel asking people to open their bags for inspections outside courtrooms. People were asked to empty their water bottles and sharp objects were not allowed in.
  <br>
  <br>
  “If these items are discovered, we will call the police,” a notice displayed at the screening area read.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a courtroom mainly hearing criminal cases, roughly three security guards were present and about four police officers were in the dock.
  <br>
  <br>
  On floors without courtrooms, security checks were not required.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sources suggest Edward Wong was the magistrate who was allegedly targeted as court proceedings were underway on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The court diary on the judiciary’s website showed Wong was not presiding over any cases on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Unlike West Kowloon Magistrates’ Courts, where national security cases are heard, there are no walk-through metal detectors and people are not asked to empty their pockets at the Kowloon City courthouse.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, police have laid a holding charge against a man, 32, suspected of involvement in Monday's attack.
  <br>
  <br>
  The case will be mentioned at Kowloon City Magistracy on Wednesday morning.

    New prostate cancer therapy could save lives

<img alt="Doctor Kenneth Wong (right) said around one in two patients who receive the new treatment will see their tumour shrink or eliminated altogether.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 There may be fresh hope for prostate cancer patients who develop resistance to traditional forms of therapies, as oncologists say a new third-line treatment is showing promising results so far.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong Society of Uro-Oncology said the targeted radiotherapy treatment -- lutetium-177-PSMA-617 -- can boost cancer survival rates and improve patients' quality of life.
  <br>
  <br>
  Half of the patients also reported a reduction in tumour size, while others had cancer cells completely eradicated.
  <br>
  <br>
  The treatment is used when the patient no longer reacts to both hormonal therapy and chemotherapy, and presents symptoms such as difficulty in urinating, blood in urine, and even spinal cord pain.
  <br>
  <br>
  Clinical oncologist Kenneth Wong said the treatment is also associated with less side effects.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There are certainly some side effects associated with the use of this drug, including dry mouth, fatigue, nausea, anaemia and so on," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  But that was still better than traditional chemotherapy, Wong stressed, in which patients had to deal with suppressed bone marrow function and an increased risk of infection.
  <br>
  <br>
  The theranostic medicine is administered intravenously every six weeks, for up to six sessions. It locates cancer cells in the body and delivers targeted radiation to kill those cells.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong said patients are required to drink large amounts of water to purge the remnants of the drug which are not absorbed by the tumour.
  <br>
  <br>
  They should also avoid close contact with people for up to two weeks, especially children and pregnant women.
  <br>
  <br>
  Each injection costs HK$150,000 and public hospital patients have to pay out of their own pockets. Charity group St James' Settlement currently provides a subsidy of up to HK$30,000 for each treatment programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prostate cancer was the third most common cancer among men in Hong Kong in 2021. More than half of the patients were only diagnosed at an advanced stage.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Fanling Magistrates' Court on Monday sentenced a 23-year-old mainland student to three months in jail for using fake academic credentials to apply for a master's degree programme at a Hong Kong university.
 <br>
  <br>
  Police said the man had passed an online interview for the Health and Physical Education programme at Education University, and received a conditional offer.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was then asked to submit his qualifications, including an English proficiency test.
  <br>
  <br>
  Upon verification the institution realised the actual score attained by the applicant did not match his claim, and reported the case to police.
  <br>
  <br>
  The man pleaded guilty to a count of attempting to obtain services by deception.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police warned people against using bogus academic qualifications, saying it will adopt a zero-tolerance approach to maintain the reputation of Hong Kong's higher education.

 Education officials on Monday said the results of this year’s Territory-wide System Assessment (TSA), which tests students on the subjects of Chinese, English and maths, remained “generally steady”.
 <br>
  <br>
  Primary three students’ scores were all slightly down this year in all the subjects, with an 80.9 percent, 78.7 percent, and 85.3 percent proficiency in Chinese, English and maths respectively.
  <br>
  <br>
  Secondary three pupils did better in Chinese and maths this year, but their English proficiency was down from last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As compared to that of last year, the performance of the primary three and secondary three students participating in the assessment of the three major subjects of Chinese Language, English Language and mathematics this year remains generally steady," the Education Bureau said.
  <br>
  <br>
  It added that it will use different ways to help enhance learning and teaching effectiveness.

<img alt='Often inhaled through vapes, "space oil" usually contains etomidate, a regulated sedative that can only be prescribed by a doctor. File photo: AFP' src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1777506_1_20241104155333.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A pharmacist on Monday said regulations on short-acting anaesthetics were not strong enough to deter their recreational use.
 <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong has this year recorded at least three deaths caused by the suspected usage of “space oil”, according to the Toxicology Reference Laboratory of the Hong Kong Poison Control Centre.
  <br>
  <br>
  Often inhaled through vapes, “space oil” usually contains etomidate, a regulated sedative that is prescribed by a doctor. The anaesthetic is classified as a Part 1 poison.
  <br>
  <br>
  The president of the Society of Hospital Pharmacists of Hong Kong So Yiu-wah said the long-term use of etomidate could be deadly.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The drug will suppress the cortisol level inside our body. Once the cortisol is lowered, then our blood potassium will also be lowered, making muscles, especially the legs, seem very weak," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Because the potassium level is low, the heartbeat may become irregular. If those people already have some heart disease, it may be even fatal."
  <br>
  <br>
  He also said penalties for the illegal use of the drug are not stringent enough.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The penalty is high not enough, because for those people who violate the [regulation], the maximum penalty is a HK$100,000 [fine] and being kept in jail for two years,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government is seeking to list the sedative as a dangerous drug in the first half of 2025, according to security minister Chris Tang, who also said taking “space oil” would be equivalent to taking drugs.
  <br>
  <br>
  If etomidate is listed as a dangerous drug, those illegally possessing or consuming “space oil” containing the substance would face a maximum of seven years in prison and a fine of HK$1 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  And those trafficking or illegally importing the drug would be liable to a maximum penalty of life imprisonment and a fine of HK$5 million.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Monday arrested a man who allegedly attempted to attack a magistrate with a knife inside Kowloon City Magistrates’ Courts.
 <br>
  <br>
  The case took place shortly after 10am, when the court was in session.
  <br>
  <br>
  As proceedings were under way, the 32-year-old suspect allegedly emerged from the public gallery and charged towards the magistrate, while pulling out a knife from his bag.
  <br>
  <br>
  A police officer intervened quickly and the man never got to the magistrate.
  <br>
  <br>
  The man then tried to flee the scene but was subdued outside the courtroom. Three officers suffered minor injuries in the process.
  <br>
  <br>
  The suspect was later arrested on suspicion of attempted wounding.
  <br>
  <br>
  Superintendent Gar Kam-lam told reporters at a briefing that the man was carrying four knives of 27 to 46cm long, as well as flammable liquids and lighters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gar also confirmed the suspect was convicted of indecent assault in 2020, and was awaiting appeal.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He brought along documents and papers which suggested he was upset with the ruling," Gar said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sources suggest Edward Wong was the presiding magistrate for that case. The same magistrate was at the court this morning.
  <br>
  <br>
  There are currently no security checks at most of the city's Magistrates' Courts.
  <br>
  <br>
  The judiciary said it will "progressively implement enhanced security measures" from Tuesday, including screenings and extra manpower.
  <br>
  <br>
  It will also liaise with police on strengthening patrols and ensure the safety of judges, judicial officers, court staff and users.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Department of Justice strongly condemned the case, saying any threat to judicial officers’ personal safety cannot be tolerated.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Bar Association, for its part, also condemned the case "in the strongest possible terms".
  <br>
  <br>
  It said any threat or violent act made with the intent to frighten or pressure judicial officers, or retaliate against their decisions is a serious assault on judicial independence.

    Govt probing Tung Chung water outage

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Director of Water Supplies on Monday said officials are investigating what caused a pipe burst that resulted in a water outage in Tung Chung, and apologised to those affected.
 <br>
  <br>
  Tung Chung was cut off from fresh water for about 12 hours because urgent repairs on a 1.2 metre-diameter pipe were needed following an operational incident near the Siu Ho Wan Water Treatment Works.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities said they originally planned to turn the taps back on at 6am on Monday, but fresh water only returned to Tung Chung at 10am.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters, Roger Wong apologised to the 120,000 affected residents.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Because of the site constraints, and also because of the special failure mode of this incident, we take time to investigate and find out the leakage point,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The leakage point is also at the bottom of the pipe, so it is hard to carry out the repair works. That's why the progress of [repair] works has been slightly delayed."
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong added more time was needed to find out the exact cause and a report will be submitted to the Development Bureau.
  <br>
  <br>
  Built in the 1990s, the burst water pipe is the only one servicing the Tung Chung area.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's Exchange Fund recorded a record-breaking investment income of HK$224.7 billion for the first nine months of the year, the Monetary Authority (HKMA) revealed on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The fund posted gains of HK$114.6 billion in the third quarter alone, with the largest gain coming from bond investments, which contributed HK$66 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Investments in Hong Kong stocks posted gains for the second consecutive quarter, adding about HK$22 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gains from other stocks totalled HK$18 billion while the valuation of foreign exchange brought in HK$8 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  The figure for the first three quarters saw the investment income falling just HK$40 billion short of the total annual record of HK$264 billion in 2017.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters, the HKMA’s chief executive Eddie Yue said it is difficult to tell if this year’s annual figure will set a new record.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We’ve got two more months to go, and the financial market, even a week or month, is a very long period. During those two months, even within this week, we are seeing different developments that will have an impact on the market,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “For example, the pace of the US interest rate reduction is still unknown. The market is expecting that at the [Federal Open Market Committee] meeting this week, the Federal Reserve will continue with the reduction path, with a cut of let's say 25 basis points as expected by the market. But what the commentary will be, and how they will assess the forward path will have an impact on the market.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Yue also noted factors – such as whether China will announce more economic stimulus measures, as well as uncertainties arising from the geopolitical conditions – will influence the fund’s performance.

    SAR a hub for legal collaboration: justice chief

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong’s justice secretary on Monday said the SAR is well positioned to be a hub for legal and economic collaboration, with Beijing saying it will give its unwavering support to back the SAR in its role as a super-connector.
 <br>
  <br>
  At the opening of Hong Kong Legal Week, Secretary for Justice Paul Lam said the SAR serves as a gateway between China, the Asia-Pacific and the rest of the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Under the One Country, Two Systems principle, Hong Kong is the only common law jurisdiction within China. Our strong legal foundation, coupled with our close ties with and support from the mainland, position us as a critical hub for legal and economic collaboration across the region and beyond," Lam said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister also said efforts to set up a training academy for international legal talents are underway, with a ceremony set to take place on Friday to mark the new initiative.
  <br>
  <br>
  The academy – first outlined in last year’s Policy Address – will regularly organise training courses, seminars and international exchange programmes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Also speaking at the event, Commissioner of the Foreign Ministry’s Office in Hong Kong Cui Jianchun, said the central government’s unwavering commitment to the One Country, Two Systems principle is the strongest foundation for the territory’s development.
  <br>
  <br>
  He called on the SAR to continue to boost its unique role as a super-connector to facilitate trade and investment between Chinese and foreign enterprises.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another role that the territory could play, Cui noted, would be uniting diverse market participants and expanding international connections.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We believe Hong Kong's uniqueness not only serves and links the mainland with the international community, [but also] we believe here, the common law, the unique law system, can pave the way for the development of the international community."
  <br>
  <br>
  The commissioner added the SAR could act as a bridge for multicultural interactions, facilitating legal assistance and cooperation, as well as the exchange of legal experience.

Photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1777463_1_20241104104544.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Authorities on Monday said that water supply to Tung Chung was restored shortly after 10am, after the area was cut off from fresh water for about 12 hours due to urgent overnight repairs.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Water Supplies Department had originally planned to restore the supply of water at 6am but was forced to delay it several times.
  <br>
  <br>
  Islands District Councillor Lau Chin-pang told RTHK the arrangements were unsatisfactory.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I think the delay is not good for our residents because 7am to 8am is the most important time for the students and for the workers. So I don't think it's a suitable case. I think they can improve,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Huizaifa, a food delivery worker who lives in Yat Tung Estate in Tung Chung, was one of the affected residents.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Now I go to work [but there was] just a little water only [for] face wash… I feel very bad because when I came home, no water and when I go toilet no [water]” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a wet market, an angry congee shop owner surnamed Fu said no water meant no business.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Of course the water outage has a huge impact, affecting the whole world. It makes things very inconvenient. Everything needs water. Even if you want to eat, there’s nothing to eat. So there’s no business,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The department said earlier that it ordered water trucks and water tanks to the area to provide a temporary supply of fresh water to residents and businesses.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said the repairs for the 1,200-millimetre-diameter fresh-water pipe were needed following an operational incident near the Siu Ho Wan Water Treatment Works.
  <br>
  <br>
  A department document said the works is a key facility to supply water to Tung Chung, Hong Kong International Airport, Tai Ho, and Discovery Bay.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Urgent repair work is taking place on a pipe that provides fresh water to Tung Chung, after water supplies were suspended to the area at 10pm on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Water Supplies Department says water supply to the area will gradually resume on Monday morning.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, the department said the repairs were needed to a 1,200-millimetre-diameter fresh-water pipe following an operational incident near the Siu Ho Wan Water Treatment Works.
  <br>
  <br>
  A department document said the works is a key facility to supply water to Tung Chung, Hong Kong International Airport, Tai Ho and Discovery Bay.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials have cordoned off part of Cheung Tung Road to make the repairs.
  <br>
  <br>
  The department said it has ordered water trucks and water tanks to the area to provide a temporary supply of fresh water to residents and businesses.
  <br>
  <br>
  It added that it has contacted the Tung Chung district councillor and care team to offer support to people affected.
  <br>
  <br>
  One Tung Chung resident surnamed Cheung was heading to the market to buy water. He said he had to rush back home to take a shower before the suspension.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The water suspension is annoying. I will go to bed earlier. I need to work tomorrow. I have asked my younger sister to boil some water so we have water to drink," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hospital Authority has said the operation of North Lantau Hospital in Tung Chung will not be affected.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Two people on Sunday were hospitalised, and nine others were injured following accidents at the Sha Tin Cycling Festival, with riders reporting that the path was uneven.
 <br>
  <br>
  More than 700 people took part in the inaugural event with 11 races held along the Shing Mun River.
  <br>
  <br>
  The accidents took place in the youth and elite group competitions, involving nine male and two female riders. Most suffered minor injuries, while two needed hospital treatment.
  <br>
  <br>
  In one of the accidents, a cyclist lost control and crashed into a first aid station, causing other bikers to fall as well, while video footage showed a cyclist in a neck brace.
  <br>
  <br>
  KT Ng from race organisers Hong Kong Flash Exchange Association said there was not enough time to tidy up.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There are cars that usually drive on this path on a daily basis. I could see some uneven areas on the road before the race. I contacted the Highways Department during the week to pave the road," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The road was closed at four in the morning and races started at 6.30am. There wasn't enough time, so some things might have been overlooked during the clean-up."
  <br>
  <br>
  Retired cyclist and event ambassador, Wong Kam-po, said the roads met specifications.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It will be better with more experience, because most of the accidents were caused by collisions. Some cyclists might not have good control when it comes to maintaining their position," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They also might not have sufficient experience or it could be nerves."
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong added that he hopes to see more competitions take place in Hong Kong.

    Labour chief: top talent scheme vital for HK

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Welfare and Labour Chris Sun on Sunday said it is vital for Hong Kong to attract well-qualified talents from outside its borders, in view of a shortage of local graduates.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on an RTHK programme, the minister noted there are currently about 50,000 local graduates each year, much lower than when he graduated decades ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sun said that the combination of lower graduate numbers and there being many more career paths than before has left Hong Kong short on talent.
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted that the Top Talent Pass Scheme – where applicants are not required to have a job offer before applying for a visa – shows that the government is being more flexible in importing skilled workers.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Over the years, Hong Kong has been attractive to talent, but the actual number of people coming here is quite low because our vetting process has been pretty strict. However, as the economy tries to return to normal after the pandemic and with fewer young people around, we really need more highly qualified talent. So, what can we do? That’s when I thought of asking for specific qualification requirements, leading to the Top Talent Pass Scheme,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Currently, there’s no annual quota, with tens of thousands of people arriving in the city through the scheme.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister added he is not concerned that bringing in too many people might potentially harm the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I believe Hong Kong is an expensive place to live, and it’s tough to make a living. If someone can thrive here, they’re definitely talented. If they can’t make it, they’ll simply leave. It’s a natural process of elimination. While talent chooses Hong Kong, we also choose them,” Sun said.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The health chief Lo Chung-mau on Sunday said the government is working on its review of the SAR's healthcare system.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lo's comments came after the Chief Executive said the government will reform the functions and divisions of work at the Hospital Authority, Department of Health and the newly-established Primary Healthcare Commission.
  <br>
  <br>
  On a TVB programme, Lo explained how the healthcare system could be rearranged.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For example, chest and dermatological services have been provided by the Department of Health. But we would like to redistribute these services to either the Hospital Authority or the Primary Healthcare Commission," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Department of Health, meanwhile, will focus on disease prevention and control, health promotion and take on a monitoring role."
  <br>
  <br>
  The health chief also urged those with chronic or episodic illnesses, such as the flu, not to immediately seek help from the Hospital Authority.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lo said they should first consult their family doctor, and offered assurances that the government would still take care of the underprivileged.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For those who cannot afford this, such as people on low incomes and who are receiving the comprehensive social security assistance, the government will be responsible for them. We will take care of them at the general out-patient clinics."

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Sunday said that Hong Kong's deepening cooperation with the Middle East can go beyond finance, innovation and technology, and investment.
 <br>
  <br>
  Writing in his blog, Chan said the SAR can also promote more people-to-people and cultural exchanges, and mutual learning between China and the Middle East.
  <br>
  <br>
  "During meetings and exchanges, many Middle Eastern investment institutions said that Hong Kong is international, diverse, and can respect different cultural values, allowing both parties to deepen cooperation on the basis of mutual respect and mutual benefit," he wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  "To them, Hong Kong's role as a 'super connector' not only connects the mainland with European, American and Middle Eastern markets, but can also be extended to connecting emerging markets with different backgrounds and cultures."
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister also said his visit to Riyadh the past week was fruitful and that a series of projects were being facilitated as a result, proving that “Brand Hong Kong” not only has unique value, but also great development potential.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan also said he is in talks with the Saudi Arabia’s Future Investment Initiative to host its second summit in the SAR next year.

 Hong Kong’s sole delegate to the nation’s top legislature, Starry Lee, on Sunday said she hopes to promote the SAR as a talent hub at the upcoming National People’s Congress Standing Committee meeting in Beijing.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lee said the top legislative body will at the meeting review several bills and reports, including on developing world-class universities on the mainland.
  <br>
  <br>
  She expressed the hope that these institutions will boost cooperation with universities in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I want to hear about what policies there will be in terms of the cooperation between the mainland’s ‘double first-class universities’ and Hong Kong’s universities. These are important for building Hong Kong into an international hub for top talents,” Lee told reporters at the airport.
  <br>
  <br>
  The five-day NPC session will be held from Monday to Friday.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong Disneyland on Sunday wrapped up its weekend running event, with a record number of people attending.
 <br>
  <br>
  Nearly 20,000 people – including children and those with visual, hearing and physical disabilities – signed up for the event, a record for the Hong Kong Disneyland 10K Weekend 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  Financial Secretary Paul Chan, one of the guests of honour, said it was the first time runners could jog through World of Frozen, the world’s first and largest attraction themed on the popular Disney franchise. Chan said this shows that the SAR is full of attractions.
  <br>
  <br>
  “This event shows that as long as we use our brains to think of new ideas we can draw more people to Hong Kong because there are so many attractive places here,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “There are so many people from the mainland and other places in the world. We welcome you.”
  <br>
  <br>
  One runner, dressed as Queen Anna from Frozen, travelled with her family from Thailand. She said she visits the SAR a lot and loves the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong, first of all, is close and another thing is like we enjoy local food very much. We like to taste food and all the culture and this trip I plan to take them on the tram to see all the scenery of Hong Kong," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I love it very much. The mountain, the ocean and the city is all so good."
  <br>
  <br>
  Another participant, who is visually impaired, said he completed his first 10-kilometre race in about 70 minutes and that racing through the theme park was a whole new experience.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The race in Disneyland is so different from other races. They play music in these races, while most races don't," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think music is a form of motivation, and Disney music sounds really good. When they play it while you are running, it is like an adrenaline rush."

 Police have arrested a 36-year-old man on suspicion of assaulting a police officer and robbery, after an off-duty sergeant was attacked and had his wallet snatched in Jordan.
 <br>
  <br>
  The incident happened in the small hours of Saturday on Nathan Road near Wing On Plus department store.
  <br>
  <br>
  Senior Inspector So Man-ho said the victim got into a scuffle with the suspect after realising his wallet had been stolen.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The victim identified himself as a police officer, but the man attacked his neck and limbs multiple times with a sharp object. The victim tried several times to stop the assault but failed," So said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Another passerby attempted to intervene, and filmed the incident with his phone. The attacker fled empty-handed,” he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The sergeant was treated at Queen Elizabeth Hospital and was discharged on the same day.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officers on Saturday arrested the attacker, who is a foreign man on a temporary entry permit, at his home in Hung Hom.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police have arrested eight men reportedly with a triad background after a prison officer was attacked outside Pik Uk prison in Sai Kung on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  According to the police, three masked men equipped with "long hard objects" attacked the corrections officer when he was waiting for a bus near the prison at about 12:50pm.
  <br>
  <br>
  The trio, aged 16 to 37, then got in a private car with a fake licence plate and fled the scene.
  <br>
  <br>
  Superintendent Lam Kai-chor said while they are still investigating a motive for the attack and whether it's related to the victim's job, no evidence showed correlation to the victim's financial situation or personal life.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There are a total of six cuts that are five to 10 centimetres long on the victim's head and upper limbs, and a fracture on his right wrist. The victim is now stable and remains in hospital for treatment," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Also, during the chaos, the three men hit a 33-year-old woman and her two-year-old daughter. They sustained minor injuries and left the hospital after treatment without any issues."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lam did not rule out the possibility of further arrests.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A country park near the border with Shenzhen is key to ecological conservation and revitalisation, according to the Environment minister Tse Chin-wan.
 <br>
  <br>
  Located in Sha Tau Kok, the 530-hectare Robin's Nest Country Park was once a prime mining site.
  <br>
  <br>
  The area, which was established this year as the 25th country park in Hong Kong, also supports one of the most important bat colonies in the territory.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department is gradually constructing recreational facilities, such as hiking trail networks and viewing points in Robin's Nest Country Park," Tse said at the park's opening ceremony on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It also expects to complete the revitalisation of the Lin Ma Hang Lead Mine by the end of the year and open it to the public, allowing people to deepen their understanding of Hong Kong's mining history, and bat ecology there."
  <br>
  <br>
  Robin's Nest is connected to Shenzhen Wutong Mountain, forming a cross-border ecological corridor between the SAR and neighbouring Shenzhen. The park is rich in biodiversity with many species of high conservation value.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The immigration chief has revealed that he personally reached out to snooker superstar Ronnie O'Sullivan, recommending a suitable visa scheme for the Briton to come to Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 48-year-old, known as "the Rocket" for his fast and attacking playing style, recently became a Hong Kong resident through the Quality Migrant Admission Scheme, saying the territory is a great place to live because of the food, culture and a low tax regime.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a televised interview on Saturday, Director of Immigration Benson Kwok revealed he found out from a friend that O'Sullivan had interest to develop his career in the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As the director of immigration, of course, I have to recommend some visa schemes that are suitable for him. He quickly chose the Quality Migrant Admission Scheme, and his application was approved by the committee on quality migrants and professionals," Kwok said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The result was ideal because O'Sullivan has been helpful, promoting Hong Kong's attractiveness."
  <br>
  <br>
  Labour and welfare minister Chris Sun, for his part, said the snooker player's decision to obtain Hong Kong residency was a testament to the city's attractiveness.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The fact that O'Sullivan has decided to come to Hong Kong and become a part of us speaks volumes about the attraction of the SAR," Sun said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We hope to achieve more success, because we truly believe in the attraction of Hong Kong. Be it our tax system, our natural beauty, the convenience, the great food and all the great things here in Hong Kong, it's a huge attraction for top talent all over the world."

<img alt="Michael Tien says more attractions like Disneyland and Kai Tak Sports Park can generate revenue perpetually for the local economy. Photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1777306_1_20241102114122.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A lawmaker has highlighted the need for Hong Kong to have more large-scale, staple infrastructure in order to deepen and broaden its tourist base.
 <br>
  <br>
  Michael Tien made the remarks on Saturday on a Commercial Radio Programme, where he pointed out that even though tourism has only contributed less than 10 percent to the local GDP, it's crucial to other sectors, like retail and the food and beverage industry.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tien emphasised that, rather than relying on mainland visitors, the territory can set up more permanent attractions like Disneyland and Kai Tak to draw more visitors from around the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kai Tak - the largest sports park in Hong Kong with 50,000 seats - is set to open its doors next March, and will host British rock band Coldplay a month later.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Kai Tak so far, and Disneyland are about the only two continuous attractions we have to attract people from overseas to come to Hong Kong to spend, to consume, and we need a few more of this," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I've been advocating for a race track with reclamation at Penny's Bay. That could be a third long-term tourist infrastructure...the beauty about Disneyland and Kai Tak is that they're perpetual - they can generate new economic activity, day after day."
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, Tien, who's also a businessman, called on the government to offer two years of rates concessions to ease the burden on tenants.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said many are paying "astronomical rents" for agreements that were signed at a time when tourist traffic was much higher.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are now currently paying rental to support actually a much larger consumer base, dating back to 2017 and 2018, when a lot of mainlanders were coming down to Hong Kong to spend money, so we lost about 30 percent on that consumer base," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Therefore, based on a free market economy, the rents are going to come down. So we need breathing space of about two years to have new tenancy to be in effect. So this is the two-year relief that I am asking the government to help us on."

<div class="itemFullText">
 Labour and welfare chief Chris Sun has assured there is a strict system to screen people applying to enter Hong Kong under the top talent scheme.
 <br>
  <br>
  He said on Saturday that officials have not found anyone providing fake credentials, following earlier reports of people allegedly forging documents to cheat their way into a local university.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have built in a very, very robust system to make sure that all the qualifications submitted to us are true, and can be verified," Sun told reporters after a radio programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For submissions, say, from mainland China, it's a mandatory requirement. They have to verify via a third-party system, or they have to verify directly with the institution granting them the qualifications."
  <br>
  <br>
  The administration had said visa holders under the scheme will be given an extra two months to apply for an extension.
  <br>
  <br>
  Extension approvals will be granted based on various factors, including the person's income, tax payments and time spent in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  The labour minister pointed out that officials do not currently have an estimate on how many individuals would have their visas extended.

 Drivers will have to provide a verified Hong Kong mobile number or email address when applying for or renewing their licence from November 18, the Transport Department announced on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The requirement will enable the police to start issuing any fixed penalty notices by digital means – a move which is set to begin in the first half of next year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I don't think there is much difficulty because nowadays people get used to technology a lot. What we are changing is only from a paper ticket to an electronic form. All the information is provided in that SMS or email," police superintendent Nip Hoi-kwan said at a press conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nip added that he thinks the digitalisation will cut the time officers spend on paperwork for a penalty notice, from around 30 minutes to 15.
  <br>
  <br>
  Helen Lee, a principal executive officer with the Transport Department, said measures are in place to ensure the security of the information collected.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Transport Department adopts the government cloud infrastructure services, which provide a very reliable and secure infrastructure for the Transport Department to collect and keep the personal data collected through the verification platform," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Moreover, the data collected will be transferred to our central system immediately, so we will not keep any data in the platform."

<div class="itemFullText">
 Retail sales were down 6.9 percent in September compared to the same month last year, marking the seventh consecutive month of year-on-year declines.
 <br>
  <br>
  Official data released on Friday showed that the total value of retail sales came in at HK$29.6 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  The drop followed a revised 10 percent fall in August and an 11.7 percent decrease in July.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sales of motor vehicles and parts saw the most dramatic fall, with a 26.7 percent drop.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials said a change in consumer patterns will continue to affect the retail sector in the near future.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Nevertheless, an improved outlook for the mainland economy following the recent introduction of a wide range of stimulus measures, and a possible easing of the Hong Kong dollar alongside the US dollar with the commencement of the US interest rate cut, would be conducive to boosting sentiment and supporting spending," a government spokesman said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the executive director of the Retail Management Association, Bond Law, said the sector is pessimistic about sales for the rest of the year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's anticipated that many local people will travel abroad during the Christmas period, and certain domestic-related retail categories are expected to see a decline in business," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Due to the absence of Christmas holidays on the mainland, the tourist-related retail categories, such as watches and jewellery, are also expected to perform worse than last year."
