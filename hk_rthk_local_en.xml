<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Wednesday said he was encouraged by remarks about Hong Kong in Premier Li Qiang's work report.
 <br>
  <br>
  Addressing delegates at the Great Hall of the People, Li said Beijing will continue to fully implement the One Country, Two Systems policy and ensure Hong Kong and Macau are administered by patriots.
  <br>
  <br>
  The premier also said the central government supports the two SARs in improving their economies and the livelihoods of the people.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee, who attended the opening of the National People's Congress in the capital, said the SAR will continue to unswervingly implement One Country, Two Systems.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a Facebook post, he also said 2025 marks an important year for reforms.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This year marks the final year of the 14th Five-Year Plan, the beginning of the 15th Five-Year Plan formulation, and an important year for further comprehensive deepening of reforms, which has significant meaning for the practice of One Country, Two Systems," he wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CE said he will continue to advance the Northern Metropolis development and innovation initiatives, and strengthen Hong Kong's position as an international financial hub.

 Premier Li Qiang on Wednesday said Beijing would continue to fully implement the One Country, Two Systems policy and have the two SARs administered by patriots.
 <br>
  <br>
  Delivering his annual work report at the Great Hall of the People, Li said the central government supports Hong Kong and Macau in improving their economies and livelihoods of the people.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will support Hong Kong and Macau in growing their economies, improving the lives of their people, and deepening international exchanges and cooperation," the report said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will ensure that Hong Kong and Macau better integrate themselves into China's overall development and maintain long-term prosperity and stability."
  <br>
  <br>
  On Taiwan, Li said China resolutely opposes "Taiwan independence" and external interference, to promote the peaceful development of cross-strait relations.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will improve institutions and policies for promoting economic and cultural exchanges and cooperation across the Taiwan Strait and advance integrated cross-strait development to improve the well-being of Chinese people on both sides," the report said, adding that China will firmly advance the cause of reunification.
  <br>
  <br>
  The premier also said that Beijing is ready to work with the international world to promote a community with a shared future for mankind.

    CK Hutchison to sell Panama unit after Trump pressure

<img alt="The sale to a BlackRock consortium will deliver cash proceeds in excess of US$19 billion to Hong Kong's CK Hutchison. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1794251_1_20250305042524.jpg&q=25">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's CK Hutchison on Tuesday agreed to sell its interests in a key Panama Canal port operator to a BlackRock Inc-backed consortium, following intense pressure from US President Donald Trump.
 <br>
  <br>
  The US$22.8 billion sale, which also includes dozens of ports in other countries, appeared to be a win for Trump's aggressive diplomacy just hours before he is due to tout the successes of the first six tumultuous weeks of his second term in an address to the US Congress. Trump had refused to rule out military action to assert US control over the canal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has complained about the presence of mainland Chinese and Hong Kong-based companies in Panama, while US officials and politicians have said CK Hutchison's control of ports at both entrances of the canal represents a security risk for the operation.
  <br>
  <br>
  The sale of licenses will result in the consortium gaining a 90 percent stake in Panama Ports Company, which has been the operator of the Balboa and Cristobal ports in the Central American country for more than two decades, CK Hutchison said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  BlackRock has briefed the White House and Congressional leadership on the deal, a person familiar with the transaction said.
  <br>
  <br>
  This would be BlackRock's largest infrastructure investment to date, that person said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US State Department, White House, National Security Council and Panama's government did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
  <br>
  <br>
  The canal is operated by the Panama Canal Authority, an autonomous agency overseen by the Panamanian government.
  <br>
  <br>
  Panama's authorities have announced an audit of CK Hutchison's contract, saying they are investigating its compliance with concession agreements. Panama's attorney general determined earlier this month that CK Hutchison's port contract was "unconstitutional." The Supreme Court was to have had the last word on its legal status.
  <br>
  <br>
  US Secretary of State Marco Rubio made his first overseas trip as top US diplomat to Latin America last month, including to Panama, where he pressured the country over China's presence along the canal. After his departure, Rubio hailed Panama's decision to exit China's Belt and Road infrastructure plan, and he has expressed optimism in media interviews that Hutchison would not own the ports in the future.
  <br>
  <br>
  The sale of Panama ports licenses held by the unit of billionaire Li Ka-shing's conglomerate to a consortium that includes BlackRock, Global Infrastructure Partners and Terminal Investment will give it control of an 80 percent interest in Hutchison Ports for an equity value of US$14.21 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  It will get control of 43 ports comprising 199 berths in 23 countries while delivering cash proceeds in excess of US$19 billion for the Hong Kong-based consortium.
  <br>
  <br>
  The sale does not involve any interest in Hutchison Port Holdings Trust, which operates ports in Hong Kong and Shenzhen, as well as South China, or any other ports in mainland China, CK Hutchison said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The consortium has agreed that negotiations will be on an exclusive basis for a period of 145 days, the company said.
  <br>
  <br>
  BlackRock completed the acquisition of Global Infrastructure Partners for approximately US$12.5 billion in cash and stock last October. At the time, chairman and CEO Larry Fink described infrastructure as “a generational investment opportunity.” (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 World number one Judd Trump made a winning start in Hong Kong, beating Gary Wilson to advance to the last 16 of the World Snooker Grand Prix at Kai Tak Arena.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump, who recently obtained Hong Kong residency through the Quality Migrant Admission Scheme, was playing on home soil for the first time.
  <br>
  <br>
  But it was fellow Englishman Wilson who started off strong and took the first frame. Trump struck back with a 142 break to level things up, before going on to win the best-of-seven match 4-2.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 35-year-old will next face another Englishman Jack Lisowski.
  <br>
  <br>
  In other first-round action, English stars Shaun Murphy and David Gilbert both secured narrow 4-3 victories to reach the last 16.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism, Rosanna Law, was in attendance and officiated at the opening ceremony.
  <br>
  <br>
  She hoped the ranking tournament will be a huge success and hoped that players and visitors would have an unforgettable experience.
  <br>
  <br>
  This six-day event marks the first official sports competition at the Kai Tak Sports Park, with over 4,200 people attending on the first day.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A Beijing official overseeing Hong Kong and Macau affairs has told delegates to the national legislative body to ride on the stock market boom and boost economic development in the territory.
 <br>
  <br>
  Xia Baolong, the director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, also expressed confidence that the city can "weather the storm" in face of challenges posed by geopolitics.
  <br>
  <br>
  He made the comments on Tuesday during a closed-door exchange with National People's Congress (NPC) delegates from the two SARs.
  <br>
  <br>
  The city's sole delegate to the NPC Standing Committee, Starry Lee, said the central government highly recognised the work of the Hong Kong administration on supporting the economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said the city's economy has been relatively stable, and achieved moderate growth of 2.5 percent last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We all understand that Hong Kong’s economy is relatively stable … especially the stock market, the volume [went up]. All these [were contributed by] the support of the central government," she told reporters after the meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the coming future, we will continue as NPC (members) to act as (contributors) to the economic development, and to improve the livelihood of Hong Kong people."
  <br>
  <br>
  NPC delegate Ma Fung-kwok said the director singled out the city's stock market as an area of focus.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[Xia] did mention the stock market rally in recent months. He said if this trend continues, it will certainly boost Hong Kong's economy," Ma said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked if geopolitics had been part of the conversation, the delegates quoted Xia as saying that some of the pressure faced by the country would "inevitably pass down to Hong Kong", but such challenges could be overcome.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, the office said Xia expressed the hope for the delegates to perform their duties "with a sense of responsibility and mission" and reflect public opinion.
  <br>
  <br>
  The statement went on to say the director told the members to fully support their respective SAR governments.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xia urged Hong Kong delegates to expedite the city's transition from stability to prosperity, and those from Macau to promote moderate economic diversification, the statement added.

<img alt="Woo Chia-wai was credited for setting up the world-class HKUST Business School during his tenure. Photo courtesy: HKUST" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1794219_1_20250304203731.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The founding president of the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) has died last Sunday at the age of 87.
 <br>
  <br>
  Professor Woo Chia-wei led the university between 1991 and 2001.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement on Tuesday, HKUST council chairman Harry Shum said Woo's departure marked an irreplaceable loss to the university, Hong Kong and the global academic community.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Professor Woo was one of the few individuals with both grand visions and strong capability of execution. With unwavering dedication, he led the establishment of HKUST, transforming a bold vision into a world-class institution renowned for its pioneering research, innovation, and global impact, especially during a time when Hong Kong was in a critical juncture of transitioning to a knowledge-based economy,” he said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Current HKUST president, Nancy Ip, who worked alongside Woo for eight years when he was in charge, was also saddened by the news.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A man of extraordinary foresight, Professor Woo envisioned and empowered HKUST as a catalyst for Hong Kong's transformation. He forged a culture of excellence, recruiting distinguished faculty, designing cutting-edge curricula, and fostering partnerships with leading global institutions," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Woo’s son, Wu Dekai, expressed gratitude to the love and support his family has received during a difficult time. Also a professor at HKUST's Department of Computer Science and Engineering, he strived to carry forward his father's innovation, determination and can-do spirit.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other than his role in the university, the elder Woo also held positions in several government committees, and was appointed a member of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference in 1998.
  <br>
  <br>
  The physicist had also earned the Gold Bauhinia Star and Commander of the British Empire.

 The chairman of a leading casino and hospitality group in Macau said on Tuesday that Hong Kong and Macau should work together to attract more foreign investors.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on the sidelines of the Two Sessions in Beijing, Galaxy Entertainment Group chairman Francis Lui said Macau’s leisure industry has been developing steadily in recent years.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said he has full confidence in the industry’s future development, adding that the two SARs can work together to take business to a new level.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Hong Kong and Macau, we have a common objective in making sure that there will be more foreign players, customers and investors coming over,” he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I think we should cooperate with each other, making sure that all the hardware, all the services and all the resources behind Hong Kong and Macau could be working together to make sure that we bring in foreign investors.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Lui, a member of the National Committee of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference, said Hong Kong’s economic development is an issue for delegates.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said he hopes the central government will introduce measures during the Two Sessions that will help revitalise the city’s economy.

 <br>
  <br>
  Addressing 2,000 or so delegates -- as well as President Xi Jinping and other state leaders -- at the Great Hall of the People, Wang Huning also used his work report to note areas for improvement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We need to improve the CPPCC consultation systems and mechanisms, and the mechanisms for adopting, implementing, and providing feedback on consultation outcomes," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We need to expand the coverage of channels and platforms for bolstering unity and friendship, intensify implementation of measures in consultative oversight, and give full play to the unique role of different sectors. Going forward, we will take solid steps to make improvements in these aspects."
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang also recapped the party's achievements in the past year, saying the main economic and social development targets were accomplished, while major strides were made in the country's modernisation drive.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Hong Kong and Macau, the chairman said a system was implemented to facilitate visits by their delegates, as well as young people from the two SARs.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We continued to arrange inspection tours aimed at deepening exchanges and cooperation between the mainland and Hong Kong and Macau, and supported the organisation of report sessions to update young people in Hong Kong and Macau on national conditions as a form of campus outreach," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Last year, National Committee members held 75 report sessions in the two regions."
  <br>
  <br>
  Wrapping up his half-hour speech, Wang declared the further deepening of reform as both a "formidable task and a glorious mission", and urged everyone to forge ahead with firm confidence and collective strength.

    Octopus to speed up work for changing HK$2 scheme

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The firm which operates the Octopus Card on Tuesday said it hopes to shorten the process needed to implement the government's plans to scale back the HK$2 elderly transport subsidy scheme.
 <br>
  <br>
  In the budget last week, the government proposed limiting the HK$2 subsidised trips to 240 a month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elderly passengers would also have to pay 20 percent of future trips that cost more than HK$10.
  <br>
  <br>
  Labour minister Chris Sun said last week it would take around 18 months to adjust each and every Octopus machine to adopt the changes.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a media gathering, Octopus chairwoman Jeny Yeung said it would take time to implement the scheme because different transport operators have different discounts and fare calculation methods.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said it should take the company at least a year to discuss these issues with them to adjust the system, as well as conduct trials.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeung said Octopus would seek to finish the work in less than 18 months.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said the firm wants to introduce a new function in the second half of the year that would allow users who installed the Octopus mobile app to send money to another app user, or an actual card.
  <br>
  <br>
  Such payments would require entering the card details of the other user.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeung added the firm is trying to extend its services to Japan in the third quarter of this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said the idea is that transactions would go through the Octopus mobile app, as the firm is discussing cooperation plans with platforms that have wider coverage in the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the past year or so, the firm extended services to mainland China and Thailand.

    HK govt still in the dark over new US tariffs
   </title>

<img alt="" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1794132_1_20250304123411.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Commerce Secretary Algernon Yau on Tuesday said the SAR government still doesn't know whether new US tariffs on Chinese goods will also cover Hong Kong products, but in any case transit trade could be hit in the short term.
 <br>
  <br>
  An additional 10 percent duty on Chinese exports to the US is expected to come into force on Tuesday, following the extra 10 percent imposed by US President Donald Trump last month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Washington earlier clarified that the first tariffs move did apply to Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  On an RTHK radio programme, Yau reiterated the government's opposition to Trump's decision.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In fact, Hong Kong is a separate customs territory and the executive order is said to add duties on Chinese goods. But previous documents from the US Department of Homeland Security and the Customs and Border Protection have included Hong Kong goods as well. We have already announced that we'll file a complaint with the World Trade Organisation," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This time the US added another 10 percent levy on Chinese products. But it's very unclear; they did not say whether Hong Kong was included in the new tariffs. So we are studying whether they included Hong Kong this time."
  <br>
  <br>
  Yau said transit trade could be affected, but the tariffs won't have a significant impact as Hong Kong's exports to the US account for less than 0.1 percent of the city's overall exports globally.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, the commerce chief said there have been significant improvements in the city's trade of liquor, after tax on some spirits was reduced last October.
  <br>
  <br>
  The duty on liquor with an alcohol content above 30 percent and with an import price of over HK$200 was cut from 100 percent to 10 percent for the portion above HK$200.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yau said trading volumes of liquor increased by 60 percent from October to the end of January, while the value of the liquor traded rose by 150 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The momentum has been quite good in recent months. The reason we reduced the duties on premium liquor was that we wanted to develop Hong Kong into a trading centre for premium liquor. This would then have a knock-on effect to the catering, hospitality, logistics, and warehouse sectors, it could bring significant economic impacts," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We also hope to help Chinese baijiu to go global using the SAR as a trading centre. So we hope to boost trades on liquor, but not that we are encouraging people to consume more alcohol," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the minister encouraged SAR businesses to tap into opportunities brought by the rising e-commerce trend globally, noting that the sector accounts for some 20 percent of global trade, with revenues in this market rising by double digits on a yearly basis.
  <br>
  <br>
  A second edition of the "Hong Kong Shopping Festival" will be held in the SAR in August to further capture the booming e-commerce business, Yau said, adding that authorities also hope to take the festival to Asean member states to promote Hong Kong products.

    Facial recognition mulled after alleged Kai Tak breach

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Facial recognition technology could be deployed at Kai Tak Sports Park and other venues to stop people sneaking in without permission, Culture, Sports and Tourism Secretary Rosanna Law said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Her comment follows a report by Wen Wei Po on Monday that two reporters managed to attend the park's opening ceremony last weekend despite not having tickets. The newspaper said the pair, and a man that helped them get inside, also managed to avoid security checks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Law said police are investigating the alleged breach, but such a lapse wouldn't demonstrate any "large-scale loophole" in security measures.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said there might be a need to use technology to stop people such as backstage staff from getting non-ticket holders into venues.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The authorities need to check whether the person entering a place is the actual pass-holder. Say if you own the pass but you gave it to me, I shouldn't be allowed in," the minister said on an RTHK programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Whether we can adopt real-name registration here, or, as some people suggested, use facial recognition, we can discuss these things with event organisers."
  <br>
  <br>
  Law also said officials are hoping to bring non-local football teams to play at the sports park in the summer.
  <br>
  <br>
  She added that the staging of the National Games in Hong Kong, Guangdong and Macau this November will provide a litmus test regarding the possibility of the region holding other major tournaments in the future.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If we host the Games well, that would prove that the Greater Bay Area city cluster is very much capable of hosting major sporting tournaments. Would this be the Olympics, or, I've also heard others say, perhaps the Asian Games?" she said.

    'No major policy shifts at Two Sessions expected'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A local economics academic said he does not expect major policy shifts in the "Two Sessions" meetings in Beijing, saying it's important for the central government to focus on stabilising sentiment and continuing with high-quality growth.
 <br>
  <br>
  Delegates from the SAR and around the country are in Beijing for the opening of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference on Tuesday and the National People's Congress a day later, during which Beijing will announce its economic growth target for 2025.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho Lok-sang, an adjunct research professor from Lingnan University, said he expects mainland authorities to set a target of five percent, similar to last year's.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm pretty sure that the most likely target would be five percent, which is in my mind certainly within reach," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho highlighted the need for the world's second-largest economy to pursue high-quality growth.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's possible for China to achieve five percent, but there's no need to raise the target to suggest that they're very keen in pushing up economic growth. Five percent, I think, is a target that will produce the effect of giving confidence, and at the same time showing continuity."
  <br>
  <br>
  The academic believes under President Xi Jinping's leadership, the priorities this year include spurring domestic spending, boosting confidence and attracting more foreign investment.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's important to stimulate consumption. Internal consumption is something that's within the government's control, but external factors are difficult to tell... Continuing to open up is a main responsibility that President Xi has considered to be a priority, continuing to give the impression that we are really opening up, and all countries from Europe, North America, anywhere, are welcome to China."
  <br>
  <br>
  This year marks the end of the 14th Five-Year Plan, and authorities are now drawing up blueprints for the period between 2026 and 2030.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We do not expect any surprises and I think it's important for China – at this time – not to produce any surprises, because there had been some significant policy movement, initiatives in the past, and that had rocked market sentiments," Ho said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also said improving governance is another key focus at this year's "Two Sessions".
  <br>
  <br>
  "Improving governance has been on the agenda for quite some time, and improving governance is a way to boost people's confidence in the leadership.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Improving governance through introducing new laws can enhance people's confidence in the policies.
  <br>
  <br>
  "No one likes policies that come out of the blue, right? But if you improve governance, you're securing an atmosphere that is guaranteed by the legal framework."

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong delegates to the nation's top political advisory body who met with senior mainland official Xia Baolong in Beijing on Monday evening quoted him as saying the city should unite in supporting Chief Executive John Lee's administration.
 <br>
  <br>
  Xia, who heads the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, held talks with Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) delegates from the two SARs, a day before the opening of this year's CPPCC meetings.
  <br>
  <br>
  Delegates said during the 70-minute meeting with Xia, he highly praised the achievements of the two SARs in the past year.
  <br>
  <br>
  A local CPPCC member, Ho Hon-kuen, said Xia stressed that Hong Kong should work together as a whole.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Talking about the upcoming Legislative Council election, he said the current members have done a good job, but he hopes the next term can be even better,” Ho said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “He also said Hong Kong should unite and support the work of the chief executive. He said under the current economic and political situation, we should be confident in ourselves.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho also quoted Xia as saying that Hong Kong has the advantage of the One Country, Two Systems principle, and the central government and Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office fully support the SAR's development.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another local CPPCC member, Junius Ho, said they had discussions about the global political and economic situation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Junius Ho also mentioned Hong Kong's current situation.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The stability and prosperity that we are now enjoying do not come easy. We need to treasure them. We need to make it a sustainable growth. We need to maintain it. I think this requires concerted efforts, and we are all committed to do that,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The third session of the 14th CPPCC National Committee begins on Tuesday.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Sunbeam Theatre – the North Point venue best known for its Cantonese opera performances – put on its last show on Monday night, bidding farewell to fans and opera lovers after more than half a century.
 <br>
  <br>
  Dozens of people were already there ahead of the final show at 7.30pm, in what would be another full house.
  <br>
  <br>
  Harry Au Yeung brought along his son, 4, for a final look at the theatre that opened back in 1972.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think it's a great memory for many people," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I have never watched any Chinese opera before. But I think it is very valuable for most of the Hong Kong people, especially for the (older) generations. I hope the traditional Chinese opera can be extended to the future."
  <br>
  <br>
  Andrew To, a Malaysian who has been living in the SAR for over 20 years, was at Sunbeam Theatre for the second night in a row.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Today I'm not taking photo, but I'm just here to walk around, to see the people around, what they are doing, how they're saying farewells... Just soaking in the moment before it's gone forever," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Veteran actress Lana Wong, 94, performed at Sunbeam many times in the past. On this night, she came to watch the final show and say farewell.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Sunbeam is like my family, it's like my family being torn apart today. I am very, very sad," Wong said.
  <br>
  <br>
  But she said she doesn't believe the closure would affect the development of Cantonese opera, adding performances can still be staged in many other venues.
  <br>
  <br>
  A woman surnamed Chan also came for Sunbeam's last show, about the late paramount leader Deng Xiaoping played by award-winning opera performer Loong Koon-tin.
  <br>
  <br>
  Unlike Wong, she believes the end of the North Point landmark could have a negative impact on Cantonese opera because a lot of performances started off at Sunbeam.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan, who lives in Tseung Kwan O, also said while fans can still enjoy performances at locations such as the Xiqu Centre in West Kowloon, Sunbeam is more convenient because it's closer to her and can be easily reached by the MTR.
  <br>
  <br>
  A church will take over the location after Sunbeam ceases operation.

<img alt="WWF-Hong Kong says it hopes to discuss its findings with government officials. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1794010_1_20250303173647.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Conservation groups are warning that around a quarter of almost 900 different species assessed in Hong Kong are at risk of local extinction, with types of birds and freshwater fish among the most in danger of disappearing from the territory.
 <br>
  <br>
  The findings were released on Monday in the 'The state of Hong Kong biodiversity' report by WWF-Hong Kong, in association with the Hong Kong Bird Watching Society, Kadoorie Farm and Botanic Garden, Outdoor Wildlife Learning Hong Kong and local researchers.
  <br>
  <br>
  The assessments covered mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, fish, butterflies, dragonflies and freshwater crustaceans. Of the 886 species researchers checked, 232 were deemed to be on the brink of local extinction while 21 were confirmed to be extinct.
  <br>
  <br>
  Examples of species under threat include the Oriental magpie which is at high risk of disappearing locally, and the crested bunting which has lost its breeding population here. The Chinese floating frog, meanwhile, is already gone from the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With nearly half of the native freshwater fish species at risk of local extinction, threats such as channelisation and water pollution, and the invasion of non-native species must be tackled," said Dr Alphonse Tsang, Research Assistant Professor at Lingnan University.
  <br>
  <br>
  The report is accompanied by the 'Hong Kong Terrestrial Biodiversity Hotspot Map 2025' which highlights what are described as 27 critical biodiversity sites outside the protected-area system.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nearly 80 percent of the hotspots are said to have suffered from eco-vandalism, while almost half are threatened by development.
  <br>
  <br>
  The report includes more than two dozen recommendations for the authorities, including the establishment of special task forces to combat poaching and a review of plans to build on ecologically important habits.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are going to share this report to all the relevant government bureaus and departments, and we would request to have a kind of sit-down and share our thoughts with the relevant departments," said Dr Bosco Chan, director of conservation at WWF-Hong Kong.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's retail sales dropped 3.2 percent in January year-on-year, marking the 11th consecutive month of declines.
 <br>
  <br>
  According to official data released by the Census and Statistics Department on Monday, the value of total retail sales in January was estimated at HK$35.3 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  January's drop was narrower than the revised 9.6 percent decline recorded in December last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sales of motor vehicles and parts saw the sharpest decline at 52.6 percent, while those of furniture and fixtures saw a 26.4 percent fall.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, a department spokesman said looking at both January and February data would give a better picture of the city's retail performance during the Lunar New Year period.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Looking ahead, the near-term performance of the retail sector would continue to be affected by the change in consumption patterns of visitors and residents," the department statement read.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bond Law, executive director of the Retail Management Association, said he expects a sluggish year for the sector.
  <br>
  <br>
  "By April, we anticipate that the drop may narrow or level off with slight increases during certain holidays. Overall, we expect a flat year with fluctuations of no more than 2 percent," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Law said purchasing power and consumer sentiment remained weak despite an increase in mainland travellers.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Taxis that offer a variety of ways to pay and come equipped with systems to keep an eye on the driver  are about to arrive on the city's streets, with officials saying the only way is up when it comes to service quality.
 <br>
  <br>
  Five new taxi fleets with more than 3,500 vehicles between them were unveiled on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hundreds of the taxis are brand new and as well as accepting various forms of electronic payments rather than just cash, the fleets' various boasts include a number of wheelchair-accessible vehicles, some electric vehicles, online booking, and driver monitoring systems "for passenger convenience and driving safety", according to the government.
  <br>
  <br>
  Transport Secretary Mable Chan said that after years of challenges, the taxi trade can only make improvements when it comes to service and she hopes the fleets will play a leading role in this.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think today is a start," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We hope that we can promote and attract more taxis to join such a kind of fleet management so as to provide more modern and more user-friendly services."
  <br>
  <br>
  Big Boss Taxi Company, CMG Fleet Management, Sino Development (International) Company, SynCab Service and Tai Wo Management are the operators granted licences.
  <br>
  <br>
  Between them they will run around 20 percent of all the city's taxis, with the first fleet expected to start operating by the end of this month and all of them arriving by July.

    Govt operating account largely balanced: FS

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Monday said while Hong Kong's capital account, which is used to finance large infrastructure projects such as the Northern Metropolis, was facing higher deficits, the city's operating account was still largely balanced.
 <br>
  <br>
  "On the operating account, our aim is to return it to balance as soon as possible, and start to register surplus. The coming [financial] year, in 2025-2026, we will be largely in balance. The deficit is only about HK$4 billion. When you take it into the context of the government expenditure of over HK$600 billion a year, I would call that largely balanced. And then the year after, 2026-2027, we [will] start to have an operating surplus," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added the city must expedite the development of the Northern Metropolis so as to drive the SAR's technological growth, but that would also mean the government's capital account would be under an imbalanced fiscal situation in the short term due to the gap between revenue and expenditure.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In order to match the cash flow requirements, we can consider issuing some bonds with longer tenor. That is possible. But at the same time, I have to wait and balance between cost of borrowing and the tenor," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  There have been concerns over the city's rising debt, given authorities' plan to issue up to HK$195 billion worth of bonds annually over the coming five years.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Chan stressed the city's debt levels remain low and it should make good use of its borrowing capacity to meet the capital account cash flow gap.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The ICAC on Monday said it received 2,058 reports of corruption last year, up three percent from 2023.
 <br>
  <br>
  The anti-graft body said 480 of the complaints involved government departments, with the police getting the most at 108, followed by the Correctional Services Department with 44 and the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department with 40.
  <br>
  <br>
  Of the 1,438 reports involving the private sector, more than a third concerned building management firms, with the construction industry and finance and insurance companies also seeing scores of complaints.
  <br>
  <br>
  There were 140 reports involving public bodies, including 25 linked to the Hospital Authority.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ICAC said it prosecuted 207 people in 2024, including 16 civil servants, and 119 people were convicted.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The overall corruption situation in Hong Kong still remains very positive. We have not seen any sign of deterioration in terms of rise of corruption in Hong Kong,” said Bernard Chan, chairman of the ICAC's operations review committee.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee will head to Beijing on Tuesday to attend the annual opening meeting of the National People’s Congress (NPC).
 <br>
  <br>
  The NPC meeting will open in the capital on Wednesday, while the annual meeting of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) will open on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee will return to Hong Kong on Thursday, and Chief Secretary Eric Chan will be the acting CE during his absence.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Executive Council will not hold meetings these two weeks as local NPC and CPPCC members will need to attend the meetings in Beijing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters at the airport on Monday, a number of local NPC deputies expressed hope for policies supporting private enterprises.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I believe that in the government work report, there will also be supporting measures to encourage more private enterprises from Hong Kong and around the world to invest in our country," said Starry Lee, Hong Kong's sole delegate to the NPC Standing Committee.
  <br>
  <br>
  NPC deputy Iris Wong said she was upbeat about the country's potential in tech and cultural industries despite Sino-US tensions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Everyone can see that whether it's DeepSeek or the development of robotics, and even the recently popular Ne Zha movie, these are all achievements of our innovation, culture and technology," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  CPPCC member and Liberal Party chairman Peter Shiu said he would continue to push for more Greater Bay Area residents to visit Hong Kong, including expanding the multi-entry visa scheme to eight more cities in the GBA.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another CPPCC delegate and lawmaker Johnny Ng, meanwhile, said he would propose mechanisms for fraud prevention education during the meetings in the capital.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong delegates attending the "Two Sessions" meetings this year said they're looking to make a range of proposals – from the development of artificial intelligence to a low-altitude economy – as the SAR seeks to further integrate into the nation's development.
 <br>
  <br>
  Members of the National People's Congress (NPC) and the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) will be joining the country's largest annual political gatherings in Beijing this week.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lawmaker and local CPPCC member, Johnny Ng, told RTHK that he expects Beijing to put forward initiatives on technology – especially AI – in light of the emergence of DeepSeek.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Nowadays we have DeepSeek, this is open source. Open source means different industries can leverage AI to improve their efficiency, like the healthcare industry, the legal industry, the education industry," Ng said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This year I expect and I suggest the government to make a clearer blueprint to every different industry to leverage the benefits of AI... The government should have a clear blueprint and make some funding support."
  <br>
  <br>
  He expects cybersecurity to be a key concern for policymakers amid the country's technology development.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fellow lawmaker and CPPCC delegate, William Wong, called for the development of a cross-border low-altitude economy, which he sees as key to boosting cooperation in the Greater Bay Area.
  <br>
  <br>
  While the development of a low-altitude economy is generally considered more mature on the mainland than in the SAR, Wong believes Hong Kong can play a significant role moving forward.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The research part can actually be done in Hong Kong, and then the sort of prototyping, the testing part can be done in Shenzhen, for example, because one project is split between two places.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So during the research and development process, there will be a lot of, for example, document transfer. There may be experimental samples transfer or even equipment transfer."
  <br>
  <br>
  Stronger cross-border cooperation could also be on the cards when it comes to biotech.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong's sole delegate to the nation's top legislature, Starry Lee, said the Hetao zone is a major technology hub for the SAR, and the city should make good use of it and step up cooperation with the mainland, to help boost the country's overall biotech development.
  <br>
  <br>
  The NPC Standing Committee member said the mainland could send its blood products to Hong Kong, so the SAR can capitalise on its advantage in medical research.
  <br>
  <br>
  Financing for businesses is another key topic.
  <br>
  <br>
  Local NPC deputy, Ronick Chan, said many mainland enterprises, especially those in Qianhai, want to tap the Hong Kong loan market, but it's difficult for them to do so right now.
  <br>
  <br>
  He wants to expand the loan quotas.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They can put in place a total quota in respect of how the Qianhai enterprises could borrow from Hong Kong's financial institutions, and also Hong Kong's companies and enterprises could also borrow from Qianhai's financial institutions. This kind of liberation, I expect, could accelerate the cross-border fund flow and also be beneficial to Hong Kong's loan growth," Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other delegates at the "Two Sessions" said they'd like to see more support for the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  NPC deputy Stanley Ng wants more mainland tourists to be able to visit Hong Kong via the multi-entry visa scheme, which only covers Shenzhen residents at the moment.
  <br>
  <br>
  He hopes the scheme will cover residents in Guangzhou before expanding further to other cities in the Greater Bay Area in future.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A lawmaker on Monday said the Kai Tak Stadium places Hong Kong on the map as a "hot destination" for major concerts and events, after the Kai Tak Sports Park officially opened over the weekend.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lawmaker Adrian Ho was among the tens of thousands of people who attended the ceremony, where spectators were treated to a dazzling performance featuring athletes and celebrities.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho said organisers of major events will now take notice of Hong Kong's brand new facilities.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We really never had a sort of internationally up-to-standard arena until right now. So I believe that we would be a very hot destination to host events not only just locally, but internationally too," the New People's Party member told
  <a href="https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/news-programmes/this-episode.htm?cmsid=77" target="_blank">
   RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme
  </a>
  .
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted that the size of the stadium is a draw, adding that international stars prefer to perform at newer facilities.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Almost all organisers prefer sort of newer arenas. So I mean, this is the newest and hottest arena... If you look at events around the world everybody wants to go to a newer arena because of more state-of-the-art technology, technological advancements in terms of equipment, infrastructure, it's newer, it's better, so to speak, so I think for that matter... we're at an advantage."
  <br>
  <br>
  The lawmaker also said Saturday's opening ceremony for the Kai Tak Sports Park -- which featured a fencing duel between movie star Donnie Yen and Olympic gold medallist Vivian Kong, a medley performance by celebrity couple George Lam and Sally Yeh, and a surprise appearance by singer and actor Andy Lau -- went smoothly.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was such a huge event, and I think all of the expectations that I had prior to the event in terms of security, arrangements, the audience, as well as the programme, pretty much met my expectations," Ho said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I thought it was great."

<img alt="Henry Tang, a member of the CPPCC Standing Committee, says he will put forward ideas on allowing Greater Bay Area residents more access to HK's financial system.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A local delegate to the country’s top advisory body plans to ask for measures on facilitating people flow within the Greater Bay Area, during the upcoming “Two Sessions” meetings in Beijing.
 <br>
  <br>
  Henry Tang, who is a Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) Standing Committee member, came up with a number of proposals on better integrating Hong Kong into the country’s development and the Greater Bay Area, as well as leveraging the One Country, Two Systems principle.
  <br>
  <br>
  The former chief secretary hoped the central government would expand the multiple-entry visa scheme currently in place for Shenzhen residents.
  <br>
  <br>
  But one “new concept”, as he put it, would be on enriching the financial system on a closed-loop basis.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It’s not like I’m proposing to open up a giant back door to undermine the currency controls of the country, but to allow the people in the Greater Bay Area to take much better advantage of the financial instruments available in Hong Kong that are otherwise unavailable to the Shenzhen residents,” he said in the capital.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, Tang said the latest budget blueprint unveiled by the SAR government had focused on stability, calling it “commendable and reasonable”.
  <br>
  <br>
  “If you look at it from three basic principles — first is stability, second is development, and third is investing for future — they have all three parts in it,” said Tang, who formerly served as financial secretary himself.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Generally, it is an acceptable budget, in that aspect, and that three years is a reasonably period for a forecast to return to a budget surplus.”
  <br>
  <br>
  In Financial Secretary Paul Chan’s latest budget, he stressed containing government spending would be a top priority for the administration in the coming years as he outlined plans for job cuts, pay freezes and reducing expenditure.

    'Most civil servants understand need for pay freeze'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Civil Service Secretary Ingrid Yeung on Sunday said most civil servants understood the need for a pay freeze given the government’s deficit.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a Commercial Radio programme, Yeung said she had been told the move would not affect morale.
  <br>
  <br>
  “During the discussions, I approached many civil service colleagues and most of them told me they understood the situation. Some even said it had been expected. Before the budget announcement, some union representatives had said that it would not affect morale,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Financial Secretary Paul Chan also announced in his budget speech on Wednesday that two percent of the civil service would be cut between the 2026/27 and 2027/28 financial years, with about 10,000 civil service posts expected to be slashed by April 1, 2027.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeung said the two percent cut was a minimum requirement, and departments could reduce more posts if they wanted.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, Yeung said some vacancies had to be filled such as firefighters and teachers.

    'Taxing boundary-crossing drivers won't affect many'

<img alt="Paul Chan said on TVB that around 15 percent of people head to the mainland in private vehicles, and taxing them would not affect a great amount of people." src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1793870_1_20250302124329.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Sunday said officials plan to go ahead with a proposed land departure tax for private cars, saying this represented a wealthier demographic in society.
 <br>
  <br>
  The proposal announced in the budget last week met some opposition, with some lawmakers saying it wouldn't help Hong Kong's integration into the Greater Bay Area.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Chan said these drivers amount to about 15 percent of the some 100 million departures annually, so there wouldn't be too many people affected.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Because we spent much on these border facilities in terms of construction, and there are also maintenance costs," he said on a TVB programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  "From a user's pay perspective, we ought to get some money back. We don't want to bother the general public."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan stressed the government was still open to ideas and welcomed discussions.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister said there were many ways for people to cross the border, adding the government would not consider charging passengers who take the express rail.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the administration plans to raise more than HK$150 billion worth of bonds every year for the coming five fiscal years, in part to finance infrastructure projects.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said the government would mainly issue short-term bonds, but added it has also received local market feedback expressing interest in longer term, Hong Kong dollar bonds that could be considered stable investment tools.

    Technology chief pledges to foster AI development

<div class="itemFullText">
 Technology and innovation chief Sun Dong on Sunday said policies related to artificial intelligence (AI) mentioned in last month's budget show the government’s commitment to high-quality development.
 <br>
  <br>
  Financial Secretary Paul Chan described AI as a “core industry” as he delivered the budget for the 2025-26 financial year, and said the government would support research and development efforts in the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also announced that HK$1 billion would be earmarked for the establishment of the Hong Kong AI Research and Development Institute.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a Commercial Radio programme, Sun said the founding of the institute could benefit society in many ways, including applications in areas like government services, law, finance, healthcare and education.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think that with AI advancing to its current level, every country and region needs to achieve breakthroughs in important areas, particularly in applications. Of course this involves some free exploration. Therefore while we want to encourage different research teams to explore AI freely, we also need to combine our limited resources to focus on development. That’s part of why we’re establishing the institute," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The technology chief also noted there were 4,700 start-ups in the city at the end of last year, describing them as important pillars for Hong Kong’s future development.
  <br>
  <br>
  “This is four times what it was before the pandemic and over a 10 percent increase from the year before. The number is expected to go up again this year,” he said
  <br>
  <br>
  “Start-ups are looking at Hong Kong's innovation scene, government policies, the overall resources availability, and whether the business environment is good. When start-ups come here, talent will follow."
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong has to have its own “star start-up” as it works its way to become an international I&T centre, the minister said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sun will lead a delegation, including representatives from the I&T sector, to Spain and Portugal on Sunday evening, to strengthen ties and cooperation between Hong Kong and the two countries in the field.

    Man hospitalised with measles after Vietnam trip

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) says people should make sure they are fully vaccinated against measles before travelling, after a man was hospitalised with the disease following a trip to Vietnam. The 38-year-old, who travelled to the country in early February, is now stable at Queen Elizabeth Hospital.
 <br>
  <br>
  Although the CHP has classified the case as imported, the man stayed at the Hong Kong Sports Institute and visited its cafeteria while he was infectious.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CHP has set up a hotline on 2125 2372 for those who may have been exposed. It will operate until Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Measles cases are rising in some countries due to low vaccination rates. While Hong Kong's vaccination coverage exceeds 95 percent, international travel poses a risk.
  <br>
  <br>
  CHP controller Dr Edwin Tsui said anyone unsure of their vaccination status, especially travellers, should consult a doctor.

<img alt="O'Sullivan had been looking forward to playing in front of a home crowd in Hong Kong, after becoming an SAR resident last October. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1793832_1_20250301225306.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ronnie O'Sullivan has withdrawn from the World Snooker Grand Prix 2025 scheduled at Kai Tak Arena next week, citing health reasons.
 <br>
  <br>
  "I am very disappointed not to be competing. I had been eager to make my comeback in Hong Kong and have put in my utmost effort, but unfortunately must consider my health. I wish to sincerely thank the organisers and all the Hong Kong fans for their support," the 49-year-old star said in a statement on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Rocket, as he's nicknamed, will be replaced by world number 33 Hossein Vafaei.
  <br>
  <br>
  The event will be the first ranking tournament in the SAR since 1989.
  <br>
  <br>
  World number one Judd Trump, who -- like O'Sullivan -- became a Hong Kong resident through the Quality Migrant Admission Scheme, will now headline the competition from March 4 to 9.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other big names include Mark Williams, Mark Selby and Ding Junhui.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A fencing duel between movie star Donnie Yen and Olympic gold medallist Vivian Kong, a medley performance by celebrity couple George Lam and Sally Yeh, and a surprise appearance by singer and actor Andy Lau were some of the highlights for the opening ceremony of Kai Tak Sports Park on Saturday night.
 <br>
  <br>
  The show, which went on until 8:35pm, half an hour longer than scheduled, was capped by a brief fireworks display.
  <br>
  <br>
  Spectators said they were dazzled by the overall experience. Jimmy and Dhillon said they were super excited to see Donnie Yen.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They had a fencing demonstration just now, mixing kung fu and fencing. Donnie Yen fencing against Vivian Kong, the Hong Kong champion. It looks like we are in the Olympics," they said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another attendee, Gary, was pleased with his clear view to the stage, even he sat in the upper section.
  <br>
  <br>
  "My seat is the top (row) one. So my sight is all the stadium and very huge. It makes me feel great. I’m very proud that Hong Kong has this (stadium)," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alan, who went with his girlfriend, praised the facilities inside the stadium, although he felt the sound quality can be improved.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The number of toilets is beyond my expectations… Just [every] few steps there's a toilet," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also hoped spectators can bring their own food or drinks in the future.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We did not buy any drinks or food inside - just the price consideration. We wanted to buy the popcorn but that is not the fresh popcorn, just pre-prepared food," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  A woman from Zhuhai was overjoyed to see Andy Lau in person.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Everyone was hoping to see the four heavenly kings," Zhang said, referring to 1990s Hong Kong pop idols Andy Lau, Aaron Kwok, Jacky Cheung and Leon Lai.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was awesome enough to see one of them show up."
  <br>
  <br>
  The event also drew in Jeffery and Arnold, both engineers involved in the sports park project.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For me, it's like what you said, our baby. So it feels like we accomplished something because of our hardships and all the struggles that we faced here during the construction. Yeah, all the tears, the sweat," Jeffrey said.

 The brand new Kai Tak Sports Park will help Hong Kong soar to new heights, the chief executive told the crowd during the opening ceremony on Saturday night.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking in Cantonese, Putonghua and English, John Lee also underlined his vision for the city’s newest landmark, built on the site vacated by the old airport.
  <br>
  <br>
  “From the first successful trial flight 100 years ago to the establishment of an airport, today we have created Kai Tak Sports Park … a brand new stage for sports, culture and arts facing the world,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CE added that the park will be the perfect venue to kick off “Hong Kong Super March,” outlining a list of mega-events scheduled for the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Like this very stadium's retractable roof, the sky is the limit. From snooker, the Hong Kong Rugby Sevens to football, the upcoming sports events are sure to delight all - on and off the pitch,” he declared.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee was then joined onstage by political and business leaders for the launching ceremony. They included the director of the central government's liaison office, Zheng Yanxiong, as well as Henry Cheng, chairman of New World Development, which built the park.
  <br>
  <br>
  The crowd of 33,000 or so were treated to a Chinese drum performance and lion dance before the speech.
  <br>
  <br>
  The media were allowed to stream roughly the first half an hour of the show, until 7 pm.
  <br>
  <br>
  The rest of the ceremony – including performances by singers Joey Yung, and demonstrations by national athletes – was kept under wraps until 9.30 pm, when four free-to-air TV channels will broadcast the event in full.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Jubilant and excited crowds arrived at Kai Tak Sports Park ahead of the opening ceremony on Saturday night, but some were left confused by the rules of admission.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 90-minute ceremony will begin at 6:30pm, featuring celebrities including Donnie Yen, Gin Lee, MC Cheung, Joey Yung, as well as SAR athletes Vivian Kong and Jordan Tang.
  <br>
  <br>
  One spectator, Edward, arrived two hours in advance. He said he couldn’t wait to see the stars and check out their performances.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Of course Joey, MC - those are the perfect performances that I want to look at. Also I know some of the sports stars will be joining. I'm looking forward to it," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another man, surnamed Wong, said his daughter helped him buy a ticket. The 67-year-old said he has never been to a big stadium before and called this an "once-in-a-lifetime opportunity."
  <br>
  <br>
  The ceremony will welcome 33,600 spectators, including 8,500 lucky ones who managed to purchase tickets online.
  <br>
  <br>
  But to get in, they had to show up with electronic vouchers and identity documents to redeem a physical ticket by 3pm.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bosco and his girlfriend arrived half an hour before the deadline. He said the arrangement was a bit of a hassle but described the redemption process as smooth.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think it'll be better if the seats are arranged when I buy the tickets ... It's a bit troublesome to come here a few times," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For us it's quite smooth because ... not many people are here. The process takes about five minutes."
  <br>
  <br>
  But a number of others showed up after 3pm, including Alsen, who travelled from Shenzhen.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said he was thankful to get the ticket, but felt that signage directing spectators could be improved.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There are many instructions that I can't identify. There's information but it still feels a bit hard for me to find the right place. I asked some police and others," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Spectators were allowed to enter the main stadium from 4:30pm, after passing security checks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some of them were unaware of the list of items prohibited inside the venue. These include long umbrellas, plastic, glass or metal food containers, water bottles and so on.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's kind of odd. Maybe it's for safety reasons, but kids need their own water bottles. It means we need to spend money inside," said Mavis, who attended the gala with her two daughters and husband.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ceremony will not be broadcast live, but four local TV channels, including RTHK, will carry the show at 9.30pm.

    Taxi fleets to be unveiled on Monday: transport chief

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Five taxi companies which were awarded licences to operate taxi fleets will roll out the long-awaited service next week, according to the secretary for transport and logistics.
 <br>
  <br>
  Writing on her blog, Mable Chan added the fleets will serve customers with a range of new electric vehicles. She and the fleet operators will meet the press in an official launch ceremony on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The taxi fleet regime was introduced last year as part of the government’s efforts to improve the sector's service quality.
  <br>
  <br>
  The scheme drew keen interest with 15 applicants. Three of them did not meet the prescribed requirements, such as having a driver monitoring system and the provision of online hailing services.
  <br>
  <br>
  The remaining applicants were then vetted by an assessment panel, and five who emerged as winners were each granted a five-year licence.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan also gave updates on the government’s push to adopt new energy vehicles.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said the Transport Department has approved 152 domestic and 409 international electric vehicle models as of the end of 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier amendments to the Road Traffic Regulation meant to enable certain features of these vehicles also took effect today.
  <br>
  <br>
  They include remote parking, which Chan expects to be well-received by many drivers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong's land resources are precious, with many parking spaces being quite compact. You may have seen videos showing skillful parking manoeuvres ... sometimes drivers even need to exit through the sunroof," she wrote.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong-based singer songwriter Khalil Fong has died at the age of 41, his music label revealed on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, Fu Music said Fong passed away gently and gracefully on February 21 after battling a "relentless illness" for five years.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The music and graphic novels he gifted to the world remain an eternal testament to his luminous spirit, a timeless treasure for generations to come," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Born in Hawaii and having debuted in 2005, Fong was known for his soul and R&B music.
  <br>
  <br>
  After releasing his ninth studio album "Journey to the West" in 2016, Fong took a break from his engagements due to health reasons.
  <br>
  <br>
  He made a comeback last October with his final album "The Dreamer", and said back then he was on the road to recovery.

    'Pay freezes show govt serious in tackling deficit'

<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Saturday said his proposal to freeze civil servant pay aims to show the government's determination in achieving a fiscal balance.
 <br>
  <br>
  In his budget speech on Wednesday, he proposed cutting recurrent government expenditure by two percent for the coming financial year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some lawmakers and political parties suggested deeper cuts of five to 10 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan told an RTHK programme that salaries were the government's biggest expense, and it was best to take a cautious approach to any cuts.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We need to make some adjustments in this area, while maintaining the level of public services. Even when training staff to use technology, it takes time," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We believe that reducing recurrent expenditure by two percent annually is more appropriate. If we move too quickly, haste makes waste and the results may not be as good."
  <br>
  <br>
  The finance chief reiterated that he didn't want to rely too heavily on land income, citing the tremendous financial pressure on residents when land and property prices soared in the past.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We don't want housing to be as expensive as it was during times of short supply. So we'll continue our work on land supply. As for releasing prepared land, we can be flexible and take market conditions into consideration."
  <br>
  <br>
  On plans to roll out eight residential plots in the coming year, Chan said land sale plans shouldn't be linked to land premium income and this year's housing supply shouldn't be excessive.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on another radio programme, Chan said the government would expedite the development of the Northern Metropolis, adding that many mainland enterprises had expressed an interest in its development.
  <br>
  <br>
  Infrastructure investment for the Northern Metropolis has increased from HK$90 billion to HK$120 billion annually.

    Card readers will be updated to allow for HK$2 tweaks

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Users will be able to check the remaining number of discounted trips using an Octopus card reader when changes to the HK$2 elderly transport subsidy take effect, the labour and welfare chief Chris Sun said on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The government announced in the latest Financial Budget that there would be a cap of 240 trips per month.
  <br>
  <br>
  After that, while the flat rate of HK$2 remains for rides costing HK$10 or less, the government will only shoulder 80 percent of the cost if the standard fare exceeds HK$10.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a Commercial Radio programme, Sun noted that all 17,000 Octopus card readers in the SAR only allowed users to check the last 40 transactions and the remaining value.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think it's important for them to check whenever they want to check it - how many trips are remaining for that month. Right now, for the Octopus card they are holding, this is not a function with it. So we have to create that function for them to check it out," he told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And also, they have to go to... most likely one of the machines installed in most of the MTR stations where they can check their balance and also the recent transactions. So through that, what we call 'an Octopus card checker', when they just tap the card, they can check how many trips are still remaining for that month."
  <br>
  <br>
  While the government aims to put the changes in place no later than September next year, Sun emphasised that he hopes the amendment can take effect as soon as possible.
  <br>
  <br>
  He says he believes the new measures will help tackle the issue of commuters taking long-haul rides for only short trips.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister emphasised that the government would reach out to elderly in, what he called, a "very, very extensive way", to ensure they were aware of the tweaks.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also reiterated that the impact brought by the changes would be minimal, as 75 percent of the beneficiaries take rides costing less than HK$10.

    Basketball betting 'could be legalised by September'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Sources said the Hong Kong Jockey Club is hopeful that legislation clearing the way for basketball betting will be passed by lawmakers by September this year.
 <br>
  <br>
  The government revealed in its latest budget that it is looking into regulating basketball betting, and will invite the Jockey Club to submit a proposal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sources said that the club has already submitted a proposal framework and met with government officials on Friday morning.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Jockey Club has suggested that legalising basketball betting could take reference to football betting, which means it will charge a 50 percent duty from net betting revenue.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is expected that after legalising basketball betting, the club could draw 30 to 40 percent of the city's illegal betting turnover to the tune of HK$30 billion a year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sources said that HK$1 billion to HK$2 billion has to be invested in infrastructure, such as the development of a new computer system that would be rolled out in 2026/27.
  <br>
  <br>
  It's also expected that HK$1.5 billion in tax revenue could be generated for the government after four years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sources said the club will step up public education on basketball betting.
  <br>
  <br>
  The club will contribute HK$50 million a year to the Ping Wo Fund that aims to help those with a gambling addiction.

    'Not enough separation for planes after take-off'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An unspecified number of air traffic control staff have been suspended over an incident involving two cargo planes that triggered an alert after take-off.
 <br>
  <br>
  According to the Civil Aviation Department (CAD), the two aircraft were cleared to take off from Hong Kong International Airport on Thursday morning, heading to Turkmenistan and Azerbaijan.
  <br>
  <br>
  One of the cargo planes was told by air traffic control to climb to 5,000 feet, and the other to 3,000 feet, to maintain separation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "However, as the climbing rates of the two cargo flights varied from what the (air traffic control) officers had anticipated, the desired vertical separation was not achieved," a government statement read.
  <br>
  <br>
  "During this time, both cargo flights followed standard departure procedures and maintained visual contact with each other."
  <br>
  <br>
  The second plane then descended to 2,500 feet after its traffic collision avoidance system issued an alert to its crew.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both aircraft continued to their destinations according to their flight plans.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CAD said preliminary information showed the incident might be due to air traffic control staff failing to abide by take-off protocols, and those involved have been temporarily removed from frontline duties.
  <br>
  <br>
  Secretary for Transport and Logistics Mable Chan on Friday said the department has been ordered to submit a report on the case.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The report has to include, for example, procedures and staff related to the incident. I hope it can help prevent similar incidents in the future and allow us to do better," she said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Transport and Logistics Bureau is aiming to complete a review on the fixed penalties for traffic-related offences and various fees and tolls this year, its chief said on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  In the latest financial budget, the government revealed that it is hoping to increase revenue by HK$2 billion annually by doing so.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a press conference, Mable Chan said the bureau will focus on traffic charges that have not gone up for years.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Take parking meters as an example, [the charge] has not been adjusted for more than 30 years. And for fixed penalties for traffic-related offences such as parking [illegally], those too have not been adjusted for almost 30 years," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Therefore, our intention, apart from adhering to the principle of exercising fiscal prudence, is also to pay attention to traffic management, as well as road safety."
  <br>
  <br>
  The transport minister said officials hope "an appropriate adjustment" can serve as a deterrent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan noted that drivers have to pay tolls at eight out of 18 government tunnels.
  <br>
  <br>
  She assured the public that the government will also consider people's affordability when carrying out the review.

    Edgar Cheung tells students to never give up

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's fencing king and two-time Olympic gold medallist Edgar Cheung has encouraged students to never give up in the face of adversity.
 <br>
  <br>
  He was attending a student-sharing session after receiving an outstanding athlete award worth HK$3.375 million from his alma mater, Lam Tai Fai College.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cheung, who captured gold in the individual foil event in Tokyo in 2021 and in Paris last year, told students that it's not all glamorous for athletes.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said he had a disappointing performance during the 2024 Asian Fencing Championships, held about two months before the Paris Olympics, and it took him some time to regain his confidence.
  <br>
  <br>
  The world no. 2 encouraged students to never forget their goals or be discouraged when they encounter any difficulties.
  <br>
  <br>
  Table tennis star Wong Chun-ting, who partnered with Doo Hoi-kem to reach the mixed doubles semi-finals at the Paris Games, was a fellow alumnus and received a prize of HK$375,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  The school's supervisor, Lam Tai-fai, said the athlete award programme demonstrates the school's contributions to Hong Kong sports and education.

    Smaller housing plots in next land sale programme

<img alt="Bernadette Linn said the plots in the coming financial year's land sale programme can house less than a thousand flats each. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1793689_1_20250228180230.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government said on Friday that eight residential plots it plans to roll out in the coming financial year can house around 4,450 flats, more than a fifth less than the figure from the current fiscal year.
 <br>
  <br>
  Development Secretary Bernadette Linn said none of the plots in the coming land sale programme are able to accommodate more than a thousand units.
  <br>
  <br>
  Five of the sites are in urban areas, in Tsuen Wan, Shau Kei Wan, Jordan Valley, Ngau Tau Kok and Ta Kwu Ling.
  <br>
  <br>
  The others are in Tung Chung, Stanley and Tuen Mun, whose Hoi Chu Road plot for around 500 homes will be introduced in the next quarter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Linn said officials want to roll out sites in urban areas because there are signs the property market is recovering and these plots should be quite attractive.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said some of them used to be school campuses, wet markets or planned community sites and officials decided to rezone them for housing because they were no longer needed for their original purpose.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Some of the government sites that have been developed in the past are not put to gainful use. Perhaps they have a lower development density, and after review we think that those sites can be put to better use," she told a press conference about the latest budget.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So given that this is an ongoing task, I would not rule out the possibility of more of such sites being rezoned for residential or commercial uses in future years."
  <br>
  <br>
  Linn said officials will study the market situation before deciding which of the rest of the plots to put up and when.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister added that the government decided not to keep three plots from this year in the next land sale programme, because of market conditions.
  <br>
  <br>
  She noted that one piece of land is in Kai Tak and said that has been removed because of abundant housing supply in the area. The other two plots to go are in Tuen Mun and Cheung Sha on Lantau.

    Govt seeking clarifications over latest US tariffs
   </title>

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development Algernon Yau on Friday said authorities are seeking clarifications as to whether new additional tariffs on Chinese imports announced by the US also cover goods from Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  US president Donald Trump announced on his social media overnight that he will slap extra 10 percent tariffs on Chinese imports from March 4, on top of additional 10 percent levies imposed earlier this month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters at a press briefing, the commerce chief said the US tariffs are "unreasonable", reiterating that SAR authorities are filing an official complaint to the World Trade Organisation (WTO) over the earlier tariffs move.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have to understand better the details of this [latest] imposition, whether the Hong Kong production and products are included or excluded, so we are making assessments for the time being and seeking clarification," Yau said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Actually the volumes of Hong Kong products trading with the US are very minimal, accounting for only 0.1 percent of the total exports of Hong Kong, so the impact is not very significant at the moment," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  US officials earlier confirmed that the first set of additional tariffs applies to Hong Kong, to which the SAR government responded by saying the US ignored the fact that Hong Kong is a separate customs territory as stated in Article 116 of the Basic Law and recognised by the World Trade Organisation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, Yau noted that Hong Kong is in discussions with Malaysia and Saudi Arabia on setting up economic and trade offices in the two countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that Hong Kong is exploring investment agreements with Saudi Arabia, Bangladesh, Egypt and Peru, while actively seeking to join the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP).
  <br>
  <br>
  On another note, the commerce chief said Hong Kong remains a major investment hub as 10,000 overseas companies had settled in the SAR by the end of last year, a 10 percent rise on the number at the end of 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yau said while about one fifth of those firms come from the mainland, 1,400 are from Japan and another 1,400 are from the US.
  <br>
  <br>
  There are also about 720 firms from the UK and 520 from Singapore, which indicates that the city is attractive to foreign investors from various regions, he said.

    Ethnic minority advocacy group Unison to wind up

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong Unison, a group advocating the rights of the city's ethnic minorities, on Friday announced it was starting its dissolution process, saying its “historical mission has been successfully accomplished.”
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters after an executive committee meeting, committee chair Alice Chong said winding up the group was not an abrupt decision and it had started discussions around two or three years ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said 16 out of 17 members with voting rights supported the disband motion, adding it had nothing to do with political or financial matters.
  <br>
  <br>
  “There are already more than 30 NGOs and groups that are now providing services and support in education, welfare, job and health to ethnic minority people. We are sure that they will be in good hands. We are also happy to [see] the government [has made] ethnic minority people as one of their priorities,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chong said the decision was backed by most former board members.
  <br>
  <br>
  She also noted the group had about HK$4 million in assets and after covering staff severance and long-term service pay, the rest of the money would be donated to other charity groups with similar goals.
  <br>
  <br>
  The organisation’s former executive director, John Tse, said he had not been consulted and called the move to disband “irresponsible”.
  <br>
  <br>
  “How can we say that we’ve accomplished what we set out for? No one would say that, because look at the Hong Kong society, racism, discrimination against ethnic minorities, they’re so common,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tse also noted the process of planning for winding up started back in September, but he was only instructed to stop receiving donations in late January.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added he and two other former staff members were planning to start a new group to continue their work helping ethnic minorities.
  <br>
  <br>
  Former project officer Javria Khalid said she was let go a month ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I’m so hurt, I feel like that we have let our ethnic community down,” she said. “I'm so speechless right now. I don't even know how to tell the parents, the students, the awardees, everyone that Unison is shut down.”
  <br>
  <br>
  She said about 100 people, as well as over 10 ongoing projects, which include Chinese classes and mental health counselling sessions, would be affected.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong Unison was founded in 2001 and was registered as a charitable organisation four years later.
  <br>
  <br>
  It advocated for various policy changes to improve ethnic minority rights in Hong Kong, including the promotion of teaching of Chinese as a second language as well as getting the Race Discrimination Ordinance to come into effect in 2009.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Cultural, Sports and Tourism Secretary Rosanna Law on Friday said the opening of the Kai Tak Sports Park is only the beginning of many mega events in March, adding that preparations are in the final stage.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a press conference, Law said there will be a simple but grand ceremony on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The preparation for the opening of Kai Tak Sports Park is of course, at its final stage and a very intensive stage. Of course, rehearsals are ongoing, and then we are making final preparations for all the logistic arrangements," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked about reports that Singapore will host concerts this year by American singer Lady Gaga, Law said Hong Kong will host Asian superstars and singers who haven't performed here for a long time.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are doing all we can with the Kai Tak Sports Park, the Tourism Board and other relevant bodies to try to attract and invite as many as possible international mega events to Hong Kong. It may or may not necessarily be just popular concerts."
  <br>
  <br>
  In his budget speech on Wednesday, Financial Secretary Paul Chan said the government will earmark HK$1.2 billion for the Tourism Board, lower than the HK$1.5 billion in the current fiscal year.
  <br>
  <br>
  In response to this, Law said the Tourism Board has enough reserves and she hopes the board will use its resources prudently.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Each year, HKTB will be monitoring very closely and announcing the tourist spending and the tourist duration of stay, both for overnight visitors and for same-day visitors. These will obviously be some of the KPIs that we will be looking for," she said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The government says people attending the opening ceremony for Kai Tak Sports Park on Saturday evening must get their tickets by 3pm on the day.
 <br>
  <br>
  Some 8,000 people received vouchers which have to be exchanged in person for the tickets they bought.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sports Commissioner George Tsoi said on Friday morning that so far, nearly half of the buyers have collected their tickets.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said while the ceremony will begin at 6.30pm, the 3pm cut-off time for ticket exchanges is necessary for the sake of crowd control.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our gates will open at 4.30pm for the opening ceremony," Tsoi said at a press conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If there are many people queuing for ticket exchange at the last minute, we don't want so many people colliding, going in different directions at the same time."
  <br>
  <br>
  In total, more than 30,000 people are expected to attend the ceremony in the Kai Tak Stadium, with officials urging them to travel to the venue by public transport.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tsoi said no parking will be available at the Kai Tak Mall inside the sports park on Saturday, a restriction that will also be in place for future large-scale events there.
  <br>
  <br>
  There will be a special pick-up and drop-off zone on Sung Wong Toi Road for those arriving by private car or taxi.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials noted that no professional cameras, long umbrellas or water bottles will be allowed in the stadium, also reminding people that ticket scalping is not permitted.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong home prices retreated to their lowest level in nearly eight and a half years in January.
 <br>
  <br>
  Figures from the Rating and Valuation Department on Friday showed that the city's home price index dropped to 287.6, from 288.9 in December.
  <br>
  <br>
  That marked a 0.4 percent decline on a monthly basis and a 6.5 percent retreat from a year before.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prices had risen in October and November after cheaper borrowing costs attracted buyers to take the plunge.
  <br>
  <br>
  Commenting on the latest data, Eddie Kwok, executive director of valuation and advisory services at consultancy CBRE Hong Kong, said January was low season for the property market due to the Lunar New Year holiday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kwok also partially attributed the declines to developers rolling out new residential projects while also pushing existing inventories.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he said he expects a rebound later this year, noting that home prices are highly correlated with the city's stock market performances.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If the Hang Seng Index remains at its current level or continue to increase, we expect residential prices for the secondary market to stabilise and potentially pick up going forward," he said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rental prices continued to edge up in January, with the official key gauge rising to its highest level in four months to stand at 192.9.

 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Friday said overseas firms were still keen on the mainland market and on Hong Kong's position as a gateway to that, a day after US President Donald Trump said a further 10 percent levies on China would be going ahead.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chan was commenting on Friday during an RTHK radio phone-in programme on his 2025-26 budget that he unveiled on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We try to reinforce the relationships and trading relationships with developed economies, US, Europe, because for them, in our contact with them, many of their businesses are still very interested in the mainland market, and Hong Kong will be the natural landing platform for them, using this platform to access the mainland market and to expand in the region," said Chan.
  <br>
  <br>
  He stressed the importance of Hong Kong re-aligning itself as a high value-added supply chain management centre, as well as opening up new capital markets in the Middle East and Southeast Asia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan's budget on Wednesday announced cuts to thousands of civil service jobs and a boost in spending in artificial intelligence as it seeks to tackle a deficit of HK$87 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  One caller, Ng, noted that a number of projects that were issued grants under the Innovation and Technology Fund were related to medical and healthcare, yet the government focused on AI and new industrialisation in his speech.
  <br>
  <br>
  He asked: "Is it because the government has evaluated these [healthcare] projects? They have granted the subsidies and they are useless?"
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said the government would continue to invest heavily in medical and healthcare, and continue to give grants to universities but would shift the focus to the private sector and industry-led research.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Lok Ma Chau Loop between the border of Hong Kong and Shenzhen will be a major area for these companies to be located. And also we think perhaps it would be wiser not just using government's money, but also using market resources. That is why we put up a scheme on a matching basis to co-invest with general partners, which are fund managers in these areas," said Chan.
  <br>
  <br>
  The finance minister also stressed how technology could take away some of the burden of civil servants to ensure public services are not affected, as the administration gradually reduces its headcount.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have set aside resources and provided training to help our various [departments] to use technology tools to enhance their work efficiency and also take the opportunity to streamline, to review their operational model and procedures, to see how this could be further rationalised and optimised."
  <br>
  <br>
  Another caller, Steven, expressed disappointment that the non-means-tested one-off student grant of HK$2,500 would not be continued, and asked whether the government cared about the city's birthrate and providing support to parents.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said the budget allocation for education continued to exceed HK$100 billion a year, which he described as "a very substantial investment."
  <br>
  <br>
  He went on to say that the Education Bureau considered that student grant, being non-means-tested, was not targeted to help those in need.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The SAR government has condemned members of the US Senate Committee on Foreign Affairs, accusing them of making baseless allegations against Hong Kong's national security law.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, the government dismissed what it described as a so-called resolution criticising Hong Kong's autonomy and its national security law, labelling it "political manoeuvring and reckless clamoring".
  <br>
  <br>
  It called on the US to stop undermining Hong Kong's international reputation and interfering in Hong Kong matters.
  <br>
  <br>
  A government spokesman said US politicians had time and again made skewed remarks about Hong Kong's situation and advocated imposing "sanctions" on the SAR to undermine its rule of law and its prosperity and stability.
  <br>
  <br>
  "National security is the foundation for prosperity and stability in society, as well as the well-being of the people," the spokesperson said, highlighting the success of the law in restoring order after the 2019 unrest and fostering Hong Kong's economic recovery.
  <br>
  <br>
  The spokesperson also criticised the US for its double standards, noting that it has at least 21 pieces of laws safeguarding national security.
  <br>
  <br>
  The spokesperson added that the national security law complies with international human rights standards, reaffirming that Hong Kong's legal system ensures freedom and protection under the Basic Law.
  <br>
  <br>
  On ongoing legal cases, the spokesperson emphasised that all proceedings are based on evidence and the rule of law.

    'Private sector growth high on Two Sessions agenda'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Support for private businesses is a very important area that will be addressed during the upcoming "Two Sessions" meetings in Beijing, according to Hong Kong's sole delegate to the country's top legislature.
 <br>
  <br>
  In the first of our series previewing this year's National People's Congress (NPC) and Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) meetings, NPC Standing Committee member Starry Lee said there is an urgency to attract more private investment to China amid the current geopolitical situation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing has moved to introduce the private economy promotion law, which is designed to ensure private firms receive clear legal protections and create a fairer business environment.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bill includes provisions prohibiting arbitrary fees and fines on private enterprises, and requiring the State Council and local governments at or above the county level to provide regular reports on their progress.
  <br>
  <br>
  It's "set to become China's first fundamental law dedicated to the private sector," according to Xinhua News Agency.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee attended an NPC Standing Committee meeting in the capital this week examining the bill's second draft, ahead of the opening of the NPC session next Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I believe some of the initiatives will be mentioned in the government report... to further invite and encourage private investment," she said in an interview with RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee said the SAR has a role to play in trying to shore up support for the private sector.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With the current geopolitical situation, there is always an urgency to have more private investment to invest in our country, not only from Hong Kong, but from different parts of the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Being one of the most international cities in our country, we have our responsibility to attract more talent, enterprises and technology to come to Hong Kong to help to build further our financial market and also the technology side."
  <br>
  <br>
  This year marks the end of the 14th Five-Year Plan, and Lee said people have high expectations for the next blueprint for 2026-2030 which she believes would be related to the resolution adopted in the third party plenary session last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The NPC Standing Committee member added that the SAR, the Hetao Shenzhen-Hong Kong Science and Technology Innovation Co-operation Zone, as well as the Northern Metropolis will be "key stakeholders" to contribute to the country's development.

    'SAR debt still at very manageable level'

<img alt="Christopher Hui says the ratio of government debt to GDP is less than 17 percent. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1793524_1_20250227181644.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury Christopher Hui said the SAR's debt is still "at a very manageable level", and that the government has maintained close contact with global credit rating agencies relating to its financial position.
 <br>
  <br>
  Hui's remarks came after Financial Secretary Paul Chan announced in his budget that the government plans to issue about HK$150 billion to HK$195 billion worth of bonds annually over the next five years to support infrastructure projects such as the Northern Metropolis.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In fact, we have long been in close contact with some relevant rating agencies and we have very regular communications, so that we'll ensure they know about the specific [financial] situation of Hong Kong, our bond issuance plans, as well as the reasoning on how we manage our finances," Hui said in a press conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're actually maintaining our debts at a very manageable level right now. As you can see, compared with some other economies, the share of our bond issuance to our overall gross domestic product is less than 17 percent. This is actually very manageable level compared with the international level."
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, the financial services and treasury chief noted that authorities hope to improve the city's financial markets by conducting reforms of the stock trading and company listing mechanisms.
  <br>
  <br>
  Measures include the gradual introduction of a new function by the end of the year to enable most stock transactions to settle one business day after the trade date, in what's called the "T+1" settlement cycle.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hui said that the new settlement cycle will help improve the quality of the city's stock trading, as the current "T+2" settlement cycle is lagging behind other international peers, such as the US, Canada, and Mexico.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's a global trend, really, in terms of increasing capital deployment efficiency, and allow capital to be returned to the investors sooner, so that they can utilise it further," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other reform measures include the establishment of a "technology enterprises channel" by the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing to help specialist technology and biotechnology companies, especially those listed on the mainland, seek listings in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hui said that the new channel will provide "tailor-made" assistance and guidance for those firms to prepare better before they submit their IPO applications.

<img alt="Chris Sun says only 360 people were found to have taken more than 240 trips a month under the HK$2 transport subsidy scheme. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1793531_1_20250227185519.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Labour and welfare chief Chris Sun on Thursday said it will take time for the authorities to prepare for changes to the HK$2 transport subsidy scheme, which will be implemented no later than September next year.
 <br>
  <br>
  As outlined in the budget delivered by Financial Secretary Paul Chan the day before, instead of a flat HK$2 fare, eligible commuters will have to pay 20 percent of any standard fare surpassing HK$10.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a press briefing, Sun said the government wants to ensure all 17,000 Octopus readers in the city are properly set up for the "HK$2 flat rate cum 80 per cent discount" scheme, which will take time.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the machines are spread out on the MTR, buses, minibuses and resident coaches, and adjustments can only be made one-by-one at the end of the day.
  <br>
  <br>
  The welfare minister also said changes to the subsidy scheme were made after careful discussions among officials.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We believe we have struck a right balance between, first of all, to preserve as far as possible the very reasons of introducing a HK$2 concession fare scheme, which is to encourage our elderly and the disabled to go out and to see for themselves the beauty of the outside world and also to remain socially connected, and secondly, to make sure the concession fare scheme will be fiscally sustainable into the future,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  As for the proposed monthly cap of 240 trips, Sun said only 360 people were found to have exceeded that number each month between August and November, amounting to less than 1 percent of all such users, so most other elderly and disabled travellers won't be affected.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, Sun said his bureau has invited the 177 non-profit organisations (NGOs) that receive government funding for a meeting next Monday to discuss a proposed 7 percent cut in recurrent government spending through the 2027-28 financial year.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We’ll let them know [how] exactly we’re going to work together to achieve the efficiency gains and yet at the same time providing more flexibility to our NGOs,” he said. "Right now I'm not in a position to provide you with a detailed breakdown."

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Former lawmaker Lam Cheuk-ting and six others were on Thursday sentenced to between 25 and 37 months behind bars each, after earlier being found guilty of rioting in Yuen Long in 2019.
 <br>
  <br>
  The District Court handed down the longest term to Lam.
  <br>
  <br>
  In handing down the 37-month sentence, judge Stanley Chan said Lam showed no remorse and had played a different role than the other defendants in the riot on July 21, 2019.
  <br>
  <br>
  The judge said Lam was well-known and his visit to Yuen Long on the day in question had a “different impact” and had worsened confrontations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan rejected the defence's claim that the defendant had intended to resolve conflicts between two rival groups of people, saying he had “fanned the flames” and failed to ask people to stay calm.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lam will serve three months of his jail term concurrently with the six years and nine months he received earlier for conspiring to commit subversion.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Education Secretary Christine Choi on Thursday said there is "never a good time" to scrap the HK$2,500 student grant but the current financial situation makes it necessary.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a press conference, Choi said the cancellation is expected to save around HK$2 billion annually, which is around two percent of the total education expenditure.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For when to remove the HK$2,500 [student grant] will be the right time, I think there's never a good time to do that, but we are still considering the present financial situation. We have to make a decision," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The education chief said measures are still in place to address the plight of underprivileged pupils and parents.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have different student financial assistance schemes and different resources from the working family financial assistance scheme. We are also considering increasing the flexibility of using different allowances or grants in the schools."
  <br>
  <br>
  Education sector lawmaker Chu Kwok-keung said in a statement that he was not consulted over discontinuing the subsidy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked who was consulted on the measure, Choi said officials don't share specific details about the budget with individual lawmakers.
  <br>
  <br>
  She added that officials talked to different stakeholders about which measures they wanted to keep if spending cuts were needed.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Innovation, Technology and Industry Sun Dong on Thursday said a new Hong Kong AI Research and Development Institute could commence operation as early as next year.
 <br>
  <br>
  Financial Secretary Paul Chan announced in his budget speech on Wednesday that the government will earmark HK$1 billion for the institute's establishment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters, Sun said the institute will not only advance AI research, but also promote its application across various sectors, including innovation and technology, finance, healthcare and government services.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the goal is for the institute to take a leadership role in these areas, and generate business opportunities for the local industry.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The institute will focus on facilitating upstream R&D, midstream and downstream transformation of R&D outcomes and expanding application scenarios. So in terms of the goal and the scale, this AI R&D institute is different from the current InnoHK centre, HKGAI (Hong Kong Generative AI Research and Development Center)," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The AI institute will be established based on the existing HKGAI centre. In the future, we will gradually integrate the InnoHK centre, HKGAI, into the newly established AI research institute."
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, in response to suggestions from lawmakers that Hong Kong should attract the mainland AI company DeepSeek to the city, Sun said all domestic and international AI companies are welcome.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that the recently launched large language model HKGAI V1, the SAR's first locally developed generative artificial intelligence, already incorporates DeepSeek-related technology.

    Govt won't rely on land sales for revenue: Paul Chan
   </title>

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan said on Thursday that the government no longer wants to rely heavily on land sales as a main source of revenue.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chan made the comment when lawmaker Chow Man-kwong asked him whether officials can come up with measures to boost the market so that it isn't "overly cold".
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a Legco Finance Committee meeting discussing the new budget, Chan said officials hope that homes will be more affordable for the people.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the past, land sales were one of the main sources of government revenue that supported other kinds of development. This led to a surge in property prices because of a lack of supply," the minister said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We no longer want to see the SAR over-rely on land sales revenue. We need to develop the economy so that salaries and profits taxes and other forms of revenue are more important."
  <br>
  <br>
  New People's Party lawmaker Dominic Lee asked whether the Kau Yi Chau Artificial Islands project, previously known as Lantau Tomorrow Vision, is "dead", being as there is no mention of it in the budget.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said officials are prioritising the Northern Metropolis project, while stressing that ongoing studies relating to the artificial islands will continue.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We want to focus on the Northern Metropolis, putting in every effort to speed up that project. Lantau Tomorrow is ranked behind the metropolis for sure," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Business and Professionals Alliance lawmaker Jeffrey Lam, meanwhile, said businesspeople he has spoken to think the proposed HK$200 airport departure tax is too expensive, saying flight tickets to some nearby cities only cost that much.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lam was also among several councillors who questioned whether a land departure tax for private cars is necessary, arguing that it would go against the desire for Hong Kong to integrate further with other Greater Bay Area cities.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said the HK$80 increase in the airport departure tax is only minor.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also said transport officials have received various feedback on the land departure tax, and the government does not have a finalised plan at this moment.

    HKU and CUHK to get 60 more medical training places

<img alt="CUHK says it will announce details for the “second degree entry track” in due course. Photo courtesy of CUHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1793464_1_20250227125822.jpg&q=65">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Education Bureau said that medical schools at Chinese University (CUHK) and the University of Hong Kong (HKU) would have 60 more training places in the next academic year.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a paper submitted to the Legislative Council, the bureau said 50 places would be reserved for CUHK and HKU to introduce a new entry track for bachelor’s degree holders who want to pursue medicine as their second degree.
  <br>
  <br>
  It added the remaining 10 places would be allocated to the universities’ existing medicine programmes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The document also stated the number of first-year undergraduates for the eight publicly-funded universities would remain at 15,000 for each year in the 2025-28 triennium.
  <br>
  <br>
  In response to questions from RTHK, CUHK said it would announce details for the “second degree entry track” in due course.
  <br>
  <br>
  Financial Secretary Paul Chan announced in his budget address on Wednesday that the number of medical training places would increase to 650 in total in the 2025-26 academic year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Medical sector lawmaker David Lam said the increase was in line with his expectations, noting it was part of the bureau's ongoing plan to raise medical student intake.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lam said while there was a need for more doctors in view of an ageing population, medical schools cannot increase the number of training places drastically in the short run.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We need to step up the teaching facilities in the universities and maintain a good number of teaching staff. Students also have to learn the clinical skills at the bedside on patients, which means we need enough hospitals to teach our students, and we need enough doctors, clinicians to mentor our students," he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "All these takes time to prepare. That's why the increase has to be gradual."

    FS shoots down levy for all outbound travellers
   </title>

<img alt="" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1793462_2_20250227135507.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Thursday said a proposed levy on private cars departing Hong Kong is aimed at clawing back government spending on cross-boundary facilities, while dismissing the idea of a fee for all outbound travellers over the potential impact on the public.
 <br>
  <br>
  During a radio phone-in programme, Chan fielded questions from callers on a wide range of cost-cutting measures detailed in his budget, including tweaks to the HK$2 transport subsidy scheme for the over 60s and the phasing-out of a HK$2,500 student grant.
  <br>
  <br>
  A caller surnamed Wong said he was confused about the plan to charge private car drivers HK$200 to cross the border, a move the government says should raise about HK$1 billion a year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "What kind of private cars will be levied? If you’re talking about cross-boundary vehicles with closed road permits, usually they have companies set up on the mainland and travel for business purposes," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If you wish to boost revenue, why not tax travellers who leave the city via land border control points?"
  <br>
  <br>
  In response, Chan said quite a lot of money has been spent on cross-boundary facilities, including the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Can we recover some of those costs? That is one of our considerations. Currently we're still in the research stage, and everyone can give their views so the Transport and Logistics Bureau and the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau will consider them," he replied.
  <br>
  <br>
  As for a departure tax for all travellers at land crossings, Chan said such a move would have quite a large impact on the general public, and this should be "avoided as much as possible".
  <br>
  <br>
  Another caller was upset with the scrapping of the HK$2,500 student grant, which has been given out annually to the parents of children in kindergartens and primary or secondary schools since 2019.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Didn't the government tell people to have more children? You cancelled this subsidy, but at the same time provide half a month of extra payment to recipients of social security and Old Age Allowance … What are the middle class like us supposed to do?” asked a woman surnamed Chan.
  <br>
  <br>
  The financial chief acknowledged her concerns, but stressed that public resources should go to those most in need.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Right now, this HK$2,500 does not require any means test and everyone is eligible … so we think if we were to cut down on expenditure, it has to come from these areas," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, proposed tweaks to the HK$2 transport scheme for the over 60s also drew a lot of feedback.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Why cap the number of trips at 240 per month, instead of raising the concessionary fare to HK$3 or HK$4?" asked a man surnamed Leung.
  <br>
  <br>
  In response, the FS said he wanted to keep the cheapest discounted fares at HK$2 because the scheme is widely recognised by society and encourages the elderly to go out more often.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But by capping the number of trips at 240 [per month], we can limit the future expenditure growth. In the short term, we can even save money when the adjustments are implemented in 2027 or 2028," he said.

 Abraham Ancer is gearing up to defend his LIV Golf Hong Kong title this March, eager to relive the unforgettable moments from last year’s tournament.
 <br>
  <br>
  Ancer secured his first individual victory on the LIV Golf tour in a dramatic playoff against Australia’s Cameron Smith and England’s Paul Casey at the Hong Kong Golf Club.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Mexican golfer said that playing in Fanling is not only enjoyable but steeped in rich history.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's really fun and you have to be extremely accurate, not necessarily hitting it very far, but it's like playing chess, you really have to pick your battles and know when to attack and when to hold back," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I like that kind of golf where you have to think about what you're going to do off the tee, so [Hong Kong] will always be a super special place for me."
  <br>
  <br>
  Bryson DeChambeau, the 2024 US Open champion, is also eager to return to Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  As captain of Crushers GC, he aims to lead his team in defending their title from last season, and deliver an exciting performance for the fans in the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong loves their golf, and they thrive around golf. It was cool to see that last year, how much they embraced all of us and really wanted us to be there and just loved every second of it," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It’s going to be a lot of fun going back there, being the US Open champion, hopefully [we will be] showing some fireworks and winning. I want to win this year."
  <br>
  <br>
  The tournament at the Hong Kong Golf Club will be the third event of the League's 2025 season taking place from March 7 to 9.

    '99pc of people won't exceed new HK$2 scheme limits'

 An Executive Councillor on Thursday said most of Hong Kong's senior citizens will not be affected by changes to the city's fare concessionary scheme for the over 60s.
 <br>
  <br>
  As announced in Wednesday's budget, instead of a flat fare of HK$2, eligible commuters will have to pay 20 percent of any standard fare exceeding HK$10.
  <br>
  <br>
  The scheme will also be capped at 240 trips per month, which works out at an average of roughly eight per day.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lam Ching-choi, who formerly chaired the Elderly Commission, was speaking to RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Only a small percentage of them, they might travel quite a lot because actually, we set the limit quite liberally, I don't think it will affect most individuals who are just trying to visit their grandchildren, or going to work" he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "On average, I believe 99 percent of individuals won't exceed the limit," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Wednesday said this fine-tuned proposal preserves the government's policy intent while striking a balance between enhancing the sustainability of the scheme and minimising the impacts to beneficiaries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Government sources said the new arrangements are expected to come into force in September 2026.
