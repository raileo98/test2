<img alt="Rosanna Law said she and other officials from her bureau will go all out to ensure the first Rugby Sevens to be held at Kai Tak is a success.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Sports chief Rosanna Law said on Wednesday that parties involved in the Hong Kong Rugby Sevens tournament to be held later this month have to liaise and communicate closely for the Kai Tak event to be considered a success.
 <br>
  <br>
  The annual extravaganza is moving to the Kai Tak Sports Park for the first time, having been held at the Hong Kong Stadium for decades.
  <br>
  <br>
  Law's reassurance came after lawmakers in a Legislative Council meeting asked why officials, the sports park and organisers of a snooker tournament earlier this month had come up with different versions about wrong information given out to people at the event.
  <br>
  <br>
  Paul Tse cited incidents where spectators were told they had to leave before midnight and a sign wrongly showed that there was a "curfew" in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  Describing the tournament as "a Cinderella event," Tse said it's important for authorities to clean up their act up at the sevens for a better fan experience.
  <br>
  <br>
  For his part, Roundtable lawmaker Michael Tien expressed concern over whether the government could get the sports park to have a designated spokesperson in time for the sevens, which will kick off in less than 10 days.
  <br>
  <br>
  In response, Law said the park is actively looking into this and that officials are paying close attention in a bid to minimise the risks of problems popping up.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The organisers and government departments will have to work hand in hand. This is no exception. On top of that, this is a new venue. We need enhanced communications," she told the lawmakers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The sports commissioner, permanent secretaries and I myself are all involved. We have been in close communication with the operator. We want the Rugby Sevens to be a successful event."
  <br>
  <br>
  A bar association had earlier complained that it was unable to host a bar festival in Kai Tak during the tournament, saying it didn't have enough time to obtain licences.
  <br>
  <br>
  Law said the administration is willing to streamline procedures and offer as much help to different parties as possible when it comes to hosting mega events.
  <br>
  <br>
  She stressed the authorities never received a formal application, and that she personally checked and found that had the association applied, there would have been enough time for a licence to be approved.

    PolyU 'to shoulder cost of third medical school'

<img alt="Polytechnic University has hailed its 45 years of experience in nurturing medical professionals as it states the case for its bid for the third medical school.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Polytechnic University (PolyU) on Wednesday said it will shoulder the cost of developing Hong Kong's third medical school when necessary.
 <br>
  <br>
  The publicly-funded university in Hung Hom is among three candidates that have submitted proposals to the government.
  <br>
  <br>
  The planned medical school, along with a teaching and research hospital, is expected to be located in the Northern Metropolis.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lam Tai-fai, the university's council chairman, said in a press conference that PolyU could shoulder all expenses of the new medical school before it opens in the new development area.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will go hand-in-hand with the government to develop this third medical school... Regarding the detailed figure, we will let everybody know once it's ready," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  President Teng Jin-guang noted PolyU has been offering a number of healthcare programmes in almost half of a century that produced more than 50,000 graduates, which he described as a key strength of the university.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added artificial intelligence will feature prominently.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The future medical service will rely heavily on AI-powered devices and systems," he said. "The design of the new medical school, particularly its pedagogy, will make full use of AI, so students will be able to pursue their studies more independently."
  <br>
  <br>
  The university has pulled in a number of outside advisors to help with its bid, including leading Chinese infectious disease expert Zhong Nanshan, former health chief York Chow and Nobel laureate Barry Marshall.
  <br>
  <br>
  Baptist University and the University of Science and Technology have also expressed their interest in running the city's third medical school.
  <br>
  <br>
  Interviews with the three universities are planned for the second quarter, with the evaluation process expected to conclude within the year.

    Govt moves to boost healthcare data sharing

<img alt="The government hopes healthcare providers will proactively upload their patients' records onto the " src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796401_2_20250319135402.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government said it plans to amend the law to help boost the development of its one-stop “eHealth” platform.
 <br>
  <br>
  The government-developed platform, launched in 2016, enables the sharing of electronic health records among healthcare providers in both the public and private sectors, while also letting people access their own records.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the Health Bureau said almost all data in the system currently comes from the public sector, and some private healthcare providers struggle to link their internal system with the eHealth system. Officials also said some private clinics believe patients' records are their personal assets, and are reluctant to share their data.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under proposed changes to the Electronic Health Record Sharing Ordinance, the secretary for health will be empowered to require all healthcare providers to enter important data into their patients' eHealth accounts.
  <br>
  <br>
  These include prescription, diagnosis, allergies and adverse drug reactions, immunisation records, as well as laboratory and radiology reports.
  <br>
  <br>
  Healthcare providers failing to meet such requirements could face a fixed fine of HK$1,500 and be prosecuted for a fine of up to HK$50,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bureau also proposed simplifying the consent mechanism, so when individuals open an eHealth account, they automatically grant healthcare providers the right to upload their health records to the system.
  <br>
  <br>
  But to access the records, healthcare providers must still obtain a separate approval from the individuals.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bureau is also looking into allowing some recognised healthcare providers on the mainland to provide and receive data across the border.
  <br>
  <br>
  But these non-Hong Kong healthcare providers would only have temporary access, and must obtain explicit consent from their patients.
  <br>
  <br>
  The administration also hopes to expand access to eHealth to more healthcare professionals, including speech therapists and dietitians as well as those working in facilities managed by the government.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a closed-door media briefing, Deputy Secretary for Health Sam Hui explained that the government hopes to establish a proper legal framework through the amendment bill and that the changes won't take effect until the market is ready.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also said the government is working closely with healthcare groups and third-party service providers, to help with the integration of electronic systems.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bill will be gazetted on Friday and brought to the Legislative Council for a first reading next Wednesday.

    Two EMSD staff, supplier charged with fraud

<img alt="The trio are charged with conspiracy to defraud, and the ICAC said more charges could be laid against the trio. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796388_1_20250319122707.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The ICAC said on Wednesday two frontline staff from the Electrical and Mechanical Services Department and a supplier have been charged with conspiracy to defraud.
 <br>
  <br>
  The three are two EMSD works supervisors, Tsang Tak-keung, 57, and Yip Wai-ho, 51, and Cheung Chun-kit, 66, who is the sole operator of three suppliers, namely Leader Med Technology, Hi Quali Trading and Smartechnique Services.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tsang and Yip were responsible for contacting suppliers to get quotations for machinery parts and compiling internal quotation vetting documents for maintenance services to Queen Elizabeth Hospital and Yau Ma Tei Jockey Club Polyclinic.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Independent Commission Against Corruption said investigations revealed that Tsang allegedly accepted over 80 gifts worth a total of over HK$500,000 from Cheung, while Yip allegedly took more than 20 gifts worth about HK$800,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  The gifts included luxurious watches, handbags, jewelry, household appliances and digital products.
  <br>
  <br>
  In return, Tsang and Yip allegedly placed HK$13 million worth of purchase orders with the suppliers over a seven-year period from 2017 to 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  One of the cases took place between January 2020 and June 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tsang and Cheung are alleged to have conspired to get the EMSD to make payments to the three companies by falsely claiming they were the lowest bidders.
  <br>
  <br>
  That ended with the EMSD awarding around 180 purchase orders worth more than HK$8 million to Cheung’s companies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yip and Cheung are also alleged to have conspired in this case with defrauding the EMSD between January 2017 and last June in a similar manner, allowing Cheung’s companies to secure around 140 purchase orders worth about HK$5.6 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The trio had allegedly inflated the quantity and the price of the machinery parts in some of the purchase orders, while some other purchase orders were fabricated,” the ICAC said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The trio will appear in the West Kowloon Magistrates’ Courts this afternoon for mention.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ICAC said more charges could be laid against the trio.

 Ocean Park said on Wednesday its cable car services were suspended due to signal issues, and facilities at its upper park were closed temporarily.
 <br>
  <br>
  With the Ocean Express already suspended from Monday to Friday this week due to annual maintenance, there was no transport service between the lower and upper parks.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Visitors can continue to enjoy park facilities at The Waterfront. We apologise for any inconvenience caused," Ocean Park wrote in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  To ensure visitor safety, the park said the cable car system will be thoroughly inspected before resuming.

    'Joint property management key for older buildings'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Secretary for Home and Youth Affairs said the joint property management scheme will help homeowners to better manage and maintain their assets.
 <br>
  <br>
  The one-year pilot scheme, which was unveiled in last year's Policy Address, will commence as soon as June in four districts: Yau Tsim Mong, Sham Shui Po, Kowloon City and Tsuen Wan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under the scheme, a number of companies will handle the property management for clusters of aged buildings, with the minimum requirement of two, so that the so-called "three nil buildings," which do not have owners' corporation, property management services or resident organisations, can enjoy basic services at affordable prices.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on RTHK's Overview Policy programme, Alice Mak pointed out that now's the right time to kick start the scheme.
  <br>
  <br>
  This is because the building management professional service scheme, which aims to allow "three-nil buildings" to set up owners' corporations with the help of NGOs, has been regularised and expanded to cover all districts in the SAR, she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mak pointed out that a property management firm will help homeowners tackle a lot of minor problems.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If there's an owners' corporation, and we look for a professional property management firm through the scheme to help with building management, and deal with minor issues to prevent delays and things getting worse, homeowners can save a lot of time and money," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, care teams will get 50 percent more funding in their next term of service.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mak noted that the government will review their service scope, as well as offer training to the members.
  <br>
  <br>
  But no matter how we train them, they cannot replace professional departments to offer services, she stressed.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Five primary school pupils who took part in an exchange tour on the mainland have fallen ill with gastroenteritis, adding to a string of similar cases in the past few weeks.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Centre for Health Protection said on Tuesday it was investigating the latest cluster involving pupils from SKH St Michael's Primary School in North Point.
  <br>
  <br>
  The five were part of a group of 70 students and teachers who visited Xi'an between March 11 and 14.
  <br>
  <br>
  Health authorities said one of the five developed symptoms of acute gastroenteritis such as vomiting on the last day of the tour. Four others sitting nearby the pupil who first fell ill began showing similar symptoms two days later.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two sought medical attention but none required hospitalisation, officials said, adding their symptoms matched that of a norovirus infection.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The centre's preliminary investigation results show that the cases are likely to be infected through person-to-person transmission or an environment contaminated by vomit," it said.

  A number of secondary school pupils have come down with gastroenteritis after visiting the mainland on exchange tours, with the government forming a task force to look into the recent outbreak.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Education Bureau has reminded schools that have upcoming exchange tours to learn about the latest information on disease prevention and control, a spokesperson said.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to the bureau's website on national education activities, it has urged schools to "avoid providing higher-risk food such as raw and cold food, siu mei and shellfish seafood when organising student exchange activities [on] the mainland".
  <br>
  <br>
  It has also asked contactors of exchange programmes across the border who help to organise trips to stop supplying such dishes.

    'Funding cut won't affect non-local student tuition'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Education authorities on Tuesday stressed that plans to slash funding for universities does not translate to a rise in tuition fees for non-local students as a source of income.
 <br>
  <br>
  The government had announced plans to reduce public university funding by HK$2.8 billion over the next three academic years.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a Legislative Council panel meeting, education minister Christine Choi was asked if universities would raise fees for non-local students because of the cut.
  <br>
  <br>
  Choi said non-local students' tuition fee adjustments are not linked with the income of a university.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Even if we increase the funding for universities, they will not lower the tuition for non-local students, so when non-local students come to Hong Kong to study – regardless of the change in our funding for universities – the tuition level is decided based on the cost of individual programmes," Choi said.
  <br>
  <br>
  As part of funding changes to publicly-financed universities, the institutions need to return HK$4 billion from their General and Development Reserve Fund to the government in a one-off special arrangement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Universities would not be seriously affected with the move leaving them with around four months worth of reserves, Choi said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's jobless rate has increased slightly as authorities warned about the "uncertainties" caused by US trade protection measures going forward.
 <br>
  <br>
  Data released by the Census and Statistics Department on Tuesday showed that the city's unemployment rate increased  by 0.1 percentage point to 3.2 percent in the three-month period ending February.
  <br>
  <br>
  The underemployment rate, however, stood steady at 1.1 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another 1,600 people lost their jobs, taking the total to 111,700 in the December-February period, while the total number of those underemployed dropped by some 2,300 to stand at 40,700.
  <br>
  <br>
  The jobless rate rises were mostly seen in the food and beverages, transport, construction and professional and business service sectors, excluding cleaning.
  <br>
  <br>
  Commenting on the latest data, Secretary for Labour and Welfare Chris Sun noted there were "diverse movements" in terms of the jobless rates in various sectors but that the rates "generally stayed low."
  <br>
  <br>
  He cautioned that "the labour market should remain largely stable in the near term amidst continued economic expansion, though some businesses would be affected by the uncertainties stemming from US trade protection measure."
  <br>
  <br>
  Sun's remarks came as the city's total employment number dropped by about 7,100 to more than 3.7 million, and total labour force decreased by about 5,400 to stand at 3.82 million last month.

    Hotter weather expected this year: Observatory

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Observatory on Tuesday said residents can expect hotter weather this year due to the continuing impact of climate change.
 <br>
  <br>
  It predicted that up to eight tropical cyclones will enter the city’s 500-kilometre warning radius from June or earlier.
  <br>
  <br>
  The forecaster also said Hong Kong will be affected by rainstorms and localised heavy rain, despite predicting annual rainfall to be within the normal range.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In general, the temperatures in Hong Kong are on a rising trend in the past few years. In fact, in the last year, we have the highest wind temperature in Hong Kong. And it's a result of urbanisation and also the effect of climate change," said observatory director Chan Pak-wai.
  <br>
  <br>
  Looking back at 2024, the observatory noted that it was the warmest year recorded globally, and that Hong Kong also recorded 11 months that were warmer than usual.
  <br>
  <br>
  The annual mean maximum and minimum temperatures were 27.3 and 22.8 degrees Celsius respectively, which were the highest and second highest on record.
  <br>
  <br>
  The forecaster also pointed out that sudden changes in the weather like on March 15, when it issued a hail warning and the first Amber rainstorm warning signal this year, are common in spring.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said people should take note of push notifications from the observatory's mobile app to get immediate weather updates.

    ERB to offer new courses to highly educated trainees

<img alt="The Employees Retraining Board says it has been actively promoting skills-based training. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796244_1_20250318161327.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Employees Retraining Board (ERB) on Tuesday said it will step up collaboration with tertiary institutions this year to provide advanced courses for people with a higher education level.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Chief Executive announced in his Policy Address last year plans to reform the ERB, and the board has since January expanded its service targets to include the entire local labour workforce, disregarding their education level.
  <br>
  <br>
  The board said since it expanded its coverage, about 4,000 people with a bachelor's or a higher-level degree have applied for ERB courses, making up about 12 percent of the total number of applications it received over the first two months of the year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Its chairman Yu Pang-chun said the ERB has been actively promoting skills-based training to help people acquire new skills.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[The ERB] strengthens its collaboration with tertiary institutions, broadens its network of training bodies to include institutions with extensive training experience, thereby supporting trainees with different educational attainments and background to pursue lifelong learning," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The board said it will work with the Hang Seng University, the University of Hong Kong's School of Professional and Continuing Education, and the Education University's Institute of Professional and Vocational Education and Lifelong Learning this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Its executive director Byron Ng said the advanced courses may include the application of artificial intelligence models in various industries.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With the expansion of our service targets, including the higher educated working population, more higher educated trainees can benefit from our courses, which include, of course, digital and technological courses," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The board also revealed it expects to provide about 165,000 training places in 2025-26, and that it will submit its long-term plan to the government in the fourth quarter.

    22 arrested over alleged mortgage referral bribes

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The ICAC on Tuesday said 22 people have been arrested on suspicion of accepting bribes and helping intermediaries defraud banks of mortgage referral fees.
 <br>
  <br>
  The case involved over 200 mortgage applications and more than HK$2 million in bribes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Those arrested, aged between 31 and 58, include 18 frontline staff from 10 local banks.
  <br>
  <br>
  In one of the cases, a married couple who worked at banks allegedly received HK$600,000 in bribes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Grace Yee, a principal investigator with the Independent Commission Against Corruption, explained how the fraud scheme worked.
  <br>
  <br>
  "During the investigation, the ICAC found that frontline bank staff had accepted bribes from intermediaries by secretly slipping referral forms into the mortgage loan documents that borrowers needed to sign," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This made it appear as if customers who were directly applying for mortgage loans had come through intermediary referrals, allowing the intermediaries to fraudulently obtain referral fees from the banks."
  <br>
  <br>
  However, Yee said she believes the case only involves a few bad apples at individual banks and that Hong Kong's banking sector as a whole remains clean.

    Vaping devices ban sought to stop space oil drug use

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The chairman of the Hong Kong Council on Smoking and Health on Tuesday called on the government to ban the possession of e-cigarettes devices.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on an RTHK radio programme, Henry Tong said the situation with teenagers taking the space oil drug is worrying.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said teachers and parents find it hard to spot students taking the drug, which is usually inhaled through vaping devices.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tong noted that e-cigarettes make it easy to easy to hide abuse of the drug as, unlike with the distinctive smell of traditional cigarettes, the space oil drug offers different flavours such as fruit and chocolate.
  <br>
  <br>
  He emphasised that the government should proceed with all haste in implementing the ban.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Security Bureau said 300 people reportedly took the drug last year, with 75 percent of them aged below 21.
  <br>
  <br>
  There was a greater incidence of the cases in North district, Yuen Long and Tuen Mun.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ng Sing-chin, chairman of Tuen Mun District Secondary School Heads Association, said on the same show that the number of reported space oil cases in these places might be due to their higher number of students.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also said the participation rate for the "Healthy School Programme," an anti-drug education initiative that comes with voluntary drug testing, varies among districts.
  <br>
  <br>
  For instance, while more than 90 percent of the schools in Tai Po have already signed up for the scheme, only a few schools among the dozens in other districts have done so.
  <br>
  <br>
  He told RTHK there might be a reason why some schools decided not to join the programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think that maybe for schools, anti-drug education might not be a high priority. Because actually there were only a very low number of students taking drugs. It's a minority. Therefore, teachers' time and efforts might be on education," he said
  <br>
  <br>
  "In recent years, we care a lot about students' mental health and emotions, and they might focus more on these areas."
  <br>
  <br>
  Ng emphasised that rather than mainly relying on tests to tell if a student is on drug, the priority should be on teachers' observation and peer support.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Shares in Chinese EV giant BYD surged to a record high on Tuesday after it unveiled new battery technology it says can charge a vehicle in the same time it takes to fill up a petrol car.
 <br>
  <br>
  The company said the battery and charging system, called "Super e-Platform," boasted peak speeds of 1,000 kW, allowing cars to travel up to 470 kilometres after being plugged in for just five minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The new technology aims to "fundamentally solve users' charging anxiety," according to founder Wang Chuanfu.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our pursuit is to make the charging time of electric vehicles as short as the refuelling time of fuel vehicles," he said at the launch.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong-listed shares in BYD jumped more than six percent to hit a fresh peak at one point on Tuesday before paring some of the gains.
  <br>
  <br>
  The announcement positions BYD ahead of arch-rival Tesla, whose Superchargers currently offer charging speeds of 500 kW.
  <br>
  <br>
  BYD introduced the Super e-Platform alongside two new EV models that will be the first to feature the system: the Han L sedan and the Tang L SUV.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Shenzhen-based company also unveiled plans to build more than 4,000 ultra-fast charging stations nationwide to support the new technology.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ambitious expansion comes on the heels of remarkable growth, with February sales soaring 161 percent to more than 318,000 electric vehicles.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Tesla experienced a steep 49 percent sales decline in the Chinese market during the same period. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee announced on Tuesday that the Legislative Council general election will be held on December 7.
 <br>
  <br>
  He also said three months prior to the poll, a by-election would be held for the Election Committee tasked with nominating and electing 40 Legco members.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee noted that of the 967 elected members in the 1,500-strong committee, there are 90 vacancies and there's a need to fill them in a by-election set for September 7.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CE said electoral officials will provide more details later, such as the nomination periods.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I have directed the Constitutional and Mainland Affairs Bureau to prepare for the elections, and collaborate closely with the Electoral Affairs Commission," Lee said ahead of the weekly Executive Council meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the Constitutional and Mainland Affairs Bureau and the Electoral Affairs Commission will work on vote counting, data systems and security, among other tasks, to ensure everything goes smoothly.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Legco election will return 90 lawmakers for the eighth legislature since the SAR's establishment, and it's the second poll since the national legislature passed a decision to improve Hong Kong's electoral system four years ago.

    'Changes in checkpoints for drivers need coordination'

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday said any changes to cross-border driving arrangements must prioritise traffic management and require careful coordination with mainland authorities.
 <br>
  <br>
  Currently, cross-boundary private cars are only allowed to use designated border checkpoints for entry and exit.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference vice-chairman and former chief executive CY Leung called the arrangement unreasonable, saying such vehicles should be able to use different ports to travel in and out.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee told reporters the government must ensure smooth traffic flow at all checkpoints when it considers any changes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "One consideration that we have to take into account is that if there aren't any regulations or controls, some of the ports that provide more convenience may see serious traffic congestion and the congestion may affect the urban areas," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee said any changes would require cooperation between local and mainland authorities since cross-border control points involve traffic management on both sides.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since 2023, some private cars and cross-boundary coaches have been permitted to use different control points, Lee noted.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CE said members of his administration would continue to work with their mainland counterparts and study potential new arrangements that align with people's expectations.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee said concerns expressed over CK Hutchison’s deal to sell its global port operations to a US consortium are worthy of "serious attention," saying foreign governments should provide a fair environment for deal-making.
 <br>
  <br>
  He made the comment on Tuesday when asked about Beijing officials re-posting of articles criticising the deal, which also included the selling of the firm's operations at the Panama Canal.
  <br>
  <br>
  The sale came after US President Donald Trump reportedly asked the military to draw up plans to ensure American access of the canal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ahead of the weekly Executive Council meeting, Lee said foreign governments should ensure that global trades are made in a fair manner.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Hong Kong SAR government urges foreign governments to provide a fair and just environment for enterprises, including enterprises from Hong Kong," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We oppose the abusive use of coercion or bullying tactics in international economic and trade relations."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee added that the SAR government will ensure that any transactions are made in accordance with the law.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, CK Hutchison and CK Assets announced that they will not hold press and investors briefings on Thursday, when they release annual results.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A special admission scheme that makes it easier for guests from 10 Asean nations to visit Hong Kong will start on Tuesday, Chief Executive John Lee has announced.
 <br>
  <br>
  Such guests include those who have made significant economic contributions to the SAR or been invited to important events.
  <br>
  <br>
  They can enjoy fast immigration clearance through self-service gates and have a special counter to handle their visas and paperwork.
  <br>
  <br>
  They can stay for two or more months and enjoy these benefits for three years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking ahead of the weekly Executive Council meeting, Lee said the move is aimed at strengthening the city's ties with Asean countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Now this special scheme will facilitate the attendance of talent from Asean member states in our important meetings and facilitate their investments in Hong Kong, thus encouraging them to use Hong Kong as a springboard to go global," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asean is one of Hong Kong's closest economic partners and the city's second-largest trading partner in merchandise trade, Lee added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Chief Executive said the Commerce and Economic Development Bureau and the Department of Justice will start sending out invitations to business and legal leaders.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) is investigating a gastroenteritis cluster among secondary students who participated in an exchange tour to Xiamen last week.
 <br>
  <br>
  The latest cluster involves six secondary students who were part of a group of 36 teachers and students from a secondary school in the Kwun Tong district.
  <br>
  <br>
  The exchange tour took place between March 13 and 15, during which the six students started developing symptoms.
  <br>
  <br>
  Five of them sought medical attention in Xiamen, and none were hospitalised.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Preliminary epidemiological investigations revealed that all six affected persons had not consumed any common food items other than the group meals and had no other common exposure history in Hong Kong prior to their departure," the statement said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hence, at this stage, the CHP could not rule out the possibility that the cases were infected by consuming contaminated food."
  <br>
  <br>
  The CHP is investigating the source of the outbreak and has collected stool specimens for testing, while also coordinating with mainland health authorities regarding the implicated restaurants.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Education Bureau said it has instructed organising institutions to stop using the affected dining venues.
  <br>
  <br>
  It has also reminded all organisers to immediately request that restaurants serving group meals refrain from offering high-risk foods like raw foods as well as cooked shellfish.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bureau also said that that all participants of the tour have returned to Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the CHP said that three more students have developed gastroenteritis symptoms following an exchange tour to Shaoguan earlier this month, raising the total number of students and teachers affected to 55.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The government said on Monday it received three proposals for establishing the city’s third medical institution.
 <br>
  <br>
  The proposals were submitted by Baptist University, Polytechnic University and the University of Science and Technology.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, the government said that the Task Group on New Medical School will evaluate the proposals according to the devised parameters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Task Group earlier agreed to adopt a holistic and comprehensive approach for evaluating the proposals submitted by universities from various perspectives, in accordance with the 10 key parameters set (including innovative strategic positioning, curriculum structure and assessment methodologies, and financial sustainability)," the statement said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The expert advisors and other members of the Task Group will conduct an in-depth evaluation of the proposals in their respective areas of expertise."
  <br>
  <br>
  The group added that interviews with the three universities are planned for the second quarter of this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also said that the evaluation process is expected to conclude within the year, with a recommendation to the government on the proposal best suited to train medical professionals and support Hong Kong’s development as an international hub for medical training, research and innovation.

 Police said three people have been arrested for their alleged involvement in a murder case in Fo Tan on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Officers said a 52-year-old man was attacked by two men on Lai Wo Lane. He was later certified dead at the Prince of Wales Hospital.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police raided a residential building in Mong Kok on Monday afternoon looking for the two assailants, but no arrests were made.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters later in the day, superintendent Li Muk-yik said a 76-year-old man and his 47-year-old son were arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to commit murder.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police said the pair planned the attack.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Both of them have a triad background. Police believe that the victim had serious disputes with the two over money," Li said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police are also looking for a suspected lookout at the scene, who is believed to have fled to the mainland.
  <br>
  <br>
  His 28-year-old girlfriend was taken into custody for allegedly assisting offenders and misleading officers.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 One of Hong Kong's richest people, Henderson Land founder Lee Shau-kee, has died at the age of 97.
 <br>
  <br>
  The property firm announced that Lee passed away peacefully on Monday evening surrounded by his family.
  <br>
  <br>
  Born into a small merchant's family in Guangdong province in 1928, he moved to Hong Kong in 1948 where he built his business empire and became one of the city's property tycoons.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee started his career in currency and gold trading.
  <br>
  <br>
  He became friends with prominent businessmen Kwok Tak-seng and Fung King-hey. Dubbed the "Three Musketeers", they founded Sun Hung Kai Properties in 1963.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee later left Sun Hung Kai Properties and founded Henderson Land in 1976.
  <br>
  <br>
  Henderson grew quickly to become one of Hong Kong's biggest developers, with a land bank currently totalling about 20 million square feet.
  <br>
  <br>
  His business empire also expanded beyond real estate, which includes Hong Kong and China Gas Company, or Towngas, and the Hong Kong Ferry Company.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee headed Henderson Land until 2019, when he handed over the reins to his sons Peter and Martin, as joint chairmen and managing directors.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to Forbes, the tycoon had a net worth of about US$30 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Affectionately known as "Uncle Four" for being the fourth child in his family, Lee was also renowned for his philanthropy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Through the Lee Shau Kee Foundation, he donated huge sums for scholarships as well as capital and education projects in Hong Kong and across China.
  <br>
  <br>
  One of his best-known mottos was "success isn't just about making money, but knowing how to spend."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chief Executive John Lee offered his condolences.
  <br>
  <br>
  He called Lee Shau-kee an outstanding business leader and entrepreneur who made significant contributions to Hong Kong's economic development, as well as its prosperity and stability.
  <br>
  <br>
  Henderson Land said announcements on funeral arrangements will be made later.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Triathletes from the SAR will try to book a spot in this year's National Games by competing in a selection race next month along Victoria Harbour.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Asia Triathlon Sprint Championships will take place on April 5 and 6.
  <br>
  <br>
  The race will start with a swim at the Central-Wan Chai Waterfront Promenade, followed by cycling around Lung Wo Road and the IFC, before ending the running portion at Tamar Park.
  <br>
  <br>
  This is the first time the SAR is hosting the Asia Championships and Mixed Relay Championships for adult athletes.
  <br>
  <br>
  SAR athlete Jason Ng said he hopes to take advantage of home turf to challenge a strong field of competitors.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think the Hong Kong team, as a generalisation, we have raced on this course for a handful of times now in the last of couple years, and I think we are beginning to know it quite well now, so I think just the experience on the course will give us a bit of an advantage," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other local athletes such as Oscar Coggins, Wong Tsz-to and Hilda Choi will be competing against international contenders from 13 Asian countries and regions.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Animal welfare groups on Monday held talks with MTR Corporation officials as the railway company looks into allowing pets on trains.
 <br>
  <br>
  Twenty groups under the Animal Welfare Advocacy Alliance, together with DAB lawmaker Edward Lau, made suggestions, such as a requirement for carrier bags for pets to be used.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other suggestions include allowing pets on board only during non-peak hours in the initial stage.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Most of them are concerned about odour issues. We also told the MTR officials to discuss and obtain advice from veterinarians and other professionals because they need to carry out investigations on the suitability of the ventilation system in Hong Kong," said Animal Rights And Welfare Association founder Susan Lai.
  <br>
  <br>
  "After all, the MTRC also needs to explore the need for stronger ventilation systems within the platforms," she said, citing the importance of balancing the rights of pets and their owners on the one hand and other commuters on the other.
  <br>
  <br>
  District councillor Corey Lau said regulations were also needed for pets and their owners using the trains.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There are some penalties we have suggested, not just fines but also the possibility of whether pet owners who do not follow regulations may be banned," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lau added that allowing pets on trains will be a milestone in turning Hong Kong into a pet-friendly city.
  <br>
  <br>
  In response, the railway company said it is committed to providing safe, reliable and comfortable railway services, and will consider and balance different factors.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said it will further communicate with various stakeholders.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Monday raided a building in Mong Kok, with sources saying the operation was linked to a murder case in Fo Tan the day before.
 <br>
  <br>
  A 52-year-old man was killed on Sunday after he was attacked by two knife-wielding men on Lai Wo Lane.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officers cordoned off King Hing Building at the junction of Argyle Street and Fa Yuen Street on Monday afternoon, in what's believed to be part of an investigation into the case.
  <br>
  <br>
  The building reopened later in the afternoon.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police did not say if any arrests were made.

    New transit route 'needs to seamlessly link Kai Tak'

<img alt="The proposed mass transit system will connect the Kai Tak MTR Station with the Kai Tak Cruise Terminal with six stations in total. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796048_1_20250317132335.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A think tank on Monday urged the government to give full play to undeveloped land along the planned elevated mass transit system in Kai Tak to connect the line "seamlessly" with buildings in the neighbourhood.
 <br>
  <br>
  Ryan Ip, vice-president and executive director of Our Hong Kong Foundation's public policy institute, also acknowledged it would be difficult to further reduce construction time, after the government said the system could be up and running three years earlier than expected.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I understand there are procedures on tendering, and there will be construction time... I think it is hard to push even ahead of 2031," Ip told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  The authorities recently revised their plan on building the 3.5-kilometre system between Kai Tak MTR Station and the Kai Tak Cruise Terminal, with a target for the route to be in service by 2031.
  <br>
  <br>
  Changes include adding one more stop and making it a six-station line, which Ip said provides an opportunity to improve the system's design.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There are two [plots of] commercial land that are still to be sold at that new station area, and I urge the government to take reference on what Singapore has done on its [Light Rail Transit] system to seamlessly connect or integrate the new stations with the commercial buildings nearby," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another revision put forward by officials was to keep the system at least 20 metres away from residential properties, instead of the 10 metres initially proposed.
  <br>
  <br>
  But according to Kowloon City District Councillor Jimmy Lam, privacy concerns still linger.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lam also urged authorities to look for ways to connect the Hong Kong Children's Hospital and the incoming New Acute Hospital with the proposed route.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said officials could take reference from the escalators and walkway system between Central and Mid-Levels.

<img alt="The Consumer Council says only three makeup bases that offer protection from the sun do not contain potential endocrine disruptors. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796050_1_20250317133301.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Consumer Council on Monday warned that some makeup bases can affect hormone levels, and people who are pregnant or are breastfeeding should avoid such products.
 <br>
  <br>
  Among the 37 primers it reviewed, 17 of them that claimed to offer protection against ultraviolet rays contained potential endocrine disruptors.
  <br>
  <br>
  The watchdog pointed out that aside from pregnant women and those who are breastfeeding, adolescents and children should also avoid using these products.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[Potential endocrine disruptors] will affect your hormone levels, your sex hormones, maybe possibly it will impair your fertility," the council’s chief executive Gilly Wong said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And also for newborns, it may [cause] genital malformation; for the young adolescents, possibly premature puberty as well."
  <br>
  <br>
  The watchdog found that only products that protect users from the sun made by Guerlain, Hourglass, and MAC are free from potential endocrine disruptors.
  <br>
  <br>
  The council also noted that 15 products it examined contained BHT, a type of antioxidant that helps to improve product stability.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said the substance could potentially lead to skin and eye irritation, according to studies conducted on animals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, the watchdog called on the public to be aware of alcohol concentrations and fragrance allergens in cosmetics, as they could lead to dryness and irritation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Users should test products by applying them on the inner wrist, it added.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Innovation and technology secretary Sun Dong said on Monday Hong Kong's I&T development was so rapid that the sector is already "in the fast lane."
 <br>
  <br>
  He made the comment in Beijing at a press conference on Monday about the upcoming two-day World Internet Conference Asia-Pacific Summit to be held in Wan Chai starting on April 14.
  <br>
  <br>
  It will mark the first time the summit is held outside mainland China.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sun said the hosting of the summit in Hong Kong shows that the SAR is, apart from being a hub for finance, trading and aviation, also making the mark in becoming a centre for global IT cooperation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In fact, for the future innovation and technology industry, Hong Kong has entered the fast lane. We have clearly stated that there is a need to focus on several advantageous areas, and they're related to digital economy," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted that in Hong Kong's IT development policy blueprint, areas such as artificial intelligence, data and robots have been earmarked as focal points for development.
  <br>
  <br>
  For his part, the conference's secretary general, Ren Xianliang, says the summit will discuss topics such as the development of AI models, lower costs and technological innovation.
  <br>
  <br>
  He described the introduction of AI model DeepSeek in January as changing the world's understanding of AI, saying it has provided different professions with unprecedented development momentum and room for creativity.

    Experts weigh in on extending cryopreservation storage

<img alt="Extending the storage of embryos and gamets could raise new issues for patients according to some fertility doctors. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796041_1_20250317124547.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A specialist in obstetrics and gynaecology said it remains uncertain whether patients will return for tailored counselling after storing their embryos or gametes for a certain period of time.
 <br>
  <br>
  The government is looking to make it a requirement for licensed centres under its proposal to lift the storage period restriction for frozen eggs, sperm or embryos.
  <br>
  <br>
  In an interview broadcast on
  <a href="https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/news-programmes/this-episode.htm?cmsid=77" target="_blank">
   <u>
    <b>
     RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme
    </b>
   </u>
  </a>
  ,
  <br>
  Dr Alice Wong, a council member of the Hong Kong Society for Reproductive Medicine, pointed out that present freezing technique allows embryos and gametes to be stored longer than the current limit of a decade.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Theoretically, with our present freezing technique we can freeze the embryos and eggs for much longer than 10 years... of course the problem is whether it is feasible for the woman to bear the pregnancy 17 years after [she freezes her eggs] so there are still other limitations," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  With the changes possible in the future, Wong believes people will consider freezing the embryos or gametes at an earlier age to harvest eggs with higher quality.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said this means that patients can undergo fewer harvest and thus, save money from carrying out the procedure.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under the proposed amendments, the government is also planing to make it mandatory for centres to provide patients information such as the risks of egg retrieval.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong, who's also the Vice President of the Obstetrical and Gynaecological Society of Hong Kong, pointed out that centres have already been doing so.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A local education concern group on Monday welcomed the government's decision to form a task force to look into a recent gastroenteritis outbreak among students who went on a mainland study tour in Guangdong.
 <br>
  <br>
  Education minister Christine Choi said the task force would review the arrangements of such trips, and liaise with their mainland counterparts.
  <br>

   </u>
  </a>
  , Mervyn Cheung, who chairs the Hong Kong Education Policy Concern Organisation, said the task force was necessary to ensure future school trips did not encounter similar problems.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The task force is badly needed... because these kinds of exchanges or study tours for students are becoming more and more frequent and, at the same time, they are quite important in the curriculum for schools," Cheung said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cheung said the task force must look at existing regulations to see if they need to be changed or improved to ensure the health and safety of students on school trips.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They need to review all the guidelines that are set for these kinds of study tours. And especially in relation to the vigilant maintenance of hygiene and safety standards for students during the tours... whether or not the existing provisions have already safeguarded the hygienic standards and the safety standards of the travel agencies that have been hired... all this should come under very strict scrutiny."

    Healthcare co-payment levels 'should be capped'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A former senior Hospital Authority official has called for caution in setting co-payment levels for healthcare services after the government said it'll consider charging patients separately for certain check-ups.
 <br>
  <br>
  Luk Che-chung, a former chief executive of the authority's Hong Kong East Cluster, also said on Monday that the authorities should cap medical expenses paid by patients.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Some medical services do cost a lot, especially self-financed items that often involve new drugs. They are expensive. If patients need financial assistance... there'll be procedures to undergo and thresholds to meet," Luk told an RTHK programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If there is a capping mechanism in the future – not only on the number of check-ups but also medical fees – I believe it will be a good thing for the public."
  <br>
  <br>
  The administration has said it's reviewing fees and charges for public hospital services, including charging for such services as CT scans and MRIs to prevent abuse. But emergency and hospitalised patients would be exempted.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials said they were hoping to adjust hospital fees to a level where there would be a "reasonable co-payment."
  <br>
  <br>
  Alex Lam, chairman of Hong Kong Patients' Voices, expressed concerns that some people might not be able to cope if a co-payment were to be introduced.
  <br>
  <br>
  “For people who are not eligible for the Comprehensive Social Security Assistance scheme or are not qualified as a result of means tests, they would rather not pay the several hundred or thousand dollars out of their own pocket even if it means they won't receive such services. In the end, their condition may get worse," Lam told the same programme.

    Nap on beds before purchasing: consumer watchdog

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Consumer Council on Monday encouraged people to nap on mattresses – some of which were found to provide inadequate support – before making a purchase.
 <br>
  <br>
  The watchdog made the advice after testing double mattresses from 14 brands that make pocket spring, interlocking spring, and foam models.
  <br>
  <br>
  It found one was too hard and could not conform to a person’s back, and more than half of them were unable to support side-sleepers effectively.
  <br>
  <br>
  The council's chief executive Gilly Wong said taking a trial nap on mattresses at stores could help people make smarter purchases.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We highly recommend don't be shy. [Do] try out different mattresses to test out how you feel after you sleep on it. We recommend at least ten to 15 minutes. Frankly speaking, the longer the better," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So if the shop allows you to sleep longer, sleep as long as you could so that you can get a good sense according to your sleeping pattern, no matter it's back sleeping or side sleeping," she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The council also revealed that pocket spring mattresses offered more stability than interlocking spring models, allowing two people to rest with fewer disturbances.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Choose [mattresses] according to your own and partner’s body shape, sleeping habits and posture," the council's report said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The watchdog also noted that prices do not necessarily reflect the quality of the mattress, as they found a more than double price difference for two pocket spring models of the same rating.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the watchdog reminded consumers to pay attention to their mattresses' warranty terms, after finding over half of them were eligible for free maintenance for the first one or two years of purchase.
  <br>
  <br>
  It urged sellers to clearly explain any post-purchase costs and warranty registration procedures.

  Police said they received reports that the incident took place after 5pm, at the junction of Lai Wo Lane and Sui Wo Road.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officers said the victim was allegedly attacked by two knife-wielding men, who later fled the scene on a taxi.
  <br>
  <br>

    Parents need more guidance on child abuse law: YMCA

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An NGO on Sunday said many parents are still unclear about an incoming law which makes it mandatory to report child abuse, adding that authorities should step up efforts to explain the legislation which comes into effect next year.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Chinese YMCA of Hong Kong polled over 2,500 parents from last July to November in a survey which found that two-thirds of them did not fully understand the Mandatory Reporting of Child Abuse Ordinance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Albert So, a lawyer who has been assisting the YMCA in holding activities regarding the legislation, said parents may not have had the chance to read up on the changes.
  <br>
  <br>
  “There are also lots of parents that are not local. They may be coming from the other jurisdictions, for example, some overseas ethnic minorities or people coming from mainland China,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Due to the cultural difference, [non-local parents] may not know about the situation of current legislation of Hong Kong," he said, adding more explanatory work, such as holding seminars and relevant activities, would improve the situation.
  <br>
  <br>
  The survey also revealed that almost 80 percent of the parents polled experienced mood swings when disciplining their children, and that about 30 percent of them believed a certain level of physical punishment could change their children’s behaviour.
  <br>
  <br>
  YMCA’s coordinating secretary Phoebe Sze says punishment has serious impacts on child development and should be discouraged.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We don't agree about using punishment to our children. It will harm their self-image in building their self-confidence, and may discourage their relationship with others. This would [also] discourage the children's exploration abilities.
  <br>
  <br>
  It called on parents to be more aware of their own emotions when taking care of their children and to seek help when needed.

    HK firms should strive for win-win deals: Starry Lee

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's sole delegate to the country's top legislature on Sunday said all Chinese people should do their part to help the nation’s development, and business exchanges are only sustainable if it is a win-win situation.
 <br>
  <br>
  Starry Lee made the comment when asked on a TVB programme about Beijing officials reposting articles criticising CK Hutchison's sale of its Panama Canal ports – and dozens of other ports across the globe – to a US consortium.
  <br>
  <br>
  She added that businesspeople and Hong Kong residents have always been able to create win-win situations for all parties.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The best way to approach matters is to create win-win situations. Because no matter if you're talking about doing business or having an exchange with other people, it's only sustainable if it's win-win and benefits both parties," the member of the National People's Congress Standing Committee said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We think Hong Kong people are always flexible. We've always been able to grasp the idea of creating win-win situations."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee, a former chairwoman of the DAB party, also said the Northern Metropolis development has been too slow, and the Hong Kong government can speed things up by creating what she called "an SAR within an SAR".
  <br>
  <br>
  She said such a development mode has been adopted on the mainland where officials would cut red tape and adopt a different set of vetting procedures for projects.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Sunday said the success of mainland film Ne Zha 2 has inspired his administration to continue breaking barriers and forging its own path.
 <br>
  <br>
  Writing on his Facebook page after watching the highest-grossing film in national box office history, Lee said the movie showcased the rapid advancement of the nation's animation technology.
  <br>
  <br>
  Citing a line from the movie, "If there is no path ahead, I will make one", Lee drew parallels between Ne Zha's determination and Hong Kong's approach to tackling long-standing issues.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This mirrors Hong Kong's recent vigorous reforms, as we continue to resolve long-standing issues one after another," he wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Similarly, my team and I tackle each challenge fearlessly, demonstrating breakthrough thinking."
  <br>
  <br>
  The chief executive concluded by expressing optimism about the city's film industry, citing the success of recent local productions and expressed the hope they would reach more viewers outside Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  The sequel to the 2019 blockbuster Ne Zha premiered in Hong Kong last month, topping the local box office for several days.

    3,000 compete in inaugural Kai Tak Run

<div class="itemFullText">
 More than 3,000 runners took part in the inaugural Kai Tak Run at the Kai Tak Sports Ground on Sunday morning.
 <br>
  <br>
  Runners jogged past major facilities of the new sports ground, such as the Kai Tak Arena, with organisers saying participants were able to admire the design of the new venues and take in the nearby scenery.
  <br>
  <br>
  The event featured over eight races, including an elite, and open category.
  <br>
  <br>
  Matthew Yu, who competed at the event said he enjoyed the route. "It's very innovative, and it's something new."
  <br>
  <br>
  "We usually [race] through the streets during marathons, Tolo Harbour, or along cycling tracks in Tai Po. It's the first time for me to [race] in a large sports facility, and seeing the view from inside is a new experience for me," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Yu, who was competing in a wheelchair, also expressed the hope organisers could look into the possibility of allowing those in wheelchairs to compete alongside other groups.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think it would be better to allow us to participate alongside people in the other races, such as by having both groups start together. We could then enjoy the atmosphere together. I also think this would help promote disability inclusion," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yiu Hong-lai, the winner of the five-kilometre elite category race also said she enjoyed the race track.
  <br>
  <br>
  The runner said the route offered some challenges, such as slopes and U-turns, which tested runners' strength and ability to change directions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Also at the event was lawmaker Vincent Cheng. Speaking to reporters, Cheng expressed the hope that officials can promote the Kai Tak community ahead of international events.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Rugby Sevens is happening later this month. I hope organisers can provide more information to tourists on where to visit and the tourist spots nearby, so they could consume more [in Hong Kong]," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cheng also said the new sports ground can host more school sports competitions.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan said grooming local tech talent and attracting people in the field from outside Hong Kong are both important for the development of innovation and technology in the city.
 <br>
  <br>
  Writing on his weekly blog, he noted that local tech hubs have been offering thousands of jobs in recent weeks.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister said about 500 firms will host a job fair at Cyberport later this week offering more than two thousand jobs, more than half of them related to artificial intelligence.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last month, companies from the Science and Technology Park offered a thousand jobs in the industry.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan noted that in his budget last month, he asked more companies in the field to go to local schools to share their experience and inspire students.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister then said that the government's Hong Kong Investment Corporation will promote the development of AI technology, including hosting a forum on AI for global youth scientists.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It will promote the technical exchange of AI and its industrial development, including open source technology. Among them, the design and application of the Risc-V open source computer chip is an important part of strategic development going forward," Chan wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the firm will announce this week its partnership with a group focusing on Risc-V.

    'National Games test events show room for improvement'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The local official who heads the National Games Coordination Office on Sunday said test runs for cross-border sports events have shown there is room for improvement.
 <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong is set to co-host the November Games with Guangdong and Macau for the first time, and will host events for eight sports, including fencing and basketball.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeung Tak-keung told a radio programme that organisers are working to improve cross-border marathon and road cycling events, particularly in supporting athletes who lag behind the leading group.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We found that for some of the arrangements we can make further improvements, like how to support our athletes, and how to monitor [them]," he told reporters after the radio show.
  <br>
  <br>
  "During the road cycling and marathon [events], sometimes there may be a distance [between] the leading group and the other athletes – they may be not so close together. So how we can provide better support to them, that is one area that we think we can further improve."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Games will also feature 23 mass participation events, including bowling which will be hosted by the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  Local selections will take place in April and successful candidates can compete with bowlers from other Greater Bay Area cities in the finals in August.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeung added that officials are still working out the pricing for tickets but promised they will be affordable.

 Nobody was reported injured after three workers became trapped on a gondola platform in Tin Shui Wai on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The incident happened at the Tin Shui Estate as Hong Kong saw its first amber rainstorm warning of the year at around 3 pm.
  <br>
  <br>
  A video circulating online showed the platform swaying from side to side amid high wind gusts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Firefighters rescued the workers shortly after.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Labour and welfare minister Chris Sun on Saturday said changes to the HK$2 fare scheme could save the government about HK$680 million a year.
 <br>
  <br>
  As Financial Secretary Paul Chan announced in the budget last month, instead of a flat HK$2 fare, citizens aged 60 or above will have to pay 20 percent of any standard fare costing more than HK$10.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters after an event, Sun said the HK$680 million saving is “not a small amount,” and it accounts for more than 10 percent of the expenditure on the scheme.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sun also said the amended scheme would encourage the elderly to take short-haul buses instead of long-haul ones for short journeys, which will save the government even more money.
  <br>
  <br>
  “This nearly HK$700 million saving is based on the assumption that the travel habits and patterns of the beneficiaries remain unchanged. However, implementing the changes means they will choose cheaper transportation,” Sun said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the amended scheme would not lose its original purpose, while its financial sustainability would be enhanced.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Consumer Council has so far received 12 complaints involving around HK$5,000 in relation to the shutdown of the online food delivery platform, Deliveroo, in Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  It announced earlier that it will run until April 7, and part of its assets will be sold to rival Foodpanda.
  <br>
  <br>
  Consumer Council chief executive Gilly Wong pointed out that the biggest complaint involved about HK$600.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong said Deliveroo has to make it clear whether its subscribers are still entitled to a complimentary half-year membership at its rival, Foodpanda, if they have already subscribed to that platform.
  <br>
  <br>
  She also called on Deliveroo to inform its customers about the handling of their data.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If customers have a membership on both platforms, or they do not want to switch to another platform to enjoy their services, can they ask for a refund for the subscription that they've purchased?" Wong called on the platform to spell out the arrangement.
  <br>
  <br>
  She noted that members will have their subscriptions renewed automatically when the complimentary subscription ends, but said the platform should allow members to decide for themselves instead.
  <br>
  <br>
  She added that the watchdog is maintaining close contact with Foodpanda, which is taking over part of Deliveroo's business, and the council will offer more details later.

 Executive Councillor Lam Ching-choi sounded the alarm on youth mental health in Hong Kong on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at an event, Lam, who chairs the Advisory Committee on Mental Health, said previous studies by the committee had found that one-fourth of primary students and one-sixth of secondary and university students faced mental health challenges.
  <br>
  <br>
  He underscored that the issue must be addressed early in life.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The reason to allocate a lot of resources to youth work is simple, and it is evidence-based, that 90 percent of mental illnesses are developed before 21 years old,” Lam said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “If we do a good job in addressing the needs of young people, the psychological burden for adults can be relieved,” he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lam said it is important for the medical sector, teachers and social workers, to coordinate and provide mental support to students in school, as there were a lot of unsuccessful referrals to other institutions in the past.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also said people from all walks of life can take part in mental health training to help themselves and others, as people may face mental health issues in their lives.

    'Rugby Sevens tourists opting for HK Island hotels'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Rugby Sevens, one of the city's most popular and highly anticipated events, will be hosted at a brand new location this year, but the retail and tourism sectors are still expecting a boost in spending.
 <br>
  <br>
  The three-day event kicks off on March 28 and will be staged at the newly opened Kai Tak Sports Park - after three decades of being held at the Hong Kong Stadium in Causeway Bay.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tourism sector lawmaker Perry Yiu told a Commercial Radio programme on Saturday that many tourists coming for the tournament have opted for hotels on Hong Kong Island despite the change in venue.
  <br>
  <br>
  He pointed out that it will take time for visitors to adjust to the new location.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Because they used to live in areas like Causeway Bay and they are used to the area, so they would continue to stay there," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They also know that transportation is convenient on Hong Kong island side, so maybe during the first year, they will adopt a wait-and-see approach."
  <br>
  <br>
  Yiu was also pleased to see that around 80 percent of the three-day tickets have been sold.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fellow lawmaker Peter Shiu from the retail sector believes Lan Kwai Fong in Central will remain a hotspot for revellers, on top of the new attractions in Kai Tak.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Timothy Chui, executive director of the Hong Kong Tourism Association, said the so-called "Hong Kong Super March", which features a series of world-class events such as LIV Golf, and the Coldplay concert next month, will attract long-haul visitors to the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the sector still lacks manpower, particularly coach drivers, he added.

 Hong Kong’s sole delegate to the nation’s top legislature, Starry Lee, on Saturday called on the government to continue to coordinate with other major cities around the world to further strengthen the SAR's position across fields.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters after an RTHK programme, Lee said Hong Kong should make use of its unique system and further strengthen international cooperation, citing it as one of the key takeaways from this year’s “Two Sessions” meetings.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee suggested the government to invite various sectors to deliberate over how to boost international cooperation.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Apart from economic ties with different cities, we have to think about, for example, other areas politically, or make use of culture, sport, education, technology, all these other areas we can further develop various ties with different cities around the world,” Lee said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on the radio programme, Lee said Hong Kong should expand its network with the Global South and Asean countries, aside from just looking at traditional markets in Europe and North America.

    'New private sector law must be rolled out gradually'

<img alt="Last week, legislators tabled the private economy promotion law, which is aimed at creating a fairer business environment. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795827_2_20250315105255.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An economist has said that the new law proposed by Beijing to protect and enhance the country's private sector could help address "grey areas" facing private business, but cautioned that it should be gradually rolled out to avoid stifling opportunities.
 <br>
  <br>
  Last week, the nation’s top legislators tabled the private economy promotion law, which is designed to ensure private firms receive clear legal protection and create a fairer business environment.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bill was first introduced to the public via a consultation last October, subsequently reviewed twice by national lawmakers since last December, and was signalled by the country's top legislature - the National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee - to be hammered out in parliament.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the bill was not passed at the annual session of the NPC, as lawmakers redrafted the bill to add more detailed measures.
  <br>
  <br>
  Analysts expect more tweaks to come.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Ever since President Xi Jinping met some leading tech entrepreneurs last month, it has become a pretty clear signal that the government is very keen on promoting the private sector," Dan Wang, a director at the Eurasia Group's China team, told RTHK's Trending China programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang said the new bill is necessary, but cautioned that it should be rolled out gradually.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Previously, there were too many grey areas, including violations of intellectual property rights and people taking advantage of a symmetry information, so the government wants to address that. But precisely because regulations were added very fast, it stifled opportunities that could have existed for private entities."
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang, who's a seasoned economist, noted that while measures from the new law, such as prohibiting local governments to exclude private firms when launching government tenders, could give a boost for small and medium-sized private enterprises, authorities must come up with new ways to provide financial assistance for them.
  <br>
  <br>
  "How they can provide affordable and accessible financing is a problem. And how those private businesses can compete with their SOE (state-owned enterprise) competitors in the market, that's also a difficult issue," she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, another distinctive measure that was proposed by Premier Li Qiang in his report to the NPC aimed to crackdown on the so-called "996" work culture and "neijuan" practices.
  <br>
  <br>
  The "996" work culture refers to the practice by some firms to illegally make employees work from 9am to 9pm, six days a week, while "neijuan" refers to a self-defeating cycle of competition where firms feel forced to compete with one another excessively.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang noted the intention and necessity of the policy, but has questions on how it can be implemented practically.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Actually, China was in this vicious circle that everybody was racing, competing with each other to see who can come up with the longest working hours and who can be more competitive within the company. But it's quite damaging to the morale of the whole labour force," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For a young, fresh graduate, they don't really have negotiating power in the labour market. They probably prefer to hold on to a job rather than negotiating the work life balance."
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang added that fresh policies from Beijing during the "Two Sessions" showed a more "pro-labour" approach as part efforts to stablise the country's private sector and job market.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) on Friday called on members of the public to exercise caution when travelling to the Middle East.
 <br>
  <br>
  The reminder came as the World Health Organisation reported four new cases of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in Saudi Arabia, involving chronically-ill men aged between 27 and 78.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two of the patients have passed away.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, the CHP said one of the infected patients has had indirect contact with dromedary camels and their raw milk.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The CHP also recommends travel agents organising tours to the Middle East to refrain from arranging for visitors to ride dromedary camels or to participate in any activities involving direct contact with dromedary camels, which are known risk factors for acquiring MERS-CoV," the statement read.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials also reminded people to maintain good personal hygiene.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A male visitor at Kwong Wah Hospital has been arrested for allegedly assaulting a nurse.
 <br>
  <br>
  The hospital revealed that the nurse's arm was injured in the incident that happened in a ward on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said other medical staff and security officers were alerted, and reported the case to the police.
  <br>
  <br>
  The nurse was sent to the Accident and Emergency Department for treatment, and has since been discharged.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The hospital is highly concerned about the incident, expressed sympathy and rendered necessary support to the nurse," a Hospital Authority statement read.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The hospital resolutely adopts a zero-tolerance attitude to any workplace violence and strongly condemns the violent act."

<div class="itemFullText">
 Education minister Christine Choi said on Friday the government was left with little choice but to change rules on how local schools can continue to operate, as Hong Kong faces a dwindling pupil population.
 <br>
  <br>
  She described the drop in student numbers as a "structural" rather than a "transitional" issue, and that it would only exacerbate in the coming years.
  <br>
  <br>
  This week, the Education Bureau announced tighter restrictions on how schools can continue to receive government funding, which effectively increased the risk of them closing down if they don't enrol enough students.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under current policy, schools can operate a class on private money for a year, and resume receiving government funding once they can meet the minimum intake of 16 pupils.
  <br>
  <br>
  From September, such classes cannot revert to private funding again for six years.
  <br>
  <br>
  And schools that are allowed to go private must ensure their pupils complete their primary education using private funds.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the past few years, we have lowered the class formation requirement. But today, we think basically all possible methods, all adjustments have been exhausted," Choi told reporters after attending an event.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We must face this problem squarely. We need to implement measures for the education sector's stable and sustainable development in a timely manner."
  <br>
  <br>
  She noted that there had been fears more than 10 schools could face closure this year, but it turned out that only two were affected.
  <br>
  <br>
  The secretary for education also said early next month, officials will reach out to parents whose children are due to attend Price Memorial Catholic Primary School in Wong Tai Sin and Southern District's Aplichau Kaifong Primary School, two schools that won't receive government grants to operate primary one classes in the coming academic year.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said the two schools, which are left with the options of running the primary one class with private funds, merging with other schools or facing an eventual closure, have to decide the way forward themselves.
  <br>
  <br>
  Only pupils who applied for the spots under the discretionary scheme would be affected, Choi said, because no pupils had been sent there through central allocation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Choi said students going on mainland study tours are reminded not to consume cold dishes, after dozens of students and teachers on such tours from three schools were said to have contracted gastroenteritis.
  <br>
  <br>
  Health officials said they all went to eat at the same location in Shaoguan in Guangdong province, but the education chief stressed there's no evidence their illnesses had to do with food served during the tours.
  <br>
  <br>
  She added that to be on the safe side, operators of mainland study tours have stopped providing cold dishes.

<img alt="HKGCC chair Agnes Chan says that the AI-empowered tool will support small businesses to develop ESG audit without significant costs. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795746_2_20250314170438.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong businesses, specially small and medium-sized ones, are set to receive a boost to enhance their environmental, social and governance practices with the launch of a new AI tool to help them comply with rules.
 <br>
  <br>
  Green360 was launched by The Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce (HKGCC) on Friday, and it is an online learning platform aimed at helping small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to start and develop their environmental, social and governance (ESG) audit and reporting processes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a launch ceremony, Algernon Yau, Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development, said the platform represents a pivotal step in Hong Kong's push forward as part of its sustainability agenda.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The introduction of Green360 comes at a crucial time as we navigate the complexities of environmental challenges for sustainable practices that are urgently needed. This innovative platform not only aligns with the global movement towards a greener economy but also emphasizes Hong Kong's role as a leader in integrating advanced technology commercial development," Yau said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since January 25, all companies are required by the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing to disclose their direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions.
  <br>
  <br>
  The move also came as the government rolled out a road map in December to align its sustainability disclosure requirements with International Financial Reporting Standards – Sustainability Disclosure (ISSB) Standards by 2028.
  <br>
  <br>
  Echoing Yau, HKGCC chairwoman Agnes Chan noted that the tool, which is empowered by artificial intelligence technology, will help speed up the city's green transition.
  <br>
  <br>
  "AI is emerging as a crucial driver for integrating green and just transitions, digital platforms and data analytics pivotal in accelerating the de-carbonisation of both the economy and the capital markets," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Many companies are uncertain about where to begin or lack the resources to pursue such initiatives. So Green360 alleviates these concerns by helping them to identify areas for improvement and achieve accreditation without incurring significant costs," she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fillippo Addarri, senior advisor for the United Nations Development Programme and project lead for the European Union Social Impact Score, said at the same event that Hong Kong and the European members could cooperate over green finance following increased economic ties between Europe and China.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said that Chinese green investments in Europe, such as in the battery and electric vehicle fields, have seen a 50 percent increase year on year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And as a global financial hub, Hong Kong is poised to become a key partner of the European Union. Your advanced regulatory framework and culture of innovation sets your leadership in the driving seat," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Touching on the question of support from Beijing, Xin Bingxian, executive secretary of the World Development Foundation, said at the event that the move is in line with the direction signalled from the Two Sessions meetings this year that carbon reduction requirements are shifting from voluntary to mandatory.
  <br>
  <br>
  But she suggested the SAR government cooperate with mainland authorities to also align on ESG disclosure rules as there are notable differences in regulations.

    CK Hutchison shares down after port deal criticism

<img alt="CK Hutchison earlier agreed to sell its interests in a key Panama Canal port operator to a consortium led by BlackRock. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795749_1_20250314172048.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Shares of CK Hutchison shed more than 6 percent on Friday, after the Beijing office in charge of Hong Kong affairs reposted a newspaper commentary slamming the firm's sale of its Panama Canal ports.
 <br>
  <br>
  Last week, the conglomerate controlled by tycoon Li Ka-shing agreed to sell its interests in a key Panama Canal port operator to a consortium led by US asset management firm BlackRock.
  <br>
  <br>
  The deal worth US$22.8 billion followed intense pressure from US President Donald Trump, who vowed to take back control of the canal, using force if necessary.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office shared on its website an opinion piece published by Ta Kung Pao on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The commentary noted reports suggesting BlackRock chief executive Larry Fink had a "close relationship" with Trump, and described the deal as an act of American hegemony.
  <br>
  <br>
  For CK Hutchison, "Critics say this is an act of kneeling down... and one which disregards national interests, betrays and sells out Chinese people," the article read.
  <br>
  <br>
  The commentary also told the company to think twice and decide "which position and side it wants to be on".
  <br>
  <br>
  The article was also shared by Beijing's liaison office in Hong Kong on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Andrew Leung, an independent China strategist, told RTHK that while he understood why Beijing was upset with the deal, CK Hutchison had to act with its business interests in mind.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[CK Hutchison] still has a great deal of businesses tied to mainland China and to Hong Kong. So I don't think that this is anything other than, if you like, a self-centered business strategy," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Beijing is fully aware of [CK Hutchison's] importance to Hong Kong. But on the other hand, it has to balance its national interests and perceived threats from the Trump administration - a hostile Trump administration bent on scuttling China's rise - and also send a signal to other businesses tied to China to be more aware of these national strategic priorities."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hang Seng Index, meanwhile, snapped a five-day losing streak, climbing more than 2 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The index had surged past 24,000 before giving up some of the gains.
  <br>
  <br>
  It ended 497 points or 2.1 percent higher at 23,959.

    Hospitals may start charging for CT and MRI scans

<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Health Lo Chung-mau said on Friday the government is reviewing fees and charges for public hospital services, including charging for such services as CT scans and MRIs to prevent abuse.
 <br>
  <br>
  However, he said that emergency and hospitalised patients would be exempted.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The demand for some complicated imaging services such as CT scans and MRIs keeps increasing, and prolongs the waiting time. We will consider having a co-payment on such services,” Lo said after a health services panel meeting in the Legislative Council.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We have to stress that these items are completely free now, as they are fully funded by the government, and that has led to an excessive use of services,” he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lo said the adjustment of fees and charges is needed to reduce waste in such areas as medication so that resources can be utilised accurately and directed towards helping patients whose conditions are more serious or who need more urgent treatment.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the government will take affordability into account when changing the fees and charges.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lo said the adjustment in public hospital fees is an important step in primary healthcare development, and people are encouraged to consult their family doctors instead when their symptoms are mild.

 Tourist arrivals hit 8.4 million in the first two months of the year, a seven percent increase year on year, the Hong Kong Tourism Board said on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  More than three-quarters of them – or 6.5 million – were from the mainland, an uptick of four percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arrivals from other short-haul markets also rose, with those from the Philippines, Indonesia, Japan and South Korea each surging more than 30 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Visitor numbers from long-haul markets grew as well, up 20 percent to 500,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arrivals from Australia, for example, saw a 34 percent increase.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong celebrated the start of the Year of the Snake on January 29, hosting a series of events such as the Lunar New Year parade and a fireworks display.

    Parents express concern over possible school closures

<div class="itemFullText">
 Some parents at a primary school that won't get public funding to operate first-year classes in the next academic year said on Friday they're shocked by the development.
 <br>
  <br>
  Price Memorial Catholic Primary School in Wong Tai Sin is one of two schools left with the options of running the primary one class with private funds, merging with other schools or facing an eventual closure.
  <br>
  <br>
  The other one is Southern's Aplichau Kaifong Primary School.
  <br>
  <br>
  Outside the Wong Tai Sin school, a mother said that all three of her children attend the school or had done so, and she's among parents who're concerned it may ultimately be forced to close.
  <br>
  <br>
  "My children and pupils like the school a lot, they like the teachers here," she said. "When our children learned of the news, they were like, 'oh why? I don't want this,'"
  <br>
  <br>
  "But we hope the school can continue and persist."
  <br>
  <br>
  School principal Maureen Ho said it notified parents of the news on Thursday night once the government announced the funding decision.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said it's early days still as to what will happen, but the school will discuss a way forward in an attempt to come up with the best arrangement for the pupils.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When we got the news we found it regrettable and weren't too happy. But it's a decision made by the Education Bureau so we have to respect that," Ho said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We care a lot about our pupils, so our management will discuss different plans with our council and sponsoring body, as well as education officials, to help them."
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho noted that the lack of pupils is a territory-wide issue, adding that the school particularly had trouble attracting new pupils because it is hard to get to.
  <br>
  <br>
  In recent years, schools that faced the same problem could go private for a year and, once they were able to meet the minimum class intake of more than 16 pupils, resume receiving government funding.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the government changed the rule this week, requiring schools to operate a class with private funds for six years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Education officials also said if schools take in less than 16 pupils again within that period, they won't be allowed to go private again.
  <br>
  <br>
  They said the change was made because the number of pupils projected to enter primary schools in the coming years is expected to drop by just over 11,000 to around 37,500 in 2031.

<div class="itemFullText">
 People around the globe marked World Sleep Day on Friday, an annual event that serves as a reminder of the importance of sleep to one's well-being and health.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a pre-recorded interview broadcast on
  <a href="https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/news-programmes/this-episode.htm?cmsid=77" target="_blank">
   <u>
    <b>
     RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme
    </b>
   </u>
  </a>
  , Julia Sun, a clinical psychologist at the Chinese University's Department of Psychiatry, said people should not underestimate the importance of a good night's sleep.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Sleep is really important and it is related to the physical and mental well-being. Physically, chronic sleep depravation will lead to reduced immune function and hormonal imbalance. And also we can see that when people sleep less, they tend to gain more weight. Sleep depravation is also linked to increased cardiovascular risk," Sun said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In terms of mental well-being, insomnia, or sleeping less, leads to increased irritability... it also leads to more mood swings and also difficulty in managing stress."
  <br>
  <br>
  Sun recommended that people get into a routine before bed, to ensure a good night's sleep.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think that regularity is important - try to have a regular sleep-wake schedule no matter in weekdays or weekends... try to limit the screen use before sleep, for example like 15 to 30 minutes before bedtime. And also you can dim your light before you go to sleep."

  , Lam said many people were starting families later in life which is why an adjustment to current regulations was needed.
  <br>
  <br>
  "More and more couples are getting married late and planning their families late... and if you look at some of the restrictions to current [regulations] we're having such as this 10-year period, it's pretty much outdated. We do need a full-on upgrade of a lot of the rules and regulations around this to ensure that it fits with current trends."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lam said easing restrictions on non-married couples or single people, allowing them to use their frozen embryos to start a family, would also help.
  <br>
  <br>
  "At the moment it might be a little bit tricky, but we do need to do more persuasive discussions in Hong Kong," Lam said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Medical sector lawmaker David Lam, speaking on an RTHK programme, said the proposed measure was helpful, but people also needed to understand that, if possible, it is better to start a family sooner rather than later.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We need to let people know that this option is not for everyone, it is a choice for those with a unique problem. It should not become an option for people to delay childbearing. We should have children as early as possible.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Lam added that pregnancy difficulties and health risks would increase as women get older which was another reason not to delay starting a family.

 Two primary schools will not receive grants from the Education Bureau to operate primary one classes in the coming academic year, because they failed to enrol the minimum 16 pupils required to form a class.
 <br>
  <br>
  They are Price Memorial Catholic Primary School in Wong Tai Sin and Aplichau Kaifong Primary School in Southern District.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bureau sent a letter to all government and subsidised primary schools on Thursday regarding the approval of classes and manpower planning for the 2025-26 school year.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said if schools have any comments over the proposed class structure, they can submit feedback by March 27.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bureau noted schools that don't receive grants can still request to run primary one classes with private funds, merge with other schools or close altogether.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said such schools can join the Primary One allocation a year later with special approval from the bureau.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bureau added that no schools that faced bans on enrolling primary one students over the past six years are facing the same issue again.

    Civil service job cuts won't save much: Legco

<img alt="The Legislative Council Secretariat says civil service job cuts may not save much money. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795601_1_20250313190933.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government's plan to cut 10,000 civil service positions over two years may not translate into substantial manpower savings, according to a research brief released by the Legislative Council Secretariat on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  According to the report, the size of the civil service establishment exceeded the actual number of workers employed by 18,900 last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Coupled with a vacancy rate in civil service of around 10 percent right now, most of the 10,000 posts would not have been filled anyway, with or without the post deletion policy," the report read.
  <br>
  <br>
  Researchers also examined the civil service pay freeze for the upcoming fiscal year. They projected potential savings of HK$8.7 billion, assuming a 3 percent market wage increase.
  <br>
  <br>
  Comparing Hong Kong with other advanced economies in the Asia-Pacific region, the brief noted that civil servants made up 4.7 percent of the local workforce in 2023, higher than Singapore's 3.7 percent, and 4.2 percent for South Korea.
  <br>
  <br>
  The report also concluded the HK$2 fare concessionary scheme for the elderly remains competitive, even after putting a cap on the number of trips and changing the formula for long-haul journeys.
  <br>
  <br>
  It compared the measure to similar schemes in 12 other cities worldwide, and noted only London, Paris, Guangzhou and Singapore offer concessionary fares for commuters between 60 and 64.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the secretariat conceded the proposed tweaks will bring insignificant relief to public coffers, estimating savings of only HK$680 million each year.
