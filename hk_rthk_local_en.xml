<div class="itemFullText">
 Justice Secretary Paul Lam on Wednesday said the Constitution provides the fundamental legal protection for the "One Country, Two Systems" framework, and people should start learning about the Constitution from a young age.
 <br>
  <br>
  Addressing the flag-raising ceremony on Constitution Day, Lam said the event was established to promote constitutional spirit and the rule of law.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Given the fundamental importance of the Constitution in implementing 'One Country, Two Systems' in Hong Kong, we must strengthen constitutional awareness. The prerequisite is to deepen public understanding and knowledge of the Constitution," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The activities on Constitution Day serve to promote and propagate the Constitution. It's also a good opportunity to promote rule of law awareness through public education."
  <br>
  <br>
  The SAR should make full use of the unique advantages under "One Country, Two Systems" and safeguard national sovereignty, security and development interests, Lam added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The justice chief also called it an "important mission" to teach youngsters about what the Constitution is and why it matters, adding that disciplinary services officers should stand at the forefront as guardians of the Constitution.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 100 members of the disciplined services took part in the flag-raising ceremony led by the Security Bureau at the Hong Kong Customs College.

    Ideas for Ocean Park to cut costs and raise revenues

<img alt="Lawmakers looked at ways Ocean Park could cut costs and raise revenues during a Legco panel meeting on Tuesday. File photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1781940_1_20241203204442.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lawmakers on Tuesday discussed ways to help Ocean Park improve its finances after it posted a deficit of more than HK$71 million for the financial year ending in June, despite revenue and visitor numbers hitting five-year highs.
 <br>
  <br>
  At a Legco panel meeting on economic development, the theme park disclosed that its water park, or Water World, lost over HK$200 million last financial year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ocean Park chairman Paulo Pong explained Water World had only been running for two years and was still in its growth phase, promising lawmakers the theme park would work hard to reduce losses.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lawmakers voiced concerns Ocean Park might struggle to stay financially sustainable, urging it to use the opportunities created by its six pandas.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tourism sector lawmaker Perry Yiu noted that following the resumption of multiple-entry visas for Shenzhen residents, Ocean Park could consider giving them more discounts to boost visitor numbers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Benson Luk from the Business and Professionals Alliance, suggested Ocean Park lease out its outdoor areas to host major events to increase revenue.
  <br>
  <br>
  Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism Kevin Yeung noted Ocean Park has been thinking of different ways to find more sources of income.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Ocean Park will make use of the resources available to try to increase revenue, for example concerts can be held in the park. This will also help solve the problem of not having enough venues in Hong Kong,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Roundtable lawmaker Michael Tien suggested the Leisure and Cultural Services Department (LCSD) take over the water park's operations to reduce losses.
  <br>
  <br>
  “[Ocean Park’s] current loss last year is strictly due to one project, which is the water park. The loss of the water park, which is in excess of HK$200 million, is about the same as the government subsidy,” he said
  <br>
  <br>
  “So basically, the government is not subsidising the other activities of Ocean Park, and that is unfair to Ocean Park and is tying up the hands of the entire team. So my suggestion is to spin off the water park, and give it to LCSD,” he said.

<img alt="Hong Kong schoolchildren picked up bad habits during the Covid pandemic, researchers say. Photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1781914_1_20241203171234.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A new study shows that most schoolchildren in Hong Kong are not doing the 60 minutes of moderate to vigorous exercise each day recommended by the World Health Organisation.
 <br>
  <br>
  Professor Patrick Ip from the University of Hong Kong’s department of paediatrics said research he carried out for the InspiringHK Sports Foundation found less than eight percent of more than 1,000 primary and secondary students studied met the exercise standard over the past year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ip blamed this on poor habits developed during the Covid pandemic.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We have observed a very alarming situation that during non-school days and public holidays, children actually did not go out with their friends, their family members to play sports or do any activities under the sunshine,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “This turns out to be a very bad habit. If that habit continues, our next generation will be at a much worse physical activity level, as well as having a poor shape in both physical and mental health.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The foundation said it hopes that by 2030, 16 percent of Hong Kong schoolchildren will reach the 60 minutes per day recommendation, adding that it will launch a scheme next year aimed at promoting physical activity among schoolchildren.

<img alt="Security chief Chris Tang says authorities have received 23 requests for assistance so far this year of Hongkongers allegedly being detained in Southeast Asia to work illegally." src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1781904_1_20241203162256.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Security minister Chris Tang has warned against a resurgence of cases involving Hong Kong residents allegedly being held captive in Southeast Asia to work illegally.
 <br>
  <br>
  A number of Hongkongers fell for employment scams and were detained in various Southeast Asian countries in 2022, prompting the government to set up a task force to coordinate follow-up actions.
  <br>
  <br>
  So far this year, authorities received 23 requests for assistance. Eleven of them returned to the SAR, while the others were discovered safe even though their movements were reportedly restricted.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Since the second quarter of 2024, there have been signs of a resurgence of cases of Hong Kong residents being suspected to have been lured to Southeast Asian countries and detained to engage in illegal work," Tang told a Legislative Council panel on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister said immigration officials have been following up on the cases through foreign ministry representatives in Hong Kong as well as diplomatic and consular missions elsewhere.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked if the government had learned about what happened from those who had returned to Hong Kong, Tang said none of the Hongkongers suspected to be detained against their will were taken away while on holiday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For each case, once the citizen has returned to Hong Kong, we would interview them, ask them why they were lured overseas and how they were released," Tang told lawmakers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But let me say this, most of the individuals went voluntarily and then they were detained there illegally. There was never a case that an individual was abducted."
  <br>
  <br>
  The security chief said authorities would continue to monitor online communications and strengthen cooperation with their international counterparts, while stepping up calls for people to be more alert to job scams.

    'HKU community pharmacy for education, research use'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The University of Hong Kong (HKU) on Tuesday said its community pharmacy merged pharmaceutical services with education and research, which is different from other medical dispensaries in the city.
 <br>
  <br>
  Located at the medical school's campus in Pok Fu Lam, the community pharmacy opened its doors in November, serving mainly Queen Mary Hospital patients as well as HKU staff and students.
  <br>
  <br>
  The medical facility, which is the city's first teaching community pharmacy on a university campus, offers a number of prescription-only medications and drugs for minor ailments.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jovan Chow, a third year pharmacy student at HKU, said he was able to learn by observing how pharmacists interact with patients.
  <br>
  <br>
  "My biggest takeaway from [working at] the community pharmacy is actually the soft skills I acquired during my time here... I have more opportunities to have a glance of how community pharmacies operate," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ian Wong, professor of pharmacology and pharmacy at the university's medical faculty, said the facility goes beyond serving those seeking help.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The main duties and core functions of a university are teaching, research, and knowledge transfer," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our pharmacy's mission is also to [give] the best education to our students, and secondly, is to make use of this pharmacy to conduct research, so that we can help our patients and citizens to optimise the use of medicine. And finally, providing services is actually a knowledge transfer, so that we make use of our knowledge to treat our patients."

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday said he believes the Northern Metropolis project will bring a good return on investment and the public will be able to share the fruits of the development.
 <br>
  <br>
  Last week, more than 80 enterprises and developers signed an expression of interest for the development, along with separate agreements for projects worth some HK$100 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are very confident that the Northern Metropolis development plan will invite and attract a lot of interest," Lee told reporters before heading into the weekly Executive Council meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will be also developing the San Tin Technopole. There will also be a university city and different pockets of land, and all these will add together to create extra value for Hong Kong. All these projects will bring a good return on investment."
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked whether there will be penalties for enterprises that sign agreements but don't invest, Lee said he believes these investments will pay off well in the long run.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Of course, we have to look very far ahead in the future. Some investment periods may be as long as five to 15 years," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CE added that he hopes to find innovative ways to ensure regular citizens also benefit from these investments.

    Cut education spending to reduce deficit: economist

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A local economist on Tuesday suggested the government reduce spending on education to save money.
 <br>
  <br>
  Financial Secretary Paul Chan earlier revised the estimated government deficit for the current financial year, doubling it to around HK$100 billion due to poor performance in the asset markets.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on an RTHK radio programme, Terence Chong, executive director of Chinese University's Lau Chor Tak Institute of Global Economics and Finance, said the government could link education spending to the student population.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If the number of students drops, there's no reason for the government to increase education expenditure," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Should we think about reforming education spending and pegging it against the student population? If student numbers fall, shouldn't we reduce spending?"
  <br>
  <br>
  He said it would be difficult for the government to save money by cutting civil servant pay or reducing the civil service establishment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chong said such a move would only lead to government workers opting to work in the private sector instead, with public services affected as a result.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, lawmaker Wendy Hong said the government could consider recovering education costs from non-local university students.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong, who's a member of Legco's financial affairs panel, said such students are only charged HK$150,000 to HK$180,000, even though the annual cost of their education is HK$300,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is a gradual process. Of course, with the increased cost, their interest to come and study in Hong Kong might be reduced. We can offer scholarships at the same time to attract those in the top-tier," she said.

 A court ruling overturning the approval of an environmental study on building flats on Fanling golf course won't significantly affect Hong Kong's public housing supply over the next decade, Chief Executive John Lee said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a decision handed down on Monday, the High Court called on the authorities to consult the public again on plans to build public flats on 9.5 hectares of the century-old course.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee said while overall housing goals over the next 10 years won't change, the ruling will affect how many homes they can build at the golf course and how long it will take.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Following the judgment, in terms of the number of public housing units, the density and the delay in the housing production, we are seeing a significant impact. And that means the government will have to conduct a holistic assessment," he said before the weekly Executive Council meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CE told reporters that officials have secured land to produce more than 308,000 public housing units in the next 10 years.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The change in relation to the public housing development on Fanling golf course should not pose a major change to the public housing production target," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee said the government will conduct analyses before deciding the way forward, including whether to launch an appeal.

 Chief Executive John Lee said on Tuesday that the government will introduce different measures to spur economic growth amid a larger-than-expected budget deficit, describing the central government's move to allow Shenzhen residents to visit Hong Kong more often as coming at just the right time.
 <br>
  <br>
  On Monday, the financial secretary changed the deficit forecast for the current financial year from HK$48.1 billion to around HK$100 billion, citing lower revenue due to poor asset market performances and a drop in profits tax.
  <br>
  <br>
  For his part, Lee stressed that officials will cut spending and formulate measures to increase revenue -- but they'll be cautious with the measures so as to reduce the impact on the public.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the visa rule change for Shenzhen residents is among many measures exemplifying the country's strong backing for the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There are also new growth points, for example, the third runway system, which has been commissioned. Next year, Kai Tak Sports Park will also be commissioned. A lot of international major events will take place in Hong Kong," Lee told reporters ahead of the weekly Executive Council meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  "All these will stimulate our economy and increase government revenue. The government, meanwhile, also continues to consolidate our status as an international financial trade and shipping centre."
  <br>
  <br>
  The CE said he will hold a Q&A session in the legislature next Thursday, and one of the topics will be economic growth and expanding Hong Kong's international network.
  <br>
  <br>
  On tourism, Lee said operations have been smooth since Beijing restored multi-entry visas for Shenzhen residents on Sunday, and many people, he said, look forward to visiting the SAR "whenever they want".
  <br>
  <br>
  The CE noted that some trade representatives have expressed optimism that the measure will inject life into the local economy, noting that there are "waves of activities" coming up over the Christmas period.
  <br>
  <br>
  These, Lee said, include Hong Kong WinterFest, international horse races, panda carnivals and a real-life gathering and adventure for an online mobile game this weekend.
  <br>
  <br>
  The chief executive also said law enforcement agencies are determined to stop the return of parallel goods trading in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said consumption patterns of mainland residents have changed, and nowadays they can find many quality and cheap products through online stores.

 The Office of the Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Monday said it hopes Hong Kong youngsters can have a greater understanding of the nation's foreign affairs through an annual knowledge contest.
 <br>
  <br>
  The theme of the 17th edition of the Hong Kong Cup Diplomatic Knowledge Contest is "Love Diplomacy, Love the World".
  <br>
  <br>
  The contest is jointly organised by the commissioner's office, the Education Bureau and the Better Hong Kong Foundation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at the kick-off ceremony, Deputy Commissioner Li Yongsheng said the contest is an important platform for students to learn more about China's foreign policy.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The year of 2025 marks the 80th anniversary of the founding of the United Nations and the 70th anniversary of the Bandung Conference. These two events are of great significance in the history of diplomacy," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The contest aims to encourage Hong Kong youth to further understand major-country diplomacy with Chinese characteristics, and think of how to make greater and more contributions to the country's foreign affairs."
  <br>
  <br>
  A study tour to Beijing and Gansu Province was held in July for the winning teams of the 16th edition.
  <br>
  <br>
  Director of Broadcasting Eddie Cheung said RTHK produced three episodes of the tour, to be aired on three Thursdays starting this week.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I believe students who joined the tour were able to combine the knowledge in their textbooks with their insight from the study tour, integrating their love for the country and Hong Kong, and tell good stories of our country," Cheung said.
  <br>
  <br>
  A Form three student from St. Paul's College said he will be participating in the upcoming contest and hopes he can do better this time round.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I read more about the news in the world and I also read books about the diplomatic policies of China," he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Last year, I didn't go to the final competition, so this year, I wish I can get a better result in the online quiz and can get the chance to attend the final competition."
  <br>
  <br>
  Applications will open on December 9. The first round of the contest will be held in March next year, and the final will take place in May.

    Court halts Fanling golf course flats plan

<img alt="The High Court says overturning the administration's decision can lead to re-conducting the public consultation and seeking comments from environmental advisers. File photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1781778_2_20241202200228.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The High Court has overturned the government's approval of an environmental study into plans to build public flats on part of the Fanling Golf Course, calling on authorities to consult the public on the matter again.
 <br>
  <br>
  Judge Russell Coleman on Monday handed down the judgement after the Hong Kong Golf Club filed a legal challenge against an environmental impact assessment (EIA) report that would set the stage for building public housing units on 9.5 hectares of the century-old course.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said overturning the administration's decision could lead to re-conducting the public consultation and seeking comments from environmental advisers "with the benefits of the fruits of that re-consultation".
  <br>
  <br>
  The club had argued that a public consultation exercise had not been carried out properly or fairly, saying authorities had been allowed to submit additional information during the assessment but people's responses to the submissions were not taken into account.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As a matter of fact, the public were only consulted on part of the EIA report in its final form. That is contrary to the requirement of the EIA Ordinance," Coleman wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In short, I find that the fairness and integrity of the process, set out in the EIA Ordinance properly construed, demanded re-consultation once the additional information was produced to form part of the EIA report."
  <br>
  <br>
  The director of environmental protection gave conditional approval to the assessment in May last year, before the Town Planning Board rezoned the site from "residential" to "undetermined" use temporarily.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials had attached a number of conditions to the assessment's approval, including having the Civil Engineering and Development Department revise its layout plan to preserve about 0.4 hectares of woodland "as far as practicable".
  <br>
  <br>
  The judge said imposing such a condition “subject to the caveat of practicability” was problematic.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Until the exercise of revision is actually performed, it cannot be known whether the stated current plan [can] be maintained," he wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the High Court judge also rejected part of the club's contention, including an argument that the approval was unlawful because it failed to require the project proponent to carry out mitigation measures identified in the assessment report.
  <br>
  <br>
  The court earlier suspended the environmental review on an interim basis until the judicial challenge was resolved.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong Golf Club said it welcomed the judgement, saying the Fanling site is an internationally renowned and world-class venue with significant ecological and cultural value.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The three championship courses – which include the old course – are integral parts of the Fanling site, which is an irreplaceable sports facility and is key to Hong Kong’s ability to attract major golf tournaments," the club said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  It added the course will host a series of events next year, such as the LIV golf tournament and golf competitions for the National Games, which "play a critical role" in driving the city's sports scene.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Moving forward, the club will utilise the three championship courses to the best of their potential with a view to supporting the government policy that advocates the 'shaping of tourism with sports' and the further development of Hong Kong's mega-event economy," the club said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Environmental Protection Department said it will study the judgement and announce whether it would appeal "at an appropriate time".

    Consultation on subdivided flats plan begins

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A two-month consultation exercise on proposed regulations aimed at ridding the city of poor quality subdivided flats began on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  At a housing panel meeting, several lawmakers said they were concerned landlords might start renovations ahead of the new legislation, leaving existing tenants homeless.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lawmaker Gary Zhang, a panel member, said the government needs to take the opportunity to hear what the public thinks about the policy.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We roll out this policy out of a very good will to ensure the basic humanity level at our housing situation. But if we cannot manage the transition, well I'm afraid ultimately we might cause some people to lose their homes, lose their residences,” he told RTHK after the meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  Deputy Financial Secretary Michael Wong, who leads the Task Force on Tackling the Issue of Subdivided Units, said he doesn't think such evictions will be a big problem.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We have talked to different parties earlier and heard about such sayings. But we haven't found any signs of a widespread issue. Also we have emphasised multiple times that under the existing landlord and tenant ordinance, the protection for tenants is still here. If any landlords break the rules and evict their tenants please let us know, we will address that seriously,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to the proposed policy, subdivided flats will have to have a floor area of at least eight square metres and a minimum ceiling height of at least 2.3 metres.
  <br>
  <br>
  Landlords caught renting out substandard flats would face jail terms of up to three years, as well as a maximum fine of HK$300,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials told lawmakers that they will consult the public on how long the grace period should be for landlords to modify their flats to meet the new requirements.
  <br>
  <br>
  During the meeting, some lawmakers said they were worried people might simply switch to renting beds or guest rooms instead, which could be even more cramped than subdivided flats.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong said the government will look into other relevant policies to address potential issues.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A local creative studio is hosting an exhibition called "Panda Go! Fest HK" showcasing 2,500 panda sculptures at various iconic locations across the SAR on weekends in December and during Christmas.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a welcoming ceremony, SK Lam, founder of All Rights Reserved, said the exhibition will be held at the Avenue of Stars, Ngong Ping 360, Ocean Park and Sun Yat Sen Memorial Park.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Based on our past 10 years of experience and also the recent experience we had with [Doraemon], we think these are the more accessible areas that the public can go and visit," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lam also said the team has created six new panda characters inspired by the Ocean Park panda family, consisting of Ying Ying and Le Le, new arrivals currently named An An and Ke Ke, as well as the newborn twins.
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted that the company introduced a giant panda installation a decade ago, featuring 1,600 panda sculptures to symbolise the existing panda population at that time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lam added that thanks to global conservation efforts, the giant panda population has since increased to over 2,500, encompassing both wild and captive pandas.

    HK Island to get 'smart and green' transit line

<img alt="The Transport and Logistics Bureau says the 'smart and green mass transit system' it has opted for is more cost effective than a heavy rail project.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Transport officials say they hope to kick-start construction projects for a transit line linking HKU and Wong Chuk Hang MTR stations in 2027.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a paper submitted to Legco, the Transport and Logistics Bureau said rather than the heavy rail originally proposed, the new plan for the South Island Line (West) is to build a "smart and green mass transit system" using viaducts, along with a tunnel through the hilly terrain between Queen Mary Hospital and HKU.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 7.5-kilometre line will also pass through Aberdeen, Tin Wan, Wah Fu and Cyberport and will serve 130,000 residents and 50,000 people working in the areas, officials said.
  <br>
  <br>
  No expected completion date was given.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bureau said it hopes to begin detailed planning and design for the project next year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lawmaker Gary Zhang, who's a former railway engineer, said he expects construction work to be completed within five to six years' time.
  <br>
  <br>
  He pointed out that the capacity of the mass transit system is much lower than the original.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The new smart [and] green system - capacity could reach around 8,000. But normally the optimal capacity could be something around 5,000," he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So the capacity, yes, would be a disadvantage. But construction costs would be much much lower."

 Chief Executive John Lee on Monday said Hong Kong would continue to leverage its advantages under the One Country, Two Systems framework and use its global network to become an international education hub.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lee made his remarks while addressing the Global University Presidents and Leaders Summit, where attendees included leaders and presidents from more than 50 global universities.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Our unique advantages spring from One Country, Two Systems. Thanks to this unique principle, we enjoy unwavering support from our country together with global connectivity," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Hong Kong attracts students from more than 100 countries. Over half of the academic staff in our institutions comes from outside Hong Kong. And we are building on that solid foundation, the Hong Kong SAR government endeavors to develop Hong Kong into an international post-secondary education hub,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CE noted the SAR has five universities among the world's top 100, and three in Asia's top 10.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added the government would continue to promote the “study in Hong Kong brand” as well as encourage local universities to seek more collaboration with overseas and mainland institutions, especially with other cities in the Greater Bay Area.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at the same occasion, the director of the central government's liaison office, Zheng Yanxiong, said under support from the central government, Hong Kong has upheld its universities' independence and academic freedom since the city's return to the motherland.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also expressed hope that local universities would work even more closely with their global counterparts.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I hope local universities will seize the opportunity at this forum to deepen their connections with the global higher education sector, enhancing mutual understanding, respect and trust, as well as collaboration in joint programmes and academic exchanges,” Zheng said.

<img alt="Paul Chan has revised the government's budget deficit estimate this year to around HK$100 billion." src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1781721_1_20241202122432.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government has doubled its estimated deficit for the current financial year to around HK$100 billion, citing lower revenue mainly due to poor asset market performances.
 <br>
  <br>
  When Financial Secretary Paul Chan announced his budget in February, he forecast a shortfall of a little more than HK$48 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he told lawmakers on Monday that as well as relatively poor asset market performances, revenue from profits tax is lower because firms aren't doing too well at present.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the latest estimate was made after considering revenue from government bonds and repayments due.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Due to geopolitical tensions and other uncertainties, the asset markets continue to be under pressure and this has somewhat affected the revenue from land sales and stamp duty," Chan said at a financial affairs panel meeting in the legislature.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We'll continue to consider our fiscal balance as well as long-term needs of our society. We'll put in place arrangements with a view to restoring fiscal balance in the coming few years."
  <br>
  <br>
  He said SAR officials have met credit rating agencies and they agree with the government's assessment that it shouldn't try to reverse the deficit in one to two years as that would "bring a major shock to the society".
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said the government is conducting transitional fiscal consolidation, mainly by cutting expenditure, while raising revenue is considered to be supportive only.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister said US President-elect Donald Trump's economic policies could contribute to global uncertainties next year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said Trump's threat to impose new tariffs against different countries, including China, could affect Hong Kong's re-exports of mainland goods to the US.
  <br>
  <br>
  The secretary also reassured lawmakers that they need not worry too much about the government's dwindling fiscal reserves, saying the key is "taking care of our own business".

    'Shallow waters contributed to whale's death'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department revealed on Monday that Hong Kong's shallow waters was a factor leading to the death of a whale in Tai O.
 <br>
  <br>
  The stranded animal passed away despite rescue efforts by a team of veterinarians.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on an RTHK radio programme, Assistant Director (Fisheries & Marine Conservation) Jim Chu pointed out that beaked whales usually inhabit deep waters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Its natural habitat is in waters with a depth of between 300 metres and even a kilometre. The waters of Hong Kong are only around tens of metres deep," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Around Tai O, the water depth is around 10 metres or less. So these conditions are totally unsuitable for these animals to survive."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chu revealed the cetacean was first discovered in Yi O on Saturday afternoon, before it appeared in Tai O in the evening.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities also said that a canvas bag was discovered inside the whale, and Chu said it was not known for how long it had been inside the animal's digestive system.
  <br>
  <br>
  But as the bag was still in good shape, it showed the cetacean was unable to digest it.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chu also said autopsy showed the whale's stomach did not have any food, and it is likely this was due to the bag blocking its digestive system.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added the Response Plan to the Sighting of non-resident Cetaceans in Hong Kong Waters was activated for the first time during this incident.
  <br>
  <br>
  It aims to minimise the nuisance caused by people to external species and provide emergency assistance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Taison Chang, chairman of the Hong Kong Dolphin Conservation Society, told the same programme the animal was likely a tropical bottlenose whale.
  <br>
  <br>
  He believes the cetacean, measuring six to seven metres long, was an adult whale.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A residential care home serving people with disabilities for almost six decades in Hong Kong is seeking support to enhance its care services for ageing residents.
 <br>
  <br>
  Home of Loving Faithfulness is one of the 11 beneficiaries of this year's Operation Santa Claus (OSC), and has been providing life-long care for children and adults with special needs since 1965.
  <br>
  <br>
  What sets this facility apart is its commitment to lifetime care, accepting residents as young as six years old and allowing them to stay indefinitely, the home's Superintendent Matthew Chu said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chu said the charity has launched a project called Lifelong Services to address the increasing challenges in caring for elderly residents who experience deteriorating body functions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When they age, the need for their caring [becomes] more challenging because sometimes their swallowing is not very good. Sometimes they have difficulties in excreting their urine," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chu said the charity operates entirely on donations without government subsidies and it will use the funds from OSC to hire more staff and bring in professional services.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will [use] the funds to hire additional staff and also we will [hire] professional services like occupational therapist services to come in to help these residents to maintain their health."
  <br>
  <br>
  Jointly organised by RTHK and South China Morning Post, OSC funds charitable projects that focus on children and youth, the elderly, the community, those with physical and mental disabilities, medical projects, and those concerning the environment.
  <br>
  <br>
  If you wish to make a donation, please visit the Operation Santa Claus website at https://oschk.org/.

    Giant pandas make media debut at Ocean Park

<div class="itemFullText">
 Two giant pandas gifted by the central government on Monday made their debut to the media after completing their quarantine at Ocean Park.
 <br>
  <br>
  The pair, currently called An An and Ke Ke, are both five years old and showed their distinct personalities during the visit.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ke Ke climbed up to her wooden platform and leisurely ate her bamboo leaves. An An was much more playful – he walked around exploring his habitat and rolled around on the ground while eating.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ponyo, who works at the park's Whiskers Village, explained how to tell the pandas apart.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For Ke Ke, she is like a princess. She loves to have her me time, and she's a bit curious about the environment outside, and she would like to stay a little bit quiet.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But for An An, he's just like a boy. He's very strong, and he's very curious [about the] outside, and he would like to discover outside, see what is going on."
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 22,600 suggestions have poured in for a naming contest of these national treasures, with the winning names set to be announced at the official debut ceremony on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hongkongers will be able to meet the pandas when their home opens to the public this Sunday.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Agriculture, Fisheries, and Conservation Department (AFCD) on Sunday said a tote bag was found inside a whale, which died earlier in the day.
 <br>
  <br>
  The whale had become stranded in shallow waters near Tai O.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bag, measuring 88 by 52 centimetres, was found in the whale's digestive system during a necropsy conducted by vets from Ocean Park, alongside AFCD officials.
  <br>
  <br>
  The preliminary results of the necropsy pointed to it being a male beaked whale of six-to-seven metres in length.
  <br>
  <br>
  Taison Chang is the chairman of the Hong Kong Dolphin Conservation Society. He says the tote bag could have played a role in the whale's death.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The size of the bag is quite large. It is likely to cause malnutrition over time, as it is difficult for the whale to eat other things. This is likely one of the reasons for it being so weak, leading to its accidental entry into Hong Kong waters and ultimate stranding," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The AFCD says the whale showed signs of injury, which could have been sustained when it became stranded.
  <br>
  <br>
  The cause of death and the exact species of the whale are yet to be confirmed.

 The Sai Kung District Office on Sunday said a laptop and a mobile phone belonging to one of its care teams have been stolen. The office says the devices contain the personal data of hundreds of people.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, the Sai Kung District Office said it received the theft report from the Sai Kung Hang Hau East Sub-district Care Team on Saturday. It said the laptop and the mobile phone contain the names and phone numbers of hundreds of people, some with addresses and ID card numbers.
  <br>
  <br>
  The district office said the items, used by the Hang Hau District Festival and Special Event Preparatory Committee, had been in a locked room at the Hang Hau Rural Committee office on Hang Hau Road. It said the door lock had been broken.
  <br>
  <br>
  The office said both electronic devices and files were protected by high-strength passwords, so the risk of data leakage should be relatively low.
  <br>
  <br>
  The office has reported the case to the police and the privacy watchdog.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police have classified the case as burglary.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A community group on Sunday called on the government to allow more non-elderly single people to get public housing.
 <br>
  <br>
  According to the Society for Community Organisation (SoCo), about 91,000 non-elderly one-person applicants were waiting to be allocated a public housing unit as of September.
  <br>
  <br>
  A maximum of 2,200 units, or about 10 percent of new public housing units made available, are allocated to them each year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Deputy director of SoCo Sze Lai-shan said that should be raised to up to 30 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Now the government use age in the points system when they [applicants] are waiting for public housing, and the quota for non-elderly persons is very low," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think the government should suspend the points system, and increase the quota allocated to non-elderly single people so it is more fair for them, maybe at least to 20 or 30 percent. It would be more fair and not affect families and elderlies too much."
  <br>
  <br>
  While the average waiting time for public housing units is 5.5 years, Sze said that did not include non-elderly one-person applicants who often have to wait for more than 10 years before being assigned a flat.
  <br>
  <br>
  A 57-year-old man surnamed Suen, who rents a cubicle apartment, said he has been on the waiting list for 16 years.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Four years ago I was 20 points short [on the points system] to be allocated a flat, two years ago I was still 20 points short, and recently I still find myself missing 20 points. How long do I still have to live in this apartment?" he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "No government subsidies are available, and we have to wait longer for public housing, and we are also not eligible to apply for Light Public Housing," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  SoCo also called on the government to include non-elderly one-person applicants in a cash allowance scheme for those who have been on the public housing waiting list for at least three years.

    Make every dollar count, says audit director

<img alt="Director of Audit Nelson Lam says the Audit Commission will focus more on checking public organisations and funds in the future.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Government departments and public organisations should take the lead in cutting cost and increasing revenue in light of a budget deficit, the director of audit said.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a TVB programme, Nelson Lam noted there is less corruption in the public sector these days, and government workers are being more careful with spending.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lam said the Audit Commission will therefore focus more on public organisations and funds going forward, especially when it comes to big projects involving a lot of public money.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have been looking at whether spending is economical or not. In fact, we will pay more attention to larger expenditures and those involving more public funds," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the Nano and Advanced Materials Institute, under the Innovation and Technology Commission, bearing the cost of the allowance beyond the permitted amount incurred in some business trips as revealed by the latest audit report, Lam said that affected the government's overall expenditure and image.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For us, it's quite surprising. I find it strange why people still make these kinds of mistakes. But I want to emphasise one thing – I hope all public servants understand that when you work in public service, it should be for the public good, not for personal gain," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lam also said future audit work may require cross-border data sharing because of greater cooperation between Hong Kong and Guangdong, including the expansion of elderly healthcare vouchers to mainland cities.

<div class="itemFullText">
 An injured whale that died after being stranded in Tai O might have been hurt or fallen sick before entering Hong Kong waters, a marine conservationist said on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Taison Chang, chairman of the Hong Kong Dolphin Conservation Society, believed it could be a rare Longman's beaked whale.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Even before the whale entered Hong Kong waters, it could be sick and got lost, that's why it's found in Hong Kong waters. It's very possible that the whale had some kind of disease or got injured by other reasons," he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department had activated a response plan to rescue the whale after it was sighted in the waters near Tai O on Saturday evening.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When we saw the animal near the evening time in Hong Kong, the animal was already very weak and did not behave normally," Chang said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities said the whale, with a wound on its body, was found to be extremely weak during sedation administered for further diagnosis, and it subsequently died in the early hours of Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chang also said the conditions were unfavourable for the stranded cetacean to leave.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When the residents in Tai O first saw this animal, the tide was very low. That's why when we saw a lot of photos or videos online, the animal was mostly stranded almost on the sand or on land already.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It made the situation very difficult for the animal, even if the animal had the ability to swim," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  A necropsy will be carried out on Sunday to determine the cause of death.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan said the resumption of multi-entry permits for Shenzhen residents visiting Hong Kong will boost the local tourism, retail and catering industries.
 <br>
  <br>
  From Sunday, more than 10 million people in Shenzhen will be allowed to visit the SAR as many times as they like, reversing a policy that limited such trips to once per week.
  <br>
  <br>
  Writing on his weekly blog, Chan said the move will make it easier for people to travel and strengthen economic ties between Hong Kong and Shenzhen.
  <br>
  <br>
  A series of measures by the central government to support the SAR's tourism and efforts by local shops and restaurants to improve their services will boost the Hong Kong economy, Chan added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong's economy has shown moderate overall growth this year, but consumption and export of services still need further improvement," he wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  The finance chief also noted that the new three-runway system at the airport and plans to increase international destinations will consolidate the city's position as an international aviation hub.

 A stranded whale has died near Tai O despite efforts by a team of veterinarians to help it.
 <br>
  <br>
  A spokesman for the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) said on Sunday that veterinarians from Ocean Park had carried out an initial assessment and found that the whale was injured.
  <br>
  <br>
  "During sedation administered for further diagnosis, the veterinarians found the whale in extremely weak condition," the spokesman said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the whale subsequently died during the diagnostic procedures at around midnight.
  <br>
  <br>
  The spokesman added that AFCD staff and Ocean Park vets will examine the carcass to determine the cause of death.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau announced on Saturday that starting from next year, the Mega Arts and Cultural Events Fund will adopt a fixed operation cycle to accept applications thrice annually.
 <br>
  <br>
  This comes as the authority unveiled the enhancement to the fund's operation to boost the sector's development more effectively, as well as promote tourism,
  <br>
  <br>
  A matching grant will be rolled out to encourage organisers to seek commercial funding.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government will also assess the effectiveness of events based on one more criterion - its integration with tourism.
  <br>
  <br>
  Applicants also need to ensure that events can boost tourism and the economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  The authority will provide funding for a maximum of four events each round, and it aims to support at most 10 projects each year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The fund was set up back in April last year. It has so far sponsored 20 large-scale arts and cultural events.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A sports professor at the Hong Kong Baptist University on Saturday said now is the best time for Hong Kong to develop sports as an industry and that promoting sports arbitration would be crucial.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chief Executive John Lee mentioned in his Policy Address that the government will look into establishing a sports dispute resolution system and promoting sports arbitration.
  <br>
  <br>
  Patrick Lau from the university's Department of Sport, Physical Education and Health said Hong Kong athletes had some great achievements at international events recently.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the city's sports sector had experienced controversial issues, relating to athlete selection mechanisms, sports associations making use of government funds, and compensation for sports injuries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lau urged the government to do more promotion on sports and legal knowledge.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Although other regions in Asia have set up institutions for sports arbitration, Hong Kong has advantages in internationalisation and its legal talents," he told an RTHK radio programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Together with mature infrastructures and financial supporting facilities, I believe Hong Kong can finish strong and become an important place in Asia for sports arbitration."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lau said the SAR government lacks systematic planning for sports development, and he urged the authorities to set up long-term plans every five years.

    HK well-prepared for multi-entry travellers: minister

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Secretary for Security, Chris Tang, said on Saturday that staff at border control points are well-prepared to handle a surge in travellers in the wake of Beijing's decision to restore multi-entry visas for Shenzhen residents.
 <br>
  <br>
  The multi-entry visa scheme will resume from Sunday, and the maximum length of each visit will be seven days.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was scrapped in 2015 at the request of the SAR government due to concerns over parallel trading and overcrowding.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a radio programme, Tang said the scheme's resumption is expected to benefit about 10 million people, and the government will ensure that residents will not be affected.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Border control points may be under pressure, but our staff are well-prepared, and they'll minimise leave and they'll open all the counters, to ensure there's enough manpower," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Customs and police officers will step up patrols at places where a lot of people tended to shop in the past... Similar efforts will be made at tourist spots, to ensure that visitors have a good time, while not affecting our residents."
  <br>
  <br>
  Tang said the government had discussions with the mainland authorities on extending the opening hours of control points on New Year's Eve, to ensure travellers could return to the mainland after countdown celebrations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tourism minister Kevin Yeung, meanwhile, echoed Tang's comments and downplayed the likelihood of parallel trading being an issue.
  <br>
  <br>
  He believes the scheme will boost several sectors.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Especially with Christmas around the corner, Hong Kong has more of a Christmas vibe than the mainland, which has attracted lots of teenagers there to come and enjoy the festivities here," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So with all these factors, generally speaking, the scheme will have a very positive effect on visitor numbers and on businesses between Christmas and Lunar New Year."
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeung noted that the catering and retail industries are already poised to provide high-quality service and encourage visitors to open their wallets.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he said the retail sector, in particular, has more work to do on attracting more tourists.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The retail sector, in particular, has to offer things with Hong Kong characteristics. It may not be about the product, but the service they provide has to allow travellers to enjoy a different shopping experience from the one they have on the mainland. These experiences are also important."

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police said on Saturday that they've laid a holding charge of murder against a 52-year-old man on suspicion of setting a Tsim Sha Tsui karaoke parlour on fire 27 years ago, leaving 17 people dead.
 <br>
  <br>
  The case will be mentioned at West Kowloon Magistrates' Court on Saturday morning.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officers said they were informed by their mainland counterparts earlier this week that the suspect had been apprehended. The man was sent back to Hong Kong on Thursday through the Shenzhen Bay border.
  <br>
  <br>
  Superintendent Lam Kai-chor from the Organised Crime and Triad Bureau said the force had verified the man's identity through his fingerprints.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The force has evidence to show that the suspect played a major role in the case," he alleged.
  <br>
  <br>
  The hooded suspect was brought back to the scene on Friday night to re-enact the case. He was given a plastic bottle which resembled a Molotov cocktail.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police said Molotov cocktails were thrown at the now-shuttered Top One Karaoke on January 25, 1997, days after two gangs got into a quarrel at the scene.
  <br>
  <br>
  Seventeen people died due to smoke inhalation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Five other culprits have been arrested and sentenced in connection with the case. Four of them have been jailed for life, while another received 11 years for manslaughter.
  <br>
  <br>
  The remaining suspect, Chan Fok-ching, is still on the run. Police said a HK$400,000 reward continues to be offered for information leading to his arrest.

<div class="itemFullText">
 New World Development announced on Friday that Chief Executive Officer Eric Ma has resigned with immediate effect, just a little more than two months into the job.
 <br>
  <br>
  Echo Huang, who's the head of the group's property business in mainland China, has been named as his replacement.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a filing to the local bourse, the developer said Ma, who was also the executive director, wished to pursue "other personal commitments".
  <br>
  <br>
  The former development chief took over from scion Adrian Cheng in September, after the company reported a net loss of more than HK$17 billion the previous financial year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cheng's father and the developer's chairman, Henry Cheng, said "timely phased changes needed to be made" after reviewing the group's development direction.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added he was glad to have found a "more suitable" CEO, citing Huang's experience in real estate and corporate management.
  <br>
  <br>
  The company also appointed Gilbert Ho and Edward Lau as executive directors.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shares of New World Development and sister company, New World Department Store China, fell by around six percent before trading was halted in the afternoon pending the personnel announcement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trading for both firms will resume on Monday.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The government announced on Friday that the Director of Broadcasting, Eddie Cheung, will become the new permanent secretary for the environment and ecology early next year.
 <br>
  <br>
  He'll replace Janice Tse on January 2, when she will begin her pre-retirement leave.
  <br>
  <br>
  In another senior appointment, deputy secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury Manda Chan will head the Leisure and Cultural Services Department from next Wednesday, taking over from the retiring Vincent Liu.
  <br>
  <br>
  Civil service chief Ingrid Yeung described the two appointees as seasoned administrative officers with proven leadership and management skills.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I have every confidence that they will continue to serve the community with professionalism in their new capacity," she said in a statement, while also thanking the two retiring officials.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cheung joined the government's administrative service in October 1993, and rose to the rank of administrative officer staff grade A in April this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  He has served in various bureaus and departments, including a three-year stint as the special representative for Hong Kong Economic and Trade Affairs to the European Union from 2019, before heading RTHK since October 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan, meanwhile, joined the administrative service in September 1995 and rose to the rank of Administrative Officer Staff Grade B1 in April this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  She was the Commissioner for Narcotics of the Security Bureau for more than three years from 2016, and was the Commissioner for Rehabilitation of the Labour and Welfare Bureau for around three years until October 2022.

    Northern Metropolis projects to invite tender in 2025

<img alt="The Development Bureau says it will solicit views from the industry on three Northern Metropolis projects next month. File photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1781445_1_20241129192157.jpg&q=70">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government says it will start accepting tenders for three pilot development areas in the Northern Metropolis as soon as the second half of next year, and the projects could be completed in a decade or so.
 <br>
  <br>
  The plots, in Hung Shui Kiu, Fanling North and San Tin, range from 12.5 to 18.6 hectares in size. Each will have its own residential, industrial and public facilities.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hung Shui Kiu has been earmarked as a "high-end professional services and logistics hub". A Technopole is planned in San Tin, while Fanling North is mainly designed to provide housing.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Development Bureau said baseline scenarios it set for the three sites have been deemed as financially viable by a consultant.
  <br>
  <br>
  A bureau spokesperson said developers will be asked to largely adhere to the scenarios in regards to development.
  <br>
  <br>
  But officials will also listen to feedback for potential adjustments, before the projects are put up for tender.
  <br>
  <br>
  Developers will have to carry out site formation as well as engineering infrastructure works, such as building roads and drainage. They'll have exclusive rights to residential blocks within the development site.
  <br>
  <br>
  The spokesperson said the three sites will provide some 630,000 square metres of residential gross floor area.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The large parcel development mode is a new concept in Hong Kong, but it's been widely adopted on the mainland. So we look forward to attracting not just local developers, but also those from the mainland," the spokesperson said, later adding that overseas firms are also welcome.
  <br>
  <br>
  The person pointed to existing mechanisms assessing whether participating developers are financially robust. In the event they run into capital trouble, there will be safeguards to ensure delivery of the projects.

<img alt="The Hong Kong Retail Management Association says it will take time for all sectors to fully benefit from the multi-entry visa scheme for Shenzhen residents. File photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1781432_1_20241129181641.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Retail Management Association on Friday hailed the mainland authorities' move to bring back multi-entry visas for Shenzhen residents visiting Hong Kong, saying it will boost consumption.
 <br>
  <br>
  "This policy, along with the increase in the duty-free allowance for mainland visitors and the expansion of the individual visit scheme, will stimulate the flow of visitors to Hong Kong and contribute to the local retail market," executive director Bond Law said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "However, [due to] the change in tourist consumption patterns, it will take some time and effort from all sectors to enable the multiple entry policy to fully take effect."
  <br>
  <br>
  Agnes Chan, chairwoman of the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce, said it will now be more convenient for Shenzhen residents to come to the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  “This will inject fresh momentum into sectors such as tourism, food and beverage, and retail, while boosting market confidence,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kenny Shui, vice president of the Our Hong Kong Foundation, said the measure will boost the region’s economic growth through attracting more visitors, and broaden the SAR's appeal as a destination for mega tourism events.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shui said the arrangement will not only help with the recovery of the tourism industry, but will also foster cultural and economic exchanges in the Greater Bay Area.
  <br>
  <br>
  Marcos Chan, head of Research at CBRE Hong Kong, said retail, food and beverage businesses near MTR stations in the New Territories will particularly benefit from the arrangement.
  <br>
  <br>
  “This, together with the expanded capacity of the Hong Kong International Airport via the commissioning of the third runway will warrant sustained and accelerating inbound tourism recovery for Hong Kong,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said he also expects leasing demand for shops at sightseeing spots to improve.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Should interest rates further lower, domestic consumption will also strengthen as household burdens reduce. A fuller retail market recovery is expected for 2025.”

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Enterprise representatives said on Friday they are confident about the development of the Northern Metropolis.
 <br>
  <br>
  A total of 85 companies were present at a signing ceremony for enterprise participation, including developers such as Sun Hung Kai Properties, Swire Properties and China Resources Land.
  <br>
  <br>
  They signed an expression of interest regarding the Northern Metropolis development, along with separate agreements for various projects worth some HK$100 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters after the ceremony, Bank of China's Deputy Chief Executive Wang Huabin said the Northern Metropolis' planning compliments Hong Kong's positioning as an international finance, aviation, trading and innovative hub.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We believe the Northern Metropolis will act as a new force to drive Hong Kong's development in the future. Our corporation highly values the building and development of the Northern Metropolis," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As early as 2022 when the metropolis plan was first suggested, we had already formulated and announced that we will establish a comprehensive financial services plan for the area," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang said the bank will strengthen its efforts to attract more investors to the area to complement the Hong Kong government's plan, by providing financial services to companies that invest in the Northern Metropolis.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bank signed a cooperation agreement with nine corporations, with one agreement worth more than HK$20 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Also present at the signing ceremony was Daryl Ng, deputy chairman of real estate corporation Sino Group. He said the group will support the development of the Northern Metropolis.
  <br>
  <br>
  "From the government's plan, we see there will be a third medical school in the Northern Metropolis. We also see it involves a lot of innovative technology projects and the building of a university city. I think the potential of the Northern Metropolis is very high and our group is confident in the development of the region," he said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Friday called on the business sector to get on board with the development of the Northern Metropolis, adding that the government will roll out large parcels of land in Hung Shui Kiu, Fanling North and the San Tin Technopole.
 <br>
  <br>
  "The three sites are different in scale and components, suiting varying commercial interests and risk appetite. I'm confident that this would provide the private sector with a brand new and efficient way to participate in our development and in return benefit our society as a whole," Lee said at a signing ceremony for enterprise participation.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CE added that while the development of the Northern Metropolis will be government-led, market participation is just as vital.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With the [Lok Ma Chau] loop and other development areas in the pipeline, the Northern Metropolis will become a region that radiates beyond geographical boundaries. Taking forward a development of this scale and gravitas requires the efforts and resources of all sectors of our community."
  <br>
  <br>
  Zheng Yanxiong, director of the liaison office, told the same ceremony that business leaders should take the initiative in taking forward projects in the Northern Metropolis.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The development of the Northern Metropolis is a major initiative for Hong Kong's innovative development. It represents a focal point for economic growth and breakthrough innovation, and is also a key strategic move for Hong Kong to better integrate into the development of the Greater Bay Area and the country."

 Two political parties on Friday expressed support for the mainland's move to bring back multi-entry permits for Shenzhen residents to visit Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  Visits will still be limited to seven days, but from December 1, Shenzhen residents can apply to come to the SAR as often as they like, rather than just once a week.
  <br>
  <br>
  National People's Congress Standing Committee member Starry Lee, from the DAB, said the move shows Beijing's support and care for the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are very, very much thankful for the central government's support and attention for Hong Kong," she told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We hope different sectors in society can make good use of the central authorities' support measures to revitalise the local economy."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Federation of Trade Unions, meanwhile, said the move will boost exchanges between the people of Shenzhen and Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This of course also helps local tourism and drives the development of related industries. Our federation very much welcomes this," its president, Stanley Ng, told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Of course we hope that Hong Kong's capacity to receive visitors can improve, for example our border transport, our facilities and tourism hotspots."
  <br>
  <br>
  The federation said it hopes sporting and cultural events at Kai Tak Sports Park and the West Kowloon Cultural District will attract more tourists to the city.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Travel Industry Council (TIC) on Friday welcomed the mainland's move to allow Shenzhen residents to visit Hong Kong as many times as they want in future, rather than only once per week.
 <br>
  <br>
  Executive director Fanny Yeung said the visa change, which comes into effect on December 1, is "very significant" for the tourism sector.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said she expects the number of visitors from Shenzhen to increase by at least 20 percent over Christmas.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have all these kinds of beautiful Christmas decorations...the atmosphere, the vibes, you cannot find it in any mainland city," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeung said the TIC has come up with new ways to attract tourists from across the border.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are encouraging our travel agents to offer more half day in-depth tours to attract these groups of visitors because these are experienced visitors here in Hong Kong. They know a lot of places in Hong Kong already. But most of them, they don't know about the history, or some back-end stories of some particular spots."
  <br>
  <br>
  Tourism sector lawmaker Perry Yiu also said he believes the multi-entry permits will boost the sector, adding that they will allow more people to join the SAR's mega events.

  <br>
  Wholesale and retail sector lawmaker Peter Shiu said the move provides a shot in the arm for businesses, but they also need to make improvements such as offering more specialty products to encourage spending.

    More flights, cheaper fares on the way: airport boss

 The new three-runway system will enable more flights to and from Chek Lap Kok and will bring down air fares, Airport Authority chief Steven Yiu said on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  All three runways came into operation on Thursday, with officials eyeing a boost in capacity to 120 million passengers per year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yiu, the authority's executive director, told RTHK that airlines are queuing up to get hold of additional departure and arrival slots.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The airlines are excited about the three-runway system because they want to be able to operate more trips. If short-haul flights that take around four to five hours for a round-trip leave in the morning, that means they may be able to make three trips a day. From an operating point of view, this increases airlines' efficiency," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yiu said the authority is hoping to attract more airlines to use Hong Kong for lay overs and is hoping for more long-haul routes to be opened up.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the past six months, we have provided incentives to airlines if they are willing to provide flights to places that were not available before, or if they add flights to some of our strategic destinations," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that Hong Kong will remain an international aviation hub even if competition from other airports in the Greater Bay Area intensifies.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If we look at the economy in the Greater Bay Area, there is a total population of 86 million people, which is 10 times the Hong Kong population. The area also has the most vibrant economy in China. Even with the opening of all 11 runways in the area, I believe it will not be sufficient to satisfy all demand," he said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 More than 10 million people in Shenzhen will be allowed to visit Hong Kong as many times as they like from December 1, the authorities said on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Mainland officials have reversed their 2015 decision to limit such visits to once per week, allowing Shenzhen residents to apply for multi-entry permits to make repeated trips to the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  The maximum length of each visit will remain at seven days.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chief Executive John Lee expressed his gratitude to the central government for making the move.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee previously said he had requested a return to the earlier arrangement, which was scrapped due to concerns over parallel trading and overcrowding.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, from next year Zhuhai residents can apply for weekly trips to Macau, while those living in the Guangdong-Macau In-Depth Cooperation Zone in Hengqin will be able to go to Macau as many times as they like for up to seven days at a time.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong Premier League side Eastern on Thursday night crashed out of contention in the AFC Champions League Two – Asia's second-tier club football tournament – suffering a 4-1 defeat to Australian side Sydney FC in their Group E match-up at Mong Kok Stadium.
 <br>
  <br>
  Sydney jumped out to a commanding 3-0 lead in the first half, thanks to an early goal from Moroccan striker Anas Ouahim in the fifth minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  That was followed up by a 16th-minute half-volley by Patryk Klimala, as Ouahim deflected a shot for Sydney's third goal to close out the half.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eastern striker Noah Baffoe pulled one goal back for the home team with a glancing header from a free kick in the 49th.
  <br>
  <br>
  But it was Ouahim's individual brilliance that sealed the victory for the Australians, scoring a penalty in the 62nd minute to secure the first-ever hat-trick of his career.
  <br>
  <br>
  With one round left, the win guarantees Sydney's progression to the last 16 of the continental competition for just the second time in the club’s history.
  <br>
  <br>
  They next face Philippine side Kaya FC in their final group match on December 5, while Eastern will travel to Hiroshima to play Japan side Sanfrecce on the same day.

    Zeman calls for 'panda island' attraction

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A former chairman of Ocean Park says the theme park needs to make the most of its unique panda attractions to boost returns and get back to profitability.
 <br>
  <br>
  Allan Zeman, chairman of Lan Kwai Fong Group, told RTHK's
  <a href="https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/news-programmes/this-episode.htm?cmsid=77" target="_blank">
   Hong Kong Today
  </a>
  programme that outside of the mainland, nowhere else in the world had six pandas and Ocean Park should create a 'panda island' to capitalise on this.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The fact that we have six pandas, if they do a panda island, they find a piece of land... have all the six pandas together... panda restaurants, panda shops... panda games... really create something that no other part of the world has. And I think that would really drive a lot of business," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The park unveiled its latest full-year result on Thursday, saying it recorded a deficit of more than HK$71.6 million for the financial year ending in June, despite revenue and visitor numbers hitting five-year highs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zeman said promoting the "panda economy" would be key to the park's success going forward, especially after the government's time-limited subvention – capped at HK$280 million a year – ends after the 2025-2026 financial year.
  <br>
  <br>
  He pointed out the limitations facing Ocean Park in setting its own admission fees.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Ocean Park Corporation is a statutory board that is a not-for-profit organisation, aiming to provide education and conservation at an affordable price.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong government said on Thursday that it rejects and strongly disapproves of the European Parliament’s so-called resolution on Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  The European body earlier passed a non-binding resolution, calling for the “immediate and unconditional” release of all opposition figures who had been sentenced on national security charges.
  <br>
  <br>
  It called for sanctions to be imposed on Hong Kong and mainland officials, and demanded that Hong Kong’s favourable customs treatment be revoked.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, the SAR government said it strongly condemns the baseless claims made against its officials.
  <br>
  <br>
  A spokesperson stressed that as an inalienable part of the People’s Republic of China, Hong Kong needs to put in place a complete and effective set of national security legislation to safeguard national security.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that many other common law jurisdictions also have their own national security legislation, and that the European Parliament should not interfere in Hong Kong matters and China's internal affairs.
  <br>
  <br>
  The spokesman stressed that all trials in Hong Kong are being conducted in an open, fair and independent manner.

 Police said a 75-year-old man has been arrested on Thursday in connection with a fire that broke out along a road in Tsuen Wan the day before.
 <br>
  <br>
  The blaze, which destroyed part of a six-metre-tall noise barrier on Cheung Pei Shan Road near Shek Wai Kok Estate, disrupted traffic for much of the day on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chief inspector Law Sai-to of the Tsuen Wan district crime unit said the suspect was identified after reviewing CCTV footage and interviewing nearby residents.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He lives near the scene of the crime. When he was arrested, we found three medium-sized lighters and a utility knife on him. He was arrested on suspicion of arson and possession of offensive weapon, and is currently being detained for questioning," Law said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Investigations are continuing, he added.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Commissioner's Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Hong Kong on Thursday said it strongly disapproves and rejects a decision by Washington to update its travel advisory for Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  The office made the remarks a day after the US Department of State issued a “Level 2” alert for those intending to travel to Hong Kong, saying people should “exercise increased caution” due to the “arbitrary enforcement” of national security legislation in the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  A spokesperson for the office stressed Hong Kong is one of the safest and most livable cities in the world, adding that national security legislation – the formulation and implementation of which are in line with international practice and the rule of law – has brought stability to the territory.
  <br>
  <br>
  The spokesman pointed out that the SAR has welcomed 21 million visitors during the first half of this year, 64 percent more than the same period last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Foreign funds, enterprises and talented individuals also continued to pour in, showing the international community’s trust in Hong Kong,” he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The office called on the US to stop smearing Hong Kong through repeatedly issuing travel advisories, saying the SAR – as an open and free international city – will continue to welcome international visitors with open arms.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SAR government also issued a separate statement, calling on the US to stop using its travel advisories as a political tool to smear Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  A spokesperson stressed there are clear lines being drawn when it comes to the city's national security legislation, and tourists will not unwittingly fall foul of the law.

    HK restaurants urged to get Halal certification

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Tourism Board and certification authorities are encouraging restaurants, hotels and attractions to enhance their Muslim-friendly offerings by obtaining Halal certification, with the aim of enriching the experience of Muslim visitors to Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  The board said on Thursday that the number of certified Halal and Halal-friendly restaurants has risen from approximately 100 at the start of the year to around 130.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SAR now has its first ever high-end Chinese restaurant certified as Halal-friendly.
  <br>
  <br>
  Saito Chau, culinary director of Chinesology, said the certification process was extremely detailed, encompassing everything from menu design and the procurement of cutlery and cooking utensils to selecting appropriate ingredients.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said that achieving the Halal-friendly status was a significant milestone in making Chinese cuisine more accessible to Muslim consumers.
  <br>
  <br>
  For example, the restaurant has recreated the popular "char siu", or Chinese barbecue pork, with beef instead.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Muslim diners do not know much about Chinese cuisines, many of whom have never tried Chinese cuisine before. This inspires us to offer a culinary experience to Muslim visitors that allows them to explore the sophistication of the Chinese culinary culture by getting to taste the dishes themselves," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Becky Ip, deputy executive director of the board, said the SAR is committed to expanding its outreach to visitors from Middle Eastern and Asean markets, recognising the significant potential and spending power of Muslim consumers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have just started the whole support to our agencies and also the [Incorporated Trustees of the Islamic Community Fund of Hong Kong] Board of Trustees for making Hong Kong more Muslim-friendly, particularly in the dining scene," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's just a beginning as we just started in June this year, so so far we have about 30 new restaurants joining as Halal-friendly restaurants. So hoping by doing so, we will have more. We'd like to see more restaurants participate in the scheme."
  <br>
  <br>
  Ip added that they have intensified promotional efforts in Muslim source markets to draw more visitors from Southeast Asia and the Middle East to Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[It is] very important to let Muslim travellers understand well [that when] they come to enjoy Hong Kong, it will also be very safe for them to eat the food in Hong Kong, where they stay will be very safe for them," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have actually brought a few delegations to the Middle East and quite some delegations to promote Hong Kong together with our trade partners in these areas, Middle East and Southeast Asian countries. Apart from that, we also have invited over the past few months a series of KOLs, media and trade partners to come and see Hong Kong themselves.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Particularly let them have a chance to sample our hotel facilities and sample the Hong Kong food they look forward to. It's very, very important."

 The HK$141 billion three-runway system at Hong Kong airport went into operation on Thursday, with authorities hailing it as a historic moment for the city's aviation development.
 <br>
  <br>
  Three flights - two taking off and one landing - were handled simultaneously at Chek Lap Kok in the afternoon, witnessed by top SAR and mainland officials attending a ceremony.
  <br>
  <br>
  Guests included Chief Executive John Lee, Vice Minister of Transport Xu Chengguang and the director of Beijing's liaison office Zheng Yanxiong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The various airlines also need to fully enhance their services, strengthening major routes and to explore more new destinations for Hong Kong, especially to countries of the Belt and Road Initiative in order to raise industry competitiveness," Lee said.
  <br>
  <br>
  One of Hong Kong’s largest infrastructure projects in recent years, the three-runway system involved the reclamation of 650 hectares of land to house the 3.8 kilometre-long extra runway.
  <br>
  <br>
  The new system boosts the airport's capacity to 120 million passengers per year, on top 10 million tonnes of cargo.
  <br>
  <br>
  Airport Authority chairman Fred Lam pledged to continue to implement the Airport City blueprint unveiled in 2019.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It will attract travellers from all around the world, boost the flow of people and goods, and act as an engine of Hong Kong’s economic development," he said at the commissioning ceremony.
  <br>
  <br>
  The authority said that it is now taking forward the phase two development of AsiaWorld-Expo, while a large-scale storage facility and other new projects will be completed from 2026 to 2031.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Labour and Welfare Chris Sun said on Thursday that the government cannot make the lives of carers better on its own and all sectors must work together to support them.
 <br>
  <br>
  Sun said he is pleased to see that various NGOs have already cooperated with the Social Welfare Department to help carers.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that carers who need help should not hesitate to phone the government's 182 183 hotline.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The person answering the call doesn't only chat with you to calm you," Sun said at an event.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If you are looking for temporary short-term care, the hotline will arrange it for you. If it's a very urgent situation, there will also be social workers rushing to help you."

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Thursday hinted there would soon be news on the administration's request for changes to visa arrangements for mainland residents visiting Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  In his latest Policy Address, Lee said he had asked Beijing to bring back multiple-entry visas for Shenzhen residents and to expand the number of cities that grant visas for weekly visits to the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm grateful that central government departments are studying the proposal to expedite the implementation. I believe there will be news soon," Lee said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "All units of the SAR government will do their utmost to coordinate the implementation of such measures, promote people-to-people exchanges, and inject new momentum into the tourism, catering and retail industries."
  <br>
  <br>
  Beginning in April 2009, Shenzhen residents were allowed to apply for Individual Visit Endorsements, with holders able to enter and exit the SAR freely within a one-year validity period.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the scheme was replaced with a "one-trip-per-week" arrangement in 2015 following concerns over parallel trading and overcrowding.

    Men feel less included in society, survey finds

<img alt="The Hong Kong Christian Service found that the city has an inclusion score of about 70 out of 100. Photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1781206_1_20241128131553.jpg&q=60">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Men feel they are less included in society than women, according to a survey conducted by the Hong Kong Christian Service.
 <br>
  <br>
  The group surveyed 1,026 people between May and June to gather their views on eight attributes affecting their sense of inclusiveness. These areas are employment, recreational facilities, housing, family life, social connections, education, healthcare and culture.
  <br>
  <br>
  The overall inclusion score was about 70 out of 100, which the group views as "average".
  <br>
  <br>
  But men scored lower than women in every aspect.
  <br>
  <br>
  A single father surnamed Wong said gender stereotypes have made parenting of his seven-year-old daughter difficult.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I have never seen any father help with changing a baby's diaper in the shopping mall’s baby care room. To avoid embarrassment, I would knock on the door to 'seek approval' from the mothers inside," Wong said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that he sometimes feels he is treated unkindly, saying he has overheard people talk about whether he might be a kidnapper when he holds his daughter's hand when they are out.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wilson Yung from the Hong Kong Christian Service called on society to be more accepting and to appreciate men's decisions over their family roles.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We analysed that maybe due to Chinese culture, which mainly sees a man taking the role of family income [earners], and childcare will rely on women. In the current situation the society is not too accepting for men to be child caregivers," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The survey also found that interviewees considered education to be the least inclusive area.
  <br>
  <br>
  The group said while the government has recently invested a lot resources in special needs students, there's a need for more tailored support, stressing that the current approach is too generic.

<img alt="Paul Chan says Hong Kong can connect mainland China and the Global South with the markets worldwide. Photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1781207_1_20241128132121.jpg&q=1">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Thursday called on business leaders to help with Hong Kong's bid to join the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), the world's largest free trade agreement.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a speech at the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce International Business Summit, Lee said with growing partnership between Hong Kong and Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean), it's clear that the SAR is ready to join RCEP.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I believe that the next natural step in our growing ties with Asean is for Hong Kong to become a member of RCEP," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  RCEP is a free trade pact for the Asian-Pacific region that includes all 10 Asean member states.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong is fully prepared to join RCEP. Doing so will boost our ties in trade and benefit companies and investors throughout the nations of Asean and also RCEP," the CE said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And I continue to count on business leaders like your good selves, people who know Hong Kong well and appreciate the value that Hong Kong can add to RCEP, to speak up in support of our accession bid."
  <br>
  <br>
  Financial Secretary Paul Chan, who also attended the summit, said Hong Kong has a unique role in connecting the markets in the Global South, including mainland China, to the rest of the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan noted that many mainland companies have established supply chains in the Global South and Belt and Road countries, and Hong Kong can play the role of a super-connector.
  <br>
  <br>
  “[Mainland firms] need project and trade financing. They need world-class professional services. They need global capital and global talent. In order to do this, Hong Kong would be a very unique platform,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We are encouraging mainland companies coming to Hong Kong to set up their regional offices, even international offices, to support their global ambition.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The financial secretary also spoke about challenges facing the world "underscored by geo-economic fragmentation", such as threats by US President-elect Donald Trump to raise tariffs on goods from China, Canada and Mexico.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite that, Chan said the US and Europe remain important and valuable partners for the SAR and China as a whole, saying cooperation remains possible in "non-sensitive areas" such as infrastructure and climate-related activities.
  <br>
  <br>
  He stressed the SAR needs to engage proactively with the West and reach out to their markets to tell the true Hong Kong story, to tackle misconceptions and biases.
  <br>
  <br>
  Standard Chartered's President, International, Benjamin Hung, said business people he'd spoken to around the world were discussing the possibility of higher US tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said with China having the world's largest production capacity, firms shifting their manufacturing elsewhere may lead to rising costs and higher inflation, adding to consumers' burden.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Right now, diversification is the name of the game... This is like insurance, this is like buying protection, because nowhere in the world, unfortunately, can produce the quantity, the quality, and at the cost level that China can," Hung said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So 'China+1' is never going to be enough because 'China+1' isn't enough to compensate the volume of China. You need 'China+2', 'China+N'."
  <br>
  <br>
  He said Hong Kong’s role amidst the challenges isn't just to be a centre for supply chains, but also to manage capital.

    Ocean Park sees deficit despite visitor, income surge

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ocean Park has recorded a deficit of more than HK$71 million for the financial year ending in June, despite revenue and visitor numbers hitting five-year highs.
 <br>
  <br>
  Announcing its results on Thursday, the theme park also said it will capitalise on the presence of six giant pandas to drive park attendance and income.
  <br>
  <br>
  From December 8, the public will get to meet two pandas sent by the central government as gifts to the SAR, followed by locally-bred twin cubs as early as February next year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will capitalise on the presence of six giant pandas in the park to drive citywide excitement, thereby increasing visitor numbers and revenue while promoting panda tourism and ecological conservation in Hong Kong," said Ocean Park chairman Paulo Pong.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the 2023-24 fiscal year, the theme park's total revenue increased 41 percent year-on-year to HK$1.18 billion, primarily driven by a 54 percent growth in admission income.
  <br>
  <br>
  Revenue from merchandise jumped 27 percent, while catering income rose 32 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The park also welcomed 33 percent more visitors at 3.14 million in 2023-24, when compared with the same period last year. Visitors from the mainland, India and the Philippines showed significant year-on-year growth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Still, the theme park recorded a financial deficit of HK$71.6 million in the period ending June 30.
  <br>
  <br>
  Excluding government subsidies and depreciation, its net operating loss narrowed for a third straight year to HK$297 million, with the park saying the figure reflected "sustained upward momentum in operations and business performance" with cost-saving and revenue-generating measures in place.
  <br>
  <br>
  As of the end of June, the park's bank balance and cash totalled roughly HK$1.66 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will continue to pursue diverse revenue sources and aim for continued improvement in our financial performance over the medium to long term, despite prevailing external economic uncertainties. Through our operating income, we seek to contribute to society, future generations, and environmental conservation, thereby reducing reliance on public finances," Pong said.

    Govt vows to take down cybercriminals with technology

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Thursday warned that technology-related crimes are on the rise in Hong Kong, while vowing to work with other jurisdictions to take on the challenges new technology poses.
 <br>
  <br>
  At the Asia and Pacific Regional Conference of the International Association of Prosecutors, Chief Executive John Lee said the SAR attaches great importance to ensuring the security of cyber infrastructure.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In Hong Kong, a highly developed international financial centre where technology is easily accessible by all, criminals are increasingly turning to the use of cryptocurrencies, virtual assets and technology in committing traditional crime. And crimes executed solely through technology are also on the rise," Lee said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That's why Hong Kong places great emphasis on the security of cyber infrastructure, in fighting technology crime, locally and internationally."
  <br>
  <br>
  Secretary for Justice Paul Lam told the same conference that crimes involving modern technology present "novel challenges" to prosecutors, adding that it can be difficult to bring offenders to justice.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Modern technology is, of course, not inherently evil. It becomes evil only when it is misused and abused by criminals," Lam said. "Our overriding objective is not only to prevent, suppress and punish such misuses and abuses, but also to outwit the criminals by becoming better users of modern technology and make modern technology our close ally in our war against the criminals."
  <br>
  <br>
  Tong Jianming, first deputy prosecutor general of the Supreme People's Procuratorate, said it is important for jurisdictions to adapt to changes brought about by technological developments.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that Beijing is willing to collaborate with others on using modern technology in strengthening prosecutions and looking into effective ways to tackle crime.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A property analyst says housing prices are bottoming out and should stabilise next year, with possible growth of under five percent.
 <br>
  <br>
  Hannah Jeong, head of valuation and advisory services at CBRE, was commenting after official data showed that home prices went up in October after declining for five months.
  <br>
  <br>
  Data showed private residential prices were up 0.6 percent month-on-month. In September, prices dropped to their lowest level in eight years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rents in October recorded their first fall since February, falling 0.3 percent month-on-month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jeong said the major reasons for the upswing in prices were local banks lowering their prime rates after the US central bank began cutting interest rates in September.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government relaxing the maximum loan-to-value (LTV) ratio for all residential properties to 70 percent, regardless of the value of the property and whether it is for self-occupation, also had an impact, she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think we only have three or two months to go. So the decline or the overall negative growth will continue within this year," Jeong said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But 2025, possibly we are bottoming out and then see slight positive growth, possibly less than five percent, or remain stable or flat. So that's the forecast for 2025."
  <br>
  <br>
  The analyst noted the rental market was performing quite well, with a yield reaching about 3.3 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said she expected this upward trend to continue in 2025, due to the number of people entering the city under various government talent schemes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jeong also said there was a very strong desire for home ownership in Hong Kong, and next year, when the supply of new flats was expected to peak at around 26,000, this would provide a good opportunity for potential homebuyers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So I think we are facing the supply peak, obviously, at the wrong time. But this will give a good opportunity to homebuyers. People were waiting a very long time and unfortunately during Covid, people thought the market will be soft. But we had a 2020 price peak and people are losing money, whoever bought at that moment," she explained.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So now people learned a lesson and expect that if the price is much more affordable at this moment, people want to have a home."
  <br>
  <br>
  She also said developers were keen to get rid of their new units and were offering good incentives in the first-hand market.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Secretary Eric Chan on Wednesday said a three-day visit to the Greater Bay Area has offered authorities insight into developing the Northern Metropolis project in the New Territories.
 <br>
  <br>
  Concluding the three-day visit to Guangdong province attended by government officials and business leaders, Chan said the trip had met its goal.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This trip to different major cities is purely an introduction, an exchange. We do not require business representatives to make any investments," Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I hope that they are able to see business opportunities, because they are truly the experts in doing business. When they see business opportunities, naturally, they will hold discussions [with others]."
  <br>
  <br>
  During the trip, enterprises from Guangdong and Hong Kong signed 126 economic and trade cooperation projects worth a total value of more than 100 billion yuan.
  <br>
  <br>
  The delegation also learnt about a “large-scale, land-disposable” development model used in mainland cities, which the SAR administration hopes can be used to expedite development in the Northern Metropolis.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan also said the government will hold a "promotional event" relating to the mega project on Friday, with local, mainland and foreign companies expected to attend.
  <br>
  <br>
  Finance chief Paul Chan is hammering out the details and will make an announcement in due course, the chief secretary added.

<img alt="Banker Peter Wong will chair the university's governing council from January 1, 2025 for a three-year term. File photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1781107_1_20241127183907.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Banker Peter Wong has been named the new chairman of the University of Hong Kong (HKU) governing council, succeeding barrister Priscilla Wong after her term ends next month.
 <br>
  <br>
  The government on Wednesday announced the appointment of the banker, who was previously the Asia-Pacific chief executive officer at HSBC, for a term of three years with effect from January 1, 2025.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chief Executive John Lee, in his capacity as the university's chancellor, also appointed five new members to the governing council.
  <br>
  <br>
  They include former director general of civil aviation Simon Li; Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) Standing Committee member Irons Sze; lawmaker Rock Chen; former president of the Hong Kong Institute of Human Resource Management Wilfred Wong; and CPPCC delegate Samuel Yung.
  <br>
  <br>
  Five other current members will also leave the governing council, alongside the outgoing chairwoman.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The newly appointed members are all elites in the community, possessing outstanding capabilities and rich experience," the government said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The chief executive hopes that the new appointments will provide the HKU's governance with a new outlook and new impetus, begin a new chapter in governance, steer the HKU towards striving for excellence and provide fresh momentum to the university."
  <br>
  <br>
  The university, for its part, said it respects the appointments made by the administration.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The university will continue to pursue excellence and make contributions in academic excellence, talent cultivation and international cooperation," HKU said.
  <br>
  <br>
  In June, a task force was established amid a conflict among the university's leadership, with vice-chancellor Zhang Xiang complaining that he was left in the dark about appointments made by Priscilla Wong.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the government statement, the chief executive thanked the task force “for its unremitting efforts in coordinating the HKU's internal operations, enhancing communication, assisting in resolving issues, reaching a consensus, and achieving a positive outcome”.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The group will continue its work to facilitate collaboration between the new council and the management for the continuous enhancement of the HKU's governance effectiveness."

    Auditor finds hitches with care home voucher scheme

<img alt="The auditor said welfare officials need to resolve some administrative issues with the Residential Care Service Voucher Scheme. File photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1781061_1_20241127153405.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Audit Commission said on Wednesday that it has found a number of administrative issues with a government voucher scheme for elderly people to pay for care homes, such as incorrect charges and widely varying application processing times.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a report, the commission said more than 5,700 applications for the Residential Care
  <br>
  Service Voucher scheme were received in 2022-23 and 2023-24, and as of the end of March this year, 3,179 vouchers had been issued.
  <br>
  <br>
  Welfare officials haven't given a timeline on how long applications should take, but the auditor found it can vary greatly, from issuance the same day all the way to a wait of seven months. The average time was 43 days, it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The auditor also found that some voucher recipients were wrongly sent bills for charges that were supposed to be covered by the government, or were overcharged by homes for extra items like nutritional drinks.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Social Welfare Department is tasked with inspecting service providers, as well as carrying out visits to check various aspects of the voucher scheme, such as the fees being charged.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the auditor found that in the previous three financial years, inspections were carried out 41 days late on average, while visits were 232 days overdue. The department blamed the delays on the Covid pandemic.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[The social welfare director should] take measures to ensure that service monitoring visits and inspections are conducted in accordance with the timeframes stipulated in the department's guidelines," the commission said.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also made a series of other recommendations, such a specific timeframe for processing voucher applications and a mechanism for vetting care home charges.
  <br>
  <br>
  The department said it agreed with the recommendations and will take the necessary follow-up action.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Four people who were jailed for conspiracy to commit subversion in Hong Kong's largest national security trial to date have appealed against their convictions and sentences.
 <br>
  <br>
  Former activist Owen Chow, former lawmaker Helena Wong, former district councillor Clarisse Yeung and ex-hospital worker Winnie Yu filed their appeals to the High Court on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The hearing date has not been scheduled, according to the judiciary website.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last week, the High Court handed down jail terms to 45 people for their roles in a scheme aiming to bring down the government by organising an unsanctioned Legco primary poll, with sentences ranging from four years and two months to 10 years behind bars.
  <br>
  <br>
  The four who lodged the appeals were among those who pleaded not guilty but were convicted after trial.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chow was slapped with a jail sentence of seven years and nine months; Yu received a prison term of six years and nine months; and Wong and Yeung were each sentenced to six-and-a-half years in jail.
