    Deficit not a big problem for HK: Wang Linggui

<div class="itemFullText">
 A deputy director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office on Monday said he does not believe the SAR's fiscal deficit is a major concern, citing the size of the city's economy.
 <br>
  <br>
  Wang Linggui, who's also a member of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), felt Hong Kong remains in a strong position despite an estimated deficit of HK$87.2 billion in the fiscal year ending March 31.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong's economic situation is not weak among developed economies in the world. Its economic growth exceeded two percent last year," he told reporters in Beijing.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A deficit of [around] HK$100 billion shouldn't be a big deal for an economy of Hong Kong's size."
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang noted the central government rolled out preferential policies for Hong Kong last year, adding more will come in the future.
  <br>
  <br>
  For instance, he said a multi-entry visa scheme will continue to expand to make it easier for mainland residents to visit the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he urged Hong Kong residents to be prepared for a rise in arrivals, including the need to draw up crowd control measures.

    Deliveroo to exit HK, sack 200 staff

<div class="itemFullText">
 Online food delivery firm Deliveroo said on Monday it is exiting Hong Kong for financial reasons, after operating in the SAR for nine years.
 <br>
  <br>
  Its UK-based parent company said its service platform will run until April 7, and it will close Deliveroo's operations by selling some assets to rival foodpanda, and closing other assets.
  <br>
  <br>
  About 200 staff members will be laid off.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There are several dynamics specific to the Hong Kong market which led the Board to consider strategic options," Deliveroo said in a statement, without explaining what the dynamics were.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Given the Group's commitment to disciplined capital allocation, [we] determine that it would not serve shareholders' best interests to continue to operate in Hong Kong."
  <br>
  <br>
  The company's chief operating officer, Eric French, said the firm wants to thank all of its staff, consumers, riders and restaurant and grocery partners in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  Deliveroo said in its 2024 interim results that Hong Kong "was a laggard amongst our major markets", citing "a more difficult market and competitive environment".
  <br>
  <br>
  Its Hong Kong market share fell after the entry of mainland-based Keeta, a subsidiary of Meituan, in late 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  The company said on Monday that Hong Kong represented five percent of the group's gross transaction value in 2024, and had a five percentage point negative impact on international gross transaction value growth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, foodpanda's parent, Delivery Hero, announced it reached an agreement with Deliveroo, saying that some of the outgoing food courier's customers and riders will be directed to foodpanda.
  <br>
  <br>
  Delivery Hero had said in a trading update last month that it saw "strong customer growth" in the SAR in December. (Additional reporting by Reuters)

 Hong Kong will improve as long as everyone works together to tackle the fiscal deficit, a former deputy director of Beijing's liaison office in the SAR said on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Qiu Hong, who is also a member of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), said unity is important when it comes to improving the economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think the deficit is a challenge Hong Kong faces in its development progress. As long as everyone works together and makes a joint effort for Hong Kong's future, I believe the situation will definitely keep improving," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Qiu also expressed optimism about the city's future, noting that residents are actively taking part in national development and Hong Kong's growth.

    Govt welcomes HK$200m donation to support AI

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's finance and technology ministers on Monday welcomed a HK$200 million donation by property developers to support the city’s generative artificial intelligence development.
 <br>
  <br>
  The fund will be used to support the Hong Kong Generative AI Research and Development Centre (HKGAI), and to develop an app for the recently launched HKGAI V1, the SAR's first locally developed generative AI tool.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a press event during which the donation provided by the Ng Teng Fong Charitable Foundation and Sino Group was announced, Financial Secretary Paul Chan said Hong Kong must grasp opportunities brought by AI.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The donation will support the establishment of a service platform for the InnoHK Research Clusters to provide services for residents based on the locally-produced large [AI] model, HKGAI," he told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I look forward to the further development of the model, to extend the platform to cover more application scenarios, so that the services will be more diversified and benefit more local residents," Chan added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong launched the HKGAI V1 large model about two weeks ago. It powers a chatbot called HKChat which is capable of answering users' questions on topics ranging from the SAR's government structure to cinema schedules.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at the same event, the Secretary for Innovation, Technology and Industry, Sun Dong, added that the funds will help make the service platform more market-driven, and help the centre hire more staff.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When you try to run a service system to the general public, you must have enough resources to support this platform, including human power as well as computing power, I think this is the main purpose of this donation," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I also hope the new version, or the mobile version of the large language model of HKGAI will be able to serve Hong Kong people as soon as possible, hopefully in the next several months."
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, Sun dismissed concerns that the latest reduction in government spending announced in last month’s budget will affect research and innovation in technology.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said authorities will support those developments in a more targeted way.

 Four people were injured and one driver fled the scene following a three-vehicle collision in Shing Mun Tunnel early on Monday morning.
 <br>

<div class="itemFullText">
 Businessman Irons Sze on Monday said Hong Kong's position as an international financial centre is attributed to China's reform and opening up and reinforced by the "One Country, Two Systems" principle.
 <br>
  <br>
  Sze, a Standing Committee member of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), said the SAR plays a vital role in the country's development.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As of the end of 2024, 1,478 mainland enterprises were listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, accounting for more than 80 percent of the total market value and 90 percent of daily transactions," he told reporters in Beijing.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the shipping front, Sze said Hong Kong's ports handled 13 million standard containers in 2024, with 40 percent of cargo coming from the mainland and 60 percent destined for the mainland.
  <br>
  <br>
  He concluded by saying that Hong Kong's future lies in its integration with the mainland, and the city would continue to contribute to the nation's development with its unique advantages.

  , Leung said the city had to build on its unique strengths and expand its global role.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Apart from maintaining our existing niches of system, such as the legal system, the economic and financial system, we have to explore more opportunities in terms of tech and international relations," Leung said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is a unique role of Hong Kong and the message is very clear: we also have to maximise some of the uniqueness in One Country, Two Systems, such as becoming an international trade dispute centre, arbitration centre as well as the only bi-lingual system that practices common law."

    Unsold homes dampens interest for new sites: tycoon

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A property tycoon says he believes Hong Kong developers will take a "conservative" approach over acquiring new plots, noting such firms still had a lot of unsold units.
 <br>
  <br>
  In an exclusive interview with RTHK, David Chiu – who sits on the Standing Committee of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference – also said this year might see some unsuccessful government land tenders.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Far East Consortium chairman said given the ample supply in inventory, developers would not feel the need to purchase more sites, likening it to “taking a break from eating and clearing the system when one’s full".
  <br>
  <br>
  “I believe now the stock in hand by all the property developers collectively – stock that they want to sell – could be as high as 20,000 to 30,000 units,” he told RTHK on the sidelines of the Two Sessions in Beijing.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I think a lot of developers' minds today... with interest rates being so high... is how to reduce their gearing first.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The government has announced plans to put eight residential plots up for sale in the coming year, but not any commercial sites.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The good news is the government has stopped selling commercial land, which I think is sensible and smart. But we've still got close to 10 pieces of land they want to sell,” Chiu said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “My advice to the government... I would not be too aggressive.”
  <br>
  <br>
  While home prices in the SAR tumbled 7.1 percent in 2024, the businessman said the property market was not expected to weaken further.
  <br>
  <br>
  It would be “unlikely” for residential property prices to skyrocket, Chiu added.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The price should be stable. It's not going up because of two reasons. Number one, interest rates still remain high. Secondly, frankly, supply is still quite sufficient,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Chiu cautioned the commercial real estate market sentiment remained weak, with an oversupply of office buildings.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chiu, separately, is a proponent of taking part in the development of the Northern Metropolis, citing the cheaper costs and proximity to Shenzhen.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I believe the future growth of China… is the Greater Bay [Area]. One of the local motifs of the Greater Bay [Area] is Shenzhen,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We got the wisdom, we got the education, we got the capital market, but we haven’t gotten the people… We need China as a backup. So linking up [mainland Chinese] young people and Hong Kong’s young people on high-tech is going to be a fantastic marriage.”

 Neil Robertson from Australia won the 2025 World Snooker Grand Prix on Sunday, delivering a dominant performance by whitewashing Stuart Bingham from England by a score of 10-frames-to-nil.
 <br>
  <br>
  It was Robertson's second championship title at the World Grand Prix.
  <br>
  <br>
  The final began at 1 pm, with Bingham already down 8-0 by the end of the first session.
  <br>
  <br>
  One spectator, Awlam, shared that this was his first time watching a snooker match, and he was excited about the whole experience.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Yes! Nice! It’s actually very nice. I’ve been here every day except for one. The sports park is absolutely amazing,” he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The whole development, including the stadium, the arena, the malls, and everything around it, is really impressive. I am very happy to see this.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Another spectator, Mr Chan, remarked that it was a great experience to watch snooker at the Kai Tak Arena, where the atmosphere was fantastic.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It’s big and beautiful; it’s quite nice. And it’s close to the MTR station.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The match resumed at 7:30 pm, and Robertson continued his impressive performance, winning two straight games and defeating Bingham 10-0.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier in the day, an exhibition match took place between Hong Kong's top player, Ng On-yee, and world number one Mink Nutcharut, with Nutcharut winning 2-0.

    Fans enjoy the atmosphere on the final day of LIV Golf

<img alt="Many fans told RTHK the all-star player roster was a big draw for them. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795008_1_20250309201219.jpg&q=60">

<div class="itemFullText">
 Spectators were immersed in what felt like a party-like atmosphere on the third and final day of the LIV Golf Hong Kong tournament, as the second edition of the event wrapped up in Fanling on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Fans told RTHK that the large number of star players included in the LIV Golf draw – a field that included six-time major winner Phil Mickelson and 2024 US Open champion Bryson DeChambeau – helped bring more fans to the historic Hong Kong Golf Club course.
  <br>
  <br>
  A man surnamed Mok, who was at the Hong Kong Golf Open in Fanling last November, said it was a big step-up from last year's inaugural competition.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think in the past, you might get one or two top names," he said. "Obviously, most of the LIV Golf roster are top players who won multiple majors. And I think that in itself is very attractive."
  <br>
  <br>
  He also commended the accessibility for fans and families travelling to the tournament, which he said helped draw much larger crowds than he expected.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Promoting [the tournament] is one thing, but it also needs to be accessible," Mok explained. "There's an effort to make it participatory, rather than just putting up the names. The big events will sell themselves, but giving people the chance to access it in an equitable way would be great."
  <br>
  <br>
  Another fan from Argentina, surnamed Caceres, shared his experience as a first-time spectator at a major golf tournament in the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think people in Hong Kong love their sports and these kinds of events," said Caceres, who attended both the second and final day of the competition. "There's rugby, tennis, and now golf events – and every time I go, lots of people [are attending]."
  <br>
  <br>
  Many young fans came to support some of their favourite players.
  <br>
  <br>
  A local fan who was at last year's edition of the tournament, surnamed Nandwani, was at the event to see Australia's Cameron Smith in action.
  <br>
  <br>
  "People come in [from overseas] to watch this event. I think it's just a great thing to have... it's a great thing as a whole for the community to show up."

<img alt="Fireballs GC came out on top in the team standings. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795006_2_20250310070148.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Sergio Garcia of Spain on Sunday carded a seven-under 63 to take home the LIV Golf Hong Kong tournament crown in Fanling, as the 45-year-old claimed his second career individual title on the men's golf tour.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Spaniard kickstarted his bid for a maiden victory in the SAR with an impressive early eagle on the par-5 third hole, before recording four consecutive birdies on the 8th to 11th holes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 35-time international tournament winner added a fifth birdie on the 16th to seal the three-shot victory in a thrilling final round.
  <br>
  <br>
  "My goal at the beginning of the day was to shoot five under," Garcia said after his individual win. "It was solid. I played very well, I gave myself a lot of chances throughout the whole day."
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'll admit I had a couple of bad swings, but I managed to get away with them and recover nicely," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Garcia edged out Dean Burmester of South Africa and American Phil Mickelson, who finished 15-under-par and 14-under-par respectively, to round out the podium.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the festivities for Garcia didn't stop there.
  <br>
  <br>
  Team Fireballs GC, led by Garcia, came out on top of the Team event – securing a double for the Spaniard.
  <br>
  <br>
  The team finished one stroke ahead of Stinger GC, who carded a 37-under-par.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was nice to see that not only was I doing well in leading the tournament, but also that my teammates were playing great," Garcia said of his team, which includes last year's LIV Golf Hong Kong champion Abraham Ancer.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They were keeping us there with a chance to win. Obviously, when you can pull off a double, it's a lot sweeter than if it's just one of them – so I'm very proud of them."
  <br>
  <br>
  Both the sports minister, Rosanna Law, who attended the event, and LIV Golf say they strongly intend to make the tournament an annual showcase in Hong Kong. Law said the sides are close to an agreement, but they're still working out the details.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tournament in Hong Kong was the third stop of the LIV Golf 2025 season, before it heads to Singapore from March 14 to 16.

    'Reduce waste by allowing water bottles into venues'

<img alt="A number of spectators were seen with bottled water next to their seats during Sunday's World Snooker Grand Prix final at Kai Tak Arena. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1794990_1_20250309170511.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A rule banning spectators from bringing water bottles into competition venues at Kai Tak Sports Park should be relaxed to reduce waste, a green group said, after noticing exemptions were given to certain guests.
 <br>
  <br>
  Greenpeace campaigner Leanne Tam told RTHK on Sunday that during the World Snooker Grand Prix at Kai Tak Arena, a VIP ticket holder was seen using their own bottle, an otherwise prohibited item for the general audience.
  <br>
  <br>
  She added that other spectators from the VIP section were even handed bottled water, generating unnecessary waste.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I do think that their security problem is the most important issue. When the Kai Tak Sports Park keep [repeating] that you cannot bring your own bottle and water bottle is not safe enough, but you can see that in the venue, the event organiser will freely distribute the plastic water bottle [with a] cap," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think actually there's no so-called safety issue in that situation because in the whole event, I can feel that it's so safe. It doesn't become dangerous when the VIP have their water bottle in their seats."
  <br>
  <br>
  Tam suggested that if water bottles are indeed considered a safety risk, the park should immediately introduce a reusable cup regime.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If...the organiser really wants to keep their balance between the safety and user experience and also the environmental protection issue, we suggest that they should have a reusable cup service to all the guests in the venue," she urged.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You can freely use it to fill water in your own cup and it's safe because it's without a cap, and it's purchased by the venue so it's under the safety regulations."
  <br>
  <br>
  The environmental campaigner added that the idea had been implemented before, including the Rugby Sevens at Hong Kong Stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  Similar venues overseas also provide a reusable option for attendees, she noted, and Kai Tak Sports Park should be able to follow suit.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Seventeen large cruise ships will visit Hong Kong this month, according to Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism Rosanna Law.
 <br>
  <br>
  These include the newly built luxury cruises "Silver Nova" and "Queen Anne".
  <br>
  <br>
  This weekend, four cruise ships are visiting the SAR which the Hong Kong Tourism Board said will attract 5,400 tourists.
  <br>
  <br>
  Law said on social media that cruise guests will be arranged to join trips covering the Kai Tak Sports Park, among other locations.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said officials will utilise the Kai Tai Cruise Terminal and its surrounding infrastructure, as Hong Kong works towards developing its cruise-tourism sector.

    'Improve doctors' training at new medical school'

<img alt="Two patients' groups unveil findings of their survey on Hong Kong's third medical school. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1794994_1_20250309165758.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Two patients' groups on Sunday gave their thoughts on the city's future medical school, hoping it would improve training for doctors and minimise the risk of mishaps.
 <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong has announced plans to build a third medical school, and the University of Science and Technology, City University and Polytechnic University have expressed their interest.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two patients' groups conducted a survey of 537 people in the past month, involving chronically ill patients or the disabled, as well as caregivers.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to the Patients' Alliance On Healthcare Reform and the Alliance for Patients' Mutual Help Organizations, the respondents emphasised the importance of better training for doctors, especially on the use of Chinese medicine and on handling patients with special needs such as those with autism.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Patients' Alliance On Healthcare Reform said because of a lack of centralised training, patients with different levels of autism often need to go from doctor to doctor, which is time-consuming and inconvenient.
  <br>
  <br>
  The group also said in light of a recent spate of medical incidents, the new medical school should increase research on technology to help prevent blunders in future.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to the study, the new medical school should also be closely connected with international medical institutions and complement Hong Kong's two existing medical schools.
  <br>
  <br>
  Local universities interested in running the new medical school are to submit their proposals by March 17, and a member of the Patients' Alliance On Healthcare Reform, Theresa Chu, urged the universities to take their findings into consideration.
  <br>
  <br>
  'We hope that our information and our analysis would be given just in time to highlight what are the expectations of the patients' groups and also the general community, with regard to what they're going to deliver in the future.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Maybe they will reassess, or adjust, or modify their approach, and this will likely (allow them to rethink) to present a more comprehensive picture to the assessment board,' Chu said.

    'Non-recurrent social welfare spending can be reduced'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Labour and Welfare Chris Sun said there's room for non-recurrent social welfare expenditure to go down.
 <br>
  <br>
  In the budget last month, the government said all departments need to cut spending by an accumulative 7 percent until the 2027-28 fiscal year, and the same applies to funding for some 170 social welfare organisations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking after attending a TVB programme on Sunday, Sun said more flexible and creative use of non-recurrent funding could be part of the solution.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I don't see room for further adjustment in terms of recurrent spending," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But as you all know, there is non-recurrent spending, such as the HK$20 billion quota approved by the Legco Finance Committee earmarked for buying space," he told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Say, we can buy units on higher floors that could be cheaper, so that facilities for youth and family purposes can move up there and free up space on the lower floors for elderly or children services."
  <br>
  <br>
  Sun stressed that officials have been helping the social welfare sector by, for example, using more technology and streamlining procedures to cut down on administrative work, so organisations can focus on providing services.

    Fleet taxis do not have to charge by meter: govt

<img alt="" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1794966_1_20250309111958.jpg&q=70">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Commuters who reserve a ride from a licensed taxi fleet will have the option of negotiating a fare with the driver and not pay by the meter, according to the transport chief.
 <br>
  <br>
  Mable Chan added there will be oversight to ensure fleet operators keep their rates to a reasonable level, while authorities will roll out specific measures to help them pick up passengers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a Commercial Radio programme on Sunday, Chan explained that people who flag down a fleet taxi on the street only have to pay the normal rate. For an urban cab, that means a base fare of HK$29 plus the incremental charge.
  <br>
  <br>
  But when they book a ride online or over the phone, both sides are allowed to negotiate a fixed fare similar to a "charter" arrangement, she added. Alternatively, passengers can still opt for the meter rate, plus a booking fee.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked if the fixed fare can be set below the meter rate, Chan called for "caution", but it is ultimately a business decision by the operators. She also stressed that regulatory supervision will be in place to ensure that fares remain reasonable and are not set excessively high.
  <br>
  <br>
  Additionally, Chan noted that the Transport Department has earmarked 13 dedicated pick-up points for fleet taxis. Nine of these spots are ready, and they can mostly be found at boundary control points, as well as the airport, the high-speed rail station and the Kai Tak Cruise Terminal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Regarding service quality, the transport minister noted that passengers who are not happy with the service can rate their drivers on the online ride-hailing platform. Fleet managers are required to monitor such feedback.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Technology will also be used with in-vehicle monitoring systems checking whether drivers are driving safely and whether there are any service problems," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  She also said that taxi fleets are encouraged to devise strategies and find ways to serve different needs in the market, such as passengers with disabilities and those with luggage.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan said on Sunday that Hong Kong must closely link its development with that of the country's, as the SAR actively integrates into the nation's growth.
 <br>
  <br>
  Writing on his weekly blog, Chan said as all eyes are on the "Two Sessions" meetings in Beijing, the SAR also needs to expedite work in three areas to align with China's development.
  <br>
  <br>
  One is to speed up the technological drive and innovation for economic growth, and another is to unleash more local consumption potential by creating new experiences in spending.
  <br>
  <br>
  The third, the minister said, is for Hong Kong to deepen international cooperation and exchanges.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan noted that on the mainland, digital-economic industries have grown to around 10 percent of GDP, with expansion in new industries and businesses.
  <br>
  <br>
  "From AI models, online games, the use of robots to animation movies, there are constant breakthroughs on the mainland in terms of science, technology and cultural industries," he wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Many new creative startups were born out of nowhere, and this is inspiring."
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister said Hong Kong needs to integrate the spirit of the "Two Sessions" into its social-economic development, so as to contribute more to the nation's rejuvenation.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Each Legislative Council election should be better than the previous one, according to a senior Beijing official overseeing Hong Kong affairs, who also stressed the SAR needs “capable, responsible and accomplished” individuals to serve the city.
 <br>
  <br>
  Wang Linggui, deputy director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, said the city should add more talent not only in the political arena but also innovation and technology.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong is expected to hold its next polls for the legislature in December this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  “In the new stage of transitioning from stability to prosperity, Hong Kong needs people who are capable, responsible and accomplished, to seek the best for the general public of Hong Kong,” Wang told RTHK on Sunday on the sidelines of the “Two Sessions” in Beijing.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Each Legislative Council election should be better than the previous one. Just like the Olympic Games, there is never the best, only better. Being ‘good’ is a goal that should be constantly pursued.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang added that he believes Hong Kong authorities would consult different sectors, including local deputies to the National People’s Congress and the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference, on the upcoming polls.

 Hong Kong and Macau delegates to the country's top political advisory body said the two SARs should make good use of their advantages under the One Country, Two Systems principle.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a plenary meeting of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) on Sunday, Hong Kong delegate Tu Haiming said the One Country, Two Systems principle helps Hong Kong and Macau maintain their long-term prosperity and stability.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the first phase of its implementation has been completed, but some people still don't have a deep understanding about the principle.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Entering a new phase, the advantages of One Country, Two Systems should be realised through vitalisation and an increase in volume. We not only have to develop Hong Kong, contribute to the country and bring the country together, but also have to benefit the world,” Tu said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Through deepening the understanding of the One Country, Two Systems principle in the new phase, we have to further enhance the sense of responsibility and mission of Hong Kong society.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Macau CPPCC delegate Lao Nga-wong, meanwhile, said Macau is an example of the successful implementation of the One Country, Two Systems.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Macau should use its advantages in reinforcing connection with both the mainland and the world… and build the SAR into another international passage besides Hong Kong,” he said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The director of the central government's liaison office, Zheng Yanxiong, on Saturday said Hong Kong should take the “One Country, Two Systems” principle to a new level, and strive for better development.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to Hong Kong deputies to the National People’s Congress (NPC) in Beijing, Zheng said President Xi Jinping made the remarks when meeting Jiangsu deputies, asking them to promote scientific and technological innovation.
  <br>
  <br>
  The director said the remarks were also meaningful for Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Hong Kong must focus on reform and innovation and walk on the new path of developing new quality productive forces,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zheng said Hong Kong should consolidate and enhance its status as the so-called “three centres”, and as an international hub for tertiary education, and innovation and technology.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the SAR should safeguard national security, pursue economic growth and advance development, as pointed out by Vice Premier Ding Xuexiang.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zheng added that Hong Kong should fully leverage its advantages under the “One Country, Two Systems” principle, and speed up the process of advancing to prosperity.

 The chairwoman of Gree Electrics on Saturday said private enterprises need continuous innovation and technological investment to thrive.
 <br>
  <br>
  Dong Mingzhu, who's also a deputy to the National People's Congress (NPC), said the country has long supported private enterprises through various forms of assistance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters in Beijing, Dong said her company's trade-in policy helps consumers gain a better understanding of household appliances and improves safety awareness.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xiang Wenbo, NPC deputy and chairman of SANY Heavy Industry, which earlier announced plans to list in Hong Kong, said the timing is favourable given the current capital market conditions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xiang added that he believes listing in the SAR will speed up his company's international development.

 Hong Kong officials on Saturday said they will learn from the spirit of "Two Sessions" and stressed the importance of unity in advancing the SAR's development.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a Facebook post, Civil Service Secretary Ingrid Yeung said her team was inspired by the speech of Vice Premier Ding Xuexiang.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeung stressed the civil service's role in implementing One Country, Two Systems, highlighting the importance of using technology in government operations.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Health Bureau said the city is making use of its advantages under One Country, Two Systems to attract medical professionals and help Chinese medicine reach international markets.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, home and youth affairs chief Alice Mak said she will work with care teams and district councillors to promote the spirit of Two Sessions at grassroots level.
  <br>
  <br>
  On her Facebook page, cultural, sports and tourism minister Rosanna Law said Premier Li Qiang's work report has provided important direction for the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  Law outlined plans to implement the Blueprint for Arts and Culture and Creative Industries Development, enhance cultural exchanges and organise major sporting events, including the National Games in November.
  <br>
  <br>
  Development Secretary Bernadette Linn, for her part, said her bureau will continue to push forward the development of the Northern Metropolis and enhance cooperation with the Greater Bay Area.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Mainland authorities on Saturday said Hong Kong and the mainland should work together to tackle cross-border scams, after six more SAR residents were released from scam farms in Myanmar.
 <br>
  <br>
  The nation’s vice minister of public security Xu Ganlu said the joint operation of China and Thailand achieved success in rescuing victims from Myanmar.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We hope people trapped in scam farms can return to their families as soon as possible. The Chinese public security organs will work closely with foreign police to rescue more victims,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The chairman of the China International Development Cooperation Agency, Luo Zhaohui, said phone scams are outrageous, and Hong Kong should join hands with the mainland.
  <br>
  <br>
  “With our cooperation with relevant countries in Southeast Asia, and through diplomatic and public security efforts, we have seen progress in cooperation with Myanmar and Thailand,” he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It must be challenging to crack down on any kind of scams… Hong Kong is also facing this problem, so it is necessary for the SAR to work with the mainland.”

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Saturday said they have arrested six people for allegedly assaulting a 14-year-old girl in Mong Kok last August.
 <br>
  <br>
  The five women and a man, aged 15 to 22, were arrested on suspicion of assault occasioning actual bodily harm, after the teenage girl made a report to the police on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police said the girl was allegedly slapped and bullied by around 10 teenage boys and girls, at a rear staircase of a shopping mall in Mong Kok.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police said they had argued over “an attitude problem and trivial matters.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Police also believe that one of the attackers had filmed a video of the assault, but officers are investigating why the video was posted to the internet.
  <br>
  <br>
  The arrestees are being detained for further enquiries, and police said they have information about other alleged attackers. Some of the attackers allegedly have a triad background.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Deputy Secretary for Justice Horace Cheung on Saturday said the government will think about how to enforce the national security law better.
 <br>
  <br>
  His comment came after the Court of Final Appeal earlier overturned the convictions of three members of the now-disbanded Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements of China, for refusing to hand information over to the police in a national security investigation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a Commercial Radio programme, Cheung said the national security law is considered as a relatively new piece of legislation as this year marks the fifth anniversary of the implementation of the law in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said there was no precedent for law enforcement agencies to follow when carrying out the law.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Cheung said the government will take the court’s view into account and think about how to improve the enforcement of the law.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We’ll carefully study the judgement handed down by the Court of Final Appeal. We will see how the judgement can further improve the law enforcement mechanism of national security in Hong Kong,” Cheung said to reporters after attending the programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  “But I will say the judgement and the case law will contribute significantly to the development of jurisprudence of the national security law in Hong Kong,” he added.

 Chief Executive John Lee praised the contribution of women to society and pledged that the government is committed to promoting women's rights.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lee made the remarks on Saturday at a reception held at government headquarters, celebrating March 8 - the International Women's Day.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Yes, women are the backbone of our society.  They include leaders, innovators, caregivers, change-makers and more. From boardrooms to classrooms, from workspace to marketplace, the women of Hong Kong continue to break barriers and inspire future generations," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The government is dedicated to promoting gender equality and empowering women in every facet of life."
  <br>
  <br>
  The CE noted since taking over office, he had established the Women Empowerment Fund and organised the first Family and Women Development Summit in the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the government will work together with the Women's Commission to foster an inclusive, opportunity-filled Hong Kong for all women.

    New scheme aims to remove poorly managed buildings

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 There's hope that a new scheme can help eliminate poorly managed, so-called "three-nil buildings" - which are blocks that lack owners’ corporations, property management services, or resident organizations.
 <br>
  <br>
  Secretary for Home and Youth Affairs Alice Mak says the joint building management scheme will involve the same property management company handling aged building clusters in the area.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government will act as a middleman to link property owners with professionals from NGOs who can advise them on finding the right management company.
  <br>
  <br>
  It will commence a one-year test in Yau Tsim Mong, Sham Shui Po, Kowloon City, and Tsuen Wan later this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a Commercial Radio programme, Mak noted the project will help take care of aged buildings in the relevant areas.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Aside from the three-nil buildings, there are some aging, single-block buildings in old districts that only have 10 to 20 households. Even if they manage to form an owners' corporation, hiring a management company can be expensive as the cost can be too high for just a few units to share. So, in most cases they just choose not to set one up,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mak said the government has set aside HK$7 million for the project, with care teams and community NGOs helping to promote it.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister added that consultations have started in District Councils across the four districts and hoped that the project can commence by mid-year.

    'HK can't stop residential and industrial land sale'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Secretary for Development Bernadette Linn on Saturday said Hong Kong is not in a position to stop selling residential and industrial land.
 <br>
  <br>
  In this year’s budget, the government stated it wouldn't sell commercial sites in the coming year in light of the high office vacancy rate.
  <br>
  <br>
  Linn pushed back against opinions saying that all land sales should be put on hold.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Firstly, Hong Kong is eager to grow various industries. We want to make as much industrial land available for development as possible, so there’s no room to hold back. That goes against our strategy," she told an RTHK programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We also won’t stop selling residential land. We have a solid plan in place, with a 10-year projection for how much land we need for public and private housing. This plan has been in play for several years, and we allocate based on this estimate every year."
  <br>
  <br>
  The budget also proposed converting some commercial land into residential use, with locations including Hung Shui Kiu Ha Tsuen, Tung Chung, Shek Mun, and Kowloon East.
  <br>
  <br>
  Linn said the government will take various factors into consideration before making a decision.
  <br>
  <br>
  “If the area is not designated as a core business area, I think there's more room to include more residential elements in it. We’ll also look at the office vacancy rates. Additionally, are there newly built commercial buildings? If there are, it suggests the supply is sufficient, so we have room for adjustment,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  When asked if the government is considering installment payments to encourage developers to bid for land, the development minister said they have an open mind toward large-scale land deals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Linn pointed out that each pilot zone in the Northern Metropolis could involve HK$10 billion to HK$20 billion in investment, adding that the administration will seek opinions from developers in the market sentiment survey.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tending process for the three pilot zones, located in Hung Shui Kiu Ha Tsuen, Fanling North, and San Tin Technopole, will begin tendering work from second half of the year.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong Customs intensified enforcement at the international airport and uncovered multiple cases of illicit cigarette smuggling involving air passengers.
 <br>
  <br>
  On Thursday, Customs raided a suspected storage facility in Yuen Long, seizing approximately 6.7 million illicit cigarettes and 570,000 alternative smoked products, valued at an estimated HK$33 million, with a duty potential of HK$22 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the early hours of Friday, Customs arrested a 36-year-old man outside a hotel in Tin Shui Wai.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was found in possession of 90,000 illicit cigarettes and 110,000 alternative smoking products.
  <br>
  <br>
  Investigations revealed that the syndicate used air passengers to smuggle these items, which were stored in hotel rooms for further distribution.
  <br>
  <br>
  The man, who claimed to be unemployed, faces charges and will appear in Tuen Mun Magistrate's Courts on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Seized alternative smoking products will be handed over to the Department of Health for further action.
  <br>
  <br>
  Over the past two weeks, Customs intercepted 20 illicit cigarette smuggling cases at the airport, arresting 13 men and eight women.
  <br>
  <br>
  About 600,000 illicit cigarettes and 460,000 alternative smoking products were seized, with an estimated market value of HK$4 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  A follow-up operation at a Yuen Long logistics warehouse led to the arrest of a 44-year-old driver after the discovery of 6 million illicit cigarettes.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was released on bail pending further investigation.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Security minister Chris Tang said on Friday that six more Hongkongers trapped in scam farms in Myanmar have been rescued in a joint operation by the Security Bureau and authorities from the mainland, Thailand and Myanmar.
 <br>
  <br>
  Tang said the victims - three men and three women aged between 29 and 44 - had been held for five to seven months, after falling for job scams.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said Myanmar soldiers rescued them overnight and sent them to Thailand, adding that they are in good health.
  <br>
  <br>
  Five of the victims are scheduled to return to Hong Kong on Friday night, while the remaining person will stay in Thailand for at least one more day to assist with the ongoing probe.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was a rescue operation, so we did not pay any ransom," the minister told reporters at the airport after returning from Bangkok.
  <br>
  <br>
  "25 people, including these six, have returned, or will be returning to Hong Kong. The SAR government will spare no effort to rescue the remaining three people [trapped in Southeast Asia]."
  <br>
  <br>
  Tang was due to attend an event on Lantau on Thursday, but cancelled it at the last minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said he couldn't announce his trip because of the need to keep the rescue operation under wraps.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister also thanked Beijing officials from the Ministries of Public Security and Foreign Affairs, as well as authorities in Myanmar and Thailand for taking part in the mission.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Legal scholar and Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) member Albert Chen on Friday said the National Security Law can be amended, and that won't have retroactive effect.
 <br>
  <br>
  His comments came a day after the SAR's top court overturned the convictions of three former members of Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements in China for refusing to hand information to the police in a national security investigation.
  <br>
  <br>
  In response, the Hong Kong government said it will study the ruling, review how it enforces national security laws, and look for ways to improve them.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to RTHK in Beijing, Chen said the Court of Final Appeal's ruling is reasonable and aligns with common law principles.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked whether changes are needed, he said Hong Kong's Committee for Safeguarding National Security is in charge of making rules for the National Security Law.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Laws can be amended at any time. Of course, these amendments won't have retrospective effect. But after the amendment, the court will need to make rulings based on the newly amended laws," the University of Hong Kong professor said.
  <br>
  <br>
  This committee can decide to change the rules on its own without seeking approval from the National People's Congress, Chen added.

 Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) Standing Committee member Henry Tang on Friday said Hong Kong should leverage its advantages and further promote internationalisation.
 <br>
  <br>
  Vice Premier Ding Xuexiang held talks with Hong Kong and Macau CPPCC delegates on Thursday on the sidelines of the "Two Sessions" in Beijing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tang said one of the issues they discussed was the city's responsibility to promote internationalisation, it being one of the most international cities in China.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We understand and recognise our responsibilities in how to further the internationalisation of Hong Kong so that we will play to the Two Systems advantage under the One Country,” Tang said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “At the same time, we are able to facilitate and to forge relationships with overseas organisations and counterparts that otherwise will be helpful in promoting relationships in this very complex political environment today.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Tang, who is also the chairman of the board of the West Kowloon Cultural District Authority, said the cultural hub will continue to promote exchanges with different countries in the cultural sector.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said West Kowloon will help enhance the cultural soft power and allow Chinese culture to go global.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Vice Premier Ding Xuexiang has urged Hong Kong to act more firmly in safeguarding national security while recognising the city's effort in implementing Article 23 legislation, according to attendees at a meeting with the top official in Beijing on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Ding, who's also a Politburo Standing Committee member and heads the Central Leading Group on Hong Kong and Macau Affairs, held a closed-door meeting with local deputies to the National People’s Congress (NPC) on the sidelines of the "Two Sessions".
  <br>
  <br>
  During the 90-minute meeting, the vice premier was quoted as saying the SAR made “new progress and breakthroughs” in the past year, such as enacting its own national security law.
  <br>
  <br>
  Starry Lee, the city’s sole delegate to the NPC Standing Committee, said Ding attached great importance to what has been happening in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  Addressing the meeting, Lee said NPC deputies must “be pioneers and lead by example”, and that security is the prerequisite for development.
  <br>
  <br>
  “At present, Hong Kong’s long-term stability is hard-won and must be cherished even more," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “[As Hong Kong delegates], we must firmly safeguard national security and have the courage to say 'no' to all words and actions that violate the Constitution and the Basic Law.”
  <br>
  <br>
  NPC delegate Ma Fung-kwok told reporters after the meeting that Ding highlighted the passage of Article 23 legislation last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  “He mentioned that this is a very important achievement, in terms of legislation concerning national security,” Ma said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He didn’t elaborate much on those directions. He just restated that we had done a very good job.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Ding also noted the city’s economic recovery and its increased influence globally, Ma added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, Xia Baolong; the head of Beijing’s liaison office, Zheng Yanxiong; and Minister of Science and Technology, Yin Hejun, were also present at the meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ding met Hong Kong and Macau delegates of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference a day earlier.

    Good to improve NSL, Beijing official says

<div class="itemFullText">
 A Beijing official on Friday said that it'll be the right thing to do to keep improving the National Security Law.
 <br>
  <br>
  Sun Qingye, deputy head of the Office for Safeguarding National Security of the Central People's Government in the SAR, made the remarks on the sidelines of the "Two Sessions" in Beijing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking in a group interview, Sun, who is also a delegate to the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), said the SAR government has been implementing the National Security Law well over the past five years or so, but noted that it'll be good to keep improving the law.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If there are any issues or problems in our National Security Law, it should be revised, but this is a matter for the National People's Congress to decide," he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sun added that the city's domestic Article 23 laws helped to complement efforts to safeguard national security.
  <br>
  <br>
  He slammed certain Western nations for imposing sanctions on SAR officials and judges.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Whether it is from the United States or from other countries, it is unreasonable for them to sanction our judges. We have to support the judges to handle relevant national security cases well. [For those countries], they are wrong and should not impose sanctions. Why don't they sanction their own judges?" he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sun also rejected calls to pardon Jimmy Lai, founder of the now-defunct Apple Daily newspaper who's on trial for alleged national security offences.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This should be handled in accordance with the law. Why should special pardons be granted? What are the reasons to grant a special pardon?
  <br>
  <br>
  "He's not the son of a certain president, so that the president can pardon him."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Beijing official also said it's important to enhance national security education at local schools, to help raise awareness among youngsters.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Kai Tak Sports Park will promote sports development and exchanges between Hong Kong and the mainland, according to senior Chinese sports officials attending the "Two Sessions" in Beijing.
 <br>
  <br>
  Zhou Jinqiang, vice president of the Chinese Olympic Committee and a member of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), said athletes from the national team who attended the sports park's opening last week were very impressed with the new facility.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If possible, of course we hope to organise some international events and sports exchange activities between Hong Kong and the mainland at the sports park," Zhou told RTHK on the sidelines of the "Two Sessions".
  <br>
  <br>
  Zhou also said preparations for the National Games are going well, adding that it will be an important milestone in China's development as a leading sports nation.
  <br>
  <br>
  This year's National Games will be co-hosted by Guangdong, Macau and Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liu Guoliang, president of the Chinese Table Tennis Association and also a CPPCC member, highlighted Hong Kong's strong performance in table tennis over the past year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liu, who also chairs the World Table Tennis (WTT) Board, said the SAR may play host to the WTT finals this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm really looking forward to having table tennis competitions at this new sports venue and have been following its development closely. Hong Kong's table tennis development has been excellent with widespread participation. This year's WTT finals may also be held in Hong Kong," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liu also expressed confidence that the National Games will lead to major breakthroughs in sports and tourism in the Greater Bay Area.

    Smart traffic control system to be tested in Kwun Tong

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Friday said they hope traffic congestion in Kwun Tong would be eased following the implementation of a new smart traffic management system in the area.
 <br>
  <br>
  The system, to be launched later this year, was co-developed with the University of Science and Technology’s Great Smart Cities Institute.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police said they received funding of HK$6.8 million from the Innovation, Technology and Industry Bureau to develop the system.
  <br>
  <br>
  It includes installing 11 sets of CCTV cameras across nine streets in Kwun Tong's business area.
  <br>
  <br>
  Traffic data will be collected round the clock, analysed real-time through AI and shared by the police and the Transport Department.
  <br>
  <br>
  For example, the system can show vehicle flow on different days and in different periods, as well as give suggestions on traffic lights control.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a press briefing, police chief inspector Terrence Yu said the collected data would not be used for enforcement and would be deleted after 28 days.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Our idea was to use technology to better understand the traffic flow in the business area to provide us with the most appropriate arrangement. We won’t carry out enforcement based on the system, but we will make arrangements in areas like deployment of manpower based on the situation, and ask our colleagues to take appropriate traffic control measures,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yu said the force does not have specific performance indicators and would review the system in future before considering whether to expand it to other areas.

    'Govt should seek new revenue streams amid deficit'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Former transport secretary Frank Chan says it is appropriate for the government to find new sources of income under a fiscal deficit, but it should carefully assess the impact of any new policies.
 <br>
  <br>
  Financial Secretary Paul Chan announced in his budget last month a proposed HK$200 levy on private cars every time they leave Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on the sidelines of the "Two Sessions" in Beijing, Chan - a Hong Kong deputy to the National People’s Congress (NPC) - said it was inevitable that new policies would have consequences.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he believed the authorities had done analysis on the possible impact.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I would expect the officers to come up with some kind of information and impact analysis so as to convince the public whether or not they should and how much it is to be raised," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Because at the time there's a financial deficit incurring in Hong Kong, then there must be a way that we need to balance it out.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Another NPC deputy Nicholas Chan said the government should also look into ways to help those being affected by policy changes.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We would have to probably take a more holistic approach about how we help people who might suffer from this, and if this is - overall - good for the economy, how do we lessen the hurt on those who are going to feel aggrieved by such a move,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government also announced plans to adjust the city’s subsidised public transport fares for the elderly, including setting a cap on the number of subsidised trips per month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Frank Chan said the subsidised transport fare was a welfare policy, instead of a transport policy, and that it is a responsible act of the government to review it based on the actual situation.

 Authorities insist there is still keen demand for housing, citing a low vacancy rate for private flats, in response to a market report suggesting the city's home market is on the decline due to a supply glut.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a statement on Thursday, an SAR government spokesman added delinquent residential mortgages remained at an extremely low level, and that banks are mitigating their credit risks.
  <br>
  <br>
  The comments were in response to an S&P report on Hong Kong's banks and property market.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We disagree with the observation that there is an oversupply of residential properties," the spokesman said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As of the end of last year, the vacancy rate for private homes stood at 4.5 percent, in line with the average between 2004 and 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Rents also keep going up, reflecting keen housing demand."
  <br>
  <br>
  As for delinquent residential mortgages, only 0.12 percent of all loans drawn were overdue as of end-January.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Under the Monetary Authority's counter-cyclical measures, the city's average residential mortgage rate remained solid at 60 percent, while the debt-servicing ratio, at 40 percent, was also low," the statement read.
  <br>
  <br>
  The spokesman added it agreed with the report's view that Hong Kong's banking sector can withstand "strains arising from the commercial real estate" sector, saying loans are diversified and institutions have taken measures to mitigate risks.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Net profit at the MTR Corporation more than doubled last year, thanks largely to strong gains in local property development.
 <br>
  <br>
  The railway firm posted a full-year profit of HK$15.77 billion, up from HK$7.78 billion in 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  Total revenue rose 5.3 percent to HK$60 billion, compared with HK$56 billion the year before.
  <br>
  <br>
  Local property development fared especially well, with net profit up nearly four times to HK$10.26 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  The gains were mainly due to earnings from sites at LOHAS Park, Ho Man Tin Station and The Southside in Wong Chuk Hang, the MTR said.
  <br>
  <br>
  It added it is considering possible tenders of Package 2 of Tung Chung East Station and Tuen Mun A16 Station Package 1 in the coming 12 months, but noted that any decisions will depend on market conditions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Losses in its mainland property business, meanwhile, narrowed to HK$3 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  The company also said patronage continued to recover, with passenger numbers of its domestic operations reaching 1.95 billion in 2024, close to pre-pandemic levels.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ridership rose for the high-speed rail link as well, with more than 26.7 million journeys recorded.
  <br>
  <br>
  Commenting on the MTR's annual results, Jacob Kam, the group's chief executive officer, noted that last year's performance was boosted by the notable recovery in property development under the "Rail plus Property" business model.
  <br>
  <br>
  "While the company’s operating results were satisfactory during the year under review, it is important to reiterate that much of these profits will be committed to the substantial funding required for the upgrading and renewal of existing lines as well as planning and constructing new railway projects," he said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We also must keep adapting to the new realities of consumer behaviour in the post-pandemic era, particularly the established trends of Hong Kong people travelling north for weekends and holidays and mainland Chinese tourists spending less time in local retail outlets."
  <br>
  <br>
  The company declared a final dividend of HK$0.89 per share, raising the full-year total to HK$1.31.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The ICAC on Thursday charged four people on suspicion of fixing matches in the Hong Kong football league.
 <br>
  <br>
  Three of the suspects were linked to Fu Moon Athletic Association, which currently plays in the Second Division, below the Premier League and First Division.
  <br>
  <br>
  They included 30-year-old defender Lo Hong-ming, who's also the owner and the coach, as well as 32-year-old midfielder So Chun-yin.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong Him-chun, a former Fu Moon player, was the alleged betting agent, while Yao Xiaocong was the alleged bookmaker.
  <br>
  <br>
  They are due to appear in Eastern Court on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The anti-graft body alleged that 11 league and cup matches between the 2021-22 season were manipulated.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lo was accused of receiving HK$60,000 in bribes, while the three others allegedly offered HK$240,000 to other players in exchange for their cooperation on the pitch.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ICAC said investigations were ongoing and warned of more arrests in the future.

    Top court upholds sedition convictions of Tam Tak-chi

<img alt="Court of Final Appeal judges dismissed arguments from Tam Tak-chi's lawyers and upheld his sedition convictions. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1794531_1_20250306130910.jpg&q=40">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's top court on Thursday upheld the sedition convictions of former activist Tam Tak-chi over a string of incitement incidents in public in 2020.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Court of Final Appeal also maintained the former vice chairman of People Power's jail sentence of three years and four months for sedition and public order-related offences.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tam's lawyers argued that the case should have been tried by a High Court jury, not the District Court.
  <br>
  <br>
  They also said the prosecutors should be required to prove the appellant had the intention to incite others to engage in violence or create a public disorder.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the top court judges dismissed both arguments.
  <br>
  <br>
  They said it was valid for a magistrate to transfer the case to the District Court.
  <br>
  <br>
  The judges also ruled that clauses of the old sedition laws didn't require proof of the intention to incite as an element of the offence.
  <br>
  <br>
  They noted the crimes listed all came with an "or" rather than an "and", dismissing the lawyers' reliance on a clause that states it is only an offence when a person counsels "disobedience to law or to any lawful order".
  <br>
  <br>
  "[The clause] constitutes only one of the various alternative forms of seditious intention each of which is capable of constituting the offence," the judges wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tam was prosecuted and jailed under the decades-old sedition laws, before the enactment of the local national security legislation under Basic Law Article 23.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Vice Premier Ding Xuexiang has urged Hong Kong to make good use of its advantages and to continue to safeguard national security, according to SAR delegates of the nation’s top political advisory body.
 <br>
  <br>
  Ding on Thursday held talks with Hong Kong and Macau delegates of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) on the sidelines of the ongoing "Two Sessions" in Beijing.
  <br>
  <br>
  The vice premier, who's also a Politburo Standing Committee member, urged Hong Kong to be confident and capitalise on its strengths.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Hong Kong has a unique position of enjoying strong support of the country and being connected to the world,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Delegates from the SAR said after the 90-minute meeting that national security was one of the topics of discussion.
  <br>
  <br>
  CPPCC member Ko Wing-man said the vice premier praised Hong Kong for completing Article 23 legislation of the Basic Law last year, while stressing that the city should not lower its guard.
  <br>
  <br>
  “There are still many internal and external forces which want to mess around, in terms of national security or the One Country, Two Systems,” Ko quoted Ding as saying.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Therefore, we have to be highly vigilant, and achieve a good balance between development and safeguarding security.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Another focus of the meeting was the trade and technology wars between China and the United States, according to CPPCC delegate and lawmaker William Wong.
  <br>
  <br>
  “He (Ding) said that the situation will not slow down. It will continue to be a bit stiff. But we should be confident in ourselves and Hong Kong should work together with the central government to advance technology and to go international,” Wong said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another CPPCC delegate, Pansy Ho, said the vice premier highly recognised Hong Kong’s efforts in boosting the economy, saying it was stable and showed improvement in the past year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho also said Ding urged Hong Kong to work closely with nearby cities, such as those in the Greater Bay Area.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Because of the close proximity and also now, the possibility of us really capitalising on the various components that each of these cities possesses, we can create a much stronger base for development,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We do not have to see Hong Kong as a standalone. We need to work on how we utilise best to our advantage, how to collaborate with cities around us.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, Xia Baolong, and CPPCC vice-chairman and former Hong Kong chief executive CY Leung were also present at the meeting.

    'More transparent private healthcare charges needed'

<img alt="The Consumer Council says many private hospitals and clinics did not provide sufficient price information, resulting in a flood of complaints.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The city's consumer watchdog on Thursday called on various private healthcare service providers, including hospitals and clinics, to be more transparent when they disclose their fees, given complaints over unexpectedly higher medical costs.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Consumer Council said it received 191 complaints between 2021 and 2024, which were related to private medical care services, involving some HK$7.2 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  About half of those complaints were due to disputes over fees and charges.
  <br>
  <br>
  The council blamed the disputes partially on the lack of sufficient disclosures of fees by those private health care premises, adding a council study found that nearly 70 percent of patients surveyed encountered "price variations" when examining their bills.
  <br>
  <br>
  The final costs, in some cases, were HK$60,000 to HK$70,000 higher compared with the initial budget estimation.
  <br>
  <br>
  But about 65 percent of respondents did not get any explanation regarding the price difference, and about 39 percent reported receiving only verbal budget estimates without any written or detailed breakdowns of the chargeable items.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, the council pointed out the dramatically varied prices among the private premises also made it difficult for people to compare medical costs for the same treatment.
  <br>
  <br>
  To tackle the issue, the watchdog urged private medical providers to disclose their price list online, and roll out more packaged treatment services with clear and detailed written prices for consumers to choose and compare.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong’s top court on Thursday overturned the convictions of three people for refusing to hand information to the police in a national security investigation.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Court of Final Appeal unanimously ruled the trio, who were members of the now-disbanded Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements in China, did not have a fair trial.
  <br>
  <br>
  Implementation rules under the national security law require suspects deemed to be "foreign agents" to hand over information to police.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chow Hang-tung, Tang Ngok-kwan and Tsui Hon-kwong were jailed in 2023 for four-and-a-half months each for refusing such a request about their former organisation.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the top court found the evidence used by prosecutors to establish that the group was acting as a "foreign agent" was so heavily redacted that it was "self-defeating".
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was self-defeating to have redacted out the only material relied on for establishing the foreign agent element of the offence, so that, in its absence, the charge could not be proved," the judges, led by Chief Justice Andrew Cheung, wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[D]epriving the appellants of all knowledge of the nature of the prosecution’s case... made it impossible for them to have a fair trial."
  <br>
  <br>
  The court therefore quashed the three's convictions and jail sentences.
  <br>
  <br>
  A separate security trial of inciting subversion involving Chow and two former Alliance leaders is still pending.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Premier Li Qiang’s work report has offered “important guidance” on implementing the One Country, Two Systems policy, Chief Executive John Lee said on Thursday, as he pledged to further align Hong Kong with national development strategies.
 <br>
  <br>
  Addressing delegates at the Great Hall of the People on Wednesday, the premier said Beijing will continue to fully implement One Country, Two Systems and ensure Hong Kong and Macau are administered by patriots.
  <br>
  <br>
  Li also mentioned the central government’s backing to the two SARs on growing their economies, improving people’s livelihoods and deepening international exchanges.
  <br>
  <br>
  On social media, the chief executive said the government work report not only set out the country’s economic targets and policies, but also gave important direction for the practice of One Country, Two Systems.
  <br>
  <br>
  Reflecting on the premier’s message, Lee said his administration is heading in the right direction with its policies.
  <br>
  <br>
  “By following this correct policy direction and proactively aligning with the nation’s development strategies, Hong Kong’s development will have a bright future,” he wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We must better leverage the advantages of the One Country, Two Systems principle and break new ground.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The SAR will further deepen international exchanges and strengthen its role as a connector, Lee added.
  <br>
  <br>
  “On top of consolidating trade ties with traditional markets such as Europe and the United States, we will also work hard to explore new markets including the Middle East, Asean countries and Central Asia, while actively striving to join the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership,” he wrote.

 Hong Kong and Macau have the full backing of the central government in integrating into the country’s development, a senior Beijing official said on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Xia Baolong, director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, met Chief Executive John Lee, who attended the opening of the National People’s Congress (NPC) in the capital.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to a statement, Xia praised the SAR administration’s performance in recognising and responding to changes, fully promoting high-quality development, and uniting the entire society to focus on the city’s economy and development.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The central government has always adhered to the comprehensive and accurate implementation of the ‘One Country, Two Systems’ principle, and fully backed the integration of Hong Kong and Macau into the overall development of the country,” the statement read.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xia was also quoted as saying that he hopes Hong Kong would work to consolidate the city’s status as an international financial, shipping and trade centre, and to become a place for high-performing individuals to gather.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a government statement, the Chief Executive vowed to lead all sectors of the SAR to proactively integrate into national development, and contribute to the Greater Bay Area and the Belt and Road Initiative.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, the head of Beijing’s liaison office in the SAR urged local NPC deputies to “shoulder the historic mission and responsibility of promoting Hong Kong’s transition from stability to prosperity”.
  <br>
  <br>
  During a meeting, liaison office chief Zheng Yanxiong pointed out that the delegates should take up four roles to further bolster the territory’s development – athletes, active players, doers, and leaders.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zheng also highlighted the importance of tapping into the city’s advantages, introducing reforms, supporting the country’s high-quality development, connecting with the mainland and the world, as well as preventing risks.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Zheng emphasised that over the past few years, Hong Kong has made a number of major accomplishments, and has been widely recognised by the international community,” his office's statement read.
  <br>
  <br>
  “This year marks the end of the 14th Five-Year Plan, which is a key year for Hong Kong to accelerate its transition from stability to prosperity.”

<div class="itemFullText">
 A vibrant festival celebrating Indian culture through dance, music and cuisine, is set to brighten up the streets of Lan Kwai Fong later this month.
 <br>
  <br>
  The inaugural "Incredible India Festival", organised by the Consulate General of India in Hong Kong and the Lan Kwai Fong Association, will take place on March 15 and 16.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We hope that this will bring Indian art and culture to an accessible space for all Hongkongers, as well as tourists and foster an appreciation and better understanding of India's rich cultural heritage that goes back millenia, making it truly 'Incredible India'," said Satwant Khanalia, the consul general of India in Hong Kong and Macau.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jonathan Zeman, CEO of the Lan Kwai Fong Group, said he’s looking forward to creating a fully immersive experience for visitors.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the streets will be filled with "lots of great food, music performances, dance performances, and different workshops".
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong has a really rich history of Indian community going back at least 150 to 200 years almost, and that community still exists here, and it's important to build a bridge with the existing Indian culture over in India. It brings a lot of new elements to Hong Kong and a lot of richness to the mosaic that we have here," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two-day festival will be open to the public for free, and Zeman said he expects around 15,000 people to turn up.

    Air passenger departure tax to go up from Oct 1

<img alt="The air passenger departure tax will be increased from HK$120 to HK$200 on October 1. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1794422_1_20250306110817.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Travellers purchasing a plane ticket to fly out of Hong Kong from October 1 will have to pay HK$200 in air passenger departure tax (APDT) instead of the current HK$120, the government announced on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The tax increase was announced by Financial Secretary Paul Chan when he delivered his budget blueprint last month. The measure is expected to boost government revenue by about HK$1.6 billion each year.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, officials say some passengers will continue to be exempted from the tax.
  <br>
  <br>
  They include passengers under the age of 12, direct transit passengers, those taking connecting flights, as well as passengers who arrive at and depart Hong Kong by plane on the same day.
  <br>
  <br>
  Passengers who get to the Hong Kong International Airport by ship, or by vehicle via the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge, will also be waived, provided that they remain in the restricted area at all times.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The APDT was last increased more than 20 years ago in 2003-04. The proposed increase constitutes only a very small portion of the overall travelling cost for the general public and travellers to Hong Kong. The impact on air passengers is expected to be minimal,” a government spokesman said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Air Passenger Departure Tax (Amendment) Bill will be gazetted on Friday, and it will be tabled at the Legislative Council for first reading and the commencement of the second reading debate on March 19.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) member Andy Tsang on Wednesday slammed the US move to slap additional tariffs on Chinese exports because of the fentanyl crisis.
 <br>
  <br>
  Tsang, deputy director of the National Narcotics Control Commission and a former Hong Kong police commissioner, made the comments in Beijing on the sidelines of the "Two Sessions" after US President Donald Trump imposed an additional 10 percent tariff on China, citing a lack of progress on tackling fentanyl.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tsang said Beijing will study countermeasures and the move should not affect anti-drug cooperation.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that he believes China is one of the world's best performers in drug-control efforts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Former health minister and CPPCC delegate Ko Wing-man, meanwhile, said the setting up of Hong Kong's third medical school aims to strengthen medical education and research capabilities, not just addressing doctor shortages.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, another CPPCC member and former Bar Association chairwoman Winnie Tam said she hopes the Greater Bay Area will recognise Hong Kong's potential to help train professionals in foreign-related legal matters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tam, who chairs the Communications Authority, also said her team will continue to improve anti-fraud measures and work more closely with different platforms.

 Hong Kong and Macau will always have the central government's backing in terms of developing the economy and improving people's livelihood, a senior official in charge of the SARs' affairs pledged on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Wang Linggui, deputy director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, made the comments on the sidelines of the Two Sessions in Beijing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked by RTHK if more support measures were in store for Hong Kong, Wang pointed to the city's booming stock market.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said if investors were confident about Hong Kong, then the stock market would do well.
  <br>
  <br>
  On a separate note, Hongkongers were told by a former Beijing official to cherish their city and build it into a better place.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tan Tieniu, who was deputy director of Beijing's liaison office between 2016 and 2022, said Hong Kong had special meaning for him.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the city is a "very good" place and has a key role to play in the country's overall development, and urged everyone to "steadfastly and successfully" implement "One Country, Two Systems".

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Andy Kwok, the captain of the Hong Kong Golf Club, on Wednesday said he expects a lot more spectators at the second edition of LIV Golf Hong Kong event in Fanling.
 <br>
  <br>
  The tournament will be the third event of the League's 2025 season, taking place from March 7 to 9 at the Hong Kong Golf Club.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kwok said he is looking forward to seeing people from Hong Kong and the Greater Bay Area at the event.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think it's great that we're now bringing mega sporting event organisers coming to Hong Kong to host mega sports events. I think it's great for Hong Kong, great for our people, great for the economy and as the club, being a golf club, obviously we want to bring the best golf events of the world to Hong Kong," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We were quite successful in hosting the first edition of the LIV Golf Hong Kong last year, and we're looking forward to an even more successful LIV Golf Hong Kong event this year, and hopefully we will try our best to continue to bring world-class events, and hopefully LIV can come back continuously in the future. We will try very hard to facilitate that."
  <br>
  <br>
  Scott O'Neil, CEO of LIV Golf, said the tour plans to have a major presence in all the markets that matter in Asia.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In terms of Asia, it's no secret golf is booming here. I believe we're up about 30 percent year over year in terms of participants playing golf, and it's no surprise that this is a place where we feel like home," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We'll obviously be in Hong Kong and Singapore and Korea, and those are three markets that we're very passionate about."

    Hospital patient chokes to death after meal blunder

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Caritas Medical Centre on Wednesday said it is investigating what led to an elderly patient choking to death after he was given a regular meal despite not being able to eat solid food.
 <br>
  <br>
  The man, 75, who had a history of cognitive impairment and high blood pressure, was admitted at the end of last month suffering from abdominal bloating and constipation.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was taken off food and given intravenous fluids instead, but after his condition improved doctors decided he could go back to his usual diet of pureed food, officials said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "By March 3, his condition continued to improve, and the medical team determined that this patient could return to eating his usual food, so it was recorded in his medical records as 'DAT', which stands for 'diet as tolerated'," the hospital's chief executive, Gladys Kwan, told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We believe that the nurse and doctor responsible had a communication issue, as the nurse mistakenly thought the instruction meant he could have a normal meal."
  <br>
  <br>
  Kwan said a student nurse was instructed to feed and monitor the man after each bite. Although the patient initially managed to swallow and chew, he soon began to cough, prompting the student to alert the medical team.
  <br>
  <br>
  The man was declared dead after resuscitation efforts, the hospital said.
  <br>
  <br>
  It added that it has apologised to the man's family.
  <br>
  <br>
  Raymond Cheung, chief manager for patient safety and risk management at the Hospital Authority, said a committee has been established to investigate the incident and to implement improvement measures within eight weeks.

    'Govt will support NGOs amid funding cuts'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Labour and welfare minister Chris Sun on Wednesday said the government would help NGOs save costs by streamlining administrative procedures amid funding cuts due to the fiscal deficit.
 <br>
  <br>
  Sun said the government would help shoulder a four percent reduction for 121 small-and-medium sized NGOs, meaning they would only face a three percent funding cut by the 2027-28 financial year.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, for the 58 large NGOs receiving over HK$50 million in government funding annually, Sun said they would have to bear the seven percent cuts on their own.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking after an RTHK radio programme on Wednesday, Sun said the government would give larger NGOs more time to hold onto their financial reserves, so they could make better use of their resources through these “difficult years”.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also said the government would give these NGOs more flexibility, and help them save costs by streamlining procedures such as reporting on how they used their funds.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I'm pretty confident after the meeting on Monday that we are more or less on the same page, so we are working together while we're facing a budget cut," Sun said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But at the same time, because of the more flexible use of reserves and also the efforts we are making to provide more room for them to make better use of their resources, we should be able to deal with it together,” he added.

 Fans at Kai Tak for the World Snooker Grand Prix will now be allowed to stay until the last game is finished, the government says, after spectators were ejected from the venue while a match was still underway on Tuesday night.
 <br>
  <br>
  About 100 people were watching Kyren Wilson play Matthew Selt in Kai Tak Arena when at around 11.15pm, with the match going into the fifth frame, the crowd were told to leave.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sports Secretary Rosanna Law said on Wednesday that organisers were worried about the availability of public transport if the spectators stayed any longer.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This situation is obviously not ideal, and we definitely need to take into account the experience seriously and identify remedial measures," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Law described the saga as "teething problems" and said it won't happen again.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Starting from tonight, all spectators will be allowed to view the entire series of matches until the last game is done. So, there will be no more question of spectators having to leave before the game ends," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Organisers said those affected can get complimentary tickets for another session of the tournament.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Some spectators were required to leave early before the match concluded and were unable to watch the full game. The tournament organising committee sincerely apologises for this situation," a statement said.

 Hong Kong's deputies to the National People's Congress (NPC) and the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) have given their backing to the country's economic growth target of around five percent target this year, saying it was no easy feat but achievable.
 <br>
  <br>
  HSBC chairman Peter Wong, who's a CPPCC delegate, was fully confident the country could meet the target.
  <br>
  <br>
  He recalled the many economic stimulus measures rolled out by the central government last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We think that hitting the five percent growth target last year was no easy feat, given the geopolitical situation and the world economy. But we worked hard to achieve this goal, and it wasn't easy," he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For 2025, I feel the country is well-planned to meet its goal."
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong's sentiment was shared by Jonathan Choi, who chairs the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  The businessman, who is also a CPPCC Standing Committee member, noted Beijing's support measures benefit companies big and small, across different sectors.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I just feel that we can achieve it, because at the moment, the Chinese government spent a lot of attention [on] local enterprises, not only the [state-owned enterprises] ... AI and also technology, new (sectors are) coming up," he commented.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, NPC deputy Nicholas Chan described the five percent growth target as a bold one, considering the scale of China's economy - the second-largest in the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For such a big economy, five percent in GDP is huge. Five percent is basically the entire economy of Switzerland. With such a big pie, just a small growth is humongous," he explained.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So this will lead to a lot of opportunities for people all over the world, for people along the Belt and Road, Brics (countries), and Rcep (Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership), so lots of opportunities for our friends together."
