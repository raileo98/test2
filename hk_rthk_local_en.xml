<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Wednesday delivered his 2025-26 budget to the Legislative Council.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chan started the speech for his financial blueprint – which aims to tackle an estimated HK$100 billion deficit – by saying that Hong Kong needs to reform, innovate and relentlessly improve.
  <br>
  <br>
  He pointed out that though counter-cyclical measures launched in the past few years to counter the pandemic have stabilised the economy and eased people’s burden, it has resulted in a fiscal deficit.
  <br>
  <br>
  “In this budget, I propose a reinforced version of the fiscal consolidation programme, including a cumulative reduction of government recurring expenditure by seven percent from now through 2027-28," he told lawmakers at Legco.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Strictly containing public expenditure is a must, but we should proceed in a steady and prudent manner, and be careful to find a balance among the various impacts that may arise in the process.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The finance minister also said there will be an all-out effort to minimise impact on public services and people’s livelihood, adding that “it gives us a clear pathway towards the goal of restoring fiscal balance”.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the SAR's economic growth, Chan said authorities forecast that Hong Kong's gross domestic product will continue to grow moderately this year, rising two to three percent in real terms for the year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The economy grew by 2.5 percent in 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also forecast that the economy will grow, on average, by 2.9 percent a year in real terms from 2026 to 2029, with underlying inflation expected to be at an average of 2.5 percent a year.

    FS mulls ways to cut spending, boost revenue in budget

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 With the government facing a budget shortfall of almost HK$100 billion, all eyes will be on how the financial secretary plans to cut spending and increase revenue when he delivers his budget speech on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Paul Chan is expected to address civil service pay and announce possible reductions in expenditure in some areas.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some people see freezing or even reducing civil service pay as a way to help rein in the deficit and achieve fiscal stability.
  <br>
  <br>
  But others argued that such a move could have a knock-on effect for the wider workforce, as many private firms refer to government salaries in making their own wage decisions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lawmaker Ronick Chan, representing the finance constituency, has said freezing or cutting civil service pay would affect millions of workers in the city, and may cause changes in people's consumption patterns, leading to a vicious cycle.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials may also try to save money by cutting spending in other areas, with the financial secretary having cited healthcare and education earlier.
  <br>
  <br>
  Health minister Lo Chung-mau has said putting public resources to good use is everyone's responsibility. "Nobody should be wasteful... It should be everyone in Hong Kong, and all government departments... We hope our patients make good use of healthcare resources and don't waste medicine. Like they take extra and just keep them at home, or even throw them away."
  <br>
  <br>
  The chairman of the Hospital Authority, Henry Fan, said the authority will fully cooperate with government policies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Paul Chan stressed the government will propose an enhanced fiscal-consolidation strategy to control public expenditure stringently, while using other public resources to speed up the city's development.
  <br>
  <br>
  On ways to boost revenue, he has highlighted the user-pays principle, meaning those who can afford to should pay more and at the same time minimising the impact to the average people.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Taxation Institute said the government could consider raising the standard salaries tax rate for high-income earners from 16 percent to 17 percent, to help boost the public coffers.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the financial secretary has also said the administration will have to tread carefully when considering tax reforms, and many factors have to be taken into consideration.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A man on Tuesday was sentenced to 14 months in prison for trafficking in a dangerous drug last year.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 24-year-old man was arrested in November as he was leaving Hong Kong from the Lok Ma Chau Spur Line Control Point.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officers seized about 0.3 grammes of cocaine under the insole of his sneaker.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was sentenced at the Fanling Magistrates' Courts in contravention of the Dangerous Drugs Ordinance.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Customs and Excise Department welcomed the deterrent sentence, saying it duly reflected the gravity of the offence.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under the law, the maximum penalty for dangerous drug trafficking upon conviction is a fine of HK$5 million and life imprisonment.

    Three arrested 'for claiming to sell Kai Tak tickets'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police have arrested three people for allegedly claiming they had spare tickets on sale for the opening ceremony of the Kai Tak Sports Park on Saturday, with tickets reportedly being offered at marked up prices.
 <br>
  <br>
  A total of 8,500 tickets for the opening ceremony on March 1 were available at HK$10 each and were snapped up within around half an hour of being available on February 21.
  <br>
  <br>
  As many as 33,600 spectators are expected to attend the star-studded event.
  <br>
  <br>
  Those who successfully made a purchase online via a real-name registration system will first receive electronic vouchers to exchange for the real tickets at a later date.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a press conference on Tuesday, police officers accused the trio of jacking up the prices and intending to sell the tickets online at a range between HK$100 and HK$2,000 each.
  <br>
  <br>
  Preliminary investigations showed two of the suspects did not hold the vouchers and the force has yet to ascertain whether the coupon held by the remaining person was authentic.
  <br>
  <br>
  The force added it has not ruled out making further arrests.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sports commissioner George Tsoi said successful buyers can only get the actual tickets from Thursday, two days before the opening ceremony.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When the exchange takes place, we will check the voucher holder's identity. If the identity does not match, no tickets will be issued, and the person will not be able to enter the venue," he said.

 The Cross-Harbour Tunnel was forced to shut partially for more than an hour on Tuesday after a piece of concrete fell from the ceiling and hit a vehicle.
 <br>
  <br>
  Police said they received a report shortly after 1pm of a car travelling through the tunnel being hit by a concrete slab that measured about 50cm by 50cm.
  <br>
  <br>
  No one was hurt in the incident.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong Island-bound fast lane was closed for emergency repair works, leading to congestion. It was reopened to traffic at 2.48pm.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong Disneyland on Tuesday said it enjoyed its strongest ever business performance in the last fiscal year, with a record net profit of more than HK$830 million and highest ever attendance figure of 7.7 million.
 <br>
  <br>
  The theme park said its revenue grew by more than 50 percent year-on-year to HK$8.8 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Managing director Michael Moriarty said the park will be celebrating its 20th anniversary from June onwards.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Hong Kong Disneyland's 20th anniversary is going to be one of the top mega events for the town to rally around. We're working with other partners as well who are just as excited,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I think with our combined effort, this can be a major draw for Hong Kong arrivals, giving reasons for people to come back, not to just to Hong Kong Disneyland, but to Hong Kong.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Moriarty said the celebrations will include the park's largest ever parade called “Friendtastic!”, and a special edition of the night show “Momentous”.
  <br>
  <br>
  The park will also expand its Marvel-themed section and create a Pixar entertainment experience, with construction work to begin this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The theme park also announced a pay rise of 3.6 to 5 percent for eligible cast members, backdated to the beginning of this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said eligible full-time staff will also be awarded discretionary bonuses equivalent to 1.8 to 2.4 months' worth of their base salary.

    Drug warehouse raid finds HK$430m of cocaine

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police arrested two men following a raid on a drug warehouse, where officers seized approximately 520 kilogrammes of suspected cocaine, valued at over HK$430 million.
 <br>
  <br>
  Officers intercepted the men at a residential building in Tseung Kwan O on Sunday, discovering two kilos of cocaine in one man's bag, along with an additional 518 kilos in their unit.
  <br>
  <br>
  Senior Inspector Tong Wai-kwok, from the Narcotics Bureau, said the cocaine was suspected to have been smuggled into the city from South America via shipping freight.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The drug trafficking group simultaneously rented a unit in Kwai Chung, where they used legitimate logistics companies to transport drugs arriving in Hong Kong to the Kwai Chung unit for processing," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There, over 1,500 boxes of frozen goods were inspected, and some cocaine concealed within was extracted, repackaged, and disguised as regular cargo. The drugs were then transferred to a private residential unit for storage and distribution."
  <br>
  <br>
  Tong said the group frequently changed locations through different logistics and transport companies to evade detection.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chief Superintendent Ng Kwok-Cheung said the two men, aged 22 and 23, were unemployed and likely committed these crimes to make money quickly.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two men were arrested for drug trafficking, and the case will be brought to the Kwun Tong Magistrates' Courts on Wednesday.

    'Child car seats wouldn't work on public transport'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A new law requiring child car seats or other extra restraints to be fitted in private vehicles carrying children would be too difficult to implement on public transport, the government said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  From November, child restraining devices must be used in private cars for children under eight, unless they are at least 1.35 metres tall.
  <br>
  <br>
  A chief engineer at the Transport Department, Eddy Wu, said half of traffic accidents affecting under eights involve private cars.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that it would be difficult for public transport operators to install restraining devices to suit all child passengers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Children of different ages require different kinds of restraints. For example, older children only need a booster seat, while infants need a baby car seat," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If public transport operators also had to offer suitable devices for children of different ages, or offer a certain quantity, it might create obstacles for their daily operations."
  <br>
  <br>
  Wu also explained why children at least 1.35 metres tall will not need extra restraints. He said this is because their feet will touch the floor and an adult seatbelt would not cut into their necks.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Unionists on Tuesday said the government should allocate more resources to improve Hong Kong’s vocational training system to cultivate more locally skilled talent.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong Federation of Trade Unions (FTU) surveyed 120 vocational training students between October and December last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Over 70 percent of respondents said they were able to land a job within three months of graduation, and more than 90 percent agreed career education in junior secondary years should be strengthened.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alice Tang, the general secretary of the FTU’s occupational retraining centre, said it is important to encourage young people to think about different career paths while they are still at school.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We believe education is a crucial point. If we cannot start from adolescence, or the student’s level, we cannot [emphasise] the importance of vocational training. The education is not only for students, it is also for their parents and teachers,” Tang said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The union suggested the government increase social recognition towards applied learning subjects in the HKDSE public examination, by raising the highest attainable level from four to five.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said this would draw more connections between students' learning experiences and their career development, therefore encouraging more to consider a path outside of traditional academics.
  <br>
  <br>
  The FTU also called for an improvement in the social status of skilled labour, while providing more opportunities for people to advance in their careers, as a way to solve the labour shortage problem.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Our strategy is to enhance professional career education, and the main theme is to enhance [students'] working skill level, so that they can reach local and overseas needs. If we can cooperate with all of society, we can reach our goal,” Tang said.

    Self-parking cars good for new drivers: motoring group

<div class="itemFullText">
 A motoring group has welcomed a change in the law which will allow drivers to use technology to get their cars to park themselves.
 <br>
  <br>
  From March 1, it will be legal for motorists to use smartphones or other devices to enable remote control parking.
  <br>
  <br>
  Honorary life president of the Hong Kong, China Automobile Association, Ringo Lee, told RTHK on Tuesday that the technology will be especially useful when parking in tight spots.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think it's absolutely safe for those who aren't familiar with driving, or even novice drivers. Because the vehicle itself makes use of a lot of technology... laser or infrared cameras, etc... to park. It's not parking arbitrarily," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee said insurance companies should expand third-party insurance to cover drivers in the event an incident is caused by a faulty car system.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other transport-related rule changes from March 1 include allowing dashboard monitors in vehicles to show non-driving related content once the handbrake is on, and more types of electric vehicles will be allowed to use expressways without the need for a permit.

    Drinks recycling plan to cut costs: Tse Chin-wan

<div class="itemFullText">
 Environment minister Tse Chin-wan on Tuesday said he believes a market-led approach in recycling plastic containers and beverage cartons will reduce overall operational costs.
 <br>
  <br>
  The government plans to introduce legal amendments to require drinks companies to collect plastic bottles and cartons for recycling.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bottles and cartons would come with a minimum 10-cent rebate.
  <br>
  <br>
  There will be four phases to the plan, and the initial recycling targets will be set at 30 percent for plastic containers and 10 percent for cartons.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a radio programme, Tse said companies will be penalised for missing targets.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This means requiring beverage importers or manufacturers to make their own arrangements, while the government only sets a target for how much they need to collect, as well as setting a minimum rebate amount," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So, we believe that a market-driven model will reduce overall operating costs and give companies more flexibility in managing their operations."
  <br>
  <br>
  Under the plans, companies can either handle recycling themselves or hire scheme operators.
  <br>
  <br>
  Simon Wong, president of the Federation of Restaurants and Related Trades, told the same programme that it could be difficult for small and medium-sized companies to implement the scheme.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Plastic bottles and drink cartons will need a special label for recycling to help people get their 10-cent refund when recycling. But it might not be easy for some importers because adding these special labels to their products isn't simple and requires changes to their production process," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The administration hopes to recover up to 75 percent of plastic containers and 50 percent of drink cartons within eight years.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government has urged event organisers to make sure they have sufficient funding before selling tickets, after this year's Digital Art Fair was cancelled just weeks in advance.
 <br>
  <br>
  Organisers said the cancellation, announced on Monday, is down to reasons beyond its control.
  <br>
  <br>
  The event was supposed to be held between March 26-30 as part of "Arts March", which also includes Art Basel and Art Central.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement responding to media questions regarding the cancellation, a spokesperson for the Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau said organisers of the Digital Art Fair had applied for money from the Mega Arts and Cultural Events Fund, but failed to provide adequate information for authorities to assess the event's artistic merits, attractiveness to tourists, and economic benefits.
  <br>
  <br>
  The spokesperson noted that tickets for the event were already on sale when the authorities received and rejected the funding application, adding that sufficient funds should be ensured before tickets are sold for an event to avoid similar situations from occurring in the future.
  <br>
  <br>
  Organisers said full refunds will be automatically provided to ticket-holders. General tickets were sold for about HK$320, with VIP tickets going for around HK$960.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Digital Art Fair deeply regrets any disappointment this decision may cause to all stakeholders," a statement said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The fair was founded in 2021 and aims to show cutting-edge technology in the digital fine art sphere.

    FEHD probes workers 'removing own display bills video'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Officials said they are investigating suspicions that some street cleaners have been creating fake work for themselves by putting up posters on lampposts just so they can be seen removing them.
 <br>
  <br>
  An online video purportedly showed workers posting bills on lampposts on Nam Cheong Street in Sham Shui Po, and then filming themselves removing them, as potential proof of their work.
  <br>
  <br>
  A Food and Environmental Hygiene Department spokesman said on Monday that a preliminary investigation found that four workers from an outsourced street cleansing service contractor were involved, and they have been suspended pending further inquiry.
  <br>
  <br>
  The department emphasised its commitment to ensuring contractor accountability and has requested a report from the contractor.
  <br>
  <br>
  It added that if the investigation confirms the allegations, the contractor could face penalties, including service fee deductions and potential impact on future procurement opportunities.
  <br>
  <br>
  The case may also be referred to the police for suspected falsification of records.
  <br>
  <br>
  The spokesman clarified that workers are responsible for removing unauthorised posters, but are not given a removal target.
  <br>
  <br>
  The department will continue monitoring the contractor to ensure compliance.

    'Education spending cuts should be strategic'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's education sector could face funding cuts as Financial Secretary Paul Chan prepares to deliver his budget speech on Wednesday amid a projected HK$100 billion deficit.
 <br>
  <br>
  Victor Kwok, deputy research director at Our Hong Kong Foundation, said the education budget has ballooned from about HK$70 billion a decade ago to around HK$110 billion now.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kwok thinks the government should avoid blanket budget cuts that could harm daily operations and teaching quality.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Now you risk sacrificing some of the things that people have always been doing on a daily basis, because they will be scrambling to find resources and replacements for things that they have always been doing... education quality may be going down as a result of that cut," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The finance minister previously said universities had relatively large amounts of reserves, calling on everyone to play a part in tackling the budget shortfall.
  <br>
  <br>
  While universities have substantial reserves totalling almost HK$140 billion, Kwok cautioned against relying on these funds to offset budget cuts.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Ultimately, [a] reserve is a fixed amount and the spending is ongoing. You have to spend every year. So if you're saying, 'oh, they have HK$100 billion in reserves, so let's give them less, and they can spend their reserves first', but one day their reserves will dry up," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Instead, Kwok said officials could consider reducing spending on research and encourage universities to develop more sustainable funding models.
  <br>
  <br>
  "How do you encourage the university sector in Hong Kong to become more linked to the industry, such that it has more diversified funding resources, and not just solely depending on the government for funding... so that's one area that we can look at," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  For primary and secondary schools, Kwok thinks the government should support merging smaller schools to improve teaching quality and make sure resources are well spent.

    Automotive sector welcomes govt's child car seat rule

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An automotive sector representative on Tuesday welcomed the rule mandating children under eight to be in a safety seat or strapped in with some other restraining device, saying it provides much needed protection for children travelling in private cars.
 <br>
  <br>
  Peter Goh, the CEO of the Hong Kong, China Automobile Association says there is currently no mandatory requirement for youngsters under the age of three to be restrained in any way in a car.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This amendment actually makes it compulsory for all children up to the age of eight to use a [child car seat or restraint of some kind]," he told
  <a href="https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/news-programmes/this-episode.htm?cmsid=77" target="_blank">
   RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme
  </a>
  .
  <br>
  <br>
  "Now the rule is actually trying to make it better for child safety to ensure that all children are adequately protected while travelling in vehicles," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Goh added that the government is trying to refine the rules and to bring Hong Kong more in line with international regulations.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, Goh pointed out that the rule will not apply to children travelling on public transport.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Unfortunately, public transport – buses and taxis – is generally exempted from this mandatory rule because of practical and logistic challenges."
  <br>
  <br>
  People caught flouting the regulation once it comes into effect in November will risk a fine of HK$230, while "serious cases" could lead to court action and penalties as high as HK$2,000.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Trade Development Council (HKTDC) on Monday said a new index it has introduced to gauge how well the city fares in environmental, social and governance (ESG) has identified several strengths.
 <br>
  <br>
  The council said it used the index in a survey of more than 1,200 vendors and buyers during several of its trade fairs and business events last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Overall, Hong Kong received a total of 64.3 points on the index, a figure well above the neutral point of 50.
  <br>
  <br>
  Irina Fan, HKTDC's director of research, said the findings suggest Hong Kong excels in areas such as availability and diversity in green and sustainable products or services, talent training and market connection with international trade partners.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fan said the survey showed that ESG considerations are increasingly regarded as integral elements in business decision-making processes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Buyers also indicated a willingness to pay a premium of at least 10% for ESG products, while vendors reported additional profit margins from engaging with ESG businesses, Fan said.

 Drivers are urged to steer clear of certain roads in Central and Wan Chai because of an upcoming triathlon test event.
 <br>
  <br>
  A total of around 110 athletes from Hong Kong, Macau and the mainland will compete in the men's individual, women's individual and mixed relay events at the Central Harbourfront and Victoria Harbour this weekend, as a part of a test event for the National Games in November.
  <br>
  <br>
  The women's and men's individual races are set for 8am and 10:30am on Saturday respectively, while the mixed relay is scheduled for 2pm on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials said from 10am on Wednesday to 6pm on Sunday, the section of Expo Drive between Legislative Council Road and Expo Drive Central will be temporarily closed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Intermittent road closures will be implemented in the Central Harbourfront and Wan Chai North areas from 5am to 8am on Friday, affecting roads such as Lung Wo Road, Yiu Sing Street and Expo Drive.
  <br>
  <br>
  Further road closures will take place from 2am to 2pm on Saturday and from 8am to 6pm on Sunday in the same areas.
  <br>
  <br>
  Athletes will begin with a swim, followed by cycling before finishing with a run.
  <br>
  <br>
  All races will start at the Wan Chai Temporary Promenade. The cycling route will pass Golden Bauhinia Square, while the running course will loop around the Central Harbourfront Promenade, finishing at the Central Harbourfront Event Space.

    Lower goals help push drink container recycling: govt

<img alt="The government is hoping to recover 30 percent of plastic beverage containers and 10 percent of drink cartons in the initial phase of the recycling scheme. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1792962_1_20250224171913.jpg&q=45">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Monday explained why it wants to take a gradual approach to getting drinks companies to collect plastic bottles and cartons for recycling, after a lawmaker suggested its initial target isn't ambitious enough.
 <br>
  <br>
  Under the plans, the bottles and cartons would come with a minimum HK$0.10 rebate and the administration hopes that within eight years, up to 75 percent of the packaging would be recovered.
  <br>
  <br>
  But there will be four phases to the plan and the initial target is for 30 percent of plastic containers and 10 percent of cartons to be collected, a goal described as "relatively conservative" by lawmaker Chan Yuet-ming.
  <br>
  <br>
  Environment Secretary Tse Chin-wan said a gradual approach would help drive the programme to success.
  <br>
  <br>
  "At present in the market, we're talking about a one-percent recovery only. [In the first year], we already require them to increase the [recovery] volume by 10 times," Tse told lawmakers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Compared to overseas markets, Hong Kong really has a very wide diversity of sales outlets. It is rather difficult for recovery rate targets to be raised more than 10 percent. We believe that a phased implementation and a phased increase of the recovery target is more appropriate."
  <br>
  <br>
  The environment chief said the 10-cent rebate is "attractive enough" as an incentive, after several lawmakers raised questions over how sufficient the amount would be in motivating public participation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The rebate is at least 10 cents... The scheme operators can always have the discretion to offer a larger rebate," Tse said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The recovery target is mandatory and this will put pressure on the operators or the suppliers to recover and collect the amount that would hit the target. Otherwise, the penalty would be on them."
  <br>
  <br>
  The government intends to introduce legal amendments in the second quarter of this year to establish a framework for Producer Responsibility Schemes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The proposal for drink suppliers covers containers and cartons with volumes between 100 millilitres and two litres.

    Child car seat rule to come into force in November

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Children under eight travelling in private cars will need to be in a safety seat or strapped in with some other child restraining device (CRD) from November 1, transport officials said on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The only exception to the new rule will be for those children who are at least 1.35 metres tall.
  <br>
  <br>
  As well as child car seats, drivers can also secure their young passengers with seat belt adjusters, wearable safety restraint vests or foldable boosters.
  <br>
  <br>
  People caught flouting the regulation will risk a fine of HK$230, while "serious cases" could lead to court action and penalties as high as HK$2,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Transport Department noted that drivers who break the rule might be able to avoid punishment in emergency situations, for example if they didn't have time to put the child in a restraining device because they needed to drive them to hospital urgently.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The new requirement aims to enhance protection for children and passenger safety. CRDs provide effective protection for child passengers in traffic accidents and they can substantially reduce the risks of being killed or seriously injured," a department spokesperson said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials noted that children not covered by the new regulation will still need to be strapped in, either with a restraining device or with a normal adult seat belt.

    HKBU says its school would shake up medical training

<div class="itemFullText">
 Baptist University says the medical school it is hoping to create would be innovative and creative and not just a replica of the two Hong Kong already has.
 <br>
  <br>
  The university is one of three institutions to answer the government's call for a third medical school in the city, with the University of Science and Technology and Polytechnic University also expressing an interest.
  <br>
  <br>
  Proposals have to be submitted to the government by the middle of next month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Professor Lee Sum-ping, who chairs Baptist University's preparatory committee on the medical school plan, said the existing medical training system needs a shake-up.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Hong Kong needs a third medical school and I believe the new medical school has to be a new one with new features that is innovative, creative, wise and would hold promises for the future. It cannot be another of the old replications,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The university said its four-year programme would be for those who have already completed their first degree, with around 60 students to be enrolled annually.
  <br>
  <br>
  It added that experts would be engaged to help make the curriculum innovative, and there would be an “East-meets-West” approach.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We would pursue a traditional Western medicine curriculum, enriching and supplementing that with Chinese medicine, where students will understand the basic principles, broaden their visual field and perspective, so students can be more encompassing, more humanistic in their approach to their patients after they graduate,” Lee said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under the proposal, students could opt to complete their clinical placement elsewhere in the Greater Bay Area, which the university said would give students unlimited learning opportunities due to the large number of patients available.
  <br>
  <br>
  “In the Greater Bay Area, you actually see a patient, you learn so much more than looking at a slide or reading a book or clicking on the internet. You feel the patient, their consistency and pulsation,” Lee said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The university said it would be able to admit its first batch of students in September 2026 if the government granted permission for the school by the third quarter of this year.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Airport Authority said January marked a significant milestone for flights taking off and landing at Chek Lap Kok, with the numbers reaching a post-pandemic high.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, the authority reported a 17 percent increase in flight movements, totalling 33,660 last month. Additionally, the airport handled 5.28 million passengers in the first month of the year, reflecting robust annual growth of 27.8 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The authority added that on January 25, the airport processed over 193,000 passengers, achieving another post-pandemic peak and signalling a complete recovery to pre-pandemic levels.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials said they saw double-digit growth compared to the month before in the number of Hong Kong residents, visitors and transit passengers using the airport.
  <br>
  <br>
  The most significant increases were observed in passenger volumes from Southeast Asia, the mainland and Japan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, cargo volume also continued to rise last month, increasing by 4.1 percent year-on-year to 394,000 tonnes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among the main trading regions, cargo volumes from the Middle East, Europe and Australasia showed the most notable increases.
  <br>
  <br>
  “HKIA [Hong Kong International Airport] serves as a prime double gateway connecting the mainland to the world. AAHK [Airport Authority Hong Kong] is increasing the total number of city terminals in the GBA to 30 by March this year," said Chapman Fong, deputy director of corporate development at the authority.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is part of our effort to continuously enhance HKIA’s intermodal connectivity, including high-speed ferry, coach and limousine services. By facilitating passengers’ journey between the GBA and overseas destinations through HKIA’s extensive aviation network, Hong Kong’s international aviation hub status will be strengthened.”

<div class="itemFullText">
 One of Hong Kong’s most historic theatres, Sunbeam Theatre, will close its doors next month after hosting fans for over five decades.
 <br>
  <br>
  Founded in 1972, the Cantonese opera theatre in North Point is set to be transformed into a church after the curtain falls on March 3.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sunbeam recently presented its final showings of “Trump on Show” – a satirical three-hour production about Donald Trump and China.
  <br>
  <br>
  The show is part of the theatre's final mission to make Cantonese opera more appealing to the younger generation.
  <br>
  <br>
  RTHK was earlier granted backstage access, and joined Sunbeam’s chairman Edward Li, as well as award-winning opera performer Loong Koon-tin for a trip down memory lane.

    Kai Tak a favourite for latest light public housing

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Kai Tak appeared to be a top choice as people put in applications on Monday for homes in the second phase of Hong Kong's light public housing scheme.
 <br>
  <br>
  Four projects in Kai Tak, Kwun Tong, Tuen Mun and Sheung Shui will provide more than 5,000 units, with monthly rents of between HK$860 and HK$3,270.
  <br>
  <br>
  Successful tenants will be able to move in from the fourth quarter of this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  One of those putting in an application, Chaves, told RTHK that Kai Tak would be a convenient location for her.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I've been waiting for the traditional public housing for almost 11 years. I'm paying rent every month, and my savings are just going. [I currently live in] a subdivided unit and there are four units in all. But the rent is quite a bit, I pay HK$5,000 a month," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm retired. I'm 73. I thought I'd apply for this because of Kai Tak. I do a lot of church work, so Kai Tak is easy for me to access the church in Tsim Sha Tsui."
  <br>
  <br>
  A man surnamed Choi was also hoping to get a unit in Kai Tak.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I live in Kam Sheung Road (in Yuen Long) now and it's inconvenient," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  An applicant surnamed Ng also said the Olympic Avenue project adjacent to Kai Tak MTR station was his choice.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I chose Kai Tak. It's more convenient, cleaner and more airy. I live in transitional housing in Chai Wan but the rent is just too expensive. It's around HK$3,000 a month," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government aims to build a total of about 30,000 light public flats by 2028 as a short-term measure for those waiting for traditional public units.
  <br>
  <br>
  Successful applicants under the first light public housing phase will be able to move into the temporary new homes in Yuen Long and Ngau Tau Kok in March and June respectively.

    'HK$2 transport scheme should stay with limitations'

<img alt="The HK$2 scheme was originally introduced in 2012 for anyone aged 65 or above. It was expanded in 2022 to also cover those between 60 and 64. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1792879_1_20250224084830.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan is widely expected to unveil measures to trim public expenditure when he delivers his latest budget on Wednesday, with one of them being a possible adjustment to the HK$2 transport fares for people over 60.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chan, who said his budget would present a plan to control spending and increase revenue, has already said the scheme is not financially viable in the long run and that expenses are snowballing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Members of the public who spoke to RTHK say they do not want to lose the scheme – which was introduced in 2012 and expanded in 2022 – but said they understood that things need to be adjusted when times are tight.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jim is among the 2.4 million or so beneficiaries of the scheme, who has been paying concessionary fares since turning 60 last May.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Of course, I don't want the scheme to go away. It saves me a great deal a month every single month on transport. But I understand the dilemma and the fiscal deficit.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I'm willing to compromise somehow in order to keep the scheme the way it is. There could be some compromise in terms of putting a limit on how much of an allowance you actually get."
  <br>
  <br>
  Seventy-five year-old David also felt the welfare initiative should be adjusted to go with the times.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The whole idea was for retired people to go out. But now, a lot of people are not retired at 65. A lot of people are working full time and are taking advantage of this," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “At this moment, the Hong Kong government is in a lot of deficit. They're not rich as they used to be. So when you don't have the money, you should consider cutting your expense."
  <br>
  <br>
  The government reimbursed HK$4 billion to public transport operators in the previous financial year. That figure could shoot up to HK$6 billion this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  But even as the expenditure balloons, unionist lawmaker Bill Tang said the scheme needs to stay.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We think the HK$2 scheme is very, very positive for elderly or disabled [people's] welfare. it's beneficial to release their workforce, not only to employment, but also help to take care of their relatives, more support to the family,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tang suggested an incremental bus fare system so that passengers who hop off after only a few stops pay a fraction of the full fare. He said that would lessen the government's burden in terms of the reimbursement amount.
  <br>
  <br>
  The DAB also opposed any changes to the scheme, saying its expenditure is a drop in the bucket compared with the estimated deficit of HK$100 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Business and Professionals Alliance (BPA) proposed raising the concessionary fare to HK$3 or HK$4, to align with inflation.
  <br>
  <br>
  BPA lawmaker Priscilla Leung also suggested setting a cap on the transport subsidy each beneficiary can get.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We do not agree to cancel a particular sector who are enjoying the scheme right now, including the age span from 60 to 64. We just need to set up a very clear scheme, for example, they may only use two times per day. So they will use it out of necessity,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fellow lawmaker Gary Zhang, meanwhile, is calling for a cautious approach.
  <br>
  <br>
  He urged authorities to hold off drastic changes until analysing data such as people's travel patterns.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Team Hong Kong, China put up a strong fight but fell short against Jiangsu, as they missed out on gold at a men's handball tournament at Kai Tak Arena.
 <br>
  <br>
  The two-day tournament, featuring Guangdong, Jiangsu, Macau, and Hong Kong, wrapped up on Sunday. It also served as a test event for the National Games in November, when the city will host handball and seven other competition events.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite raucous support from the home crowd, the SAR found themselves on the back foot against the onslaught of Jiangsu players.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both sides traded goals early on, but the visitors took a 15-9 lead at the half.
  <br>
  <br>
  After the break, Team Hong Kong, China ramped up their offensive play, closing the gap to just three at one point. However, their rally fizzled out as Jiangsu came away 28-20 winners.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the earlier bronze medal match, Guangdong dominated Macau, China wire to wire. Guangdong jumped to a 20-10 lead at halftime, and pulled away for a final score of 42-20.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeung Tak-keung, the head of Hong Kong's National Games Coordination Office, said more than 2,800 spectators attended the matches.
  <br>
  <br>
  He revealed another test event has been scheduled next weekend -- the triathlon at the Central waterfront.

    Romantic Warrior claims second in close Saudi Cup race

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong racing royalty Romantic Warrior has come up just short in the world's most lucrative race, galloping to second in an epic finish against Japan's Forever Young in the US$20 million Saudi Cup in Riyadh.
 <br>
  <br>
  Romantic Warrior – the highest-earning racehorse of all time – turned up at the Saudi capital for the race in the early hours of Sunday, Hong Kong time, hoping to add to the US$23 million already in the bank.
  <br>
  <br>
  The seven-year-old horse led the pack until the final 50 metres of the race, when the Japanese dirt star rallied to surge ahead in a nail-biting finish.
  <br>
  <br>
  This marked the first loss for Romantic Warrior since the Turnbull Stakes at Flemington in 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  Still, the Hong Kong-trained horse collected US$3.5 million for finishing second.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He was gallant in defeat. We had a great pitch in behind and he got a little bit of kickback, so I thought I'll get him into clear air and he made ground just beautifully. He went through his paces really nicely all the way to the line and I can safely say I wasn't stopping. I did not alter my stride pace at all," said superstar jockey James McDonald.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Of course, I'm gutted he got beaten ... but he went down on his sword that's for sure and made one hell of a race out of it."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trainer Danny Shum, for his part, called the performance "a good run", noting Romantic Warrior was only beaten by a head.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We all did our best. I hope to win every time, but racing is racing. As long as he tries his best and it's a really good race – I think most of the people enjoyed the race," said Shum.
  <br>
  <br>
  The champion galloper is set to next tackle the 1,800-metre Group One Dubai Turf in April.

 Hong Kong Children's Hospital will strive to resume services for its ear, nose and throat, or ENT, department by the second half of this year, according to the head of the Hospital Authority.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Kai Tak institution earlier suspended operations of the ENT department due to a manpower shortage. More than 500 patients were redirected to other public hospitals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a radio programme on Sunday, the authority's chief executive Tony Ko said that staff resignations were stabilising.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Usually there are only around 10 staff members from each hospital department, and less at the Children's Hospital. So when several staff members [from the ENT department] resigned within a short period of time at Children's Hospital ... operations had to be suspended," he explained.
  <br>
  <br>
  "However, the overall resignation numbers are stabilising, and staff numbers are slowly recovering."
  <br>
  <br>
  Ko also pledged to boost ENT services in different ways. These include encouraging medical staff outside the speciality to take care of less complicated cases, and allowing non-locally trained doctors to assist in cases.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, he said the authority is prepared for a budget cut in view of the government's fiscal deficit.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For example, through drugs and medical equipment procurement, we have been purchasing from more places such as the mainland. This helped us reduce our costs. In terms of efficiency, our colleagues are able to work more smoothly and see more patients with the help of technology," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are seeing initial results."
  <br>
  <br>
  Ko said the authority is also seeking to implement within six months dozens of recommendations set out by a committee tasked to systemically review public hospital operations and facilities.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among the suggestions are enhancing top-level oversight for quality and safety incidents, and introducing a reward-and-penalty staff assessment system.
  <br>
  <br>
  When asked whether such measures would affect morale, Ko said the ultimate aim of the review is to help both staff and patients.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan has said Wednesday's budget will detail the government's fiscal consolidation strategies, while revealing the colour of choice for his upcoming blueprint.
 <br>
  <br>
  On his official blog, the finance chief said on Sunday the administration would strictly control its spending, increase revenue appropriately, and make use of public resources and market forces to further boost development.
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted the aqua-coloured cover of the budget reflected the unlimited opportunities presented in future developments.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There is infinite vitality in a beautiful lake. Despite the occasional storms, we have firm confidence and positive expectations for the future given the solid backing of the country and the joint efforts of all sectors in Hong Kong," Chan wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  The finance minister also expressed gratitude to those who gave their suggestions during the budget consultation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan will announce his latest budget on February 26, amid an estimated deficit of HK$100 billion for the financial year ending March 31.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Officials said the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Marathon on Sunday morning proceeded smoothly, but a review will still go ahead for to identify areas of improvement for the upcoming National Games later this year.
 <br>
  <br>
  The cross-boundary race which began and ended in Shenzhen while passing through Hong Kong also served as a test event for the 15th National Games marathon later this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thirty-eight athletes from various provinces and cities participated, including three male and three female runners from Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zhao Chaochuan, from Yunnan, won the men's race in two hours, 17 minutes and 15 seconds.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SAR's Wan Cheuk-hei was the first man from the SAR to cross the line, clocking a time of of two hours and 33 minutes for eighth overall. He described the whole experience as special.
  <br>
  <br>
  "No matter if we were running against the wind or there were many slopes, it was still a very special route. We are fortunate to be running it for the first time. We don't know for sure if this will be the exact path for the Games, but I thought the arrangements were ideal," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the women's side, Guangzhou's Chen Liqin clinched gold in two hours, 44 minutes and 44 seconds. The SAR's Leanne Szeto, at some two minutes behind, also finished on the podium with a bronze.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There have been marathon events for three consecutive weeks, with this race being the third one, so my feet are starting to get tired. I also feel a bit mentally fatigued from running. I was a little dizzy earlier, but overall it went smoothly. I didn't push myself too hard," Szeto said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeung Tak-keung, head of the SAR's National Games Coordination Office, said the test event ran smoothly and gave Hong Kong marshals valuable experience.
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted that officials would conduct a review into all aspects of the race ahead of the Games this November.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will consult with the athletes, coaches and other experts to see which aspects of the race needs to be optimised or adjusted. However, we can see that the track's width, curves and incline on the Hong Kong course is suitable for the event. Nonetheless, this will need further review later on," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Around half of the cross-boundary marathon took place on Hong Kong's roads. Starting at the Shenzhen Bay Sports Centre, runners entered the SAR via the Shenzhen Bay Port, before traversing the Shenzhen Bay Bridge and Kong Sham Western Highway viaduct, and returning via the same route.

    'All views on regulating ride-hailing welcomed'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 All ideas on how officials can regulate online ride-hailing platforms in Hong Kong are welcomed, says the head of a government advisory body spearheading an industry review.
 <br>
  <br>
  Stephen Cheung, who chairs the Transport Advisory Committee, also stressed the importance of finding common ground between the taxi trade and ride-hailing operators.
  <br>
  <br>
  The body and transport officials had heard the views of more than 20 representatives from the taxi trade -- as well as five ride-hailing operators -- in separate meetings last week.
  <br>
  <br>
  The committee pledged to put forward a proposal on regulating car-sharing platforms to the administration within this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I have committed to the stakeholders that [whenever] they have opinions, not only they can express their view to us during the meetings, they can [also] submit their opinion in written form any time they want," Cheung said after appearing on a radio programme on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Even if they meet me on the streets, in whatever occasion they meet me, they can tell me what they think. This is an ongoing consultation process."
  <br>
  <br>
  As to potential adjustments to the HK$2 transport fare concessionary scheme for residents aged 60 or above, Cheung said he's open to all suggestions to "reduce the wastage" amid a budget deficit.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he threw his weight behind the scheme's objective.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Any policy that encourages people to use our public transportation, to move across town, I think is a good policy," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to sources, officials are considering to cap the number of trips at eight per day for users, who will also receive an 80 percent discount on fares exceeding HK$10 -- more than the flat fare of HK$2 they're now paying on all trips.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Athletes participating in a handball test event for the National Games on Saturday said they were happy with the atmosphere and facilities at the Kai Tak Sports Park.
 <br>
  <br>
  The men's handball test event is underway at the Kai Tak Arena over Saturday and Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The competing teams are Guangdong, Jiangsu, Macau and Hong Kong, China.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang Quan, a handballer from the Jiangsu team, said the arena is comparable to those in Europe.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think this venue is very professional. Since I have played in Europe before, I find that the lighting and flooring here are very similar to those in Europe - basically the same level," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong men's handball team captain Freddie Tse said the venue arrangements were first-class, rating them 9 out of 10.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm very excited and amazed. It's my first time at Hong Kong's home court, and it's rare to hear our own language. You can see that the spectators are our family and friends. Even the people around us – it feels so familiar," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Huang Peijie from the Guangdong handball team, meanwhile, said the atmosphere was excellent and players were eager to compete.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some spectators told RTHK they were there to support the SAR team and looked forward to watching the actual Games in person.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I play handball myself, that's why I follow this sport closely. I hope more people will get to know this sport. I want to see the Hong Kong team's techniques and learn a move or two," said a spectator.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The SAR's deputies to the National People's Congress from the DAB party said on Saturday that they will propose expanding the multi-entry visa scheme to include more cities in the Greater Bay Area, or even first-tier cities, at the Two Sessions meeting in Beijing early next month.
 <br>
  <br>
  It was among the more than 40 suggestions the party plans to table to the meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  The scheme was recently restored to cover Shenzhen residents.
  <br>
  <br>
  The party pointed out that expanding the coverage could help boost tourism development.
  <br>
  <br>
  Starry Lee, the SAR's sole delegate to the nation's top legislature noted that it is crucial for Hong Kong to open up to new markets, and the commercial sector, in particular, should get ready to do so.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Because they are more flexible in facing all these challenges and they are in a more capable position to open up new markets. Therefore I hope that different chambers and trade associations can join hands together to open up more new markets," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In return, if we have more new markets, we can also bring more talent, investment and technology to our country."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee said she will also propose that the central government set up a "housing purchase fund" to help talents from the mainland to settle in the SAR.

    Mixed reactions over rumoured changes to HK$2 scheme

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lawmakers have mixed reactions towards the rumoured changes on the HK$2 fare concessionary scheme for the elderly.
 <br>
  <br>
  According to sources, officials are mulling to impose a cap of eight trips per day for citizens aged 60 or above.
  <br>
  <br>
  It's thought while the fare stays at HK$2 for public transport rides costing HK$10 or less, the government would provide an 80 percent discount when the standard fare is above HK$10.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bill Tang welcomed the rumoured amendment, and believes it could help solve the bottomless subsidy pit.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think it would affect two types of people, for those who have to pay more - One is those who go to work everyday. I think they can afford the fare increment from HK$2 to HK$3 or HK$4," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The other is those who have to travel across multiple districts to take care of their grandchildren."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Federation of Trade Unions lawmaker hopes the government could review the threshold of HK$10 should transportation fares continue to rise.
  <br>
  <br>
  Roundtable legislator Michael Tien said he would also welcome the rumoured changes, adding that it would be better than increasing the HK$2 fare itself.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The benefit of that is that it sets a mechanism, so that it automatically adjusts itself for the next 100, 200 years, rather than arguing about when they have to change that again," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Changing it into a percentage would be the best thing."
  <br>
  <br>
  Tik Chi-yuen from Third Side, on the other hand, believed that the rumoured amendment would not have a significant impact in reducing government expenses.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Based on our observations, very few elderly take eight trips per day," he told reporters after a Commercial Radio programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If only a few people take more than eight journeys, economically, the measure has no impact. But this will cause unease among the public and it's unnecessary."

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Shenzhen Bay Port will suspend its clearance services on Sunday for the cross-boundary marathon test event of the National Games.
 <br>
  <br>
  The port will be closed from 2am to 11am, with no passengers or vehicles allowed during this period.
  <br>
  <br>
  The closure also affects the Shenzhen Bay Bridge, Kong Sham Western Highway and Ha Tsuen Interchange.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cross-boundary coach services, franchised buses, minibuses and taxis via the port will also be suspended during the time frame.
  <br>
  <br>
  Travellers are advised to use alternative control points, including Lok Ma Chau, Heung Yuen Wai, and Man Kam To.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Transport Department recommended using the East Rail Line or taking KMB routes B1 and B9 to reach these checkpoints.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Passengers [should] use public transport services as much as possible and avoid driving to cross boundary ports during the test event period to avoid traffic congestion and unnecessary delays," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong section of the marathon is about 21 kilometres in total.
  <br>
  <br>
  The athletes will run for two kilometres in Shenzhen before entering Hong Kong through the Shenzhen Bay Port.
  <br>
  <br>
  They will run along the Hong Kong-Shenzhen Western Corridor towards the south until they get to the turning point.
  <br>
  <br>
  The women’s race begins at 7am while the men’s race starts half an hour later.

    Ticket scalping for Kai Tak opening being combated

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Cultural and tourism minister Rosanna Law on Saturday said officials are working with police to combat ticket scalping for the Kai Tak Sports Park opening next month.
 <br>
  <br>
  Despite a real-name registration system, some people have been reselling tickets online for the star-studded event at prices far beyond HK$10.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a radio programme, Law called on members of the public to stay vigilant against scams.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If you try to buy tickets above face value or buy from scalpers, you will only encourage more scalping activities," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Since we have broadcasts on four TV channels, there's no need to scramble for these tickets that come from unknown sources and could even be fake."
  <br>
  <br>
  People will have to exchange their electronic vouchers for physical tickets at the Kai Tak Arena on February 27, 28 or the event day.
  <br>
  <br>
  The cultural minister said officials will keep pursuing additional guests for the ceremony on March 1, which features athletes, singers and performers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Law also said she's confident about crowd management on the show day, noting that 80 percent of spectators were able to leave on the first MTR train after two major Kai Tak drills.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the tourism chief expects next week's budget speech to reveal this year's visitor forecast, which she thinks will exceed last year's numbers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Last year, visitor arrivals reached 45 million. With more spectacular mega events this year like the giant pandas and the Kai Tak Sports Park opening, I expect visitor numbers to rise further. But we've mentioned that we're not just pursuing quantity but also quality," she said.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The sensation caused by the mainland blockbuster Ne Zha 2 is very much a "lightning in a bottle-style success" which may not be easy to replicate, according to a local film critic.
 <br>
  <br>
  The animated film, based on the mythological character from Chinese folklore, hits the big screens in Hong Kong on Saturday, after smashing box office records on the mainland and abroad.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think what director Yang Yu has done is taking an ancient property, something that every Chinese is intensely familiar with, to fiddle around with it for modern audiences," said Elizabeth Kerr, a Hong Kong-based film critic.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on
  <a href="https://www.rthk.hk/radio/radio3/programme/trendingchina" target="_blank">
   <u>
    RTHK's Trending China programme
   </u>
  </a>
  , she felt the film was a breath of fresh air as the same mythological legends are featured again and again.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The best part about the Ne Zha film is that they're not 'A Journey to the West', they're not 'Monkey King', which I understand that it is beloved ... [But] there's so much more that you can choose from," she explained.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is a kind of strange territory for overseas viewers, for people who know nothing about any of the culture on this side of the world, it's going to be fresh to them."
  <br>
  <br>
  The sequel to the 2019 hit Ne Zha smashed box office records on the mainland just two weeks after its release.
  <br>
  <br>
  The film went on to dethrone Disney's "Inside Out 2" as the highest-grossing animated movie of all time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kerr believes the sequel's more sophisticated and refined visual effects attributed to its success.
  <br>
  <br>
  But she struck a cautious tone over the film's release in the US market, saying it may not replicate the kind of success seen for Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, the Oscar-winning martial arts epic in 2000.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Partially because Crouching Tiger had a wider release. It also had considerable movie stars in it, and a powerhouse distributor pushing it," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  But she insisted Ne Zha 2's value should not be solely judged by its box office revenue.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Ne Zha 2 is one of those things that is very much lightning in a bottle. People will try and repeat it. But you can't force it because how it happened was organic - no one will ever be able to tell you why this worked for this year, at this time, in this country, why it succeeded, no one can."
  <br>
  <br>
  She also hoped Ne Zha's success will encourage mainland filmmakers to experiment with different varieties of scripts, and be willing to "roll the dice" more.

    Impact of Paul Y's liquidation 'manageable': govt

<img alt="The High Court has appointed a provisional liquidator to handle Paul Y's debts and formulate a restructuring plan. Internet photo" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1792682_1_20250221212806.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A long-standing construction firm, Paul Y. Engineering Group, on Friday had its provisional liquidation application approved by the court.
 <br>
  <br>
  The High Court has now appointed a provisional liquidator for Paul Y's five subsidiaries to handle debts and formulate a restructuring plan.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government said while the 78-year-old company is undertaking a number of public works projects, the impact of the formerly-listed firm's situation should be manageable.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, the government said the company is currently working on 13 public works projects -- all but one of them were undertaken by way of joint venture with other construction companies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Paul Y is also responsible for a number of projects for other public organisations.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As the majority of the contracts are undertaken by joint ventures, regardless of whether Paul Y is liquidated eventually, the other participants of the joint venture contracts must complete the remaining works in accordance with the contract requirements," authorities said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some public sector owners, the government noted, have already replaced the main contractor of projects, for which the indebted firm was the sole undertaker.
  <br>
  <br>
  A spokesperson added that the administration has been paying close attention and taking measures to lower the impact on relevant projects and subcontractors, while helping affected workers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Paul Y had built numerous public and private housing projects, as well as landmark buildings such as The Center and the Hong Kong Club Building in Central.

    Journey cap, reduced discounts mulled for HK$2 scheme

<img alt="The government is believed to be planning changes to the HK$2 subsidised fare scheme for the over 60s. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1792643_1_20250221172650.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong’s HK$2 subsidised bus, train, ferry, minibus and tram fares for the over 60s could be curbed, sources say, with expensive journeys costing more and a daily limit on how many discounted trips can be made.
 <br>
  <br>
  It's thought the government is mulling a daily cap of eight trips, while discounts of 80 percent will be provided when the standard fare is above HK$10.
  <br>
  <br>
  For example, a HK$20 standard fare would cost HK$4 once the subsidy is applied.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials are not thought to be planning to raise the age when people can start enjoying the cheaper fares.
  <br>
  <br>
  Financial Secretary Paul Chan said earlier that there is broad public agreement that the HK$2 scheme must be changed as it is not financially sustainable in the long run.
  <br>
  <br>
  The scheme is expected to have cost some HK$6 billion in the 2024/25 financial year, a jump of around 50 percent from the year before.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Society for Immunisations and Travel Medicine on Friday said Hong Kong people should take different jabs, in accordance with their travel destinations.
 <br>
  <br>
  The society interviewed over 100 people this month, and found that 85 percent of them would not get jabbed, even if they were going to high-risk places.
  <br>
  <br>
  Its president, Alex Leung, urged people to have a health consultation four to six weeks before their departure.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Travel health is not just about vaccination, it's about the whole package of travel health risk assessment. It's about what is the chemoprophylaxis... emergency medications," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Leung said, for example, there are currently pneumonia outbreaks in Indonesia and the Philippines, while places like Japan, South Korea and Thailand recorded outbreaks of flu.
  <br>
  <br>
  Infectious diseases expert Ivan Hung said having flu and pneumococcal infections at the same time is very common, and it may increase the possibility of hospitalisation and the death of patients.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Pneumococcal disease... which previously [was] not believed to be a traveller's disease, is now being highlighted that certain people will have this risk of acquiring this kind of infection and developing complications," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The society said people can refer to its vaccine guidelines, targeting popular destinations among Hong Kong travellers.

    Citybus unveils panda-themed open-top bus

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Tourists, bus enthusiasts and panda-lovers are being invited to take a ride on an open-top double-decker set to ply sightseeing routes in the city.
 <br>
  <br>
  Citybus on Friday introduced a newly re-painted vehicle featuring the six pandas living in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bus will be used on five sightseeing routes, including two new ones to be launched on March 17.
  <br>
  <br>
  For less than HK$50, travellers can go to tourism hotspots such as Repulse Bay and Aberdeen, or travel on the existing lines between Tsim Sha Tsui, Central and West Kowloon Cultural District.
  <br>
  <br>
  Transport minister Mable Chan said the bus company has worked with Southern District Council, Ocean Park and community groups to come up with the new routes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Not only will the bus take passengers around, those on board can also feel they're on a lively, cute and happy giant panda bus, which will blend into the scenery of different districts," she said at a press conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This not only puts into practice 'tourism everywhere', it's also 'pandas everywhere'. This injects a dose of vibrancy into different areas."
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister said that last year, the company's open-top bus routes carried around 560,000 passengers.
  <br>
  <br>
  The managing director of Citybus, Richard Hall, said the new routes offer stunning views around Hong Kong's shorelines.
  <br>
  <br>
  "These two new routes will run along the dramatic coastline of Hong Kong Island, including the famous Victoria Harbour, the iconic beaches surrounding Southern District, with the incredible sunsets to be seen along the shoreline," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The firm said it might paint pandas on more of its buses in future, depending on demand.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The vice-chancellor of the University of Hong Kong (HKU) on Friday said the institution would shoulder the financial challenges with the SAR amid a potential funding cut to the education sector.
 <br>
  <br>
  Financial Secretary Paul Chan earlier hinted there was room to reduce education spending with a public deficit of HK$100 billion, pointing to substantial reserves of local universities.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a media luncheon, Zhang Xiang said he hopes any spending cuts would be moderate.
  <br>
  <br>
  “As a responsible community member, HKU will shoulder with the community, we will all together face this challenge,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We also hope that the government's financial cuts to the higher education will be moderate so we can survive.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Zhang said that while HKU has reserves which it built up over 100 years, much of this money has already been earmarked for future projects.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We are building many buildings, more than 10 buildings on campus. This itself is multi-billion dollars already earmarked for this,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The HKU head added that a large portion of reserves consist of endowment funds from donors that support professorships.

    Lawmakers support tram fare increases

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Many lawmakers on Friday voiced support for an increase in tram fares, with Hong Kong Tramways saying it needs the rises to stay afloat.
 <br>
  <br>
  The company hopes to put up fares by 30 cents to HK$3.30 for over 12s, by 10 cents to HK$1.60 for children aged 3 to 11, and by 20 cents to HK$1.50 for senior citizens.
  <br>
  <br>
  Managing director Paul Tirvaudey told lawmakers at a transport panel meeting that the firm does not expect passenger numbers to return to pre-Covid levels because of structural changes to the population and economic activities on Hong Kong Island.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Hong Kong Tramways is at the same time very resilient, as it has been profitable in 120 years of existence. But at the same time, it is also still fragile with several critical risks which if not addressed properly, could threaten its long term viability,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “So our ambition at the moment is to keep consolidating Hong Kong Tramways in the long term, for it to contribute even more to the attractiveness of Hong Kong and to the quality of life of its residents.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Legislator Gary Zhang, who supported the fare increase proposal, asked if the company could work on "smart driving", to improve efficiency.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tirvaudey said the company has been looking into this, for example by installing more cameras on trams for investigations and training.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Regarding the most advanced technologies, we had some tests. However, the difficulty would be to extend, to generalise these kind of technologies to 165 trams,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Our fleet is quite large, and in terms of cost efficiency, it could still be very expensive compared to the benefits. So the return on investment has not been proven at the moment, but this is something that we closely monitor.”

 Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism Rosanna Law on Friday said a recording of the opening ceremony for Kai Tak Sports Park will be aired after editing in order to provide the best viewer experience.
 <br>
  <br>
  The opening show will be held at 6.30pm on March 1. It will be shown by four TV channels at 9.30pm.
  <br>
  <br>
  On an RTHK radio programme, Law stressed that the arrangement is not due to technical constraints, but is to coordinate the transition between different scenes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We hope to air the programme in one go, so viewers can enjoy a packed programme. After having many considerations, we think going for post-production is better," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked about claims that post-production demonstrates a lack of professionalism, the minister said there are many ways to show how magnificent and beautiful the sports park is.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have a strong performance line-up, and they have various collaborations and crossovers," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Law added that apart from the line-up already announced, including Hong Kong singers Joey Yung and MC Cheung, and fencing star Vivian Kong, special guests may also feature in the ceremony.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A four-day conference aimed at promoting the importance of sports law and arbitration is currently underway in Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  Organised by the Law Society, the symposium – called the 2025 Sports Law Mega Event – explores the connection between sports, law, and business.
  <br>
  <br>
  Starting from Thursday and lasting until Sunday, a number of activities will be held with the goal of facilitating exchange between lawyers and visiting guests.
  <br>
  <br>
  “This conference is all about how sports law can create opportunities for Hong Kong’s legal and sports industries,” the president of the Law Society, Roden Tong, told
  <a href="https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/news-programmes/this-episode.htm?cmsid=77" target="_blank">
   RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme
  </a>
  on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  He explained that the conference will cover a number of areas, including broadcasting rights.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We even have e-sports specialists actually in one of the sessions,” he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Deputy Secretary for Justice Horace Cheung had revealed earlier this month that the pilot scheme for sports dispute resolution will be rolled out in the latter half of this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The idea was first unveiled in the Policy Address last year with the aim of promoting sports arbitration, which Tong said is currently not a common method of solving disputes.
  <br>
  <br>
  “What we see now is the global sports market is in fact booming, and with [this], there are more disputes, whether it’s about contracts, governance issues or competition-related matters,” Tong said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We believe that a robust and efficient dispute resolution system is essential, particularly in sports.”

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Democratic Party on Thursday evening announced its intention to disband following a central committee meeting to discuss its future.
 <br>
  <br>
  But party chairman Lo Kin-hei said a general meeting would be held at a later date and the disbandment would only move ahead if 75 percent of attending members approved.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It is a decision that we make based on our understanding of the current political situation and things like that,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lo also said he would chair a three-person working group to handle the initial preparations for the party's shutdown.

 The Department of Health has apologised for mistakenly giving pneumococcal vaccines to two children who were supposed to get hepatitis B vaccinations at the Tin Shui Wai Maternal and Child Health Centre.
 <br>
  <br>
  The department said there was no adverse reaction in the affected kids and paediatricians have assessed that the wrong vaccines do not pose any health risks to them.
  <br>
  <br>
  Seven children, between one and seven months old, were scheduled to receive hepatitis B vaccines between 4pm and 5.30pm on Monday, the department said.
  <br>
  <br>
  But a routine check of vaccination records later that day found that two fewer doses of hepatitis B vaccine had been used and two extra doses of pneumococcal vaccine had been used.
  <br>
  <br>
  The department said while investigations are ongoing it is believed the incident was due to human error, noting it had instructed the health centre to step up efforts in the training of frontline staff.
  <br>
  <br>
  It added that the nursing staff involved had been suspended from vaccination duties and disciplinary action would be taken if the probe confirms any misconduct.

    Remand, new prison admission numbers rise in 2024

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The average daily number of people in remand reached its highest in more than two decades while the number of new admissions to correctional institutions last year also rose, prison authorities said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  New prison admissions overall stood at 18,438 last year, up seven percent from the figure in 2023, according to the Correctional Services Department.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 3,600 people were remanded in custody on average per day over the past year – the highest figure since 2000.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In response to the ever-changing penal population, especially the increasing population of those in remand, the department has deployed part of the capacity of certain correctional institutions to admit those in remand, to alleviate the overcrowding situation of reception centres," said commissioner Wong Kwok-hing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Delivering an annual round-up of the department's work, Wong also said authorities decided against introducing legal amendments to prevent people placed under supervision from leaving Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  The idea was previously floated after former student activist Tony Chung allegedly violated his supervision order and went to Britain to seek political asylum.
  <br>
  <br>
  "After discussing with the Department of Justice, we found that under current laws, we actually have enough power to impose some new supervisory conditions," Wong said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So since last year, we have implemented some arrangements for all those under supervision on applying to leave Hong Kong. They must apply to our supervisors before leaving Hong Kong, and they can only leave when we give approval."
  <br>
  <br>
  Fifteen cases had been approved so far under the new rule, Wong added.

    8,500 tickets on offer for Kai Tak Sports Park opening

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government announced on Thursday that 8,500 tickets would be up for grabs for the opening ceremony of the Kai Tak Sports Park on March 1.
 <br>
  <br>
  Tickets will be available starting at 10am on Friday through Urbtix on a first-come, first-served basis, and they will cost HK$10 each.
  <br>
  <br>
  The figure is among the total number of 33,600 seats available for the event, with the government and park operator each responsible for the distribution of 16,800 tickets.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 8,000 tickets will be distributed for free to underprivileged families, charities and other district organisations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism Rosanna Law said while the show that starts at 6.30pm would not be broadcast live, the ceremony would be aired later in the evening by four TV channels at 9.30pm.
  <br>
  <br>
  She pointed out that overseas viewers could also enjoy the broadcast.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For overseas viewers, I think they also can [watch] through the apps or through the channels of our different free TV channels... watch it together with the Hong Kong audience at 9.30pm at home in their countries or in their areas," Law said.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said although the park is able to live stream the event, the government decided not to do that because the broadcast version would be able to showcase the park’s facilities better.
  <br>
  <br>
  Singers, celebrities and athletes from Hong Kong and the mainland were among those slated to perform at the ceremony.
  <br>
  <br>
  Law did not reveal how much the ceremony cost, but she said the government would spend its budget wisely.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I have to give special thanks to all the participating artists and also athletes and performers, most of them actually do not require us to provide a special remuneration, aside from the minimum, for example the makeup or hair-do.”

    New light rail route to showcase gems of Tuen Mun

<img alt="The new light rail sightseeing route will cover 12 stops in Tuen Mun. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1792484_1_20250220174021.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 MTR bosses on Thursday unveiled a new "light rail sightseeing route" to take visitors on a tour of the delights of Tuen Mun.
 <br>
  <br>
  From February 22, six "Tuen Mun Voyager" trains will run in a circular route on weekends and public holidays. The journey will last about one hour and 15 minutes, although passengers can hop on and off at any of the 12 stops covered.
  <br>
  <br>
  A travel ambassador will be on board to tell passengers about the sights they can see.
  <br>
  <br>
  The railway company said it has come up with three different itineraries, one for food lovers, another for photography enthusiasts, and a third especially attractive to families.
  <br>
  <br>
  One highlight is Tuen Mun Ferry Pier, where the movie “Beyond the Dream” was filmed, while another is the seafood market near the Sam Shing stop.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jeny Yeung, MTR’s Managing Director for Hong Kong Transport Services, said she hopes the new route will attract people to visit the district as part of the "tourism everywhere" concept.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Tuen Mun is a charming place that not many Hong Kong people know. There are many beautiful landmarks, historical buildings and scenery,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Through this sightseeing route, we hope to draw in locals and tourists to come to Tuen Mun and discover the gems here.”
  <br>
  <br>
  A one-day travel pass costs HK$50 and comes with HK$150 worth of vouchers.

    Handball National Games trials to be held this weekend

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong official who heads an office coordinating the upcoming National Games, Yeung Tak-keung, said he expects around 1,000 spectators to attend a handball tournament serving as a test event for the Games this weekend.
 <br>
  <br>
  The two-day event will take place at the Kai Tak Arena, and comes before the SAR hosts the nationwide sporting tournament with Guangdong and Macau for the first time this autumn.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeung, who's the former sports commissioner, said on Thursday that workers at the Sports Park are ready after a series of trials in recent months.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said officials were making final adjustments for the tournament this weekend, such as making sure the changing rooms are fine as well as the lighting for the court.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Because for handball, sometimes players need to lob the ball high when they go on a fast break. That means they will look up, so we have to adjust the angle of the lights, and how bright they are," Yeung told RTHK in an interview.
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted the Hong Kong Rugby Sevens in late March would also be a test event for the National Games.
  <br>
  <br>
  But while it is the first time the mega event would take place at Kai Tak, Yeung doesn't expect much of a problem because the SAR has a wealth of experience in hosting it.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added the test event for beach volleyball would be held around Easter on the football pitches at Victoria Park, and stalls would be set up nearby to promote Hong Kong culture to spectators.
  <br>
  <br>
  But before that, Yeung said officials want to bring something different for the two-day triathlon trial races starting from March 1.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the past, such events would take place along the harbourfront. But this time, besides having the cycling and running there, a segment of the track will be inside the space for events at the Central Harbourfront," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There will also be stands for the spectators, and other areas for them, so they can be more comfortable, and get a close-up view of the athletes."
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeung said officials would also put up a giant screen in Central for a better viewing experience.

    Hospital doctors to use AI for medical reports

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Public hospital doctors will start using generative AI to help them draft medical reports from next month.
 <br>
  <br>
  The technology will be used to summarise a patient's clinical data, including lab results, the Hospital Authority said on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The authority's chief executive, Tony Ko, said the introduction of AI is to save doctors time when preparing their reports.
  <br>
  <br>
  “All the reports have to be finally checked and authorised by the doctor himself, so the doctors will be responsible for the accuracy of the report that truly reflects his or her decision in terms of what the content is to be included in the report,” Ko said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The authority said it will first test the system at Caritas Medical Centre, Princess Margaret Hospital, Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Tin Shui Wai Hospital, Tseung Kwan O Hospital and United Christian Hospital.
  <br>
  <br>
  The authority also said that patients will soon be able to get copies of their medical reports via its HA Go app.

    Officials urged to let vacant public flats quicker

<div class="itemFullText">
 The city's Ombudsman has urged housing authorities to speed up the turnover of recovered public rental flats, such as by shortening the period between taking back a home and issuing a refurbishment order.
 <br>
  <br>
  A probe by the watchdog revealed that it normally took around two and a half months for a home taken back by the Housing Department to be ready for its next tenants to move in, and nearly three months when the Housing Society carries out the process.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The procedures for the recovery of flats by the Housing Department and the Housing Society, and their arrangements for refurbishment and reallocation of recovered flats need further revamping, to speed up turnover of public housing flats and ensure optimal utilisation of precious public housing resources," Ombudsman Jack Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the past five years, the Housing Department has recovered 15,700 public housing flats annually on average. The Housing Society, meanwhile, took back around 1,100 units each year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities have taken steps to expedite the refurbishment of recovered flats since the watchdog launched an investigation last year, Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted that the Housing Department would issue a refurbishment works order within three days of a public housing tenant moving out, while the Housing Society set the period to within two weeks.
  <br>
  <br>
  The watchdog said in its report that the two-week period "might raise doubts among members of the public as to whether it is reasonable".
  <br>
  <br>
  "[The Housing Society] could bring forward the time for notifying the contractors to start work in the estate," Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the Housing Department over the past five years managed to refurbish each recovered flat in 43 days, which is in line with its target.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ninety percent of renovations of homes recovered by the Housing Society met the completion target of 60 days, but Chan said the body should carry out a "comprehensive review" to cut down the refurbishment period.
  <br>
  <br>
  In response, the Housing Department pledged to review and study the recommendations in detail to allocate public housing flats to those in need as soon as possible.
  <br>
  <br>
  The department also noted that it has previously looked into introducing measures such as making sure public housing applicants can move in once the refurbishment of their new home is completed.

    Legco gives green light to lower Tai Lam Tunnel tolls

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lawmakers on Thursday approved plans for lower toll fees at the Tai Lam Tunnel when it comes under government control at the end of May.
 <br>
  <br>
  Instead of the present fixed toll of HK$58, private vehicles will be charged HK$45 during peak hours, HK$30 during regular periods, and HK$18 at quiet times.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tolls for commercial vehicles such as trucks and buses will fall from as high as HK$79 to HK$43 at any time of day, while taxis will be charged HK$28 – less than half the current HK$58 fee.
  <br>
  <br>
  Roundtable lawmaker Michael Tien had proposed making the tunnel free for private cars, motorbikes and commercial vehicles during non-peak hours, but this was rejected by the council, with concerns raised about lost revenue.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tunnel, which stretches between Ting Kau and Yuen Long, is currently owned by a subsidiary of Sun Hung Kai Properties. Its 30-year franchise began in 1995.

 A transport expert on Thursday said competition between the taxi industry and other ride-hailing services will heat up, after cabbies called off a five-day strike to give authorities more time to carry out enforcement action.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong Tele-call Taxi Association had earlier threatened five days of industrial action from March 5, saying their business was seriously hurt by their unlicensed rivals.
  <br>
  <br>
  The association's chairman, Wong Yu-ting, apologised after a meeting with transport officials for causing "unease" to the public.
  <br>
  <br>
  Professor Timothy Hau from the University of Hong Kong's Business School told
  <a href="https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/news-programmes/this-episode.htm?cmsid=77" target="_blank">
   RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme
  </a>
  that the taxi drivers' “extreme" and "counterproductive” measures had angered the public.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[These measures] just make people madder and upset with them and dissatisfied with their services, which I must say is really getting increasingly worse."
  <br>
  <br>
  Hau noted that there are more players entering the ride-hailing market.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With Gaode entering the picture, and Tada more recently, we have a situation in which the government announced that within a year, they're going to regulate ride-hailing services...and so during this period, a lot of companies will come in and get their foot in the door,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “They would want to ensure that they have a place once all the regulatory policies are issued…It’s going to be a fairly crowded market,” Hau added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The taxi industry has said the government would submit a legislative proposal within this year to regulate ride hailing platforms.
  <br>
  <br>
  They also expressed the hope that authorities would require ride-hailing service providers to attend professional training beforehand, and have their vehicles undergo inspections annually.

 Police on Wednesday said they intercepted eight private cars in a citywide undercover operation targeting illegal ride-hailing services.
 <br>
  <br>
  The eight drivers, aged between 36 and 63, were suspected of using their cars for illegal hire or reward.
  <br>
  <br>
  Three vehicles were seized for further investigation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Police will continue to deploy manpower based on operational priorities to combat illegal vehicle hire or reward activities," said Cheng Ho-ming, a senior inspector with the force.
  <br>
  <br>
  The officer did not reveal whether the eight drivers were arrested, and which ride-hailing platforms were involved.

 A Beijing commerce official on Wednesday pledged further support for Hong Kong under the Mainland and Hong Kong Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement (CEPA), the city's free-trade deal with the mainland.
 <br>
  <br>
  Fan Shijie, the director-general of the Commerce Ministry's Department of Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau Affairs, told a forum that the central government is committed to backing the city's economic development.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will, under the CEPA framework, continue to promote opening up and cooperation with Hong Kong, and support Hong Kong to better integrate into national development," Fan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will support different departments in implementing preferential measures under CEPA, and will continue to strengthen opening up and cooperation under the agreement to support investors in Hong Kong and around the world to enter the mainland via Hong Kong."
  <br>
  <br>
  An agreement signed last year between the two sides to amend the framework on trade in services under CEPA will come into effect next month. Changes include removing or loosening restrictions on equity shareholding and business scope across the border.
  <br>
  <br>
  Maggie Wong, Hong Kong's permanent secretary for commerce and economic development, said the changes are beneficial to sectors such as financial services, telecommunications, and tourism.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The SAR government will make the trade make good use of a number of preferential measures, and will continue to seek to jointly promote a higher level of opening up and closer economic and trade cooperation with the mainland on the basis of CEPA, so as to maximise the space of development for the trade on the mainland," Wong said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The administration must take measures to defend free trade amid challenges posed by unilateralism and protectionism, the official added.

 The Polytechnic University of Hong Kong (PolyU) is willing to stand with the government amid potential funding cuts, the institution's council head said on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Education officials earlier said the University Grants Committee will adjust funding for the territory’s eight universities due to a significant government deficit.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lam Tai-fai, chairman of PolyU’s council, told a media gathering that such cuts would definitely affect the university, and the institution is looking at ways to reduce expenditure.
  <br>
  <br>
  That said, he stressed the university will continue to push ahead with its development plans and recruitment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, PolyU's president, Jin-Guang Teng, said the university is working on a proposal to set up Hong Kong's third medical school.
  <br>
  <br>
  The university has many years of experience in offering medical-related courses with hundreds and thousands of graduates, Teng said, adding that he believes PolyU has what it takes to establish a medical school.
