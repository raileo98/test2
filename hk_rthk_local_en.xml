<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police commissioner Raymond Siu on Saturday said cracking down on triads and violent crimes are some of his top priorities.
 <br>
  <br>
  Siu made the comments following the Police College's passing-out parade, where reporters asked him about two men who were attacked by a group of knife-wielding men outside a Yuen Long industrial building in the early hours of Wednesday, leaving one dead and another injured.
  <br>
  <br>
  The commissioner said there were a total of 3,313 assault cases in the first eleven months of last year, down from the same period in the previous year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are focusing on these violent cases, and we will spare no effort. In addition to our intelligence collection to cracking down on their illegal activities, we will also use other means, such as cutting off their financial resources," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We also have many intelligence-led operations. In the past, our arrest rate for triad-related crimes was actually close to 40 percent. It is up to us to take the initiative to carry out operations to attack them."
  <br>
  <br>
  Siu also said that the police adopts a zero-tolerance policy towards any illegal or disciplinary violations and will handle such cases seriously.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was referring to the case where police arrested 12 people, including seven officers, on suspicion of money laundering, involving about HK$10.5 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will definitely deal with any colleague who violates laws and discipline. On the other hand, we have many colleagues. Colleagues who violate laws only account for a very small part of the entire police force," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Of course, we think even one case is too many but I hope everyone understands that we maintain public order and prevent and combat crime in the Hong Kong Police Force. Most of our colleagues work very hard, and our low crime rate today is also the result of our colleagues’ hard work."
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Siu said the police force is steadily increasing in size, with the number of applications rising by 46 percent in the current fiscal year, compared to the one before.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said various measures are being implemented, including a recruitment fast-track process at overseas universities.

    Remaining land sales 'to top HK$4bn'- minister

<img alt="Bernadette Linn said she's confident that revenues from land sales in the next two months will top HK$4 billion. Photo: Commercial Radio" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1789094_2_20250125115027.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Development Secretary said on Saturday that she's confident that revenues from land sales in the next two months will top HK$4 billion, but the full year figure might still fall short of the government's original projection in last year's budget forecast.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a radio programme, Bernadette Linn noted that a land parcel in Tai Wai had attracted a significant number of bids on Friday. The government has several land sales scheduled between now and the end of the fiscal year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I believe that the final number will be higher than the number just mentioned, but it may not reach the original estimate of more than HK$30 billion," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think that at this time our real estate market hasn't fully recovered, so that's understandable. It takes time for the market to warm up."
  <br>
  <br>
  She noted that the last budget had projected average annual expenditure of about HK$90 billion on public works projects over the next four years.
  <br>
  <br>
  The development secretary said work is proceeding on these projects, including the Northern Metropolis project, which she believes can meet existing benchmarks.
  <br>
  <br>
  She also said some Northern Metropolis projects are already under construction, and others have entered the planning process, stressing that these works were huge in scale, and would take years to complete.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said the New Territories North New Town will be carried out in phases.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the past, people often heard about new development areas like the Kwu Tung North New Development Area, which is just a few hundred hectares. The entire San Tin Technopole is about 600 hectares. Thus, the development of over 1,000 hectares has to be carried out in phases," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In this case, we'll prioritize about 200 hectares within that area. It will include industrial parks, private housing, and part of a university town. We hope to finalize discussions here so we can start the statutory process early and begin construction in 2028."
  <br>
  <br>
  Linn added that the authorities will adjust the pace of some projects, to ensure that the government's cash flow is managed effectively, such as waterfront beautification and park facilities.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, she noted that the Kau Yi Chau Artifical Islands project has not been abandoned, but time constraints mean it's uncertain whether reclamation work can begin under the current administration.

    Largest Kai Tak drill yet meets expectations: minister

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Transport Secretary Mable Chan said on Saturday that it took just 45 minutes to process spectators after a test event at the Kai Tak Sports Park.
 <br>
  <br>
  The largest drill to date involved some 63,000 people, and was held on Friday evening at three venues at the park.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on an RTHK radio programme, Chan said extra MTR train services had been laid on and ten extra bus routes were arranged to carry 7,300 passengers, which was higher than expected.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Two franchised bus operators arranged the ten special routes... We hope these routes can be used to carry passengers when large-scale events are organised in the future. So it would be similar to the arrangements at the Hong Kong Coliseum and the Hong Kong Stadium," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, Chan said Greater Bay Airlines had let passengers and the government down, after it cancelled more than 100 flights for February and March, blaming factors like delayed aircraft deliveries and inspection requirements. She said it's been asked to submit a report on the problems.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan also said she hoped it's better prepared to deal with increased traffic expected over the Lunar New Year and Easter holidays.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Secretary for Security, Chris Tang, said that a Hong Kong resident who was detained in Myanmar and forced to carry out illegal work will return to the SAR on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  A government task force has been in Thailand investigating reports that a number of Hongkongers had been lured to Southeast Asian countries and held against their will.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a radio programme, Tang said the 29-year-old man had been rescued and taken to Thailand, and was in good shape mentally and physically.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister said the man will return to the city, accompanied by members of the task force.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the government would do its utmost to rescue the remaining ten Hong Kong residents being detained in the region, noting that civil conflicts present challenges to the task force members.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In fact, I have been seeing the Myanmar consulate and also the Cambodian consulate in Hong Kong to discuss how to have the safe return of our Hong Kong people," Tang said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said all parties were committed to doing their utmost to ensure the safe return of the Hong Kong residents.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tang also thanked the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for its support and assistance, allowing the man to reunite with his family before the Lunar New Year.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government said the largest drill to date was successfully held at Kai Tak Sports Park on Friday evening, involving some 63,000 people.
 <br>
  <br>
  Most of the participants were government workers or people from community groups.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two-hour drills were held at three venues -- the main stadium, the Kai Tak Arena and the youth sports ground, as officials tested out arrangements with the first two having capacity crowds.
  <br>
  <br>
  At the 50,000-seater main stadium, bands from the disciplined forces put on a concert, as different scenarios, including simulated security issues, were tested.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials carried out evacuation drills as well as having spectators leave in a regular manner at the other two venues.
  <br>
  <br>
  A number of senior officials, including Chief Secretary for Administration Eric Chan, culture, sports and tourism minister Rosanna Law and civil service chief Ingrid Yeung were on hand to observe the proceedings.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said the park is scheduled to open sometime in March, but added reports saying that March 1 is the official opening day might be premature.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Because we have many stress tests in the future - we have two large-scale stress tests [next month], so up to now, depending on the results of the tests, I think we cannot confirm the opening date," he told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  As part of the tests, all participants left the venues at around the same time as they picked their own mode of transport.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities recorded crowd control and transport data for analysis.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan added the scheduling of events in future should ensure that a capacity crowd at the three venues would not leave the park at the same time.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he said authorities mapped out worst-case scenarios to train up the ability of different parties to react to emergencies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Several participants told RTHK they were happy with the experience, saying signs giving directions were good and the sound system was solid.

 Two men were charged on Friday with murdering a man in Yuen Long in the early hours of Wednesday, as well as wounding another.
 <br>
  <br>
  Police said the pair, 19 and 27, are due to appear in Fanling Court on Saturday. The 27-year-old suspect also faces a charge of possessing dangerous drugs.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two defendants were among six men arrested so far over the death of the 24-year-old man.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officers said two suspects, 23 and 26, were arrested in Tin Shui Wai on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The incident took place outside an industrial building on Wang Yip Street West, when two men were attacked by a group of knife-wielding men.
  <br>
  <br>
  One of them died and the other was conscious when he was taken to hospital.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Licensed billiard establishments that meet specific criteria can apply to let people as young as eight years old enter these premises, as a means of promoting the sport's development in Hong Kong, said the Leisure and Cultural Services Department (LCSD).
 <br>
  <br>
  Currently, only those aged 16 or above are allowed entry.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other relaxations include allowing young patrons to stay until 11pm, compared with 8pm right now, and they could enter as early as 7am.
  <br>
  <br>
  Those in school uniforms will also be permitted to enter.
  <br>
  <br>
  The department said licensed billiard establishments hoping to accept younger patrons can make applications from February 25.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vincent Law, chairman of the Billiard Sports Council of Hong Kong China (HKBSCC), said he hopes the department can clearly lay out the specific requirements that billiard halls need to take.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The details of the requirements are yet to be announced, but according to my understanding, you have to have certain security facilities implemented in the premises, for example, maybe CCTV. Also you need certain tools and facilities which are suitable for use by children," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "During some sessions, such as training sessions and tournaments, there needs to be some coach who is qualified to coach billiard sports."
  <br>
  <br>
  Law also said that he hopes to see all restrictions removed in the long run.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is only a first step because I think the ultimate objective is to completely remove all restrictions on billiard establishments because we are just like any other sports venue," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Why should there be a restriction on the age of the person who uses the facilities?"
  <br>
  <br>
  He added he hopes to see the LCSD promote the scheme to the around 50 currently licensed billiard halls, noting that establishment owners will have to assess the administrative work and costs before considering to apply.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Health officials said on Friday that they could not rule out that beetroot salad contaminated with a bacterium served on board was responsible for the suspected food poisoning suffered by dozens of passengers of two Cathay Pacific flights arriving from Nepal this month.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) said its investigation found that 43 passengers, aged between 11 and 75, developed food poisoning symptoms such as vomiting, nausea, abdominal pain and diarrhoea, about 10 to 60 minutes after having meals on the CX640 flights from Kathmandul on January 8 and 9.
  <br>
  <br>
  None of the passengers had to be taken to hospital, the CHP said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Stool samples from two patients tested positive for Staphylococcus aureus. The overall clinical symptoms and incubation period of the affected persons were compatible with food poisoning caused by Staphylococcus aureus," the centre said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  It added that the beetroot salad was the only food served on board that was likely to have caused such poisoning, from a statistical standpoint.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, tests on samples taken from the aircraft showed the level of Staphylococcus aureus in the salad did not exceed food safety standards.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CHP said the food was supplied exclusively to Cathay for its flights from Kathmandu since the start of the month and the factory concerned was later asked to stop providing it. Inspections of the factory found the way the food was being handled might have increased the risk of contamination.
  <br>
  <br>
  In response, Cathay acknowledged the findings but stressed that no signs of contamination were found in the samples it checked in its own lab.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Cathay Pacific confirms that this salad is not served on any of our other flights. Aside from these two cases, there have not been any similar instances of customers experiencing symptoms of suspected food poisoning on any of our recent flights," it said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The airline apologised again to passengers affected and added that it has reinforced food-handling processes and staff training on hygiene.

 Home prices fell 7.1 percent in 2024, official figures showed on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  It was the third year in a row of declining prices, which have dropped 27 percent since the start of 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eddie Kwok, executive director of CBRE Hong Kong’s valuation and advisory services, said price increases could be on the cards after Lunar New Year and the financial secretary's budget speech next month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kwok said major banks have lowered their prime rates since the US Federal Reserve's interest rate cut last September and since then prices have been stabilising.
  <br>
  <br>
  Martin Wong, head of research and consultancy for Greater China at Knight Frank, said prices could rebound by up to five percent this year, with most of the increase likely to come in the second half.
  <br>
  <br>
  Figures from the Rating and Valuation Department also showed that prices fell 0.7 percent in December from the month before, ending a two-month increase.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A worker died after falling to the ground at a construction site on Tsung Tau Ha Road in Fo Tan.
 <br>
  <br>
  Police said they received a report at around 1pm on Friday that a man fell from a height of between three and four metres.
  <br>
  <br>
  Emergency personnel were called to scene where the man was certified dead.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Labour Department said officers were sent to investigate the cause of the incident.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chiu Kin-keung, the vice chairman of the Hong Kong Construction Industry Employees General Union, said the deceased welding worker was on a spider lift platform before the fall.
  <br>
  <br>
  He believed that a fractured steel beam struck the platform, causing it and the worker to fall.
  <br>
  <br>
  The worker had his safety harness attached to the platform but that also broke, Chiu said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the Association for the Rights of Industrial Accident Victims said it would be providing support to the family of the man killed.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said the accident marked at least the 10th fatal fall since the beginning of last year.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Federation of Trade Unions (FTU) on Friday urged the government to step up efforts to promote Hong Kong’s tourist spots and nurture more talent in the sector.
 <br>
  <br>
  At a press conference, the party called for more religious and architectural tours to showcase the city's beauty beyond Victoria Harbour.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Apart from the traditional shopping theme that we are quite well-recognised in the international arena, we would also like international tourists to know about how Hong Kong is naturally beautiful," said FTU lawmaker Joephy Chan.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Apart from Victoria Harbour, of course, there are also different sea views that you can have in Hong Kong. We need to further elaborate on that on different social [media] platforms as well."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan suggested journeys to temples, mosques and landmarks such as Sun Yat Sen Memorial Park to promote religious diversity and peace education.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another FTU lawmaker, Dennis Leung, highlighted the need for more training for tour guides and the recruitment of retirees into the role.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Because we have some sites in New Territories where the younger generation do not understand the history, so we hope that the government can gather all the village inhabitants or some retired people to help to promote tourism, to act as a guide to help the visitors to know more about the culture in this visiting site," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The party also urged officials to improve accessibility to tourist spots by adding more bus routes.

    Tourists want to see pandas all over Hong Kong: DAB

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 DAB lawmakers on Friday said each district should have panda-themed events and decorations to encourage tourists to explore different places across Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  The party said it has submitted various suggestions to the government's Working Group on Developing Tourist Hotspots, which was established last year to come up with ways to revitalise the tourism industry.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lawmaker Vincent Cheng said Hong Kong should promote the concept of "panda is everywhere" on top of "tourism is everywhere".
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's definitely a good chance for businesses to have a showcase everywhere, in different districts," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A lot of visitors, they're not only visiting the places, they also would like to see panda decorations everywhere in Hong Kong. We can also dress them up. Like in Sham Shui Po, they can dress up like a Sham Shui Po special edition for the panda as well."
  <br>
  <br>
  Other suggestions the party made included a walking tour in Central and Western for tourists to visit temples and taste food and drink, including sugarcane juice and dim sum.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the legislators urged the authorities to set up a one-stop platform to enable event organisers to reach out to different government departments in a more simple way.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Friday said the city's financial system remains robust, despite intensified geopolitical risks causing greater volatility in regional and global markets.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chan made the remark during a discussion on "stemming financial fragmentation", at the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting in Davos.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also said Hong Kong "steadfastly" upholds the linked exchange rate system, or the currency peg, and that recent surveys showed global investors were optimistic about the SAR's business outlook.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan added that the city has undergone significant transformations in the stock markets, wealth management and digital asset sectors, as he also stressed that China's economy is steadily growing and achieving high-quality development.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, the finance minister continued to promote green finance projects, as well as "impact investments", or funds aimed at generating social or environmental effects.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan held talks on trade with some of his global counterparts, including the investment minister of Saudi Arabia, Khalid Al-Falih, and the finance chief of Egypt, Ahmed Kouchouk. Chan invited the ministers to visit the SAR as part of efforts to deepen ties with the Global South.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also met Jenny Johnson, CEO of investment firm Franklin Templeton, to discuss how to expand the company's business in the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan is due to return to Hong Kong on Saturday.

 A Hong Kong woman on holiday in Japan has died after being hit by a train.
 <br>
  <br>
  Japanese media reports said the woman, 61, was standing on tracks near Otaru, Hokkaido on Thursday and was taking photos of the sea when she was struck by the train.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kyodo News Agency cited police as saying the woman's husband was standing nearby at the time but was not injured.
  <br>
  <br>
  The accident caused the suspension of almost 20 train services, including some to the region's main airport, railway officials said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Chinese Consulate in Sapporo and the Immigration Department in Hong Kong both said they were ready to help the woman's family if assistance was required.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Consumer Council has called on travel agencies to be flexible in refunding passengers affected by the cancellation of flights at Greater Bay Airlines.
 <br>
  <br>
  The low-cost carrier earlier announced the cancellation of 128 flights in February and March, while stressing that Lunar New Year services won't be affected.
  <br>
  <br>
  The consumer watchdog had received six complaints as of Thursday night, involving about HK$14,000 in total.
  <br>
  <br>
  Its chief executive Gilly Wong told an RTHK radio programme on Friday that travel agencies should maintain close contact with the airline to offer refunds to passengers as soon as possible.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In principle, they (agencies) should only arrange a refund after receiving the money [from the airline]. But they can exercise discretion and compassion when handling individual cases," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong pointed out that some agencies had told passengers it could take months for them to get their money back, but said in some cases the refund should arrive earlier.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If they only stick to the rulebook, that leads to customer dissatisfaction and complaints. It's not an ideal approach in terms of their reputation."
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong also said Greater Bay Airlines should not impose surcharges for passengers opting for other destinations.
  <br>
  <br>
  She added that the airline should offer updates and reach out to consumers quickly.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The SAR government on Thursday said it condemns and strongly disapproves of a recent meeting between UK officials and national security suspects wanted by Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  British Foreign Secretary David Lammy and Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State Catherine West earlier met with four Hong Kong fugitives based in the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, the SAR government expressed its strong disapproval and condemnation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Endangering national security is a very serious crime. No country will watch with folded arms the acts and activities that endanger national security. Those persons who have fled overseas are suspected of continuing to commit offences under the Hong Kong National Security Law,” a government spokesperson said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The UK Government has ignored the malicious acts of those wanted persons, which showcases the hypocrisy with double standards."
  <br>
  <br>
  The spokesperson stressed that SAR law enforcement agencies will exhaust all means to pursue the fugitives, and called on the UK to stop interfering in Hong Kong matters which are purely China's internal affairs.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Thursday said they have arrested four men for their alleged involvement in a murder case in Yuen Long.
 <br>
  <br>
  A man died and another was hurt on Wednesday, after they were attacked by a group of knife-wielding men when they were leaving an industrial building on Wang Yip Street West.
  <br>
  <br>
  Acting Senior Superintendent Tang Yick-kay said two of the arrestees had tried to escape to Thailand.
  <br>

  “The police learned that the two, aged 20 and 21, had flown to Bangkok on Wednesday. We quickly alerted the Thai authorities through our cooperation channels. The two men were subsequently denied entry at Bangkok airport and were sent back to Hong Kong on a flight,” he said, adding that the pair was arrested upon their arrival.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officers made one more arrest at the Hong Kong International Airport; while the fourth man was taken from a Tuen Mun flat, where suspected space oil drugs were also found.
  <br>
  <br>
  The four people arrested, aged 20 to 29, are said to have ties to a triad and are being held for questioning.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police said they are still tracking down on other suspects, and urged members of the public to come forward with information.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Senior Counsel Jose-Antonio Maurellet has been elected the new chairman of the Bar Association, succeeding the outgoing Victor Dawes.
 <br>
  <br>
  Senior Counsels Martin Hui and Eva Sit, meanwhile, were chosen as vice-chairmen.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters after the election on Thursday evening, Maurellet said the association will continue to defend the rule of law and judicial independence.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that the professional body will adhere to the highest standards of professional conduct, discipline and etiquette.
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted that while there are calls for Hong Kong to focus on developing the economy this year, he stressed the rule of law and economic development go hand in hand to ensure the long-term prosperity and stability of the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  Maurellet also expressed hope that more overseas non-permanent judges can be appointed to the city’s top court.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Obviously we would welcome the appointment of further such experienced jurists to our court. We believe that it strengthens Hong Kong as a jurisdiction and is also supported by members of the public,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Maurellet was appointed as Senior Counsel in 2016, and had served as vice chairman for the Bar Association for six years.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The opening of a new harbourfront walkway in North Point will create shared spaces for Hongkongers with stunning views of Victoria Harbour, officials said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The East Coast boardwalk - built under the Island Eastern Corridor - spans 2.2 kilometres in total.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 1.1-kilometre section from Fortress Hill to North Point will open to the public on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Acting Financial Secretary Michael Wong said the government hopes to open the eastern section by the end of this year, adding efforts are underway to make the harbour more accessible.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ivan Ho, chairman of the Harbourfront Commission, said there’s a shared space for pedestrians, joggers, cyclists and pet owners.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We have a shared path which allows people to cycle, walk dogs and jog, so basically we are encouraging people to use our boardwalk together in a harmonious way,” Ho said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We also created what we call a pocket space, which allow children to play around, allow some small-scale function or activity.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Movable bridges have also been installed to allow vessels access to the inner waters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho said construction has not been easy with height restrictions and machinery constraints, and officials have tried to minimise disturbance to nearby residents.

    Snakes and pandas galore as LNY fairs open

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lunar New Year fairs kicked off at 15 sites across Hong Kong on Thursday, with many a panda-themed product among the array of goods, flowers and fast food on offer.
 <br>
  <br>
  Snakes were also spotted rearing their heads among the goodies, what with the Year of the Snake about to get underway.
  <br>
  <br>
  Students were running some of the stalls at Victoria Park – home to the city's biggest fair – hoping to put their newly acquired business management skills and sales techniques into practice.
  <br>
  <br>
  A flower-seller said she has been a regular at the fair for two decades and isn't worried that a sluggish economy and people heading elsewhere to spend will put a dent in her sales.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Lunar New Year is just once a year, for good fortune, people will buy and put them at home like they always do," the woman told RTHK, adding that she has a loyal customer base for her oranges.
  <br>
  <br>
  A woman shopping with her children was delighted with the atmosphere at the fair.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This year, I think there are more people than in previous years. Perhaps it's because during Covid, only flowers were sold at the fairs. Now with more dry goods, everyone's happier, the children are happier," she told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  Customs officers are also planning to attend the fairs, with flyers and souvenirs to be handed out to remind people the importance of respecting copyright law.
  <br>
  <br>
  Divisional Commander Ho Chun-wing said officers on patrol will take immediate action if they find anything suspicious.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong people do like goods with popular models. So we will put a lot of effort into targeting those goods with suspected counterfeiting trademarks and copyright," he told RTHK.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's privacy watchdog on Thursday said the number of data breach incidents in the city increased by 30 percent last year.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data received more than 200 data breach reports last year, in which 30 percent of them involved hacking and 25 percent involved the loss of documents or portable devices.
  <br>
  <br>
  Privacy Commissioner Ada Chung said the value of personal data has increased with the rapid development of digitalisation, and she expects the trend to continue.
  <br>
  <br>
  The office conducted a review of the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance and made suggestions which included the mandatory notification of data breaches, a complete review of the penalty levels outlined in the ordinance and also empowering the Privacy Commissioner to hand down administrative fines.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the level of penalty administered, Chung said her office would take Hong Kong's economic situation into account and make reference to similar legislation in other jurisdictions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the process of consultation, we have received feedback saying that, for example, small and medium enterprises, they are concerned about the effect of all these penalties on their business environment and their compliance costs," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I believe that the government and my office would take all these concerns into account in formulating the concrete details."

<div class="itemFullText">
 Cathay Pacific says it will give its staff bonuses worth at least a month's pay following positive financial results in the past year.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a letter to employees, CEO Ronald Lam said the final level will be announced alongside the company's annual financial postings in mid-March.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm pleased to share that we will be distributing at least four weeks of eligible pay this year," Lam said on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also told staff that the company successfully completed its rebuilding journey last year, allowing flights to return to 100 percent of pre-Covid levels this month.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our strong financial performance for two years in a row also made it possible for us to commit more than HK$100 billion investments into further elevating our customers' experience in the future," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lam vowed to work towards Cathay's vision of "becoming one of the world's greatest service brands".
  <br>
  <br>
  The company's four lines of business, namely Cathay Pacific, Cathay Cargo, Cathay Lifestyle and HK Express, have formulated robust plans to serve customers and deliver great profitability, Lam added.

 Cathay Pacific has apologised to customers after technical issues temporarily disrupted a number of services, including flight bookings and online check-in.
 <br>
  <br>
  The services affected started returning to normal after 2pm on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Various services online and at self check-in kiosks were unavailable "due to a system issue", according to the flagship carrier.
  <br>
  <br>
  Airport check-in counters were not affected and Cathay's flight operations remained normal.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We apologise to our customers for the inconvenience caused and are grateful for their patience," the airline said.
  <br>
  <br>
  It had earlier advised passengers to arrive at the airport at least three hours before departure to allow sufficient time to complete check-in formalities.

<img alt="Privacy Commissioner Ada Chung said about 550,000 subjects were potentially affected. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1788806_1_20250123130332.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data on Thursday said outdated firewalls and ineffective detection measures led to the data breach incident at Oxfam Hong Kong last year.
 <br>
  <br>
  In July, the organisation suffered a ransomware attack, affecting its information systems and resulting in file encryption and data exfiltration.
  <br>
  <br>
  The privacy watchdog’s investigation revealed that over 330 GB of data was exfiltrated from Oxfam’s systems, potentially affecting about 550,000 subjects.
  <br>
  <br>
  The leaked data included identity card and passport copies, credit card and bank account numbers of Oxfam staff members, donors, job applicants and governance members.
  <br>
  <br>
  Privacy Commissioner Ada Chung said Oxfam had not updated its firewalls since 2023, and it failed to take any action despite multiple detections of suspicious activities prior to the incident.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It is a very regrettable situation, because basically we found that the data security measures adopted by Oxfam before the incident were neither adequate nor effective,” Chung said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “That was why it was relatively easy for the hacker to gain access into Oxfam’s system, because basically the firewalls were outdated, and some of the servers had significant vulnerabilities as well.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Chung added Oxfam retained some personal data for a period longer than necessary, including multiple items being held for over seven years.
  <br>
  <br>
  The watchdog said it served an enforcement notice on Oxfam, as it contravened the data protection principle, in which the organisation will have to take measures to prevent similar contraventions in the future.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump's incoming policies are casting a shadow over business confidence among small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the city, an economist said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Kelvin Lau, a senior economist at Standard Chartered Bank, said Washington has contributed to global economic uncertainties.
  <br>
  <br>
  "One of the biggest uncertainties recently is the retrenchment of US rate cut expectations. Secondly, it's the uncertainty around Trump's tariffs, how fast and how far he would take them higher," Lau said.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to the results of a Productivity Council survey, the Standard Chartered Hong Kong SME Leading Business Index fell to 42.8 in the January-to-March period, down 2.9 points from the previous three months. Figures below 50 indicate a negative outlook, while those above 50 show a positive one.
  <br>
  <br>
  The drop indicated the overall business confidence of local SMEs "has become more conservative under the uncertain global economic outlook", the council said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Of the more than 800 local firms polled, around 38 percent said the US presidential transition had affected their business confidence.
  <br>
  <br>
  They cited potential tariffs and changes in the economic environment as primary factors. Trump had warned of imposing a 10 percent duty on Chinese imports as soon as February 1.
  <br>
  <br>
  “A lot of things are less to do with local issues, but more to do with external issues. But then the downside is, because it's external, there are a very few things that we can actually control about it," Lau said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We're just hoping that we can also benefit from more policy easing from the US and from China as well. Hopefully the achievement of a global soft landing will help Hong Kong maintain a modest pace of recovery."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lau added that the first round of potential tariffs would be "in line with market expectations", and further hikes, which might not come until 2026, would bring more certainty to enterprises.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Transport and Logistics Mable Chan on Thursday said there's room for improvement in the performance of Greater Bay Airlines which has announced the cancellation of 128 flights in February and March.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a media gathering, Chan said the airline could have done better with flight arrangements.
  <br>
  <br>
  The transport minister also said the government will try to help the company, which faces operational difficulties, as much as possible, but that officials won't give special treatment to individual firms.
  <br>
  <br>
  She added that the carrier should minimise the inconvenience caused, and rebuild confidence among passengers.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CEO of Greater Bay Airlines said Lunar New Year services will not be affected.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liza Ng apologised on a Commercial Radio programme for the flight cancellations, blamed on a delay in the arrival of new aircraft and planned inspections of planes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ng admitted that the airline could have done better at informing those customers affected.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Because we notified all 5,500 passengers about the cancellations at the same time, by doing so, they will definitely be nervous as it will affect their trip," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When they called us, our staff might not have been able to pick up their calls immediately, making them more anxious. In this case, our customer service didn't handle the incident too well."
  <br>
  <br>
  Ng said the airline has boosted manpower and will look at setting up more communication channels for keeping customers informed of developments.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, an academic who specialises in aviation transport told RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme that it's usual practice for airlines to start selling tickets for flights involving new aircraft that have yet to be delivered.
  <br>
  <br>
  Achim Czerny, a professor at Polytechnic University's department of logistics and maritime studies, said buying new planes is a massive investment and the aircraft must be fully utilised as quickly as possible.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The aircraft deliveries, the airline business is a relatively complex business, and the performance of an airline depends on many players along the supply chain, for instance, aircraft manufacturers," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And that's certainly something that's not entirely under the control of the airline."
  <br>
  <br>
  Tourism sector lawmaker Perry Yiu told RTHK it is crucial that Greater Bay Airlines reviews its flight scheduling, as well as the destinations it flies to.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the airline only has a fleet of eight planes and this means there isn't much flexibility to make temporary adjustments.
  <br>
  <br>
  "After the airline opened new routes, the changes in local environment, political situation, or all kinds of negative news will affect the overall passenger traffic. These are unpredictable," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "To be honest, it's also challenging for the airline, as well as the tourism sector, because a destination that used to be a popular tourist hotspot might have drastic changes."
  <br>
  <br>
  The airline said this week that it is considering ending its flights to Seoul because of an unsatisfactory performance.

 Financial Secretary Paul Chan has met with his counterparts from Qatar and Switzerland in Davos as he continued to promote Hong Kong's competitive edge on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum
 <br>
  <br>
  Chan on Wednesday held talks with Ali bin Ahmed Al-Kuwari, the Qatari finance minister, and Daniela Stoffel, state secretary for international finance of Switzerland.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They exchanged insights on the latest global economic and financial landscapes and discussed ways to enhance co-operation between Hong Kong and both economies in trade, financial services and infrastructure," according to a statement by the SAR government.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan also held bilateral meetings with government officials and business leaders from different countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  He discussed strategies to "prevent a new, non-co-operative normal" with some 70 political and economic leaders, according to the statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The financial secretary also told the founder and executive chairman of the World Economic Forum, Klaus Schwab, that Hong Kong values taking part in the annual forum.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This platform offers an opportunity for Hong Kong to showcase its latest economic and social developments to global leaders, and the city's unique advantages under the 'one country, two systems' principle," the statement read.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Such participation also enables Hong Kong representatives to better understand international trends, exchange views with various economic and sectoral representatives, and present Hong Kong's perspectives."

<div class="itemFullText">
 Guangdong have defended their title at the annual Guangdong-Hong Kong Cup football competition, after beating the SAR on aggregate following a 2-1 win on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The two sides had settled for a 1-1 draw in the first leg in Guangzhou a week ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  The return leg was played at the Hong Kong Stadium in front of thousands of home supporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  The first shot on target for Hong Kong, China came shortly after the kick-off, although Mahama Awal’s attempt from the box was comfortably saved by Guangdong goalkeeper Zhao Shi.
  <br>
  <br>
  But it was Guangdong who struck first, when national team player Behram Abduweli scored with a narrow angle shot in the 31st minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  Things got slightly heated after the goal, as Abduweli celebrated by taking off his shirt in front of the home crowd, triggering some Hong Kong fans to throw things at him.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SAR side later suffered another blow when they had to make an early substitution after Awal got injured. Ma Hei-wai replaced him.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the hosts responded swiftly after half-time as Lau Ka-kiu made a quick run into the box and to score an equaliser.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SAR team continued their attack and created multiple scoring chances, including a one-two play between Ma and Wu Chun-ming that led to a shot by Wu.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xia Dalong put Guangdong ahead again in the 85th minute with a stunning header that caught Hong Kong goalkeeper Ng Wai-him off guard.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SAR squad made a final effort to level the game in stoppage time, but captain Stefan Pereira’s free kick was again denied by the Guangdong goalkeeper.

 Border checkpoints will not operate beyond existing hours during the Lunar New Year period, the government announced on Wednesday.

  <br>
  Last year, Lo Wu and Shenzhen Bay extending their operating hours over the festive period – something that officials decided not to do this time around.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[The government] has given due consideration to the relevant circumstances... and decided, in discussion with relevant mainland authorities, to maintain the existing operating hours of the [border control points] during this year's Chinese New Year holiday. The Lok Ma Chau/Huanggang Port and the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge Port will maintain a 24-hour operation as usual," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The HKSAR government appeals to visitors to plan ahead for their itineraries, and stay overnight after participating in various local celebratory activities for the Chinese New Year to fully enjoy the rich and diverse celebratory activities to be held across various districts in the city and experience Hong Kong's unique city charm."
  <br>
  <br>
  The administration also said around 8.67 million passengers trips in and out of the city are expected to take place over the eight-day Lunar New Year "golden week" holiday, with the majority of travellers passing through land border points.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) on Wednesday said banks have made preparations to deal with any risks posed by potential US trade tariffs and are closely monitoring developments.
 <br>
  <br>
  At a press briefing about the banking sector's performance in 2024, HKMA deputy chief executive Arthur Yuen noted that there's a lack of clarity in terms of US President Donald Trump's trade policies.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Generally speaking, you can expect that if the US imposes tariffs on the rest of the world, then the global trade system will suffer and that would actually also impact on business outlook, " Yuen said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have actually asked our banks to stay on high alert on what's the impact of those, and to make sure the risk-management practices are fully in place for handling whatever is coming their way."

<div class="itemFullText">
 Officials in Thailand on Wednesday stressed that the country remains "a safe destination for all international visitors", following reports of Hong Kong residents being lured to Southeast Asia for illegal work.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Royal Thai Consulate-General in Hong Kong also expressed its deep regret, saying it understands what happened had raised concern about the safety among SAR travellers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I would like to assure that Thailand remains a safe destination for all international visitors since none of the victims are tourists. They were misled by scammers to travel to Thailand to work in high-paying jobs but ended up being escorted across the border to the scam centres," a consulate spokesperson said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ten Hongkongers are believed to still be held captive in the region and forced to work in so-called scam farms.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thai authorities have taken steps to tackle transnational crimes and human trafficking that "will help reassure international tourists and visitors of their safety", the spokesperson added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The measures include addressing misinformation online, ensuring sufficient police deployment in high-risk areas, and introducing a two-level boundary control system along the eastern and western borders across 14 provinces.
  <br>
  <br>
  Senior Thai officials had also met their Chinese and Myanmar counterparts in Kunming and "reached positive consensus on eradicating the scam centres in Myanmar", the statement said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, the Thai government posted an AI-generated video of its prime minister speaking in Mandarin, encouraging Chinese tourists to visit the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the clip posted to the government's Facebook page, a likeness of Paetongtarn Shinawatra appeared to speak in fluent Mandarin, a language that the prime minister does not speak in real life.
  <br>
  <br>
  The character emphasised at the start of the video that it had been made with AI.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I understand that recent reports of Chinese nationals being lured to scam compounds around Thailand's borders have triggered concerns among Chinese tourists... Thailand's government puts the safety of all tourists as its utmost priority," the AI Paetongtarn said.

    Govt urged to speed up ban on flavoured tobacco

<img alt="COSH and HKU researchers found that nearly half of surveyed smokers use flavoured cigarettes. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1788690_1_20250122172324.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Council on Smoking and Health (COSH) on Wednesday called on the government to speed up a ban on flavoured tobacco products, saying they make it harder for smokers to quit.
 <br>
  <br>
  From January to May last year, COSH and the University of Hong Kong polled 5,600 people, of whom 2,600 were smokers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Researchers found that nearly half of smokers used flavoured cigarettes, with around 40 percent of teenagers in the poll moderately to severely addicted.
  <br>
  <br>
  Henry Tong, the council’s chairman, said flavoured cigarettes give a false impression to young people that they are less harmful.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The flavours, which might include mint, strawberry, or even alcohol-tasting flavours, are attractive to young people. They cover up the unpleasant smell and unpleasant feeling caused by traditional cigarettes,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last June, health officials announced plans to ban e-cigarettes, flavoured tobacco and lighting up while in a queue. But there is no timeline for the legislation yet.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tong urged the government to table the amendments to the Legislative Council as soon as possible.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also brushed off the possible impact on the tourism sector and bar industry if the ban takes effect.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Usually the economic impact of tobacco control has been exaggerated. We believe that better tobacco control in Hong Kong would attract more businesses and help the economy,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tong noted that bars and restaurants saw revenues increase by 30 percent within two years after the indoor smoking ban was introduced in 2007.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Director of Fire Services Andy Yeung on Wednesday said fire service installation and equipment inspections at new buildings will be dealt with quicker once a new office opens in March.
 <br>
  <br>
  At a press briefing, he said the One-stop Coordination Office for New Fire Protection Facilities Acceptance is expected to cut the certification process down, from an average 52 days to 35.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also said the Fire Services Department will review licensing procedures in light of potential budget cuts to help address the government's deficit.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The financial secretary is now preparing the budget. As usual, we will use our resources prudently and review the resources allocations, review the workflow, review all the licensing, in particular, the licensing procedure in order to cope with the government's budget cuts," Yeung said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The fire chief also said his department has beefed up inspections of old buildings after a fire in a residential building in Jordan killed five people last April.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We conducted inspections of 1,000 old buildings last year with a relatively higher fire risk after the tragic fire at the New Lucky House. More than 8,661 fire hazard abatement notices were issued during the inspection and over half of these cases were related to smoke stop door irregularities," he said.

    'Data breach fines should not be too high or too low'

<div class="itemFullText">
 The government says it will look at how big the fines should be for companies that breach data protection laws to make sure they are acceptable to firms, while still having a deterrent effect.
 <br>
  <br>
  Plans are in place to empower the Office of the Privacy Commissioner to fine those involved in data leaks, but some firms have expressed worries about being hit with stiff punishments for lapses, pointing to the sluggish economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  During a Legislative Council session on Wednesday, constitutional affairs minister Erick Tsang said the government understands the concerns.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The government is studying on how to appropriately adjust the legislative amendment proposals, e.g. whether to effect the legislative amendments by phases, thereby reducing the possible effect on business sectors; and how to suitably determine the amount of administrative fines, ensuring they are set at an acceptable level while not losing deterrent effect," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tsang told lawmakers there were 217 data breaches last year, a rise of nearly 30 percent from 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Election Committee lawmaker Carmen Kan asked whether the government could introduce a "shared responsibility" system when it comes to scams.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kan said under such a system, various parties such as financial institutions, telecommunication and media firms would have to fork out compensation for scam victims if the companies were deemed to have failed in their responsibilities.
  <br>
  <br>
  In response, financial services undersecretary Joseph Chan said a similar concept of shared responsibility over unauthorised transactions is already covered in existing laws.

    Consumer body 'deeply concerned' over axed flights

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's consumer watchdog has expressed deep concern over Greater Bay Airlines' decision to cancel flights in the coming weeks, after receiving complaints regarding the low-cost carrier.
 <br>
  <br>
  The airline previously announced the cancellation of 128 flights in February and March, affecting around 5,500 passengers to places like Japan, Thailand and South Korea.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Consumer Council said it received two complaints regarding flight delays or changes involving HK$7,964 as of Wednesday noon, and has since contacted the budget carrier to follow up on the incident.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The council calls on airlines to prepare for emergencies in peak seasons, fulfil their service commitments, so as not to hurt the reputation of the air carrier and Hong Kong as an international aviation hub," the watchdog said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Haiyan Song, associate dean of the Polytechnic University's tourism management school, said passengers might think twice in future before booking with the budget carrier.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's understandable from the passengers' perspective. They would be unhappy with this cancellation, because this disrupted their travel plans. In the future, when the passengers travel to the same destinations, they would think twice whether they would book [with] Greater Bay Airlines," he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But if, in the future, the [airline] recovers from this crisis and provides good services, customers will gradually build their confidence in the airline."

    Govt wants flight cancellation report in a week

<div class="itemFullText">
 Transport minister Mable Chan said officials met the senior management of Greater Bay Airlines on Wednesday morning over its cancellation of 128 flights between February and March.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chan said authorities want a detailed report from the firm in around a week.
  <br>
  <br>
  The day before, the airline cited a delay in new aircraft deliveries and statutory safety inspections of existing aircraft as the reason for the cancellations, which will affect 5,500 passengers to places like Japan and South Korea.
  <br>
  <br>
  The budget airline added on Wednesday that negligence in its flight scheduling process was found following an internal review, but flights over the Lunar New Year period would not be affected.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking after attending a Legislative Council meeting, Chan said the government wants a detailed report on matters such as remedial measures in around a week's time, noting the airline had already submitted some initial figures to officials.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Transport and Logistics Bureau and the Civil Aviation Department have already met with senior management of Greater Bay Airlines, to learn more about the way forward," she told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our message is very clear. We told the company that it must protect the rights of affected travellers, and that it must do its best to minimise the effects on passengers through various means."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said aviation authorities meet with airlines regularly, and they require firms to submit regular financial and operational reports to ensure that they are run in a robust manner.
  <br>
  <br>
  She described the existing regulatory regime as comprehensive.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister said Greater Bay Airlines should learn from this experience, noting that it's a growing firm that her bureau wants to help in the process.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan expressed hope the airline could be more flexible in scheduling flights in future, by adding buffers in areas such as manpower and computer systems.

    Tackle PRH abuse through applicant, tenant land search
   </title>

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ombudsman Jack Chan has recommended the Housing Authority (HKHA) and the Housing Society (HKHS) conduct thorough land searches for public rental housing (PRH) applicants before determining their eligibility for allocation.
 <br>
  <br>
  The recommendation was part of a comprehensive set of 31 improvements proposed by the office following its investigation into the government's efforts to combat the abuse of public housing resources.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said alongside screening existing tenants, preventing abuse at the source through rigorous vetting can significantly minimise misuse, adding that a new mechanism can make the process more cost-efficient and task effective.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the past, it cost almost HK$640 for each verification. With the intervention of my office through this investigation, the Housing Authority and the Housing Society have devised a new mechanism by which both organisations will submit these tenants' information or declaration by batches to the Land Registry and use a computerised system to verify the information," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This has significantly reduced the cost for such verification process from HK$640 per case down to HK$4 per case."
  <br>
  <br>
  Other recommendations include developing specific incentive schemes for the staff of property service agents and security contractors to encourage their participation in combating abuse and enhancing communication with mainland and Macau authorities to obtain information about tenants' property ownership in those regions.
  <br>
  <br>
  The watchdog commended the authorities for successfully reclaiming over 7,000 flats over abuse or violations of tenancy agreements, but Chan pointed out that the highest prosecution rate in the past seven years was only 4.2 percent in 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said some tenants were evicted from their units but did not face prosecution for PRH abuse, while the two-year prosecution limit passed for other cases.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said he hopes that authorities will consider extending the prosecution time limit and imposing heavier penalties.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Housing Department (HD) thanked the watchdog for its investigation report, and said they would review and study the recommendations to enhance existing measures and explore new methods to combat abuse.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We just launched the Report Public Housing Abuse Award on January 15, hoping to gather more accurate intelligence on tenancy abuse for taking action. To strengthen the deterrent effect and gradually reduce the abuse of public housing resources, we are also actively exploring amendments to the Housing Ordinance to criminalise the act of serious tenancy abuse, targeting to have the Bills passed in the Legislative Council in mid-2025," a spokesman for the HD said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We hope that capable tenants will surrender their PRH flats so that precious public housing resources can be allocated to those in genuine need, optimising the use of public housing resources."

    Friday to see largest Kai Tak Sports Park stress test

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Motorists are being advised to give Kai Tak a swerve on Friday evening as tens of thousands of people head there for the biggest test event yet at the nearly completed sports park in the area.
 <br>
  <br>
  About 63,000 people are expected to pack the main stadium, the arena and the youth sports ground to capacity.
  <br>
  <br>
  The crowd, most of them civil servants, will be treated to a concert by bands from various disciplined services.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a press briefing on Wednesday, deputy police commissioner Chow Yat-ming said the test will be conducted in three stages between 6pm and 10pm.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The first stage is when participants enter the venues from about 6pm, and the second stage is a test of a simulated emergency evacuation, while the third will be when participants naturally exit the venues," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The test will involve civil servants, government employees, as well as members from different social communities, and we'll test our arrangements on the natural entry and exit of participants, and that for buses and taxis, to make sure that the event will be conducted in a safe manner."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chow said that being as 10 drills have been held at the park since last October, the main purpose this time will be evaluating facilities surrounding the site.
  <br>
  <br>
  Assistant transport commissioner Chow Bing-kay urged people taking part in the drill not to drive to the venue, saying roads in the area will already be busy with rush hour traffic.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other motorists would also do well to avoid Kai Tak if possible, Chow said, adding that extra MTR services will be running, especially between Kai Tak and Sung Wong Toi.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan has called on countries to promote collaboration among public, private and philanthropic sectors so as to encourage private investments in green and transition projects.
 <br>
  <br>
  At the World Economic Forum (WEF) Annual Meeting in Davos, Switzerland, on Tuesday, he joined a breakfast meeting organised by the Giving to Amplify Earth Action launched by the WEF.
  <br>
  <br>
  He pointed out that there was a significant funding gap globally in responding to climate change and highlighted Hong Kong's role as a leading green finance hub in Asia, gathering financial institutions, professional services and talent with relevant expertise.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said the thriving ecosystem of family offices, private equity funds, wealth and asset management was conducive to connecting wealth with climate transition projects.
  <br>
  <br>
  He briefed attendees at a luncheon meeting on Hong Kong's latest economic situation and development strategies, highlighting its collaboration with sister cities in the Greater Bay Area.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan met the Director-General of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), Daren Tang, to exchange views on strengthening cooperation in areas such as intellectual property protection and talent training.
  <br>
  <br>
  The financial secretary also met the United Arab Emirates' foreign trade minister, Thani bin Ahmed Al Zeyoudi, to discuss bilateral cooperation in finance and trade.
  <br>
  <br>
  During his attendance at Davos, Chan has highlighted Hong Kong's unique advantages, such as its role as a "super connector" and "super value-adder" between mainland China and the world, saying this creates opportunities for global businesses and investors.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The executive director of the Travel Industry Council, Fanny Yeung, on Wednesday said Greater Bay Airlines' move to cancel scores of flights in the coming weeks won't have a significant impact, given the city's overall capacity.
 <br>
  <br>
  Around 5,500 passengers are believed to have been affected by the cancellation of 128 flights in February and March.
  <br>
  <br>
  The airline cited a delay in new aircraft delivery and the need for plane inspections for the move, which mostly affects its services to Japan, Thailand and South Korea.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The number of affected passengers is around 5,000 plus, so it's still a very minor share when we compare with the overall flight capacity. So I don't think that will have a significant impact," Yeung told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nevertheless, the company should take steps to avoid a repeat of such issues, Yeung added.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, the low-cost carrier apologised for the cancellations and said it has already contacted customers regarding rebookings and refunds.
  <br>
  <br>
  "An internal review in this matter has been carried out immediately and negligence was found in our flight scheduling process. We have also taken immediate action to tighten up the relevant approval procedure for flight scheduling," the statement said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The airline also said no flights over the Lunar New Year are affected.
  <br>
  <br>
  The carrier added that it is considering dropping its flights to Seoul because of unsatisfactory performance.

 Secretary for Security Chris Tang said a set of guidelines will be introduced in the first quarter of this year, allowing public officers to better understand their responsibilities on safeguarding national security.
 <br>
  <br>
  Last year's Policy Address stated that all government bureaux and departments must review guidelines to ensure compliance with provisions in the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on RTHK's
  <i>
   Overview Policy
  </i>
  programme, Tang said the guidelines would provide clear explanations on 20 categories of national security and how they relate to officers' work.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Public officers not only have to make considerations of national security at work, but they also have to be proactive," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Some of them don't fully understand that, so we will introduce a set of guidelines in the first quarter of 2025, using plain language and examples, instead of legal terms, to make explanations."
  <br>
  <br>
  An example cited by Tang is how government procurement may be affected by foreign sanctions.
  <br>
  <br>
  On a cross-border emergency-response mechanism established last year strengthening collaboration between Hong Kong and other Greater Bay Area cities, the security minister said up to two large-scale drills are held every year, while small-scale ones take place more frequently.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong is set to host the World Snooker Grand Prix at the Kai Tak Arena, the first ranking tournament to be held in the city since 1989.
 <br>
  <br>
  The tournament will take place from March 4 to 9, featuring the top 32 players from around the world including Judd Trump and Ronnie O'Sullivan, who will be playing on home turf for the first time after becoming Hong Kong residents through the Quality Migrant Admission Scheme.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other snooker greats set to be in action include China's top player Ding Junhui, former World champions Mark Selby of England and Australian Neil Robertson, and the current World champion Kyren Wilson.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This will be the first formal sport event to be held in Kai Tak Arena, so there will be a lot of challenges because I don't think anyone in Hong Kong has the experience of organising something of this scale in this venue," said Vincent Law, chairman of the Billiard Sports Council of Hong Kong China.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are working on every single detail meticulously, especially the production, the seating plan, the scenery, the facilities for example the media room, the media centre, the other rooms for the players, a lot of things. It's not an easy task, but we are trying our best."
  <br>
  <br>
  It's also the first time Hong Kong will host the World Snooker Grand Prix.
  <br>
  <br>
  Simon Brownell, CEO of the World Snooker Tour, said it'll be a treat for both the fans and the players.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They will be desperate to become the first to lift the historic World Grand Prix trophy in Hong Kong, and to win the historic highs prize money for this event," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For the local fans, it will be incredible opportunity to watch the best players on the planet and marvel at their skills. We are sure the atmosphere will be electric and it will be a fabulous experience for everyone inside the arena."
  <br>
  <br>
  During the event, exhibition matches will be held for other elite players, including local favourite Marco Fu.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said it promises to be a great tournament that would further promote snooker in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Looking back, many years ago I went to Queen Elizabeth Stadium to watch the likes of Steve Davis, Jimmy White, they played in an exhibition tournament in Hong Kong, and that's when I really fell in love with the game of snooker," Fu told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm sure many youngsters will come to this tournament to watch all the top players playing, and I'm sure they're going to fall in love with the game of snooker.
  <br>
  <br>
  "After this tournament, more youngsters will pick up the cue and start to play snooker. It's going to be fantastic."

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Greater Bay Airlines on Tuesday announced the cancellation of flights, which could disrupt the plans of some Lunar New Year travellers.
 <br>
  <br>
  The airline did not specify the number of flights affected, but it's understood that more than 200 flights scheduled between January and March, mainly to Japan and South Korea, were cancelled.
  <br>
  <br>
  Greater Bay Airlines cited a delay in new aircraft delivery and statutory safety inspections of existing aircraft.
  <br>
  <br>
  The carrier said it's helping passengers to re-book tickets or with refunds.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will learn from the experience and review the relevant arrangements to avoid similar situations from happening again," it wrote in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The airline also said all fees will be waived to reduce the possible impact on people's travel plans.
  <br>
  <br>
  The flight cancellations sparked a backlash on social media, with would-be holidaymakers complaining that their travel plans have been disrupted in a Facebook group.
  <br>
  <br>
  Transport secretary Mable Chan expressed deep concern and requested a detailed report.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a Facebook post, Chan said the Transport and Logistics Bureau will meet with airline representatives to understand the latest situation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Steve Huen, executive director of EGL Tours, said 11 tour groups heading to Tokushima, Japan, after February 10 will be affected, involving more than 100 people.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Generally, we give customers options. They can choose to switch to other destinations. If they cannot find a suitable alternative due to flight disruption, we usually provide a full refund," Huen said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yuen Chun-ning, executive director of WWPKG Holdings, said five tour groups going to Sendai in March will have to be cancelled, with around 100 people affected.
  <br>
  <br>
  Travellers can reschedule or choose to cancel for a full refund, Yuen said.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Immigration officials on Tuesday said seven mainland visitors were jailed for up to two months each for working illegally in Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  The jail sentences came after officers arrested eight people this month who provided illegal tour guide services and acted as "shopping agents".
  <br>
  <br>
  Seven earlier appeared at Sha Tin Magistrates’ Courts and at Tuen Mun Magistrates’ Courts, and admitted they had breached their condition of stay.
  <br>
  <br>
  They were given 54 days to two months in jail.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officers said one case is still under investigation, and there could be more arrests.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officers said four women acted as tour guides in Hong Kong. They arranged guided visits for their guests to different tourist attractions in the city, and took photos for them, at an hourly rate of HK$100 to HK$300.
  <br>
  <br>
  For the other four men, officers said they acted as “shopping agents” by buying food and necessities at supermarkets and restaurants on the mainland, and delivered the goods to customers in Hong Kong. They could earn anywhere between HK$100 and HK$200 for each transaction.
  <br>
  <br>
  The four men and four women, aged between 19 and 52, were arrested in Hong Kong between January 13 and Monday, after officers posed as customers and reserved services from them through social media.
  <br>
  <br>
  Immigration Department deputy commander Leung Tsz-chung reminded citizens to be wary of such services.
  <br>
  <br>
  “When choosing those services, people have to be careful and vigilant, and to make sure the service providers can be employed legally in Hong Kong. Otherwise, people may face criminal liability,” Leung said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's Lunar New Year fireworks display on the second day of the Year of the Snake will feature patterns of pandas, smiley faces and gold ingots, organisers said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 23-minute show, divided into nine scenes, will light up Victoria Harbour from 8pm on January 30.
  <br>
  <br>
  Organisers said 23,888 pyrotechnic shells will be launched from three barges, opening with a lucky number eight and a scene entitled "A Brand New Beginning".
  <br>
  <br>
  Wilson Mao, CEO of Pyromagic Multimedia Productions, said the eighth scene is the highlight of the show, featuring patterns of six pandas.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The six panda heads symbolise the family of pandas that are now in Hong Kong. Two of which are newborns, a very happy moment for Hong Kong, and also China has given Hong Kong two pandas. Along with the two natives that are always in Hong Kong, we have a family of six," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mao described the extravaganza here as "one of a kind".
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong has a very beautiful backdrop, and to feature a fireworks display in this beautiful backdrop is one of a kind. There's nowhere in the world that can beat this beautiful backdrop.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The fireworks in Guangzhou, they don't have a backdrop like in Hong Kong... Hong Kong is certainly world famous, the fireworks event held here is always number one."
  <br>
  <br>
  Spectators can listen to RTHK Radio 4 for synchronised music during the show.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A mainland student from the University of Hong Kong (HKU) is suspected to have lost around HK$1.8 million in a phone scam, sources said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  It is understood the woman, 22, got a phone call last August from someone pretending to be from the SAR's Immigration Department.
  <br>
  <br>
  The scammer told her she was involved in a case on the mainland and threatened to arrest her unless she opened an account at a designated bank.
  <br>
  <br>
  The victim was asked to make six money transfers to the bank account to prove that she was innocent, sources have said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Failing to contact the fraudster, she realised she had been scammed and reported the case to police.
  <br>
  <br>
  In an email to students on Sunday, HKU said that more than 60 students have been scammed in recent months, resulting in a total loss of HK$60 million.

    New website to help firms comply with competition law

<img alt="The Competition Commission has launched a new platform for SMEs to access information related to the Competition Ordinance more easily. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1788498_1_20250121154256.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Less than a quarter of small to medium-sized companies in Hong Kong have taken adequate steps to make sure they don't fall foul of competition laws, a watchdog warned on Tuesday, adding that it has come up with a new website to help firms get the information they need.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Competition Commission said a survey of around 600 companies it carried out from late 2023 to 2024 found only 24 percent of SMEs had policies in place to ensure they complied with competition regulations.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The survey results suggest that the SMEs have a quite good understanding of the Competition Ordinance. At the same time, we realise they have some confusion on some details regarding the law. We found out that they may not have the necessary resources to implement compliance plans within the company," said Gary Shiu, an executive director of the commission.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shiu said larger enterprises have the resources to hire professionals to provide advice on the matter, while smaller companies that don't have the money are at a greater risk of breaking the law.
  <br>
  <br>
  The new platform, SME Hub, highlights key aspects of the ordinance and has an assessment tool for identifying potential risks with business activities.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shiu said it also includes real-life scenarios or hypothetical examples to bust common myths surrounding the ordinance.
  <br>
  <br>
  "All enterprises have some misunderstanding concerning being part of a cartel agreement or price-fixing agreements. They would always think that as long as there are no anti-competitive effects or any negative effects in the market, then why would they infringe the law?" Shiu said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The watchdog said it will also be organising talks and training for SMEs on implementing internal guidelines for the ordinance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Andrew Kwok, who chairs the Hong Kong Small and Medium Enterprises Association, said limited resources is not the only challenge when it comes to implementing relevant guidelines.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The lack of expertise, and being uncertain about the ordinance requirements make it difficult to lay out internal policies. If the details [of the law] are too complicated, SMEs may need to consult relevant lawyers for clarification," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kwok agreed that the new website can help SMEs understand the ordinance more thoroughly.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Some SMEs may have a basic understanding, but most do not fully understand the [ordinance] terms in detail and what it implies. The launch of the SME hub provides resources and guidance tailor-made for SMEs," he said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday expressed his hope for promoting positive relations with Washington after US President Donald Trump returned to office for a second term, while saying Hong Kong would also "prepare for the worst".
 <br>
  <br>
  Lee also warned any political interference would not work.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Any political interference, any inappropriate action against Hong Kong will not work. We believe what we do is for the overall good of Hong Kong," Lee said when asked if he's worried about more sanctions on the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If there is any attempt to interfere with trials in Hong Kong, or officials or people who are involved in administering justice, it won't work. We are doing it exactly in the same way in protecting our national security as other citizens in their own countries."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee said he hopes to have a good relationship with the United States, as there are many common interests between the two sides.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With the new president in office, I hope to see that there will be good efforts to promote positive relations, because cooperation and collaboration will only create overall good for the people of Hong Kong and the people of the US. And Hong Kong people and US citizens have always been friends in a lot of areas and we'll continue to work hard on that regard," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But, of course, we will always prepare for the worst, and we will ensure that the rights of our people and companies will be protected."
  <br>
  <br>
  The SAR always seeks to strengthen ties and exchanges with different countries including the United States, the chief executive said, but there should be mutual respect and understanding.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on RTHK's Backchat programme on Tuesday, Alan Lung, co-convenor of The Path of Democracy, said the SAR government may find it challenging to anticipate Trump's thinking.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our government may not be able to read Trump, and doesn't understand what they [the administration] are worried about," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ross Feingold, Head of Research at Cyrus Consulting, felt the SAR could face an uphill battle when dealing with Washington.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong is starting from a disadvantage, and we also have to keep in mind that no matter what he [Trump] says about his personal relationship with [President] Xi Jinping... Secretary of State (Marco) Rubio, who was just confirmed, the foreign policy team, these are people who don't have warm opinions towards Hong Kong."

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee says Hong Kong will strengthen cooperation with other places to try to secure the release of SAR residents being held prisoner in "scam farms" in Southeast Asia.
 <br>
  <br>
  At the moment, 10 Hongkongers are believed to be being forced to take part in fraud after being tricked into travelling to Thailand and neighbouring countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee told reporters ahead of the weekly Executive Council meeting on Tuesday that authorities will carry out thorough investigations and work with counterparts overseas to tackle the issue.
  <br>
  <br>
  “There are a lot of players in the whole fight against this crime, including law enforcement agencies in the relevant countries. There are good networks already. The respective countries have already heightened their attention and escalated the government participation in our whole fight," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will continue to strengthen cooperation in this area, passing intelligence across the players."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee also called on the public to be aware of different types of scams, including those that have ensnared scores of university students from the mainland.
  <br>
  <br>
  "People may have heard about such cases...but still they think they won't be the victims and so they are not as alert," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police have strengthened cooperation with tertiary institutions to raise awareness of financial scams among students, Lee added.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday said more than 1.4 million mainland arrivals are expected in Hong Kong during the Lunar New Year holiday period.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters before the weekly Executive Council meeting, the CE said the administration will make comprehensive preparations to ensure travellers have a good experience.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The inter-departmental working group, chaired by the chief secretary, will make proper arrangements based on the situation during individual festive periods and the estimated traveller numbers," Lee said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Regarding cross-border arrangements, we need to discuss and cooperate with mainland authorities. We will look at the actual situation to see whether service hours at border checkpoints need to be extended and how long these should be. We should be announcing the details within this week."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee said 2025 will open a new page for Hong Kong with more tourists making frequent visits to the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the number of inbound visits saw a huge surge last year, reaching almost 45 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  While mainland arrivals saw a 30 percent year-on-year increase, the growth from Southeast Asia was even more significant.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CE said he expects the growth to continue in the coming year, with more new air routes to be opened.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the chief executive also announced that twin panda cubs at Ocean Park will make their public debut on February 16.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee said there would be a naming contest for the pandas.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We hope everyone can share the joy of this big family, so having a naming contest will make it even more joyful and warm. Details will be announced soon," he said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan arrived in Davos, Switzerland on Monday for the World Economic Forum (WEF) Annual Meeting where he expressed his desire to expedite a free trade agreement between Hong Kong and the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC).
 <br>
  <br>
  Chan met Jasem Mohamed Albudaiwi, the council's secretary-general, to discuss strengthening bilateral trade cooperation.
  <br>
  <br>
  The FS said both parties acknowledged that the launch of the "Gulf Cooperation Council Chapter" at the Asian Financial Forum last week marked a significant step forward in strengthening financial services cooperation between Hong Kong and the Gulf states.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said the SAR government is committed to facilitating two-way business delegation visits to enhance collaboration in digital economy, green transformation, securities markets, Islamic finance, and asset and wealth management with Arab states.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan also met several finance and business leaders from Europe, America, the Middle East and Japan and promoted the SAR's advantages as a "super connector" and "super value-adder".
  <br>
  <br>
  He said he briefed the leaders on Hong Kong's recent economic and social developments, highlighting progress in the local financial market last year and achievements in attracting businesses and talent.
  <br>
  <br>
  He emphasised strategies to advance finance, innovation and technology, trade and aviation and create global opportunities for businesses and talent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Additionally, Chan met the chair of Revolut, a UK-based fintech company specialising in digital banking services, to discuss the latest developments in the field and to encourage the company to expand its operations in Hong Kong.

 The Security Bureau said another Hong Kong resident suspected of being lured to Southeast Asia to engage in illegal work has been rescued.
 <br>
  <br>
  The bureau said the Immigration Department's Assistance to Hong Kong Residents Unit earlier received a request for help from the family of the SAR resident.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials said they immediately followed up and contacted the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Office in Hong Kong, the Chinese Embassies in both Myanmar and Thailand and the Consulate General of Myanmar in Hong Kong for assistance.
  <br>
  <br>
  A dedicated unit of the Security Bureau is working to bring the individual back to Hong Kong as soon as possible.
  <br>
  <br>
  It's understood that the Hong Kong resident worked in a scam operation in Myanmar for four months before he was rescued and taken to a safe place in Thailand.

    New system to simplify land ownership transfer mooted

<img alt="The government is planning to implement title registration on land sold after 2027. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1788360_1_20250120191656.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government is planning to implement title registration on land sold after 2027 to help streamline procedures relating to ownership transfer.
 <br>
  <br>
  It will also cover land granted by private treaty and by land exchange.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a closed-door press briefing on Monday, Development Bureau officials said it's estimated that there will be around 450 new land grants, and 25,000 title registers will be created within five years after the new system is implemented.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under the current deeds registration system, title is decided by checking previous deeds, and officials said there is no guarantee of title to property.
  <br>
  <br>
  When conveyancing a property, the buyer’s lawyer has to check all previous title deeds carefully, including historical title documents, to make sure the property has a “clean title” so the buyer will have the legal ownership. Owners will also have to properly keep the title deeds.
  <br>
  <br>
  By contrast, officials said title registration will provide certainty in property ownership, and the person who is being registered will be recognised as the true owner.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The Title Register is conclusive evidence of title to the property,” an official said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Development Bureau also said the new system can shorten the property-transfer process.
  <br>
  <br>
  “There is no need to check historical title documents in sale and purchase of property. People will find out the owner from the Title Register on the Land Registry, and whether there are other ownership interests,” the official added.
  <br>
  <br>
  A genuine and innocent buyer who has acquired the property will have the “indefeasible title”, even if the transfer of property involved third-party fraud.
  <br>
  <br>
  In that case, the former owner can apply for compensation, capped at HK$50 million, under a Land Title Indemnity Fund.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bureau added that it does not have a timetable on converting the existing 2.9 million land registers to title registration, due to complicated legal issues such as problematic ownership.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The outgoing chairman of the Bar Association, Victor Dawes, said on Monday that while protecting national security is fundamentally important and helps to ensure Hong Kong's economic development, the authorities need to exercise their powers in a proportionate manner.
 <br>
  <br>
  In his speech at a ceremony marking the start of the Legal Year, Dawes said common law and the judicial system are pivotal to the success of Hong Kong and the constitutional order in the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  He cited Lord Hodge, deputy president of the United Kingdom's top court, as saying that the quality of a place's legal institutions is important to investment levels, innovation and economic growth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dawes said there is no doubt that protecting national security is fundamentally important and essential for economic prosperity and people's well-being.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said there continued to be unfair criticism overseas regarding security matters linked to incidents that took place in Hong Kong in 2019, and some of the criticism was aimed at undermining the SAR's prosperity.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Bar Association chief said it's important for the authorities to exercise powers derived from national security laws in a considered and proportionate manner, to show that Hong Kong, as a jurisdiction, respects the rights of the people.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Ministers and public officers at all levels must be able to show that their powers are exercised in good faith, fairly, and for the purpose for which the powers are conferred," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Businesses must have the confidence that they will be dealt with on a principled and not an arbitrary basis. In this regard, powers under our new national security legislation should be used in a considered and proportionate manner."
  <br>
  <br>
  The president of the Law Society, Roden Tong, said his organisation will do its best to preserve the legal sector's self-regulatory regime, saying this is seen as an important part of the profession's independence.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The independence of the profession will give the public confidence that it can take an objective view and effectively uphold the rule of law," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is particularly important when our systems are under close scrutiny in the geopolitical climate, and the Law Society will strive to preserve the profession's self-regulatory status."
  <br>
  <br>
  Tong also called on the sector to play a bigger educational role to help tackle misinformation.

 Justice Secretary Paul Lam on Monday hit out at attempts to "exert improper pressure" on overseas judges serving on Hong Kong's top court.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a speech marking the beginning of the Legal Year, he also said people should not overlook the fact that some foreign non-permanent judges (NPJs) have decided to stay on the bench at the Court of Final Appeal.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2024, five foreign judges decided to step down from the court. There are now 10 NPJs, six of them from overseas.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lam said the "participation of eminent foreign judges" in the work of the top court benefits both the SAR and the common law world as a whole.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's most regrettable that there were attempts mainly from overseas to exert improper pressures on foreign judges to dissociate themselves from the Hong Kong court. These attempts pose a threat to not only the rule of law in Hong Kong but also the development of common law in general," Lam said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The government is in full support of the judiciary in its continuous efforts to appoint and retain foreign NPJs in future."
  <br>
  <br>
  He also criticised individuals who "intimidate" national security judges or "interfere" with judicial proceedings.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's vital to bear in mind that the enforcement of the national security law is subject to the supervision of the Hong Kong court exercising its independent judicial power," Lam said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Anyone who intimidates judges handling national security cases or interferes with the relevant judicial proceedings in whatsoever manner cannot be genuinely concerned about the rule of law in Hong Kong."
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the homegrown national security law, which took effect in March last year, aims to ensure "the hard-won peace and stability" that Hong Kong enjoys can be preserved.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Unless security is first safeguarded, it will be impossible for Hong Kong to utilise its unique strengths at full strength under the principle of One Country, Two Systems, and serve as an international financial, shipping and trade centre," Lam said.

    Legal principles upheld in all cases: chief justice

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's judges have upheld fundamental legal principles in hearing all cases, including national security trials, Chief Justice Andrew Cheung said on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a speech marking the start of the Legal Year, the SAR's top judge said the city's national security laws have brought with them "cases that attract heightened attention", particularly due to their political sensitivity.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Cheung stressed the same legal principles apply in national security cases as in others.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The presumption of innocence, the requirement that guilt be proved beyond reasonable doubt, and the right to a fair trial are all essential safeguards that remain firmly in place," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our courts do not merely pay lip service to these fundamental principles. Judges at all levels are expected to, and indeed do, adhere to them in the adjudication of cases."
  <br>
  <br>
  Cheung said tensions often exist between protecting basic rights and safeguarding national security, both of which the judiciary is firmly committed to upholding.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Striking the right balance can be challenging, and outcomes in individual cases may be contentious at times, nor is the interpretation or application of newly enacted statutory provisions always straightforward," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "However, it is one thing to disagree with a legal provision or a court decision in applying it, but entirely another to suggest that the justice system has been undermined by political expectations or societal atmosphere."
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to the media after the ceremony, Cheung said the city's judges faced threats, and stressed that judicial officers should not be interfered with by any countries, bodies or organisations.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Threatening sanctions against judges simply doing their work goes directly to the question of judicial independence and interfering with judges' work and therefore it is objectionable," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is objectionable as a matter of principle and it is a direct affront to the rule of law and to judicial independence."
  <br>
  <br>
  The chief justice also said while the departure of foreign judges from the city's top court "caused concerns in some quarters", it has not affected judicial independence.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is unfortunate that a few of these judges have felt unable to continue their service. They are, of course, entitled to their views, and their decisions ought to be respected. However, their premature departures do not mean a weakening of the quality or independence of the judiciary," Cheung said in his speech.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is true that, given the current geopolitical headwinds, recruiting overseas judges with the right stature and experience may be less straightforward than it once was. After all, overseas judges are appointed to our highest court on account of their acknowledged eminence and legal expertise, not merely to sustain the system of overseas judges for its own sake."
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2024, five foreign judges decided to step down from the Court of Final Appeal (CFA). Following their exits, there are 10 non-permanent judges (NPJs) left sitting on the top court, six of them from overseas.
  <br>
  <br>
  In comments made to the media, Cheung expressed confidence that the city will be able to recruit more overseas judges.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Given the rather stable number of appeals heard by the CFA in recent years, the number of 10 NPJs – six overseas NPJs, plus four local NPJs – plus possible appointment of further NPJs in the future, would be more than sufficient to allow us to cope with our very steady workload on the court," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm reasonably confident of keeping our existing NPJs as well as recruiting new NPJs in the future when we can identify suitable candidates to be appointed."
  <br>
  <br>
  The top judge also said the presence or absence of individual judges will not undermine the integrity of Hong Kong's judicial system.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cheung said the city has faced significant political, social and economic challenges in recent years, which tested the resilience of the territory's legal system and the strengths of its institutions. Despite that, he said, the judiciary continued to uphold the rule of law and ensured that legal procedures remain transparent, fair and independent.

    'Digital signage users need to up cyber security'

<img alt="HKCERT said it handled over 12,000 security incidents in 2024, with phishing accounting for over half of all cases. Photo courtesy of HKCERT" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1788324_2_20250120210646.jpg&q=70">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination Centre (HKCERT) on Monday urged organisations using digital signage devices to enhance security measures and review best practices to protect against potential cyber attacks.
 <br>
  <br>
  Alex Chan, the spokesman for HKCERT, said the use of digital signboards has increased significantly to engage customer interactions through digital advertising and public information, but warns that its growth comes with potential cyber risks.
  <br>
  <br>
  HKCERT conducted a survey of 624 organisations across various industries, including retail, tourism and financial services and found that almost 40 percent of the companies they surveyed did not conduct risk assessments for their signages in advance.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the centre identified various vulnerabilities that require urgent remediation among digital signage usage.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Someone uses a USB device that includes malicious content or also can
  <br>
  include some script, when they insert it into a digital signage with the USB port exposed, they can quickly replace the content," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For the infrared, it's another channel apart from the USB port the attacker can leverage, they can based on some infrared advice to emit some orders or instructions to the digital signage so that they would also, under the other malicious command, change the content of the digital signage."
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that some digital signage systems also utilise weak encryption methods, which could potentially allow to hackers intercept, control or obtain network information.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said companies need to increase their awareness and conduct the security measures recommended.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Physically, they block the USB port, they stop the USB port autoplay functions, the infrared services, or maybe use a very strong username password for the content management system, or use a stronger encryption protocol so that it's not easy to eavesdrop on the content sent between the user computer, the Wi-Fi network, the content management system, and the digital signage," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  HKCERT said it handled over 12,000 security incidents in 2024, with phishing accounting for over half of all cases, marking a 108 percent increase from the year before.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan highlighted that looking ahead this year, supply chain security and AI content hijacking will become the primary cyber security risks in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Organisations and individuals must prepare by implementing appropriate cyber incident response measures, deploying suitable cyber security measures, conducting regular security audits and penetration testing, and understanding and preventing relevant risks," he said.
