<div class="itemFullText">
 More than 5,000 people flocked to Ocean Park for the panda twins' debut, its chairman revealed on Monday, saying the figures fell within expectations.
 <br>
  <br>
  Paulo Pong said that dozens of people arrived at the park gates at 6am, four hours before the start of public viewings.
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted there entry to facility was smooth as several drills had been conducted earlier.
  <br>
  <br>
  The turnout marked a daily record high at the Giant Panda Adventure exhibition zone, Pong said, with a majority of them being locals.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This included annual pass holders, who are fans of pandas. There were also visitors from around the world and the mainland, including Chengdu. Many people from foreign countries, like Southeast Asia, or even Europe and America, came to see the pandas," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Some of the tourists actually didn't know about the twins when they arrived Ocean Park, but when they heard they could visit the cubs, they also queued to meet them."
  <br>
  <br>
  Public viewing of the twins, whom Ying Ying gave birth to last August, is for five hours daily – from 10am to 3pm.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Pong said visiting hours could be extended.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When they're more adapted to meeting the public, or even, when they can be in the same exhibition zone with Ying Ying, then we can gradually extend the duration."
  <br>
  <br>
  He said Ocean Park received hundreds of applications for the HK$1,500 VIP session to meet the cubs for 30 minutes before the park opens each day.
  <br>
  <br>
  The first session will be held on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pong emphasised that income generated from the special tour would be used for its conservation fund after deducting expenses.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Health authorities said on Monday that thanks to a cross-border organ donation, an eight-month-old girl underwent a successful heart transplant on Sunday night.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, Secretary for Health, Lo Chung-mau, noted that it was the second such case of cross-border organ donation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "After a then four-month-old baby girl, Tsz-hei, successfully received a heart donation from the mainland in December 2022 to extend her life, Hong Kong and the mainland established a close communication channel and procedures for cross-boundary organ transplant co-operation based on that successful experience," said Professor Lo.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said more than 100 personnel from 18 mainland authorities worked together and raced against time to ensure the safe and smooth transportation of the organ across multiple locations.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Health Bureau and the Hospital Authority said the heart transplant was successfully completed for baby, Whitney, at the Hong Kong Children's Hospital.
  <br>
  <br>
  Consultant in-charge of the Cardiothoracic Surgery of HKCH, Dr Nicholson Yam - who was in charge of the transplant - said the operation lasted approximately 6.5 hours. The statement said Whitney was now under close monitoring in the Intensive Care Unit and the following 24 hours would be a critical period.
  <br>
  <br>
  Whitney's parents expressed their gratitude to the medical teams and to the different regional authorities in finding a suitable heart, as well as thanking the donor's family for their difficult and selfless decision, giving Whitney the chance for a new life.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Director of Cluster Services of the HA, Dr Simon Tang, said all efforts had been made through different networks to identify a suitable heart for Whitney amid the difficulties involved.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Since there was no suitable recipient in the mainland, the mainland decided to send the donor heart to Hong Kong for transplanting to Whitney upon confirmation by experts from the two places that the heart was suitable for Whitney's transplantation," Dr Tang added.

 Over 50,000 civil servants and members of the public took part in a stress test at the Kai Tak Sports Park on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The aim was to assess the park's readiness ahead of its official opening at the beginning of next month.
  <br>
  <br>
  The exercise also looked into the performance of the Easy Leave platform. It uses artificial intelligence to analyse real-time data on crowd density and the time needed for people to follow an exit route.

    Make good use of Hetao to boost biotech sector: DAB

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 DAB lawmakers on Sunday said Hong Kong should make good use of the Hetao Shenzhen-Hong Kong Science and Technology Innovation Co-operation Zone to boost the country’s biotech development.
 <br>
  <br>
  The suggestion is among dozens of others the party is planning to propose during the annual sessions of the nation's legislature and top political advisory body in Beijing next month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Starry Lee, Hong Kong’s sole member of the National People’s Congress Standing Committee, said for one, authorities should allow blood samples taken from the mainland to be processed in Hetao.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I understand that [Hong Kong] Red Cross receive blood donation from the general public because we cannot have the samples from [mainland] China. We [also] have to export the blood samples to overseas countries to manufacture blood-related products for medical use,” she explained.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Our suggestion is to make use of Hetao for a trial so that all these samples can move to Hong Kong for further development and innovation.”
  <br>
  <br>
  She added that her party hopes to see more cross-border exchanges in areas like medicine and healthcare equipment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the party quoted some private enterprises as saying they would like more support from the central government to help them ride out the economic downturn.
  <br>
  <br>
  “For example, you know, all the enterprises who are operating on the mainland have to pay the social security payment. And because of the tight economic environment, some say some sort of flexibility should be incorporated during this special period,” Lee said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The party also said drivers under the Northbound Travel for Hong Kong Vehicles scheme should be allowed to return to the SAR via more borders besides the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Customs officers have arrested a 28-year-old woman on suspicion of carrying the space oil drug in a vape stick.
 <br>
  <br>
  The woman was taken into custody at the Hong Kong-Macau Ferry Terminal in Sheung Wan after she arrived from Macau on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The arrestee, who claimed to be unemployed, has been released on bail.
  <br>
  <br>
  This marks the department’s first arrest since etomidate - a key ingredient of space oil drug - was included in the Dangerous Drug Ordinance last Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trafficking or illegal import of such a substance is punishable by a maximum penalty of life imprisonment and a fine of HK$5 million

<img alt="Paul Chan said bond issuance can help secure the funds needed for the Northern Metropolis project. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1791844_1_20250216131710.jpg&q=70">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan said on Sunday that issuing government bonds to fund the mega Northern Metropolis project is one way to ensure its development won’t be affected by Hong Kong’s economic situation.
 <br>
  <br>
  Writing on his weekly blog, Chan said bonds are commonly used around the world to finance infrastructure projects, adding that international investors have traditionally been very receptive to the SAR’s debt securities.
  <br>
  <br>
  These investors, the minister said, include central banks, sovereignty funds, global organisations and banks.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong has the conditions and ability to issue more bonds, and use market forces flexibly for implementing strategic infrastructure [projects]," Chan wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  The finance chief cited research from international groups and local universities as saying that the SAR's debt level remains comparatively low, and bond issuance would be a smart solution.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan went on to say that in some developed economies, government debt is actually higher than its total GDP.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, as Hong Kong's debt is just over nine percent of its total GDP, there is room to lift this percentage while still remaining at a robust level.

    Govt mulls longer grace period for basic housing units

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Housing Winnie Ho said on Sunday that the government is considering extending a grace period for landlords to convert subdivided flats, after new laws are introduced to regulate the compact homes.
 <br>
  <br>
  Officials had initially proposed a transitional period of up to two years for the registration of such flats, known as "basic housing units", which will need to meet a number of requirements such as a minimum size.
  <br>
  <br>
  Citing public views received during a consultation exercise which concluded earlier, Ho said some respondents expressed the need for more time to make the changes.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said extending the grace period to three years could be an option.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Time-wise, it is helpful to the market - so tenants can move out and renovation work can take place and people have better options on where to live," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "All these will help the situation. So I think a three-year grace period is something that can be considered."
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho added that the government is analysing the public’s views and will make adjustments to the legal proposals accordingly.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, the housing chief said officials will soon put in place a pilot scheme at two public housing estates by installing sensors at the doors of flats occupied by elderly residents, in order to better ensure their safety.
  <br>
  <br>
  The scheme comes after a recent spate of cases involving elderly people who die alone in their homes for some time before being discovered.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said dozens of households at Sheung Lok Estate in Ho Man Tin and Wan Hon Estate in Kwun Tong have signed up for the trial.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The sensor records movements. The elderly person can decide who to send such information - it's not to the estate's management, it can be his or her son, daughter or other family members. It's up to the tenant," Ho said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister stressed the sensors don't have cameras and won't detect what's inside the flat.

    Crowds flock to Ocean Park to meet panda cubs

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ocean Park's panda twin cubs made their highly-anticipated public debut on Sunday in front of hundreds of delighted locals and tourists.
 <br>
  <br>
  Many visitors arrived extra early to make sure they could meet the baby pandas as soon as possible.
  <br>
  <br>
  A local panda enthusiast, surnamed Chan, told RTHK that he arrived at Ocean Park two hours before it opened - and he's also taking part in a contest to pick a name for the pair.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I arrived here at 8am. I want to see them as soon as I can. I will join the [naming] contest, but I am still thinking [about what names to propose]. The theme will probably be related to Hong Kong,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tourists were equally thrilled to meet the locally-born cubs.
  <br>
  <br>
  One Indonesian student who’s currently studying in Shenzhen said he doesn’t get to see pandas in his home country.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We don’t really have access to pandas [in Indonesia]. So looking at pandas, especially the cubs, is quite special to us,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ocean Park says visitors are allowed to stay for up to five minutes inside the venue to give more people a chance to view the panda babies.
  <br>
  <br>
  While some said they wish they could spend more time with the cubs, Christa from San Francisco said the arrangement is reasonable.
  <br>
  <br>
  “They [panda cubs] are just doing their own thing, just hanging out. They don’t need to do anything special, they’re just special the way they are,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I think if you can take what you can get so others could enjoy them too I think it’s better to have more people enjoy them and want to conserve and protect them. So I think it’s better to have more people see them.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Public viewings of the panda cubs are from 10am to 3pm daily, and the facility is expected to welcome up to 5,000 visitors each day.
  <br>
  <br>
  People can also choose to pay HK$1,500 each for a special, 30-minute visit before the park opens each day.
  <br>
  <br>
  A woman sunamed Ho said she may sign up for the session so that she can spend more time with the twins.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I saw the pandas climbing up and down. I like both of them. I think seeing the cubs grow up is like seeing my grandchildren. I am interested in the HK$1,500 session, at least I'll have half an hour to see the cubs. I think it's worth it because I feel happy after seeing them," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, another woman surnamed Leung said the VIP slot is just too costly.

  "I will not consider [registering] at all. It is not necessary. I still have to see the pandas with another 50 people even after paying HK$1,500," she said.

    Real-name ticketing deters scalpers: Consumer Council

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Consumer Council has called on the government to implement real-name registration for tickets to prevent scalping.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a TV program on Saturday, the council’s chief executive Gilly Wong said real-name ticketing can deter scalpers and allow people who are truly interested in attending to buy tickets.
  <br>
  <br>
  “When more mega events are taking place, there will be more ticket scalping. Recently, it was reported in the news that a ticket had been marked-up to an astronomical price of more than HK$100,000,” Wong said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We hope the market can be regulated and stabilized. We believe that real-name ticketing is a good way to achieve that,” she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The council received over 40,000 complaints last year, a 20 percent increase from 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong said over 7,000 complaints were related to Lionel Messi’s no-show at an exhibition match last February, as well as the abrupt closure of the Physical Fitness chain in September.
  <br>
  <br>
  She urged organisers to provide clearer clauses for future events, and to inform consumers earlier if they are any changes.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A data interchange system among departments has not been set up due to privacy and technical issues, according Secretary for Labour and Welfare Chris Sun, but the government is in touch with the Privacy Commissioner to overcome challenges.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lawmakers had called on the authorities to provide more assistance to hidden elders, after a 78-year-old man was found dead inside his Tuen Mun flat earlier this week.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters after an event on Saturday, Sun said the government should make use of data from departments like the Hospital Authority and the Social Welfare Department.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said authorities are currently in touch with the Privacy Commissioner to discuss ways allowing data interchange, while complying with the Personal Data Ordinance.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We hope we can intervene before any incident occurs. We can identify some high-risk cases and contact them to provide services. We hope to avoid tragedies as much as possible," Sun said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Chief Executive's Policy Address last year mentioned that officials would make use of identification tools designed by universities for detection of high-risk cases.

<div class="itemFullText">
 People are invited to suggest names for Ocean Park's panda twin cubs as they turn six months old on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at the greeting ceremony for the panda babies, Chief Executive John Lee said people can submit their ideas, based on the twins' appearance and personality, from noon on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the government will announce their names in the first half of this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee added that Sunday will be a big day, as the cubs will finally meet the public.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's the first time that pandas have been born in the SAR, and there's a sense of elation among Hong Kong people. The pair only weighed about 120 grammes each when they were born, and they've shown extraordinary resilience," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "After six months, their weight has increased to over ten kilogrammes each. They were a bit shaky at first, but now, they've become experts at tree climbing."
  <br>
  <br>
  Ocean Park said people can suggest a Chinese name for each of the cubs, along with an explainer of the meaning of the Chinese names.
  <br>
  <br>
  The submission deadline is March 7, and the judging panel will comprise representatives from the park, the SAR government, and the China Conservation and Research Centre for the Giant Panda.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ocean Park's chairman Paulo Pong said with the support of the whole community, the SAR has successfully promoted the concept of "panda is everywhere".
  <br>
  <br>
  "With promotions through social media, on transportation and various creative activities across Hong Kong involving panda-themed products, we connected Hong Kong and global panda lovers. This further promotes Hong Kong's tourism and culture," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He pointed out that the park will use top-tier animal care, veterinary and scientific research to help with the breeding of giant pandas.

 Police said efforts to educate the elderly have led to a significant drop in the number of so-called “Guess Who” phone scams – in which fraudsters pose as an old friend or relative of the victim.
 <br>
  <br>
  The number of “Guess Who” phone scams, which mainly targets victims aged 65 or above, were down by 48 percent last year, police commissioner Raymond Siu said on Saturday after attending a Commercial Radio program.
  <br>
  <br>
  “That’s why last year, we particularly focused our effort to deliver these anti-scam messages to the elderly,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Siu said police are working with The Office of the Communications Authority (OFCA) to combat other types of telephone scams.
  <br>
  <br>
  This comes following reports of suspected scam text messages carrying the hashtag prefix, to trick victims into thinking that they were sent by the authority.
  <br>
  <br>
  In December 2023, the authority launched a short message service (SMS) sender registration scheme, in which companies and organizations participating send text messages under their registered IDs with the prefix “#”.
  <br>
  <br>
  “In order to tackle other telephone scams, we need to find out the reasons as well as the victimised group, so as to work with all stakeholders, in particular the telecommunications industry and also the OFCA,” Siu said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We set up a specific working group back in September 2022. We continue to hold regular meetings with them, in order to come up with different measures to tackle this sort of telephone scam,” he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Siu reminded residents to remain alert to potential scam messages, especially those with hyperlinks.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The construction industry should look into limiting the use of bamboo scaffolding if the situation calls for it, according to Siu Sin-man from the Association for the Rights of Industrial Accident Victims.
 <br>
  <br>
  A scaffolding collapse at a Kai Tak construction site last month injured 11 workers, sparking discussions about replacing bamboo altogether with metal scaffolding.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a radio programme on Saturday, Siu said the industry should explore the possibility to limit the use of bamboo and find the most suitable material for each construction site.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Bamboo is very special material and it's widely used in Hong Kong, but in other places, they don't use bamboo. That means there may be some shortcomings of this material," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think we need to do more research on why some Hong Kong construction companies like to use metal material instead of bamboo."
  <br>
  <br>
  The chairman of the Hong Kong Construction Industry Employees General Union, Chau Sze-kit, told the same programme that it is impossible to completely scrap the use of bamboo scaffold immediately.
  <br>
  <br>
  He suggested the industry should instead look into ways of implementing safety mechanisms when using either bamboo or metal scaffold.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee has told his Macau counterpart the two SARs are "as close as brothers" with solid economic and trade relations.
 <br>
  <br>
  He also said, during the exchange with Macau Chief Executive Sam Hou-fai on Friday, that the two cities could enjoy the fruits of economic development by taking part in the development of the Greater Bay Area.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Lee said that the two cities are as close as brothers, with frequent people-to-people and cultural exchanges, alongside solid economic and trade relations. He noted that the One Country, Two Systems principle is a good policy for maintaining the long-term prosperity and stability of Hong Kong and Macau," a government statement read.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He also noted that Hong Kong and Macau, both of which are core cities of the [Greater Bay Area], can achieve complementarity and participate in and promote the development of the [Greater Bay Area] together, benefiting the people of both cities with the fruits of economic development."
  <br>
  <br>
  It was Sam's first visit to Hong Kong since becoming Macau's leader.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a separate social media post, the chief executive expressed hope the two cities would cooperate further under the leadership of Sam to carry out the four expectations laid out by President Xi Jinping in Macau.
  <br>
  <br>
  In December last year, Xi directed Macau to diversify its economy, improve governance, build a high-level platform to enhance China's international connections, and safeguard social harmony and stability.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A senior Beijing official on Friday called on mainland enterprises to take part in the Northern Metropolis project as part of efforts to fully back the Hong Kong government.
 <br>
  <br>
  Zheng Yanxiong, director of the central government's liaison office, told a reception that state-owned companies should also support the SAR in integrating into the country's development.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I hope state-owned enterprises will make good use of Hong Kong's unique advantages of having the backing of the motherland and being connected to the rest of the world," Zheng said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Mainland companies should continue to boost their investment in Hong Kong, and constantly improve their business strategies. They should also proactively take part in the Northern Metropolis development, fully support Hong Kong in consolidating its status as a financial, shipping, and trade centre, and in building an international innovation and technology centre."
  <br>
  <br>
  Zheng also urged companies to take root in Hong Kong and contribute to society.
  <br>
  <br>
  At the same event, Chief Executive John Lee described contributions to the Northern Metropolis development as "an investment with good returns" as he called on mainland firms to support the project.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hetao Shenzhen-Hong Kong Science and Technology Innovation Co-operation Zone, located within the metropolis area, is an important platform for collaboration in the Greater Bay Area, Lee added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The government will be innovative and use creative thinking to combine market forces, to promote the development of the Northern Metropolis, including that of the co-operation zone, so as to allow the first batch of industries to enter the region as soon as possible," he said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The government has backed a request by CUHK Medical Centre to extend a loan repayment period, saying it doesn't want to end up having to take back the hospital's site due to a default.
 <br>
  <br>
  In 2023, legislators agreed to a two-year extension to repayments of a HK$4 billion government loan, in view of financial difficulties brought on by the pandemic.

  <br>
  The medical centre is now seeking another extension, of three years, saying it expects to make losses in the current financial year as well as in the next one, and its cash balance is insufficient to cover the repayments at present.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a Legco panel meeting on Friday, some lawmakers expressed concern that by 2028, the Chinese University would still be struggling to pay off the loan.
  <br>
  <br>
  "What will the hospital do to tackle such a big funding gap? I'm sure no one wants the hospital to come back to Legco for another repayment extension after three years," said DAB lawmaker Chan Wing-kwong, with the party's Starry Lee echoing his concerns.
  <br>
  <br>
  The chairman of the university's council, John Chai, told legislators that the medical centre will cut costs and find ways to boost revenue, for example by introducing more in-patient beds.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There are a pocket of measures, including strengthening the business model through governance, through better management of the operations, looking into means of increasing avenues of revenue, looking into resource efficiency," Chai said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Health Secretary Lo Chung-mau said if Legco doesn't approve the new extension before the middle of next month, CUHK will have to start repaying a first instalment of over HK$550 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If the medical centre fails to repay the loan, it is clearly stipulated in the contract that there will be an additional interest rate of three percent per annum," Lo said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If it still fails to repay the loan in the worst case scenario, the government will take back the medical centre, including the site and all the buildings or structures. We don't want to see this situation."
  <br>
  <br>
  The extension request will be submitted to Legco's Finance Committee for further discussion.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Organisers of a pop-culture festival in the city on Friday said they were offering a refund to people who bought faulty priority tickets this week for the event next month.
 <br>
  <br>
  The mishap had to do with the popular K-pop girl group, NJZ, formerly known as New Jeans, who will be performing on March 23, the last day of the three-day festival.
  <br>
  <br>
  But fans were left disappointed when the tickets they bought through Cityline had the wrong date printed.
  <br>
  <br>
  ComplexCon Hong Kong said it was now refunding ticket holders who filed complaints with the Consumer Council, or made formal enquiries with ComplexCon or Cityline on or before Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "To apply for the refund, please send the valid ticket and the confirmation email from Cityline, using the e-mail account you used to purchase the tickets, to ticketing_support_0210@complexconhk.com by 5pm Hong Kong time on [Sunday]," it said in a statement posted on its website.
  <br>
  <br>
  Organisers said the refund would not include handling fees charged by Cityline, and they were working with the platform on more details as to when the payment would go through.
  <br>
  <br>
  ComplexCon Hong Kong said it reserves the right to have the final say if there are any objections and disputes over the refund arrangements.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier, the Consumer Council said it had received more than 50 complaints over the matter, involving some HK$220,000.

    'More schools should join free HPV jabs scheme'

<div class="itemFullText">
 Lawmakers are calling for more secondary schools to get involved in the government's HPV vaccine catch-up programme, saying the current participation rate was not ideal.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Department of Health has purchased 180,000 HPV jabs for 52,000 female students to take two doses for free.
  <br>
  <br>
  But only 3,700 students were inoculated as 34 percent of schools have refused or have yet to sign up to the scheme that was rolled out last year, blaming manpower problems or scheduling issues.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dr David Lam from the medical sector said two doses of the HPV vaccine could offer lifelong protection.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The 9-valent HPV vaccine that we have right now can cover most of the viruses causing cervical cancer. It can prevent the infection caused by these viruses," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This means it has very wide coverage. Apart from this, it's also very safe. Medical evidence has shown that its effectiveness can reach 90 percent or more."
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted that side effects, such as headaches and nausea, are mild.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elizabeth Quat from the DAB urged the government to step up promotion of the vaccine, saying that many parents were unaware of the free programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  It costs at least HK$3,000 for two HPV jabs in the private sector, she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The number of cervical cancer cases in Hong Kong has surged by almost 30 percent in the past decade.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2022, the disease was the ninth deadliest cancer in the SAR.

    Tragedy prompts calls for database of at-risk families

<div class="itemFullText">
 The government should set up a database of at-risk elderly people, a lawmaker said on Friday, a day after a man in his 70s was found dead with his son unharmed beside him.
 <br>
  <br>
  Police were alerted on Thursday when security personnel detected a foul odour coming from a flat at Butterfly Estate in Tuen Mun.
  <br>
  <br>
  The force said officers discovered the body of the 78-year-old man.
  <br>
  <br>
  His 44-year-old son, who is reportedly mentally challenged, was next to the elder.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Friday, lawmaker Bill Tang said authorities should consolidate the data they have about the city's senior citizens, noting that government units like the Social Welfare Department and the Hospital Authority hold the majority of information about these individuals.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The government can and has to integrate such database and form a high-risk elderly and family database, and facilitate the different kinds of social service organisations and community organisations... to care [for] and reach such kind of high-risk families," Tang told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  One way to check up on such households would be to install sensors on devices around the flat, Tang said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the sensor would be triggered and send an alert if the home's gate, for example, has not been touched for 48 hours.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fellow legislator Stanley Li said the tragedy highlighted the need to shore up support for carers, adding the administration should offer more training for people to become caretakers.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Social Welfare Department expressed concern about the incident, saying it has arranged for social workers to contact the family and provide assistance.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is understood the family involved was not a case under the department.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's exhibition activities fully returned to pre-pandemic levels last year, with the number of visitors to the Convention and Exhibition Centre topping eight million, up 35 percent year-on-year, according to the centre's operator.
 <br>
  <br>
  Monica Lee-Müller, managing director at Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre (Management) Limited, said the centre hosted 812 events in 2024, including 100 international exhibitions and conferences.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said it will host more large-scale finance and technology-related events this year to assist with the SAR's fintech development.
  <br>
  <br>
  This includes Consensus Hong Kong 2025 on February 18-20, when more than 8,000 bitcoin, blockchain and Web3 professionals are expected to gather and discuss industry trends, before another conference in August specifically featuring bitcoins.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, the hospitality sector veteran said the centre has been rolling out more measures, such as setting up Muslim-friendly facilities, to cater to the demands of diverse international visitors, especially those from the Middle East and Asean members.
  <br>
  <br>
  One of the highlights of last year, she said, was the beauty event Cosmopack Asia 2024, when 74 percent of over 60,000 participants were from overseas, and the number of Middle East exhibitors rose 40 percent year-on-year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The number of visitors for consumption-related events also rose to a new record over the past 12 months, with sales during Pet Show 2025 last week exceeding HK$100 million, the highest among such events.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee-Müller said the centre will innovate and host a new event, International Food Tasting Festival 2025, in April to further boost consumption, adding that over 600 exhibitors have already signed up.

    Tougher jail terms introduced for space oil offences

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong on Friday added four substances to its list of dangerous drugs, a move which significantly increases the maximum punishments for people caught consuming, possessing, trafficking or manufacturing space oil.
 <br>
  <br>
  Users and those found with the space oil drug now risk prison terms of up to seven years and a fine as high as HK$1 million, while manufacturers or traffickers of any of the substances involved – etomidate, metomidate, propoxate and isopropoxate – can be jailed for life and hit with HK$5 million in fines.
  <br>
  <br>
  Previously, the maximum prison term for space oil, under prescription drug regulations, was two years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Commissioner for Narcotics Kesson Lee said the tougher penalties will be a bigger deterrent.
  <br>
  <br>
  "By listing the substances as dangerous drugs, we give greater powers to law enforcement agencies," Lee said on an RTHK programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Officers can seize the proceeds of drug traffickers after applying to the courts. And if the traffickers had used young people for trafficking, we can also demand the court to pass heavier sentences."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Community Drug Advisory Council said the increased penalties are helpful, but they won't completely stop people from supplying or using space oil.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There will still be people taking risks for drug trafficking, and some will continue taking the drug," the council's executive director, David Ng, said on the same programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  "After all, space oil has been popular among young people for over two years in Hong Kong. Right now, we can say the drug has taken root here. Information on how to buy and consume it is all over many circles among youngsters."
  <br>
  <br>
  Ng called for different levels of intervention with young people, including new measures targeting those who smoke e-cigarettes, as these can be used to take the drug.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hope remains for the Hong Kong, China men's curling team, which is aiming to win the city's first ever medal at the Asian Winter Games, even after losing to South Korea in the semifinals on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The SAR squad of Jason Chang, Martin Yan, Cheng Ching-nam, Chung Cheuk-hei and Ma Chi-lap were outmatched early in Harbin.
  <br>
  <br>
  Unable to catch up, they lost 2-13 against the South Koreans.
  <br>
  <br>
  The result sent them into a bronze medal match on Friday morning against the national team, which lost 6-7 to the Philippines in the other semifinal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier, the SAR men's team beat Kazakhstan in the playoffs to win their spot in the final four.
  <br>
  <br>
  This is the first time that Hong Kong has sent a curling team to the Games, and the men's team has now become the sole hope for the SAR to secure a spot on the podium.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Panda lovers wishing to catch a glimpse of Ocean Park's new twin cubs can opt for a VIP session each day, with registration for the private visit opening on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The pair, the first pandas to be born in Hong Kong, will make their public debut on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ocean Park chairman Paulo Pong said the public could meet the twins from 10am to 3pm every day, with the facility expected to welcome up to 5,000 visitors daily.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said people could also choose to pay HK$1,500 each for a special, 30-minute visit before the park opens each day. The first visit will be on February 18.
  <br>
  <br>
  Each session will start at around 9.30am and can accommodate up to 40 people, Pong said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Ticket holders can get early admission and have a dedicated session to meet the pandas. Each visitor will have to pay 1,500 dollars. After deducting costs, the revenue will be used for the park's giant panda conservation work," Pong told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For the sake of animal welfare, there will not be any activities for people to interact with or hold the giant pandas."
  <br>
  <br>
  The pair of panda cubs might not appear at the same time to meet the public because they are still young, Pong added.

 Shenzhen Bay Port will be closed from 2am to 11am on February 23rd for a cross-border marathon event.
 <br>
  <br>
  At most 100 runners, six from Hong Kong, will take part in the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Marathon, which doubles as a test event for the 15th National Games.
  <br>
  <br>
  The event later this month features a men's race and a women's race.
  <br>
  <br>
  The women’s race begins at 7am while the men’s race starts half an hour later.
  <br>
  <br>
  The athletes will run for two kilometres in Shenzhen before entering Hong Kong through the Shenzhen Bay Port.
  <br>
  <br>
  They will run along the Hong Kong-Shenzhen Western Corridor towards the south until they get to the turning point.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong section is about 21 kilometres in total.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ken Wong, the Transport Department's principal transport officer, urged passengers to use the MTR East Rail Line to travel to Shenzhen via Lo Wu and Lok Ma Chau on the day.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also urged motorists to steer clear of  border points while the race is on.
  <br>
  <br>
  “According to operating records on a typical Sunday, there will be about 26,000 passengers, two-bound, using Shenzhen Bay Port... and according to our records, there will be about 2,000 cross-boundary private cars using Shenzhen Bay Port on a typical Sunday,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  There will be no spectators for this event.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Because the Hong Kong session for this race will be mostly either on the highway or in the restricted area near the cross boundary control points, so for this time there will not be any public viewing area for the general spectators,” Yeung Tak-keung, the head of the National Games Coordination Office said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The race will be broadcast live on RTHK’s website.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeung added that customs clearance arrangements for the athletes will be similar to the cross-border cycling test event in November last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The athletes have to submit their information to the organising party. Once verified, there will be a facial recognition and the ID and passports will have to be vetted beforehand,” he said
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that  runners have to go through another round of inspection on the race day.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A polling body has announced it will suspend all self-funded research activities and surveys indefinitely and focus on existing commissioned studies.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, the Hong Kong Public Opinion Research Institute (HKPORI) also said it will change its business model or shut down.
  <br>
  <br>
  Its president and CEO Robert Chung said he welcomes interested parties to take over the institute.
  <br>
  <br>
  "HKPORI has always been law-abiding, but in the current environment, it has to pause its promotion of scientific polling. The research team hopes there will be another opportunity to resume its work," the statement read.
  <br>
  <br>
  "HKPORI is actively exploring all possible options, (and) it will announce its final decision when the time is right."
  <br>
  <br>
  Former HKPORI deputy executive director Chung Kim-wah is wanted by the police for alleged national security violations, and Robert Chung was earlier questioned by officers in their investigation into whether he or the institute had provided assistance to an absconder.

<img alt="The SAR's men's team coach Carey Durant says the city will reach greater heights in international competition. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1791470_2_20250213153829.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong, China Ice Hockey Association has filed a complaint to the International Ice Hockey Federation regarding the altercation involving the Turkmenistan team at the Asian Winter Games in Harbin.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chairman Sherman Chan made the remarks upon returning to Hong Kong with the men's team on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  A brawl broke out after the SAR defeated Turkmenistan in a match on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Three SAR players were injured.
  <br>
  <br>
  Team captain Tony Leung hopes the altercation will not affect people's impression of the sport.
  <br>
  <br>
  He told reporters at the airport that he appreciated the team's restraint in the altercation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Clashes are inevitable in ice hockey. This incident is very rare, especially as it happened during a post-match handshake," he said,
  <br>
  <br>
  "At the same time, there are rarely fights in international competitions, or even during the match. Therefore, this is an exceptional case."
  <br>
  <br>
  He expressed his gratitude to Chief Executive John Lee and Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism Rosanna Law for visiting the injured players after the scuffle.
  <br>
  <br>
  Coach Carey Durant said the team dealt with the adversity very well.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the team's performance in Harbin would be used for what he called, "a measuring stick” to roll out development plans for the association, as well as the sport itself.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There were a lot of tears when we lost those games. And that's a good thing because that means our players expected to go all the way to try and win a gold medal," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are going to get there. I promise Hong Kong that we will get there one day. It’s just a process that we take and we take this very seriously in representing Hong Kong."
  <br>
  <br>
  The team wrapped up their journey at the Games by losing to top-seeded Kazakhstan in the quarter-finals.

    'Higher tram fares would help operator retain talent'
   </title>

<img alt="" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1791449_1_20250213121710.jpg&q=65">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An increase in tram fares would enable the operator to put wages up to find and keep hold of talent, a union chief said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong Tramways is hoping to get the go-ahead to increase adult fares from HK$3 to HK$3.30, child fares from HK$1.50 to HK$1.60 and fares for the over 65s from HK$1.30 to HK$1.50.
  <br>
  <br>
  The company says passenger figures are still about 15 percent down on 2018, before the protests and Covid pandemic.
  <br>
  <br>
  The chairman of the Hong Kong Tramway Workers Union, Yeh Yung-sheng, said fare increases would help the company attract new workers, some of whom would need to learn specialist skills.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The whole of the tram's chassis is made by hand. It's not built from parts that are bought from the market... So we need to pass on such techniques," he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You cannot just find any workers who can do such work, and it takes time for us to train such workers. [So] if the pay is not good enough, then they might feel that they do not want to learn such techniques."
  <br>
  <br>
  But speaking on the same RTHK programme, lawmaker Chan Hok-fung, who is a member of Legco's transport panel, said Hong Kong Tramways will lose even more passengers if fares go up.
  <br>
  <br>
  "At present, with the existing prices, trams do not have the so-called competitive advantage. And if you raise the fares further, the gap between the fares of trams and those of buses will be further narrowed, and then even more passenger traffic will be lost," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The advantage of trams in the past was not their speed, but their prices, because it was cost-effective, but if they do not even have that advantage, their original passengers will be lost."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said the company could instead take steps to boost passenger numbers, for example by introducing Pokémon or panda-themed trams.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong Tramways says the proposed fare increases would mainly be spent on renovating its fleet and expanding non-ticket revenue projects.

    Taxi union threatens strike over ride-hailing services

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A taxi drivers' union says members will go on strike for at least five days from March 5 unless the authorities take immediate action against illegal ride-hailing services.
 <br>
  <br>
  Wong Yu-ting, chairman of the Hong Kong Tele-call Taxi Association, told Commercial Radio that they have been left with no choice but to take action.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The government has stated that using private cars for the carriage of passengers for reward is illegal, ride-hailing services are illegal, and not having insurance is illegal, everything is illegal," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But they allow [ride-hailing service] platforms to exist, and indulge them."
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong said the industry has been discussing the issue with the government for 11 years.
  <br>
  <br>
  In an earlier response to news of a possible strike, the government said it wrote to the companies involved reminding them of legislation which bans drivers from taking passengers for money unless they have a permit.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Transport Department said a working group under the Transport Advisory Committee that is looking at regulating ride-hailing platforms has a meeting arranged with operators and the taxi industry on February 19.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials urged the taxi industry to stay calm, be rational and put the public interest first.

Professor William Wong says their agreement is the first step of collaboration towards the goal of developing an open and ethical AI.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A transparent and innovative environment is essential to the development of artificial development, according to a systems engineering professor, although the industry also needs to be properly regulated to prevent the technology from being misused.
 <br>
  <br>
  William Wong, the director of Chinese University's Centre for Innovation and Technology and a lawmaker, also described as a "surprise" the snub by the United States and the United Kingdom to an international AI declaration at the end of a summit in Paris.
  <br>
  <br>
  The document, endorsed by dozens of nations including China, India and hosts France, pledges an open, inclusive and ethical approach to AI development.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on
  <a href="https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/news-programmes/this-episode.htm?cmsid=77" target="_blank">
   <u>
    <b>
     RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme
    </b>
   </u>
  </a>
  , Wong said it is common for industry representatives to come together and discuss the path forward for AI.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have been doing that in all universities, not to mention nations, because we understand that artificial intelligence, when you want to apply it, it's high risk because you... leave everything to a machine," he explained.
  <br>
  <br>
  "What happens if it misbehaves?"
  <br>
  <br>
  He added the agreement is just the first step of collaboration towards the goal of developing open, transparent, trustworthy and ethical AI technologies.
  <br>
  <br>
  'What they have to do is to share more information, and then they would come to a consensus and write out guidelines. When you look at what is happening now, for example even in America, the UK, and France and China, their governments have also issued guidelines in the ethical part of AI."
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked if DeepSeek, the Chinese language model developed by a Hangzhou-based startup, could face stiff competition, Wong said that's not necessarily a bad thing.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You call it competition from the business side. But also you should look... (from the perspective of) the advancement of sciences as well," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You have to compare with each other; you compete with each other. And then it comes with more advanced technology. You should look at the positive side of it."

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong, China Ice Hockey Association on Wednesday said the men's team put in a great performance at the Asian Winter Games in Harbin.
 <br>
  <br>
  The team wrapped up their journey on Tuesday after losing to top-seeded Kazakhstan 24-0 in the quarter-finals.
  <br>
  <br>
  The association's chairman, Sherman Chan, said at least half of the Kazakhstan team are professional players, while many SAR players are either students or have full-time jobs.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said Hong Kong's performance wasn't affected by a post-match altercation with Turkmenistan opponents on Sunday that left three of the SAR players injured.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This game [against Kazakhstan] definitely showcased the team has been very disciplined as well as in terms of their quality, mental-wise, they are well prepared for any kind of challenge," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think obviously after the incident, a few of the players were upset. But... they mentally recovered very well and we all have this common goal to focus on the Games."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said he has high expectations for Hong Kong when it comes to the World Championships in Mexico in April.

 Three members of the same family have died in Yuen Long in what police say is a suspected murder-suicide case.
 <br>
  <br>
  A man, 93, and his son, 69, were found with multiple stab wounds inside a flat in Chun Hing New Village after police were called at around 8pm on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  A 19-year-old man, who was the grandson and son of the deceased, visited the flat before later falling to his death from Yuet Ping House at Long Ping Estate, officers said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The deceased inside the flat had a lot of injuries, and they also bled a lot, so it was difficult to conduct forensic inspections at the scene because it required a lot of cleaning work to determine the cause of death and even the number of injuries," Assistant District Commander Johnathan Kwan told the media.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The direction of our investigation includes the background of the three deceased, their family relationships, and whether they were involved in any disputes or property disputes."

    Team removed over Greater Bay Airlines cancellations

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Greater Bay Airlines on Wednesday said it had removed a team of commercial and planning managers, which oversaw the allocation of aircraft resources, due to the recent flight cancellations by the carrier.
 <br>
  <br>
  In the airline's report to the Civil Aviation Department, it said a lack of internal communication and insufficient customer service support exacerbated the carrier's scheduling failures.
  <br>
  <br>
  Around 5,500 passengers were believed to have been affected by the cancellation of 128 flights in February and March.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to details released on Wednesday, four of the cancellations were by a charterer which put on extra flights following the deadly plane crash in South Korea's Muan International Airport in December.
  <br>
  <br>
  The airline also assured the move had "no impact on the safety" of its operations.
  <br>
  <br>
  The report said the new team – comprising experienced personnel as part of a reform – had failed to observe the company's protocol for cancellation decision making, and also "took excessive time to make decisions" and "communicated the decision poorly".
  <br>
  <br>
  It noted the team did not consider the airline's customer service response capability, which did not have sufficient resources to handle "such a significant number of customer interactions at one time".
  <br>
  <br>
  "[The airline] remains committed to assuring a reliable service to our passengers. The new team concerned has been removed from the company," the report said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Also in the report, the airline put forward a number of measures such as strengthening internal procedures for flight scheduling, boosting communication, and ensuring fleet and manpower stability and reliability.
  <br>
  <br>
  Transport minister Mable Chan expressed hope Greater Bay Airlines had learned a lesson, adding it has to regularly report on its operations to the authorities.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[The Air Transport Licensing Authority] has asked the airline to submit regular reports on a monthly basis. If the airline is planning to cancel flights in future, it will have to provide a written report to the authority and list out the facts and information of the arrangements," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The airline initially cited a delay in new aircraft delivery and the need for plane inspections for the cancellation, but the report later revealed "a lack of internal communication and a lack of co-operation from customer service operations" as a contributing factor.
  <br>
  <br>
  "From the time when [the airline] shared information at the time of the incident, to now when there's been a detailed report outlining what happened, I believe this is a process," Chan said when asked if the carrier had given an inaccurate explanation at first.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister stressed the administration would consider an airline's operations and performance when making arrangements on flight allocations and air traffic rights.
  <br>
  <br>
  In response, the low-cost carrier again apologised to affected passengers and said it had put in place a number of measures to prevent similar incidents from happening again.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will maintain close contact with the Transport and Logistics Bureau regarding the company's operations, and continue to strive to provide safe and reliable services to our customers," the airline said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 National sporting events staged in Hong Kong later this year are expected to draw more than 100,000 spectators, the government said on Wednesday, as the SAR is set to co-host the National Games with Guangdong and Macau for the first time.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Games, the nation's highest-level multi-sports event, will be held from November 9 to 21.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong will host track cycling, fencing, rugby sevens, beach volleyball, golf, triathlon, men's handball and men's under-22 basketball. Bowling will also be held as a mass participation event.
  <br>
  <br>
  In addition to the National Games, the city will also host several events as part of the 12th National Games for Persons with Disabilities and the 9th National Special Olympic Games in December.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rosanna Law, the secretary for culture, sports and tourism, said officials are working on competition schedules with Guangdong and Macau counterparts.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Macau are discussing the ticketing plans and sales arrangements... The three places will adopt the same sales platform," she said in a written reply to the Legislative Council.
  <br>
  <br>
  There will be about 1,800 athletes taking part in the eight National Games events held in the SAR, with 700 others participating in the December competitions, Law said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is estimated that the events in Hong Kong will attract more than 100,000 spectators from Hong Kong, the mainland and other regions," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[The bureau] is, in collaboration with the relevant departments... conducting a detailed assessment on the traffic and transport arrangements to and from the venues having regard to the transport facilities and capacity of the venues, their past experiences in staging competitions, and the number of participating athletes and spectators for each event."

    E.coli may have spread in hospital washroom: expert

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A suspected E. coli outbreak at Princess Margaret Hospital that is thought to have claimed the life of a doctor and sickened two others could have spread in a washroom, a microbiologist said on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong University's Yuen Kwok-yung told RTHK that this is because the bacteria survive longer in humid conditions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Because they would use the same toilet in their department and that of course could be a place of transmission," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "After using the toilet it would be humid, therefore it is possible that the virus was spread there."
  <br>
  <br>
  Yuen added, however, that since the washroom in question would have been sanitised before samples were taken, the likelihood of finding E.coli there is slim.
  <br>
  <br>
  Three oncologists at the hospital are thought to have caught E. coli. While one died last Friday, the other two only had mild symptoms.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yuen said the deceased oncologist was young and was not known to have been suffering from chronic illnesses, so work was still ongoing to find out why the doctor may have succumbed to such an infection.

    'SAR working to make renminbi trading more convenient'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Christopher Hui, says the administration is working to make renminbi trading more convenient in the SAR.
 <br>
  <br>
  In last year’s Policy Address, the chief executive stated the government wants to promote the global use of renminbi and solidify the city's position as an offshore renminbi business hub.
  <br>
  <br>
  Currently, 24 securities listed on the Hong Kong stock exchange have adopted the dual-counter model, meaning they can be traded in either the Hong Kong dollar or renminbi.
  <br>
  <br>
  On RTHK's Overview Policy programme, Hui noted the next step is to make the model accessible to investors in the Greater Bay Area.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I feel that one very obvious trend after the pandemic is that, even though globalisation has been somewhat affected, regionalisation is very practical and is happening," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Trade between different countries in Asia has increased. When trade increases, there's really no need to use other currencies. I can use a currency that everyone is using."
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister also mentioned that the government is trying out different scenarios to expand the use of digital renminbi.
  <br>
  <br>
  "On one hand, of course, if mainland residents come to Hong Kong, how does our system here accommodate them? If they want to use the digital renminbi, they can do so," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "On the other hand, if I want to use the digital renminbi on the mainland, how do I do that? These are the two areas we are working on."
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister added Hong Kong needs to strengthen its role as a financial services hub, saying this is what makes the city appealing to investors.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A motorcyclist has been hospitalised in a traffic accident also involving a truck on Lung Cheung Road on Wednesday morning.
 <br>
  <br>
  Police received a report at 6:27am about a collision near Tai Po Road.
  <br>
  <br>
  The truck driver allegedly lost control and mounted a slope, causing the vehicle to flip to its side and fall onto the motorcyclist.
  <br>
  <br>
  The motorcyclist was eventually freed by firefighters and rushed to Queen Elizabeth Hospital with leg injuries.
  <br>
  <br>
  The truck driver has since been arrested on suspicion of dangerous driving causing grievous bodily harm.
  <br>
  <br>
  At least one eastbound lane of the major thoroughfare had to be sealed off, creating a tailback which stretched several kilometres to Kwai Chung at one point.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another accident in the opposite direction on Lung Cheung Road, near So Uk Estate, at around 8am saw Tsuen Wan-bound traffic pushed back all the way to Diamond Hill.

 Health officials on Tuesday confirmed that an oncologist at Princess Margaret Hospital died last Friday of a suspected E. coli infection involving hospital staff.
 <br>
  <br>
  Two other oncologists showed symptoms such as fever, stomach pain and diarrhoea. They are in stable condition, and one of them has been discharged.
  <br>
  <br>
  One faeces sample tested positive for Shiga toxin-producing E. coli, while the other two samples, including from the deceased oncologist, came up negative for the bacteria.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Centre for Health Protection and microbiologists from the University of Hong Kong are searching for the infection’s origin.
  <br>
  <br>
  Albert Au, the head of the centre's communicable disease branch said food is one possible source of infection, but the three doctors did not eat the same food or visit the same restaurant.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, they ate in the same staff lounge.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Another possibility would be human-to-human transmission in an infectious environment,” Au said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We have collected over 40 environmental samples from the Department of Oncology office and toilets. We are waiting for the results to confirm whether there was a cross infection due to the environment,” he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  University of Hong Kong microbiologist Yuen Kwok-yung said it is rare to see an adult die from Shiga toxin-producing E. coli, and pointed out that the deceased doctor was healthy with no underlying illnesses.
  <br>
  <br>
  He called on other hospital staff who felt unwell not to take medicine without proper guidance, especially antibiotics, as it could worsen their condition.
  <br>
  <br>
  The hospital has sanitised possible areas of infection, and asked its staff to seek a doctor if they feel unwell.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Secretary for Health Lo Chung-mau expressed sadness over the oncologist’s death.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement released late on Tuesday, Lo said the doctor “was still taking care of patients in the ward right before the onset of symptoms”.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I am deeply moved by the doctor's professionalism, passion for work and care for patients,” Lo said, describing the young doctor as a role model for the healthcare profession.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The Centre for Health Protection…is conducting epidemiological and environmental investigations into the incident at full strength, and will submit a report and give an account to the public as early as possible," he added.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The eventful journey of the Hong Kong, China men's ice hockey team at the Harbin Asian Winter Games came to an end on Tuesday, after they were dumped out of the quarter-finals 24-0 by top-seeded Kazakhstan.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Kazakhs are four-time gold medallists in the competition and are so far unbeaten in this year's tournament after six games.
  <br>
  <br>
  The players from Hong Kong were outmatched early and often, trailing 8-0 after the first period.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Kazakhs continued their strong play in the second by putting seven in the net, followed by another nine in the last period.
  <br>
  <br>
  Four players scored a hat-trick against the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong goalies Cheung Chi-ho and David Lam did manage 56 saves between them.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SAR team made headlines after three of their players were injured in an altercation with Turkmenistan players following a group match on Sunday.

    Top golfers ready for LIV tournament in HK

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 LIV golf is returning to Hong Kong in March, after the SAR hosted the tournament for the first time last year in Fanling.
 <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong will be the third stop of the tournament, following Riyadh, Saudi Arabia and Adelaide, Australia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Patrick Reed, who won the Hong Kong Open last November, is among the players who are slated to take part.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to the press on Tuesday, Reed said he could not wait to return to the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I can't wait to come back. Coming back to the place where I got my 10th win, and also at the same time, to go out and shoot my first 59. It means a lot. I think the biggest thing is the spectators, the fans, the people at the golf course is just spectacular," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Also participating in the team matches, Reed said all his team members are motivated and are ready to give their best.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Everyone out here I feel like is motivated to go out and play well. We're playing for huge prize purses, but at the same time we're playing for bragging rights over not only the other teams, but all the other players," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another LIV player Max Lee, who won the tournament promotion game in Riyadh and previously won a BMW car at the 2023 Hong Kong Open, said the Fanling golf course suits his game.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Fanling golf course, it requires accuracy despite not being that far away, and there are different kinds of valleys. This is similar to where I usually practice. Also, the trees in Fanling are very tall, the wind directions varies. I am the kind of player that excels in hitting low golf shots, and my performance at the venue in the past few years have been satisfactory," he said.

<img alt="The Hong Kong Academy of Medicine says it will hold three seminars before the legislation takes effect in May next year. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1791181_1_20250211162308.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Academy of Medicine on Tuesday said it would introduce a set of guidelines in the first quarter of this year, for doctors to better carry out advance medical directives.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Advance Decision on Life-sustaining Treatment Ordinance was gazetted in November last year, allowing patients to refuse life-sustaining treatments under specific medical conditions when they become mentally incapable of making a decision.
  <br>
  <br>
  Its president Philip Li announced the academy would launch a set of practice guidelines, helping doctors better understand their roles in executing advance directives.
  <br>
  <br>
  The convenor of the academy's advance directives task force, Doris Tse, said most doctors are unfamiliar with the topic.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We'll offer some practical tips on how to discuss the advance care planning with patients and family members and also advise on how to assess the mental capacity," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Then, we will have some instructions on how to sign or complete advance directives and, of course, all these have to be supplemented with case scenarios."
  <br>
  <br>
  Tse added the guidelines help establish a consensus before patients become unable to make a decision, and it can avoid possible disputes.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said the academy would hold three seminars before the legislation officially takes effect in May next year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The academy said people can also save an electronic version of their advance directive on the eHealth system, so doctors at both public and private hospitals can access the documents.

    Scams fuelled rise in crime last year: police chief

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Scams made up nearly half of the 94,000 crimes recorded in Hong Kong over the past year, the police chief said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Delivering an annual roundup to lawmakers, Police Commissioner Raymond Siu said the total number of crimes recorded last year was a five percent rise over the figure for 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  The force logged more than 44,000 scam cases, up about 12 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 10,000 suspects in total were held over offences relating to scams and money laundering, Siu said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He conceded that it is not easy to solve such crimes, with the detection rate at 10.6 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Many of these deception cases happened online or they involved phone scams. A majority of fraudsters rang from somewhere outside Hong Kong. Once the victim became aware of the situation, we're talking about weeks or months after the commission of the crime, so by the time we received the report, it would be too late," Siu said.
  <br>
  <br>
  At the Legislative Council panel meeting, the police chief and a number of lawmakers brought up the problem of mainland students at universities in Hong Kong falling victim to scams.
  <br>
  <br>
  Siu said Hong Kong and mainland officials have discussed how to boost education on scams among students and parents.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said 80 percent of the mainland students falling prey to scams were in their first year in the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  "These students got a call from scammers before the school year started," Siu said. "After the school year started, the students might already be exposed to scam awareness information, so these students would become harder to be scammed."
  <br>
  <br>
  On other crime figures, the police chief said more than 2,000 mainland tourists were arrested last year, with almost half of them picked up over scams and money laundering offences.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a press conference following the meeting, Siu said the force recorded more than 300 cases last year where mainland students were reportedly scammed, involving more than HK$230 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  Looking ahead, the police chief said the force in the coming year would focus on safeguarding national security, fighting crime, especially scam-related ones, and making sure November's National Games will be held in an orderly, safe and secure manner.

    'Tax cuts needed to help individuals and businesses'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong should provide more tax concessions to individuals and businesses in the coming fiscal year, according to the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce (HKGCC).
 <br>
  <br>
  It made suggestions across nine categories about the Budget, which is set to be released later this month, including suggestions on expenditure control and attracting foreign investment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last December, officials said the deficit would be near HK$100 billion, more than double the original estimate of HK$48 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  The chamber’s chairwoman, Agnes Chan, said the public should not worry though, as the city's economy is gradually recovering from the pandemic.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The budget deficit at that time was caused by two major factors -- we have the employment subsidy, the e-consumption voucher. Both took the government [to] over a hundred billion [dollars in deficit]. So that contributed to that year's substantial budget deficit. Then the second year, 2023-24, and the border reopened in February, but we are recovering and the government had adopted a loose monetary policy," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This year, the financial secretary is already saying it's going to be a smaller deficit because we are in a fiscal consolidation year. The measures include raising taxes on the high income earners, and having the double-tier property tax," she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The HKGCC proposed a one-time exemption on salaries tax, personal assessment tax and corporate tax, with an upper limit of HK$3,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  For small and medium sized enterprises, or SMEs, it suggested the government provide a long-term fixed-rate mortgage.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said both measures could reduce the burden towards taxpayers and stabilise the operation costs of SMEs.
  <br>
  <br>
  In terms of managing expenditure, she said a review of the government's structure would be needed, such as merging organisations with overlapping duties to cut costs.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said an example would be the Office for Attracting Strategic Enterprises (Oases) and InvestHK, in which both offices aim to attract foreign investment.
  <br>
  <br>
  The chamber also said the government could consider setting up a digital services tax, in which foreign telecommunication companies providing entertainment or consumption services in the city would have to pay up to five percent in tax per year.
  <br>
  <br>
  As for foreign investment, it said a three-year tax exemption period could be granted to companies that relocate their headquarters back to Hong Kong.

    Govt stands by idea of windows in all subdivided flats

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A proposal that all subdivided flats must have a window for ventilation purposes to comply with new minimum standards has met with opposition, the government said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  A public consultation exercise on a planned regulatory regime for subdivided flats ended on Monday, with thousands of submissions received.
  <br>
  <br>
  Housing Secretary Winnie Ho told Commercial Radio that many of the submissions included concerns about the proposed window requirement, with some people suggesting that exhaust fans could be installed instead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho said such a compromise would not be ideal.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If there are no windows, would it feel like living in a cupboard?" she questioned.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Even though we received suggestions during the consultation period saying 'let's not have windows and just install exhaust fans instead', I think windows are important to many people."
  <br>
  <br>
  The government has suggested that windows that face an area enclosed on all four sides would not be good enough.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Hayson Chan, who chairs a concern group for subdivided flat owners, said such windows could be complimented with an exhaust fan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho said if the enclosed space is big enough or has good air quality, this restriction could be eased.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said other feedback on the plans includes calls for a proposed 12 to 24-month grace period for owners to get their flats up to scratch to be extended to 36 months.

    SAR opposes higher US tariffs: Eric Chan

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Acting Chief Executive Eric Chan on Tuesday spoke out against higher US tariffs on Chinese goods, including those from the SAR.
 <br>
  <br>
  US President Donald Trump earlier signed an executive order imposing an additional 10 percent tariff on all Chinese imports, and the Hong Kong government said last week it would file a complaint with the World Trade Organization (WTO).
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is absolutely inconsistent with WTO rules... and also they have totally disregarded that Hong Kong is a separate customs territory," Chan said ahead of the weekly Executive Council meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SAR has been calling on the US to take immediate action "to rectify its wrongdoing".
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan also described American policies as "constantly changing", causing inconvenience to people who wanted to send parcels to their relatives and friends in the US.
  <br>
  <br>
  Parcel services to the US resumed on Tuesday after Washington confirmed it would not impose additional duty on mail items containing goods from Hongkong Post.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hongkong Post had temporarily stopped accepting US-bound parcels, as the United States Postal Service last week suspended inbound parcels from mainland China and the SAR and then reversed the decision in less than a day.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Beijing's top official overseeing Hong Kong and Macau affairs has directed SAR officials to better integrate the city into the country's development in areas such as finance, the acting chief executive said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Xia Baolong, director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, earlier made an inspection trip to Shenzhen, during which he was briefed on plans to boost Hong Kong's economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Acting Chief Executive Eric Chan, who was there with the top mainland official, said it was a "very good occasion" to communicate and understand the central government's thoughts on the territory.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Director Xia is very, very concerned about Hong Kong. He highly recognised the work of the Hong Kong SAR government under the leadership of the chief executive," Chan told reporters ahead of the Executive Council meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He also directed that we should try our very best to integrate into the mainland's national policies, especially the Greater Bay Area initiative. This is very important to Hong Kong."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan also said authorities would work with their Guangdong counterparts to make good use of the Northern Metropolis and the Hetao Shenzhen-Hong Kong Science and Technology Innovation Co-operation Zone.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked if Xia had mentioned ways to tackle a budget deficit such as cutting or freezing civil servants' pay, Chan said there is a mechanism to adjust the salaries of public workers every year.
  <br>
  <br>
  A host of factors would be considered before the Executive Council decides whether to approve an adjustment proposal, he noted.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Acting Chief Executive Eric Chan on Tuesday said an opening ceremony would be held at the Kai Tak Sports Park on March 1, marking its official commencement.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking ahead of the weekly Executive Council meeting, Chan said the 90-minute ceremony would start at 6.30pm, featuring large-scale dance and sports performances by local and mainland performers.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said there would be four themes, showcasing Hong Kong's role in sports and cultural exchanges in different eras.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said the opening of the park would be an historic moment, and authorities would seize the opportunity to unleash the potential of the facility.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Kai Tak Sports Park, as Hong Kong's largest sports infrastructure ever, will bring new experiences [in terms of] sports, leisure, dining and shopping for Hong Kong people, as well as mainland and overseas tourists," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I have high expectations and confidence [in] the opening of the sports park. I believe more large-scale sports, cultural and recreational events will be held in Hong Kong, promoting the development of sports and other industries."
  <br>
  <br>
  He said more than a dozen of test events had been held at the sports park, and expressed confidence the facility would be ready for its opening in March.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office director Xia Baolong was briefed by Financial Secretary Paul Chan on his plan to boost the economy during his inspection trip to the tech zones in Hetao and Qianhai on Sunday, according to a government statement.
 <br>
  <br>
  The statement said Xia told the SAR to "continue to be bold in reform, dare to break new ground, and to innovate continuously".
  <br>
  <br>
  The top mainland official was accompanied by Acting Chief Executive Eric Chan and the financial secretary in his visit to the Hong Kong Park of the Hetao Shenzhen-Hong Kong Science and Technology Innovation Co-operation Zone.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xia listened to officials’ presentations on the latest development progress and the focus of work for the park.
  <br>
  <br>
  He later visited the Qianhai cooperation zone and hosted a four-hour discussion session, in which Paul Chan told Xia on what he will do to boost the economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xia and SAR officials also discussed how Hong Kong could accelerate reforms to foster progress, enhance cooperation with Guangdong and better integrate into the Greater Bay Area.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xia said he hopes the SAR government would thoroughly implement the spirit of the important speeches by President Xi Jinping in Macau and the third plenary session of the 20th Central Committee of the Communist Party.
  <br>
  <br>
  Paul Chan said the SAR government is determined to undertake reforms, dare to be innovative, and actively integrate into the national development and align with national development strategies.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also said Hong Kong will co-ordinate development and security, as well as maintain financial and economic security, while promoting the acceleration of economic progress amid a complex external environment.

    Hongkong Post to accept US-bound parcels again

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hongkong Post said it will resume parcel services to the United States from Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Authorities said they made the announcement after the US confirmed it would not impose additional duty on mail items containing goods from Hongkong Post.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last week, Hongkong Post stopped accepting US-bound parcels, as the United States Postal Service (USPS) suspended inbound parcels from mainland China and the SAR and then reversed the decision in less than a day.
  <br>
  <br>
  The suspension by the USPS followed President Donald Trump's order for an additional 10 percent levy on Chinese imports, alongside an elimination of a duty-free exemption for low value packages.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hongkong Post reminds members of the public that the United States government is constantly changing policies and may further change its policies at any time. There may also be backlogs for mail items destined to the United States and delay of delivery, which may cause inconvenience or even losses to the public," a statement read.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government also reiterated its strong disapproval of additional US duty imposed on Hong Kong products, and urged Washington "to take urgent actions to rectify its wrongdoing".

    'Flavoured tobacco ban will further hit bar business'

<img alt="The Long-term Tobacco Policy Concern Group said a ban on flavoured tobacco and shisha would drive customers away. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1791056_1_20250210185326.jpg&q=60">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A smoking policy concern group on Monday said a government proposal banning flavoured cigarettes and shisha products would greatly affect the business of local bars.
 <br>
  <br>
  This came a day after health minister Lo Chung-mau said the government aims to table an amendment to the anti-smoking law at Legco in April, which will include a ban on e-cigarettes and flavoured tobacco, among other measures.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Long-term Tobacco Policy Concern Group said according to its survey of 514 bar customers in Lan Kwai Fong and Knutsford Terrace last month, four out of five said they would go to bars less often if the government pushes ahead with the ban, while 70 percent said they will consider visiting bars on the mainland instead.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Licensed Bar and Club Association of HK echoed that view, saying "extreme" tobacco-control measures would deal a further blow to the nighttime economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  In response, the Health Bureau said shisha is only allowed in 10 percent of the city's bars, so it won't have a strong impact.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bureau also said the government will consider offering a grace period to bars and patrons before the new law takes effect.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A football legend's no-show at an exhibition match and the sudden closure of a local gym chain have mostly contributed to the rise of complaints filed to Hong Kong's consumer watchdog over the past year.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Consumer Council on Monday said it received 40,839 complaints in total last year, up 20 percent from 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  Excluding complaints regarding mainland online shopping platforms, the figure stood at 37,590 in 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The increase was mainly due to two disputes during the year which raised widespread public concern and affected many consumers, including [Lionel] Messi's controversial non-appearance at an exhibition match in February, as well as the abrupt closure of the Physical Fitness chain in September," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Complaints arising from the two incidents involved about HK$210 million, the watchdog said.
  <br>
  <br>
  There were 1,476 complaints relating to Messi and another 5,619 about the fitness chain.
  <br>
  <br>
  The council said "food and entertainment services" remained the category that received the most complaints for the third straight year, with 5,810 cases involving over HK$15.2 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  Food and entertainment-related complaints "still accounted for the lion's share" overall even after excluding certain incidents like Messi's no-show and Physical Fitness' closure, the body added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Overall, the watchdog noted the SAR was affected by a number of factors such as the global economic downturn, the boom in the digital economy, the trend of northbound travel, and the resumption of the multi-entry visa scheme for Shenzhen residents.
  <br>
  <br>
  "While new traders entered the market, industries were faced with unprecedented opportunities and challenges, and some businesses made the difficult decision to close down, resulting in a surge in related consumer complaints," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The council urged businesses to "promptly improve the quality of services and goods" to be more competitive and appealing, to stimulate people's desire to spend.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The chef de mission of the Hong Kong, China delegation to the Harbin Asian Winter Games, Kenneth Fok, on Monday said the international governing body for ice hockey has suspended four Turkmenistan players involved in an altercation with SAR players.
 <br>
  <br>
  Three Hong Kong players were injured in a post-match scuffle after defeating Turkmenistan 5-1 in a match on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fok said the Sports Federation and Olympic Committee of Hong Kong, China (SF&OC) welcomed "the quick and fair response" from the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF).
  <br>
  <br>
  "We were notified on Monday afternoon that the IIHF has suspended with immediate effect the four Turkmen athletes, who had intentionally assaulted the Hong Kong team," he said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fok said the Turkmenistan players wouldn't be able to play in their final game of the tournament, a matchup for ninth place against Kuwait in Monday evening.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also confirmed that the three SAR players only suffered light injuries and would be ready to play in the quarter-finals on Monday night.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I want to emphasise that our Team Hong Kong China's players had always stayed respectful and friendly when competing, even when facing disrespectful and threatening actions," Fok said in a video released to the press before the suspension announcement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our players definitely did not retaliate or do anything reckless. This is worthy of our praise and recognition."

 The University of Hong Kong Faculty of Medicine has unveiled a new oral formulation of arsenic trioxide for the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukaemia, otherwise known as APL.
 <br>
  <br>
  APL is a blood cancer that occurs suddenly with a high fatality rate, leading to bone marrow dysfunction and increased risk of infections and bleeding.
  <br>
  <br>
  The new treatment, called Oral-ATO, obviates the need for chemotherapy and bone marrow transplant, which decreases the relapse rate.
  <br>
  <br>
  Clinical Associate Professor at HKU, and the study's lead investigator, Dr Harinder Gill, said that with all abnormal cells gone, around one percent of patients under this treatment experience a relapse.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So most of these patients are essentially cured with this oral formulation," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Moreover, patients who take this new treatment do not need to be hospitalised and can just go to an out-patient clinic to collect medications after the initial diagnosis, allowing them to retain a normal life.
  <br>
  <br>
  The production cost for this new oral formula is also much lower than traditional treatments, hence it is currently free and available at all hospitals in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But since this is an uncommon form of acute leukaemia, we would have this treatment centralised at Queen Mary Hospital and the University of Hong Kong where these patients would receive meticulous initial supportive care to reduce the early death rate," Dr Gill added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Oral-ATO has obtained orphan drug designation from US Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency.
  <br>
  <br>
  The research was done in collaboration with experts from around Asia, as well as teams from the UK and the US.

    Do more to get tourists on HK hiking trails: lawmaker

 Lawmaker Vincent Cheng on Monday called for the government to develop more facilities around Hong Kong's hiking trails as a way to attract more tourists.
 <br>
  <br>
  This came after a charity chaired by Cheng polled more than 380 people from late January to early February. Around half of the respondents agreed there was a lack of water fountains, and almost one-third were concerned about the safety of trails.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cheng said the government could provide more comprehensive information on different trails.
  <br>
  <br>
  "One of our suggestions is we do have more professionals to evaluate all trails in Hong Kong, classify them into different difficulties, so we can provide more beginner-friendly trails as well," he said at a press briefing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cheng added that as well as increasing the number of water fountains and toilets, the administration should set up stations for hikers to get replenishments, taking reference from Japan's mountain houses and Nepal's tea houses.
  <br>
  <br>
  In terms of promoting trails globally, Cheng said Hong Kong could participate in international travel exhibitions and invite celebrities such as actor Chow Yun-fat or snooker star Ronnie O'Sullivan to become ambassadors.
  <br>
  <br>
  When asked how to strike a balance between tourism and environmental protection, Cheng said a clear classification of trails will be needed.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have so many trails in Hong Kong. Different people have different needs. If we target one or two trails for tourism, we can promote that trail more. Some of the trails, maybe they are for locals, then we can meet local needs," he said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Sunday's fight involving ice hockey players from Turkmenistan and Hong Kong, China may have escalated due to the physical nature of the sport.
 <br>
  <br>
  That's according to Education University physical education lecturer Lobo Louie.
  <br>
  <br>
  "During the ice hockey game, it is quite violent. So in terms of our philosophy and sports development, there is a debate for games that have physical contact. If you play table tennis, you are separated [from your opponent] by the table. But for [contact] games like rugby, boxing, and ice hockey, how do we handle the emotions of athletes, that should be part of the game," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Louie added the incident would serve as a lesson for athletes to learn how to control their stress levels during and after competitions.
  <br>
  <br>
  He made it clear that contact sports often have stricter rules to protect athletes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The athletes have to stand out for a couple of minutes, or may be they are suspended for a few games or are even [given] a more serious penalty," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Louie hoped the incident would not affect the performance of the Hong Kong, China team in later matches at the Asian Winter Games in Harbin, and urged more promotion of professional sports ethics among athletes.

 Chief Executive John Lee on Monday paid a visit to ice hockey players who were injured during a post-game fight between players from Hong Kong, China and Turkmenistan at the Winter Asian Games in Harbin.
 <br>
  <br>
  SAR sports officials are demanding action from relevant authorities and have condemned the "deliberate attack and injury" by Turkmenistan athletes after Sunday's game.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee, who's in Harbin, went to the athletes' village to meet three Hong Kong players hurt in the brawl.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the trio were fine and should be able to play in Monday night's quarter-final clash against Kyrgyzstan.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CE praised the players for staying calm and showing restraint during the incident, saying they showed professionalism and displayed sportsmanship.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I encourage them to maintain the best mental condition and play with a professional attitude, not to be affected by any incident," Lee wrote on social media.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I also expressed the support of Hong Kong people for the ice hockey team, and encourage the team members to keep it up and focus on the upcoming games."
  <br>
  <br>
  The chief executive also called on the Sports Federation and Olympic Committee of Hong Kong, China, and the Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau to follow up on the matter, and ensure the safety of the SAR's athletes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee was flanked by sports minister Rosanna Law and Chief Executive's Office director Carol Yip as he met the ice hockey team.
