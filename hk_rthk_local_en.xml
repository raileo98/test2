<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday expressed his hope for promoting positive relations with Washington after US President Donald Trump returned to office for a second term, while saying Hong Kong would also "prepare for the worst".
 <br>
  <br>
  Lee also warned any political interference would not work.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Any political interference, any inappropriate action against Hong Kong will not work. We believe what we do is for the overall good of Hong Kong," Lee said when asked if he's worried about more sanctions on the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If there is any attempt to interfere with trials in Hong Kong, or officials or people who are involved in administering justice, it won't work. We are doing it exactly in the same way in protecting our national security as other citizens in their own countries."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee said he hopes to have a good relationship with the United States, as there are many common interests between the two sides.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With the new president in office, I hope to see that there will be good efforts to promote positive relations, because cooperation and collaboration will only create overall good for the people of Hong Kong and the people of the US. And Hong Kong people and US citizens have always been friends in a lot of areas and we'll continue to work hard on that regard," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But, of course, we will always prepare for the worst, and we will ensure that the rights of our people and companies will be protected."
  <br>
  <br>
  The SAR always seeks to strengthen ties and exchanges with different countries including the United States, the chief executive said, but there should be mutual respect and understanding.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on RTHK's Backchat programme on Tuesday, Alan Lung, co-convenor of The Path of Democracy, said the SAR government may find it challenging to anticipate Trump's thinking.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our government may not be able to read Trump, and doesn't understand what they [the administration] are worried about," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ross Feingold, Head of Research at Cyrus Consulting, felt the SAR could face an uphill battle when dealing with Washington.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong is starting from a disadvantage, and we also have to keep in mind that no matter what he [Trump] says about his personal relationship with [President] Xi Jinping... Secretary of State Rubio, who was just confirmed, the foreign policy team, these are people who don't have warm opinions towards Hong Kong."

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee says Hong Kong will strengthen cooperation with other places to try to secure the release of SAR residents being held prisoner in "scam farms" in Southeast Asia.
 <br>
  <br>
  At the moment, 10 Hongkongers are believed to be being forced to take part in fraud after being tricked into travelling to Thailand and neighbouring countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee told reporters ahead of the weekly Executive Council meeting on Tuesday that authorities will carry out thorough investigations and work with counterparts overseas to tackle the issue.
  <br>
  <br>
  “There are a lot of players in the whole fight against this crime, including law enforcement agencies in the relevant countries. There are good networks already. The respective countries have already heightened their attention and escalated the government participation in our whole fight," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will continue to strengthen cooperation in this area, passing intelligence across the players."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee also called on the public to be aware of different types of scams, including those that have ensnared scores of university students from the mainland.
  <br>
  <br>
  "People may have heard about such cases...but still they think they won't be the victims and so they are not as alert," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police have strengthened cooperation with tertiary institutions to raise awareness of financial scams among students, Lee added.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday said more than 1.4 million mainland arrivals are expected in Hong Kong during the Lunar New Year holiday period.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters before the weekly Executive Council meeting, the CE said the administration will make comprehensive preparations to ensure travellers have a good experience.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The inter-departmental working group, chaired by the chief secretary, will make proper arrangements based on the situation during individual festive periods and the estimated traveller numbers," Lee said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Regarding cross-border arrangements, we need to discuss and cooperate with mainland authorities. We will look at the actual situation to see whether service hours at border checkpoints need to be extended and how long these should be. We should be announcing the details within this week."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee said 2025 will open a new page for Hong Kong with more tourists making frequent visits to the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the number of inbound visits saw a huge surge last year, reaching almost 45 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  While mainland arrivals saw a 30 percent year-on-year increase, the growth from Southeast Asia was even more significant.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CE said he expects the growth to continue in the coming year, with more new air routes to be opened.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the chief executive also announced that twin panda cubs at Ocean Park will make their public debut on February 16.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee said there would be a naming contest for the pandas.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We hope everyone can share the joy of this big family, so having a naming contest will make it even more joyful and warm. Details will be announced soon," he said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan arrived in Davos, Switzerland on Monday for the World Economic Forum (WEF) Annual Meeting where he expressed his desire to expedite a free trade agreement between Hong Kong and the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC).
 <br>
  <br>
  Chan met Jasem Mohamed Albudaiwi, the council's secretary-general, to discuss strengthening bilateral trade cooperation.
  <br>
  <br>
  The FS said both parties acknowledged that the launch of the "Gulf Cooperation Council Chapter" at the Asian Financial Forum last week marked a significant step forward in strengthening financial services cooperation between Hong Kong and the Gulf states.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said the SAR government is committed to facilitating two-way business delegation visits to enhance collaboration in digital economy, green transformation, securities markets, Islamic finance, and asset and wealth management with Arab states.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan also met several finance and business leaders from Europe, America, the Middle East and Japan and promoted the SAR's advantages as a "super connector" and "super value-adder".
  <br>
  <br>
  He said he briefed the leaders on Hong Kong's recent economic and social developments, highlighting progress in the local financial market last year and achievements in attracting businesses and talent.
  <br>
  <br>
  He emphasised strategies to advance finance, innovation and technology, trade and aviation and create global opportunities for businesses and talent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Additionally, Chan met the chair of Revolut, a UK-based fintech company specialising in digital banking services, to discuss the latest developments in the field and to encourage the company to expand its operations in Hong Kong.

 The Security Bureau said another Hong Kong resident suspected of being lured to Southeast Asia to engage in illegal work has been rescued.
 <br>
  <br>
  The bureau said the Immigration Department's Assistance to Hong Kong Residents Unit earlier received a request for help from the family of the SAR resident.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials said they immediately followed up and contacted the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Office in Hong Kong, the Chinese Embassies in both Myanmar and Thailand and the Consulate General of Myanmar in Hong Kong for assistance.
  <br>
  <br>
  A dedicated unit of the Security Bureau is working to bring the individual back to Hong Kong as soon as possible.
  <br>
  <br>
  It's understood that the Hong Kong resident worked in a scam operation in Myanmar for four months before he was rescued and taken to a safe place in Thailand.

    New system to simplify land ownership transfer mooted

<img alt="The government is planning to implement title registration on land sold after 2027. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1788360_1_20250120191656.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government is planning to implement title registration on land sold after 2027 to help streamline procedures relating to ownership transfer.
 <br>
  <br>
  It will also cover land granted by private treaty and by land exchange.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a closed-door press briefing on Monday, Development Bureau officials said it's estimated that there will be around 450 new land grants, and 25,000 title registers will be created within five years after the new system is implemented.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under the current deeds registration system, title is decided by checking previous deeds, and officials said there is no guarantee of title to property.
  <br>
  <br>
  When conveyancing a property, the buyer’s lawyer has to check all previous title deeds carefully, including historical title documents, to make sure the property has a “clean title” so the buyer will have the legal ownership. Owners will also have to properly keep the title deeds.
  <br>
  <br>
  By contrast, officials said title registration will provide certainty in property ownership, and the person who is being registered will be recognised as the true owner.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The Title Register is conclusive evidence of title to the property,” an official said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Development Bureau also said the new system can shorten the property-transfer process.
  <br>
  <br>
  “There is no need to check historical title documents in sale and purchase of property. People will find out the owner from the Title Register on the Land Registry, and whether there are other ownership interests,” the official added.
  <br>
  <br>
  A genuine and innocent buyer who has acquired the property will have the “indefeasible title”, even if the transfer of property involved third-party fraud.
  <br>
  <br>
  In that case, the former owner can apply for compensation, capped at HK$50 million, under a Land Title Indemnity Fund.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bureau added that it does not have a timetable on converting the existing 2.9 million land registers to title registration, due to complicated legal issues such as problematic ownership.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The outgoing chairman of the Bar Association, Victor Dawes, said on Monday that while protecting national security is fundamentally important and helps to ensure Hong Kong's economic development, the authorities need to exercise their powers in a proportionate manner.
 <br>
  <br>
  In his speech at a ceremony marking the start of the Legal Year, Dawes said common law and the judicial system are pivotal to the success of Hong Kong and the constitutional order in the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  He cited Lord Hodge, deputy president of the United Kingdom's top court, as saying that the quality of a place's legal institutions is important to investment levels, innovation and economic growth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dawes said there is no doubt that protecting national security is fundamentally important and essential for economic prosperity and people's well-being.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said there continued to be unfair criticism overseas regarding security matters linked to incidents that took place in Hong Kong in 2019, and some of the criticism was aimed at undermining the SAR's prosperity.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Bar Association chief said it's important for the authorities to exercise powers derived from national security laws in a considered and proportionate manner, to show that Hong Kong, as a jurisdiction, respects the rights of the people.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Ministers and public officers at all levels must be able to show that their powers are exercised in good faith, fairly, and for the purpose for which the powers are conferred," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Businesses must have the confidence that they will be dealt with on a principled and not an arbitrary basis. In this regard, powers under our new national security legislation should be used in a considered and proportionate manner."
  <br>
  <br>
  The president of the Law Society, Roden Tong, said his organisation will do its best to preserve the legal sector's self-regulatory regime, saying this is seen as an important part of the profession's independence.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The independence of the profession will give the public confidence that it can take an objective view and effectively uphold the rule of law," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is particularly important when our systems are under close scrutiny in the geopolitical climate, and the Law Society will strive to preserve the profession's self-regulatory status."
  <br>
  <br>
  Tong also called on the sector to play a bigger educational role to help tackle misinformation.

    Paul Lam slams 'efforts to exert pressure' on judges

<div class="itemFullText">
 Justice Secretary Paul Lam on Monday hit out at attempts to "exert improper pressure" on overseas judges serving on Hong Kong's top court.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a speech marking the beginning of the Legal Year, he also said people should not overlook the fact that some foreign non-permanent judges (NPJs) have decided to stay on the bench at the Court of Final Appeal.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2024, five foreign judges decided to step down from the court. There are now 10 NPJs, six of them from overseas.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lam said the "participation of eminent foreign judges" in the work of the top court benefits both the SAR and the common law world as a whole.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's most regrettable that there were attempts mainly from overseas to exert improper pressures on foreign judges to dissociate themselves from the Hong Kong court. These attempts pose a threat to not only the rule of law in Hong Kong but also the development of common law in general," Lam said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The government is in full support of the judiciary in its continuous efforts to appoint and retain foreign NPJs in future."
  <br>
  <br>
  He also criticised individuals who "intimidate" national security judges or "interfere" with judicial proceedings.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's vital to bear in mind that the enforcement of the national security law is subject to the supervision of the Hong Kong court exercising its independent judicial power," Lam said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Anyone who intimidates judges handling national security cases or interferes with the relevant judicial proceedings in whatsoever manner cannot be genuinely concerned about the rule of law in Hong Kong."
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the homegrown national security law, which took effect in March last year, aims to ensure "the hard-won peace and stability" that Hong Kong enjoys can be preserved.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Unless security is first safeguarded, it will be impossible for Hong Kong to utilise its unique strengths at full strength under the principle of One Country, Two Systems, and serve as an international financial, shipping and trade centre," Lam said.

    Legal principles upheld in all cases: chief justice

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's judges have upheld fundamental legal principles in hearing all cases, including national security trials, Chief Justice Andrew Cheung said on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a speech marking the start of the Legal Year, the SAR's top judge said the city's national security laws have brought with them "cases that attract heightened attention", particularly due to their political sensitivity.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Cheung stressed the same legal principles apply in national security cases as in others.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The presumption of innocence, the requirement that guilt be proved beyond reasonable doubt, and the right to a fair trial are all essential safeguards that remain firmly in place," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our courts do not merely pay lip service to these fundamental principles. Judges at all levels are expected to, and indeed do, adhere to them in the adjudication of cases."
  <br>
  <br>
  Cheung said tensions often exist between protecting basic rights and safeguarding national security, both of which the judiciary is firmly committed to upholding.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Striking the right balance can be challenging, and outcomes in individual cases may be contentious at times, nor is the interpretation or application of newly enacted statutory provisions always straightforward," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "However, it is one thing to disagree with a legal provision or a court decision in applying it, but entirely another to suggest that the justice system has been undermined by political expectations or societal atmosphere."
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to the media after the ceremony, Cheung said the city's judges faced threats, and stressed that judicial officers should not be interfered with by any countries, bodies or organisations.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Threatening sanctions against judges simply doing their work goes directly to the question of judicial independence and interfering with judges' work and therefore it is objectionable," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is objectionable as a matter of principle and it is a direct affront to the rule of law and to judicial independence."
  <br>
  <br>
  The chief justice also said while the departure of foreign judges from the city's top court "caused concerns in some quarters", it has not affected judicial independence.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is unfortunate that a few of these judges have felt unable to continue their service. They are, of course, entitled to their views, and their decisions ought to be respected. However, their premature departures do not mean a weakening of the quality or independence of the judiciary," Cheung said in his speech.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is true that, given the current geopolitical headwinds, recruiting overseas judges with the right stature and experience may be less straightforward than it once was. After all, overseas judges are appointed to our highest court on account of their acknowledged eminence and legal expertise, not merely to sustain the system of overseas judges for its own sake."
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2024, five foreign judges decided to step down from the Court of Final Appeal (CFA). Following their exits, there are 10 non-permanent judges (NPJs) left sitting on the top court, six of them from overseas.
  <br>
  <br>
  In comments made to the media, Cheung expressed confidence that the city will be able to recruit more overseas judges.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Given the rather stable number of appeals heard by the CFA in recent years, the number of 10 NPJs – six overseas NPJs, plus four local NPJs – plus possible appointment of further NPJs in the future, would be more than sufficient to allow us to cope with our very steady workload on the court," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm reasonably confident of keeping our existing NPJs as well as recruiting new NPJs in the future when we can identify suitable candidates to be appointed."
  <br>
  <br>
  The top judge also said the presence or absence of individual judges will not undermine the integrity of Hong Kong's judicial system.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cheung said the city has faced significant political, social and economic challenges in recent years, which tested the resilience of the territory's legal system and the strengths of its institutions. Despite that, he said, the judiciary continued to uphold the rule of law and ensured that legal procedures remain transparent, fair and independent.

    'Digital signage users need to up cyber security'

<img alt="HKCERT said it handled over 12,000 security incidents in 2024, with phishing accounting for over half of all cases. Photo courtesy of HKCERT" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1788324_2_20250120210646.jpg&q=70">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination Centre (HKCERT) on Monday urged organisations using digital signage devices to enhance security measures and review best practices to protect against potential cyber attacks.
 <br>
  <br>
  Alex Chan, the spokesman for HKCERT, said the use of digital signboards has increased significantly to engage customer interactions through digital advertising and public information, but warns that its growth comes with potential cyber risks.
  <br>
  <br>
  HKCERT conducted a survey of 624 organisations across various industries, including retail, tourism and financial services and found that almost 40 percent of the companies they surveyed did not conduct risk assessments for their signages in advance.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the centre identified various vulnerabilities that require urgent remediation among digital signage usage.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Someone uses a USB device that includes malicious content or also can
  <br>
  include some script, when they insert it into a digital signage with the USB port exposed, they can quickly replace the content," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For the infrared, it's another channel apart from the USB port the attacker can leverage, they can based on some infrared advice to emit some orders or instructions to the digital signage so that they would also, under the other malicious command, change the content of the digital signage."
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that some digital signage systems also utilise weak encryption methods, which could potentially allow to hackers intercept, control or obtain network information.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said companies need to increase their awareness and conduct the security measures recommended.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Physically, they block the USB port, they stop the USB port autoplay functions, the infrared services, or maybe use a very strong username password for the content management system, or use a stronger encryption protocol so that it's not easy to eavesdrop on the content sent between the user computer, the Wi-Fi network, the content management system, and the digital signage," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  HKCERT said it handled over 12,000 security incidents in 2024, with phishing accounting for over half of all cases, marking a 108 percent increase from the year before.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan highlighted that looking ahead this year, supply chain security and AI content hijacking will become the primary cyber security risks in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Organisations and individuals must prepare by implementing appropriate cyber incident response measures, deploying suitable cyber security measures, conducting regular security audits and penetration testing, and understanding and preventing relevant risks," he said.

    Call for more parties to cover losses of scam victims

<img alt="Lawmaker Johnny Ng (right) said the establishment of the “Fraud Loss Responsibility Framework” would encourage different parties to combat fraud more proactively. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1788309_1_20250120154218.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lawmaker Johnny Ng on Monday called on the government to set up a mechanism to share the burden of fraud to better protect scamming victims.
 <br>
  <br>
  Ng, who is also the convenor of the "Anti-Scam Alliance", said the establishment of a "Fraud Loss Responsibility Framework" would encourage financial institutions, telecommunication providers, and digital platforms to take a more proactive approach in combating fraud.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said this would require these stakeholders to compensate the victim according to their degree of negligence in each case.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last September, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority launched an industry consultation exercise on introducing a "responsibility framework" among commercial banks, in which banks would have to share losses with those who fall victim to scams that involve the customer losing money by providing their personal information.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ng also suggested the establishment of an independent committee to handle disputes case by case, and determine how much percentage of losses each party should take up.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Nowadays, we do not have any mechanism or organisations to help the victims to get back the money. I think this framework is to help them [victims] to recoup some money from some organisation or parties," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that various loopholes were present even with increased protections towards citizens against scam, such as real-name registration when purchasing prepaid sim cards.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Scammers can [now] easily advertise on social networks. [Many] citizens can see advertisements such as big discounts on air tickets, and they will click in and drop into a phishing or fraud website, and lose their money," Ng said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The banking system can also do more on suspected transactions. We see a lot of cases with [criminals] using overseas bank accounts and credit cards to debit the victim's cards in foreign exchange," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The lawmaker also questioned why scamming syndicates can acquire a huge number of sim cards to contact potential victims.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ng said the government could look at other countries and regions, such as Singapore, which adopted a shared-responsibilities framework since the end of last year to combat phishing crimes, while Australia is considering the inclusion of social media firms in the sharing of fraud losses.

    US firms will keep coming to Hong Kong: InvestHK

 The government department responsible for attracting foreign investment on Monday expressed optimism that American companies will continue to be attracted to set up shop in Hong Kong after Donald Trump begins his second term in office.
 <br>
  <br>
  InvestHK said of the record 539 non-local companies it helped establish or expand in the SAR last year, US firms were the second biggest group, following those from the mainland.
  <br>
  <br>
  The department's director-general, Alpha Lau, said while it remains to be seen what the incoming US administration's policies will be, companies from many American industries will still come to Hong Kong in search of profit.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Because in the end, American companies are very pragmatic, as well as very practical. And the growth is in Asia, and in mainland China," she told a press conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So if they want to look for business opportunities and look for growth, then this is where they want to be."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lau said Hong Kong is seen as a testing ground or springboard for foreign companies seeking to enter the mainland market.
  <br>
  <br>
  The director-general expressed optimism that her department can meet the government target of attracting 1,130 companies to the SAR in the three-year period ending this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The firms last year created more than 6,800 jobs in Hong Kong, with total investment reaching HK$67.7 billion, around 10 percent more than in 2023, InvestHK said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The top five sectors were innovation technology, finance, family offices, tourism and professional services.

    Country Garden on track to agree terms with creditors

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chinese property giant Country Garden, which previously defaulted on its debt repayment obligations, expects to reach agreeable terms with creditors next month, the firm's lawyer told a Hong Kong court on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The court hearing, which was held to measure progress in reaching an agreement with creditors, was then adjourned until May 26 by High Court judge Linda Chan after a request from Country Garden's lawyers to extend the date from May 19.
  <br>
  <br>
  Country Garden said earlier this month it has proposed to creditors a debt restructuring that would cut its offshore debt worth US$16.4 billion by 70 percent, and it had reached an "understanding" with a lender group.
  <br>
  <br>
  Once China's biggest property developer, Country Garden defaulted on US$11 billion in offshore bonds in late 2023, deepening a debt crisis in the sector that had already experienced defaults by many developers, including China Evergrande Group.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ever Credit Limited, a unit of Hong Kong-listed Kingboard Holdings, filed a petition against Country Garden in February last year for non-payment of a US$205 million loan. (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A lawmaker has proposed that the student affairs offices of universities set up scam-reporting hotlines to better protect students from falling prey to swindles.
 <br>
  <br>
  The University of Hong Kong and City University have asked students to complete anti-scam quizzes as soon as possible, after dozens reported being conned online.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on an RTHK radio programme, Chow Man-kong said these anti-scam offices should reach out to the police once students report they have been swindled.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said that anti-scam education was crucial in raising their awareness.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Mainland students, in particular, they are not familiar with everything in Hong Kong, or they might not have anyone to rely on," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Under such situations, when there's an incoming phone call pointing out their identities and personal information, they will fall prey very easily."
  <br>
  <br>
  Campus TV - HKU's student news outlet - has reported that students who fail to complete the quizzes by February's deadline will be barred from certain facilities, including the library.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chow, who is also the chairman of Legco's panel on education, welcomed HKU's decision to roll out the quiz, adding the university's intention was good.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another lawmaker, Johnny Ng, told the same programme the quizzes were relatively easy, noting that questions for similar tests on the mainland were harder.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he said that anti-scam quizzes are necessary, as fraudsters are rampant.

 The University of Hong Kong and City University on Sunday asked students to complete anti-scam quizzes as soon as possible. The call came after dozens of students were reportedly scammed.
 <br>
  <br>
  HKU's student news outlet Campus TV has reported that more than 60 students have been scammed in recent months, resulting in a monetary loss of HK$60 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  The University of Hong Kong says it has sent a kit offered by the police to students to raise awareness of scams.
  <br>
  <br>
  The kit includes the latest information on how to identify scams and multiple-choice questions.
  <br>
  <br>
  At City University, the institution said it had received 30 scam reports from students, involving a total of HK$15 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  The university says it has requested all students to finish the anti-scam survey this semester.

    Only 10pc of subdivided flats meet new standards: SoCO

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A community group on Sunday said a survey they conducted found just one-tenth of subdivided flat residents feel their homes meet the standards of the government’s proposed basic housing units.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Society for Community Organisation (SoCO) said resettlement arrangements should be provided as soon as possible before tenants in substandard subdivided flats are kicked out by landlords.
  <br>
  <br>
  From December last year, the survey polled 211 tenants who are currently living in subdivided flats, bedspace apartments or cubicle apartments.  It comes as the government conducts its public consultation of the new regulatory framework for basic housing units, which runs until February 10.
  <br>
  <br>
  In October, Chief Executive John Lee outlined plans to replace substandard subdivided units with basic housing units. Landlords will face criminal liability if they rent out units that fail to meet the basic housing unit standards, which state that a unit must not be smaller than eight square metres, and have at least one window with an individual toilet.
  <br>
  <br>
  SoCO said only 10 percent of respondents said their homes fulfil these requirements, while almost 60 percent believe landlords will have to revamp their units.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another 30 percent of respondents said they have no idea whether their homes will need renovation.
  <br>
  <br>
  The community group also called on authorities to solve the resettlement issue as nearly 40 percent of the respondents said the government should provide rehousing arrangements if they are kicked out of their homes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Additionally, SoCO said the government should impose rent control measures as nearly 32 percent of respondents are worried about not being able to pay the rent for basic housing units. They suggested that the median rent should be set at about HK$2,000.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Security minister Chris Tang on Sunday said the government did not raise Thailand's travel alert to red because the government needed to reflect the situation accurately.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a TVB programme, Tang explained that victims were not kidnapped in Thailand, but rather lured there before being transported elsewhere.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last Friday, the government raised its travel alert for southeastern Myanmar to red, but the alert level for other parts of Myanmar, Thailand and Cambodia remains at amber – the lowest level of the three-tier outward travel alert system.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The victims were basically lured to Thailand before being transported to scam farms in Myanmar. There hasn't been a single case of someone being kidnapped within Thailand," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Certain areas in Myanmar are being used as scam farms, guarded by military police and armed personnel. That's where the danger lies," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister was also asked about the government's role in rescue efforts and reports of victims being released after a ransom was paid.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Some people were able to return without paying ransom. Of course, when faced with these situations, our priority is to bring people back safely," he responded.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tang stressed that officials will pursue all means to secure the safe return of stranded Hongkongers.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Sunday said he will promote Hong Kong's advantages as a super connector and super value-adder on his upcoming trip to Davos, Switzerland, where he will attend the World Economic Forum.
 <br>
  <br>
  Writing on his weekly blog on Sunday, Chan said business leaders are keen to learn more about developments in Hong Kong, and added that he will introduce policies that the SAR has adopted.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that Vice Premier Ding Xuexiang will also attend the conference to deliver a speech, and noted that "the economic conditions and development of the mainland has become one of the important highlights in annual conferences in recent years".
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said that the central government will continue to support the SAR's capital market development by significantly increasing the proportion of its national foreign exchange reserves and asset allocation in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Chan said the Asian Financial Forum held in Hong Kong earlier had facilitated exchanges between leaders from Europe, the United States, and new markets along the Belt and Road Initiative.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said finance leaders from Western countries have reaffirmed Hong Kong's role in bridging markets across the world with those on the mainland.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Whereas the global South hopes Hong Kong can diversify its fundraising capabilities to support their projects, including infrastructure, economic development, and green transition," he wrote.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Constitutional and Mainland Affairs Bureau and RTHK on Sunday announced they have jointly produced a series of programmes to promote patriotism and the rule of law.
 <br>
  <br>
  The initiative follows last year's establishment of the Working Group on Patriotic Education, which aims to strengthen education about national history and Chinese culture.
  <br>
  <br>
  The working group's convenor Starry Lee, who is also Hong Kong's sole delegate to the National People's Congress Standing Committee, said there are four major programmes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The purpose of [these programmes], as a combination of other tasks and events, is to help to build up the cultural awareness of Hong Kong people and their understanding towards our country," she told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee added that the working group will cooperate with different government departments and community stakeholders to organise events this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a launch ceremony on Sunday, Under Secretary for Constitutional and Mainland Affairs, Clement Woo, said the programmes will explain the Basic Law and the Constitution through everyday scenarios.
  <br>
  <br>
  Woo said the government has been working hard to help people understand these two documents better through diverse channels and innovative ways.
  <br>
  <br>
  Director of Broadcasting Angelina Kwan, working group member and National People's Congress deputy Cally Kwong, and Basic Law Committee member Simon Lee also attended the ceremony.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The head of respiratory medicine at the Chinese University of Hong Kong on Sunday warned that the SAR’s winter flu season has not peaked, and that occupancy rates at hospitals are continuing to rise.
 <br>
  <br>
  David Hui said those who have been hospitalised for the flu included children aged up to 5 and people who are 65 or older.
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted that there were 37 severe cases among adults who needed intensive care in the second week of the month. Fifteen of these patients died. The professor pointed out that 25 of these people had not received the influenza vaccine, and recommended that residents get vaccinated as soon as possible.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on Commercial Radio, Hui said that a general vaccination rate of 70 percent to 80 percent is ideal.
  <br>
  <br>
  But as of last month, he said the rate for infants and young children was 48 percent, and those aged 50 to 64 was only 20 percent, while the rate was 45 percent for those aged 65 or above.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hui also said that influenza cases in most northern hemisphere regions are on the rise, and that most of them involve H1N1 influenza A.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that the current flu season is expected to peak early next month, and decline around mid-March.

    'Transportation to airport will remain smooth'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Airport Authority on Sunday gave assurances that transportation services to and from the airport will not be affected by the development of SKYTOPIA.
 <br>
  <br>
  Earlier, the authority revealed the new expansion of Hong Kong's Airport City, which will include an arts hub, aimed at attracting visitors from both home and abroad.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have developed an autonomous vehicle system that would link from the border point and also from 11 Skies all the way to the MTR station in Tung Chung, which means that in [the] future, for the people from Hong Kong who want to go to SKYTOPIA, they don't actually have to use the Airport Express link," the authority's chairman Fred Lam told reporters after attending a Commercial Radio show.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the vehicle system will connect Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge's Hong Kong port with the Airport City by the start of 2026, and be extended to Tung Chung station by 2028. This, he explained, would relieve pressure on the Airport Express line.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are also developing two autonomous car parks at the restricted area of the border control area. Very soon, cars from Macau and Guangdong will be able to use the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge to reach the airport and also the SKYTOPIA area, this will also alleviate traffic problems in the future," Lam added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Airport Authority chief also said the development will see the construction of the city’s largest yacht bay, that would provide at least 500 docking spaces, as well a jet fresh market.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I hope the majority of parking spaces will be for yachts from around the Greater Bay Area and even other regions in Asia. We also hope to accommodate larger yachts, such as those longer than 70 metres, so yachts from further away can also come. Our positioning is towards those with better economic conditions, allowing them to drive their yacht and spend a few days in the city," Lam said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that the jet fresh market would allow visitors to enjoy the best fruits, meat and seafood from around the world due to the city's strong aviation network, import control and food safety standards.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Airport Authority had said the project would cost about HK$100 billion, including HK$30 billion for infrastructure.

 Customs officers on Friday arrested a man and a woman at the airport, after allegedly finding 1.1 kilogrammes of the space oil drug strapped around their waists.
 <br>
  <br>
  They had arrived from Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officers said the drugs had a street value of HK$1.2 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two suspects have been released on bail pending further investigation.

 Secretary for Constitutional and Mainland Affairs Erick Tsang on Saturday said the administration had received nearly 120,000 applications through the Top Talent Pass Scheme by the end of last year.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a luncheon event, the minister noted that more than 90,000 applications have been approved and about 76,000 people have arrived in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nine universities on the mainland and four overseas were added to the list of institutions covered by the talent scheme in November last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  With an annual update at the beginning of this year, 199 universities are now on the list.

    'Businesses need to adapt and innovate'

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development, Algernon Yau, said it's important for the city's retail, catering and hotel sectors to be adaptable and innovative - to attract a broader consumer base.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on an RTHK programme on Saturday, he said the total number of visitors to Hong Kong last year surpassed 44 million, marking a 30 percent annual increase.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that despite the SAR experiencing a 7.3 percent year-on-year decline in retail sales value last November, there was a positive shift during the Christmas and New Year period, with some businesses reporting double-digit growth.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Apart from an increase in visitors from mainland China, there were also many more visitors from Southeast Asia under the new 'multiple-entry visa' scheme. I believe that, especially this year, this should greatly benefit the retail sector, particularly during holidays," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But given the overall global economic environment and changing consumer patterns, we need to adapt. The retail and catering sectors need to think about how to transform. Hong Kong has many eateries with long queues, indicating their popularity. We can look at why these eateries are so successful."
  <br>
  <br>
  He also said online shopping is going to become the dominant trend in the global retail landscape, making it necessary for businesses to revamp their business models.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yau said the Hong Kong Brands and Products Expo this year will be promoted on e-commerce platforms across mainland China and Southeast Asia.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that the SAR offers a plethora of sought-after brands and products, including food, cosmetics, and health items that hold significant popularity in mainland markets.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked if recent cases of Hong Kong residents being forced to work on illegal scams in several Southeast Asian countries would impact Hong Kong businesses' willingness to invest and operate in those areas, Yau said the two issues should not be intertwined.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong has been doing business in Southeast Asia for a long time. There are many Hong Kong businesses in Thailand, Myanmar, Cambodia, Vietnam and Laos. When I went to Cambodia, there were also many Hong Kong people who are living happily there and setting up business there. Similarly, there are Hong Kong businesses in Laos," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think these are two separate matters that should not be confused. The occurrence of such events should not affect people's willingness to do business."

    CE puts best foot forward in North Point visit

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Saturday wrapped up a visit to the harbourfront boardwalk in North Point to talk to Hongkongers – and managed to fit in an impromptu jog.
 <br>
  <br>
  The walkway – built under the Island Eastern Corridor – spans 2.2 kilometres in total.
  <br>
  <br>
  The section from Fortress Hill to North Point will open to the public on January 26.
  <br>
  <br>
  The boardwalk will have viewing platforms and shared spaces for pedestrians, joggers, cyclists, and pet owners.
  <br>
  <br>
  Movable bridges have also been installed to allow vessels access to the inner waters.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Development Bureau and the Eastern District Office invited some people on Saturday to try out the boardwalk – while Lee was there for an inspection.
  <br>
  <br>
  After an inspection of about half an hour, Lee invited some Hongkongers to join him for a jog along the boardwalk.
  <br>
  <br>
  “My personal feeling is that whether you run, jog, or cycle along the boardwalk, the scenery is amazing. It’s nice to take in the views in a busy schedule, and Hong Kong is a beautiful place to call home,” he said after the run.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Development Bureau earlier announced that the section between North Point and Quarry Bay will be opened in phases in the second half of this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  After the completion of the project, a 13-kilometre harbourfront promenade will connect Kennedy Town in the west with Shau Kei Wan in the east of Hong Kong Island.

    Children should get flu jabs 'before LNY travel'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A paediatrician has urged parents planning Lunar New Year travels with their kids to ensure their children get their flu jabs immediately, citing an increased risk of influenza-related complications following the pandemic.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters after appearing on a radio programme on Saturday, Dr Patrick Ip, from the University of Hong Kong's department of paediatrics, said severe influenza infections could result in complications such as pneumonia, pneumococcal infection or respiratory syncytial virus infection, posing a heightened risk, especially for children.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that the vaccination rate among children is still low, with more than 50 percent yet to receive their jabs.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are already entering into the winter and already entering into the peak season of influenza outbreak. We want to encourage all the parents to try to bring your children to receive influenza vaccination as quickly as possible. Now for those younger children younger than nine years old, they need to receive at least two doses of influenza vaccine separated by four weeks," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For each dose of influenza, usually after the vaccination, it takes two weeks to become much more effective in protection."
  <br>
  <br>
  He said parents have different vaccination options available for their children, which can be accessed at different locations.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The vaccination programme this year actually has been well being conducted in the different areas including by hospital clinic settings, but also with a very good outreach programme," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This year, the government ... allowed a very flexible on-site vaccination scheme to the schools. They can choose either to receive the conventional injection of inactivated vaccine or they could also choose the nasal influenza live-attenuated vaccine option."
  <br>
  <br>
  Ip added that the upward trend in influenza cases is expected to continue, predicting more severe instances in the next few weeks.

    Law change on public housing misuse on its way
   </title>

<img alt="" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1788106_1_20250118105244.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Housing Winnie Ho on Saturday said the government is confident of passing a law change this legislative session making serious misuse of public housing a crime.
 <br>
  <br>
  Under the proposed amendments to the Housing Ordinance, people who break the rules - such as subletting units or using them for business without living there - can face fines of up to HK$500,000 and jail terms of up to a year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Currently, the toughest punishment for rule-breakers is eviction.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a Commercial Radio programme, Ho gave some examples of what might qualify as serious misuse.
  <br>
  <br>
  “For example, one unit had lots of mirrors installed and was used as a dance studio. And we found a unit which had fitness equipment in which the tenant was training gym-goers. In these situations, people aren't living there, and they're using public housing to make money, so we class this as serious misuse of public housing,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho said the administration would look at each instance on a case-by-case basis, and would be reasonable and compassionate in enforcing the law.
  <br>
  <br>
  For example, residents who hold small-scale tutorial classes for money, or make handcrafts for online businesses might not be seen as seriously misusing their units, the housing minister said.
  <br>
  <br>
  She added that the administration had held talks with major parties and received their support.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Legco's panel on housing is scheduled to discuss the legislation change next month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the cash reward scheme for people who want to report illegal public housing use kicked off on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho said about 200 reports had been submitted in the last two days, although one-fourth of informants didn’t want the reward, and there were some false claims.
  <br>
  <br>
  She estimated there would be about 1,300 successful reports this year, with authorities giving out more than HK$4 million in cash.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The director of Beijing's Liaison Office in Hong Kong, Zheng Yanxiong, on Friday said the SAR has to strengthen its advantage of international connectivity, and not weaken it.
 <br>
  <br>
  He made the comment during the office's annual spring reception at the Convention and Exhibition Centre in Wan Chai.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zheng said Hong Kong needs to "shoulder its sacred responsibilities to the motherland" by safeguarding the constitutional order and the One Country, Two Systems principle, while being able to adapt to changes and be innovative.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said while the world is going through great changes not seen in a century, Hong Kong could seize the opportunities that came its way as it has the country's strong backing.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong can surely attract money and resources from all sides. The key is to achieve our better selves through staying upright, and continue to write the legendary story of Hong Kong in the new era," Zheng said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The director said by staying upright, he meant maintaining a business environment that is free and based on the rule of law, as well as an inclusive and multicultural environment.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We need to persist in connecting both with the mainland and with the world, while resolutely integrating into the country's overall development," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong's advantage to connect internally, is that it is an external-oriented [city.] Its international advantages can only be strengthened, not weakened."
  <br>
  <br>
  Zheng went on to stress that safeguarding security and focusing on development go hand in hand, and local officials have to always stay vigilant.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at the same event, Chief Executive John Lee said he would lead the government in uniting different sectors of society, while working hard on reforms.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said Hong Kong would focus on increasing the liquidity of offshore reminbi, in a bid to attract more mainland and international firms to list on the local stock exchange.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CE added that officials would also look into improving the mechanism of connecting local financial markets with those on the mainland, as well as signing more investment and trade pacts with different countries and regions.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Friday said the government was very cautious when considering tax reforms and that many factors had to be taken into consideration.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a forum organised by the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, Chan said the government hoped to achieve a fiscal balance in three years, but the SAR would focus more on managing costs than generating revenue.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In terms of raising taxes, first, we must consider our competitiveness, comparing to our neighbouring regions and the impact on attracting enterprises and investment," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Second, as society recovers from the pandemic, including small and medium enterprises, big corporations, and even individuals, we have to rebuild our balance sheets. We hope to provide more room for companies and individuals to strengthen their financial abilities."
  <br>
  <br>
  The government deducted one percent from the recurrent expenditure resources of government departments from the 2024/25 financial year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The finance minister said the government would look into whether there was a need to further reduce expenditures in his Budget, due to be announced next month.
  <br>
  <br>
  On whether the "affordable users pay" principle could be further implemented, he said Hong Kong has to work on it in a gradual and orderly way.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan added there were currently no plans to cut costs on infrastructure, saying the Northern Metropolis project could not be delayed.

    Govt raises travel alert for parts of Myanmar to red

<img alt="The Security Bureau has raised the travel alert level for parts of Myanmar to red." src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1788030_1_20250117174108.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Friday raised its travel alert for southeastern Myanmar to red, following cases of Hongkongers being lured there and forced to work at scam farms.
 <br>
  <br>
  Red is the middle level of the government's three-tier outward travel alert system, meaning there is a significant threat of going to the place and people should avoid making non-essential trips.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Security Bureau is calling on people to avoid non-essential travel to four districts of the country, while keeping the alert level at amber for other parts of Myanmar.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Residents who plan to visit south-eastern regions of Myanmar, including Myawaddy district, Hpapun district, Hpa-An district, and Kawkareik district should adjust their travel plans and avoid non-essential travel there," the government said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said for those who are already there, they should monitor the situation, exercise caution and attend to their personal safety.
  <br>
  <br>
  While officials said they have received reports that some Hong Kong people are also trapped in Cambodia, security officials have kept the alert level for the country at amber.
  <br>
  <br>
  They said they've updated the website with new information, to remind people to exercise caution and beware of overseas job scams.
  <br>
  <br>
  Security minister Chris Tang told a HOY TV programme on Friday that the alert was raised because it is now riskier for Hongkongers to be in those districts in Myanmar.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said there are currently no plans to raise the travel alert for Thailand -- where some victims had initially gone to before being taken to scam farms.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Friday said Hong Kong would see more opportunities than challenges this year.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a forum organised by the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, Chan said the city's economy saw improvements in the past year in areas like innovation and technology, while attracting enterprises and investment.
  <br>
  <br>
  The finance chief said the economic performance of Asian countries was strong, which included China recording five percent GDP growth in 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said Hong Kong should continue to leverage its unique advantages, and reinforce its connectivity with both the mainland and the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  "While consolidating traditional markets in Europe and the United States that are closely connected to Hong Kong, we have to fully explore new markets and sources of capital at the same time," Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong not only acts as a bridge for the mainland and advanced economies like Western countries and the United States, but it also serves as a link for the mainland and Global South countries, including in the Middle East, Southeast Asia and Central Asia."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said Hong Kong's economy would still undergo a structural adjustment this year, and the United States' presidential handover would bring uncertainties to the market.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he stressed that the SAR would have a "better future" through reform and change.

 Police say an 18-year-old woman has lost around HK$9.2 million after falling for a phone scam.
 <br>
  <br>
  Sources said on Friday that the mainland woman is a University of Hong Kong student. They also said police have put five suspects on their wanted list.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police said the woman received a call almost two months ago from somebody claiming to be a mainland law enforcement officer.
  <br>
  <br>
  She reported being told she was implicated in a money laundering investigation and had to repeatedly transfer money to another bank account as part of the probe.
  <br>
  <br>
  After the transfers were made, the scammers cut off contact, police said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The force has listed the case as obtaining property by deception, with no arrests made so far.

    'Bamboo scaffolding ban not a wise move'

<img alt="The Federation of Hong Kong and Kowloon Labour Unions has called for enhanced training for safety supervisors at construction sites: Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1787994_1_20250117144702.jpg&q=65">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A concern group representing scaffolding workers on Friday said they opposed the idea of stopping the use of bamboo scaffolding in construction.
 <br>
  <br>
  A scaffolding collapse at a construction site in Kai Tak injured 11 workers earlier this week, sparking conversations about completely replacing bamboo with metal scaffolding.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a press conference on Friday, the group said they believe the many incidents involving scaffolding were caused by poor site safety management, not the safety of bamboo scaffolding structures.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho Ping-tak, from the Hong Kong and Kowloon Bamboo Scaffolding Workers Union, noted that currently more than 80 percent of sites use bamboo scaffolding and thousands of workers would be affected if it were banned.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have to think about the sustainable development of bamboo scaffolding in the construction industry. If people insist on hindering our development, it could cost some 4,000 scaffolding workers their jobs, hurting the livelihood of some 4,000 households,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He urged the government and various stakeholders to join hands and come up with a long-term plan to improve construction procedures.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the Federation of Hong Kong and Kowloon Labour Unions called for more training for safety inspectors at construction sites.
  <br>
  <br>
  The federation said more than 16 percent of 310 respondents to a recent survey said they had been injured at least once in industrial accidents.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under current regulations, one safety supervisor should be appointed to every 20 workers at a construction site.
  <br>
  <br>
  But lawmaker Lam Chun-sing, who also chairs the federation, said many supervisors receive inadequate training and were not qualified to guide workers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "From our survey, many workers believe that there's nobody to supervise them and monitor them and tell them about their occupational health and safety issues,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The supervisor may be a general worker and they do not receive professional training and so in fact they cannot play the function of the safety supervisor... So we hope that the government can strengthen their professional training and also strengthen their role.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Reacting to the Kai Tak incident, Lam said it was not optimal that a serious accident occurred just months after the government published a revised safety code.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lam said other than enhanced inspections, the government should also consider whether sites can use other materials to replace bamboo scaffolding at construction sites.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Fond memories of travels to the mainland are likely to come flooding back for visitors to the MTR's exhibition at Hung Hom as the Kowloon-Canton Railway Through Train pulls into the station again for the first time in years.
 <br>
  <br>
  Compartments from the doubler-decker KTT trains which ran to Dongguan and Guangzhou from 1998 to 2020 have been added to the Station Rail Voyage experiential gallery which is designed to give people a behind-the-scenes glimpse of railway operations, along with a trip down memory lane.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Through showcasing the KTT compartments at the Station Rail Voyage exhibition, we bring everyone back to the days of the through train platform at Hung Hom Station," MTR CEO Jason Kam said at an opening ceremony for the revamped exhibition.
  <br>
  <br>
  "These journeys bring back memories of visiting family, meeting friends or doing business."
  <br>
  <br>
  Secretary for Transport and Logistics Mable Chan said the exhibition has proved popular with locals and tourists alike, and is also a hotspot for social media influencers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said the success of the exhibition shows that Hong Kong should make use of heritage such as the MTR when designing attractions for tourists.
  <br>
  <br>
  The revamped exhibition will be open from January 23 until the end of the year. People can book a free visit via the MTR's website.

 More than 9,000 bankruptcy applications were made in Hong Kong last year, the highest annual number in almost a decade.
 <br>
  <br>
  Data released by the Official Receiver's Office on Friday showed 9,190 petitions for bankruptcy were recorded, up 17 percent from 2023.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lawmakers on Friday said the new SKYTOPIA development planned as part of an expansion of Airport City will boost tourism-related industries.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Airport Authority says the development will include a "one-stop arts hub" and a "jet fresh market".
  <br>
  <br>
  DAB lawmaker Holden Chow welcomed the move, saying it will boost the economy by bringing more tourists to the city and creating jobs.
  <br>
  <br>
  He told RTHK’s Hong Kong Today programme that now is also a good time for more flights routes to be introduced, to further enhance the SAR's status as a global aviation hub.
  <br>
  <br>
  “With the third runway already launched, we believe that we always need to connect more direct air services to more jurisdictions, including Europe and North America,” Chow said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The authority says SKYTOPIA will cost about HK$100 billion, including HK$30 billion for infrastructure.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lawmaker Rock Chen, who’s a member of the authority's board, said many potential investors have expressed an interest in funding the plan.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the authority hopes to collaborate with Art Basel to stage events, as well as art sales to attract collectors, entrepreneurs and artists to Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  Calvin Au, a researcher at the Our Hong Kong Foundation think tank said having interesting facilities around the airport could attract people to choose to use Chek Lap Kok for their travels.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police have arrested a man for using forged documents and making false crime reports, after he allegedly fabricated an email from the Kai Tak Sports Park and separately claimed he was the victim of a blackmail case.
 <br>
  <br>
  Officers alleged that the man released a press statement earlier this month claiming that his application to host an international football event -- featuring FC Barcelona -- at the new stadium was rejected, and included what he claimed was an email from the park.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kai Tak Sports Park said it never received any application documents about the proposed match.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officers said the suspect also filed a false police report claiming that a journalist covering the story blackmailed him for HK$10 million via an email.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sun Yi-ki, a chief inspector with the force, said officers believe both emails were forged by the suspect.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Police do not rule out that the suspect may have been overly optimistic about his ability to organise international events. When his plan failed due to inexperience and poor management, he tried to shift the responsibility by misleading the media and forging emails that falsely claimed Kai Tak Sports Park had rejected his venue application," Sun said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kai Tak Sports Park said it is willing to cooperate with the police probe and will continue to handle all leasing applications in a professional manner.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Thursday said they arrested 12 people, including seven police officers, on suspicion of money laundering, involving about HK$10.5 million.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, the force said the eight men and four women, aged between 28 and 68, allegedly laundered suspected criminal proceeds using 22 bank accounts between 2017 and last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two of the detained officers were also arrested for suspected fraud. They’d allegedly rented out their mortgaged residential properties between 2019 and last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officers from the Financial Intelligence and Investigation Bureau arrested the 12 people in Sheung Shui, Fanling, Tuen Mun and Kwai Chung on Thursday morning. The police officers were off-duty at the time of the arrests.
  <br>
  <br>
  The force said all seven officers, aged between 28 and 39, have been suspended from duty.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities stressed they attach great emphasis on the conduct of their officers, adding that those who breach the law will not be condoned.

 Police on Thursday said a Hongkonger who was rescued after being trapped in Southeast Asia was forced to work 17 hours a day and beaten for not meeting targets.
 <br>
  <br>
  Officers said the victim, 25, was lured by a social media job advertisement offering HK$120,000 to transport diamonds from Thailand to Taiwan.
  <br>
  <br>
  After arriving in Bangkok last October, he was taken to Myanmar and held in a mountain compound guarded by armed men.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lau Ho-tak, a chief inspector with the force, said the victim was forced to conduct online scams on social media.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Over the past three months, the victim was repeatedly beaten and denied meals because he failed to meet the fraud targets set by management staff at the compound. There are still visible injuries on his body," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police did not disclose whether the victim's family paid ransom in this case.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officers added that they are still in contact with some of the remaining 11 Hongkongers held captive in Southeast Asia and are trying all means to rescue them.
  <br>
  <br>
  The force warned members of the public to stay vigilant against overseas job offers that promise high salaries without requiring professional skills.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong Disneyland said on Thursday that it’s pleased with the theme park’s performance last year in terms of visitor numbers and revenue, and expects it to continue doing very well this year.
 <br>
  <br>
  The theme park’s vice president for communications and public affairs, Anita Lai, said the new 'World of Frozen' attraction, which opened in November 2023, was a big draw for tourists.
  <br>
  <br>
  “A year ago, we launched 'World of Frozen'. This is a movie and a story that people love,” Lai told reporters, adding that there’s been a surge in the number of mainland tourists buying the park’s annual pass.
  <br>
  <br>
  She pointed out that there was a double-digit growth in the number of Shenzhen visitors during last year’s Halloween compared to the same period in 2023, and that Hong Kong Disneyland Resort hotels reached 90 percent occupancy during the Christmas period.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said the park will step up promotions in both the mainland and Southeast Asian countries to entice more visitors during the Lunar New Year period.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked if the park is worried about vigorous competition with Ocean Park -- which will be putting the twin panda cubs on display next month -- Lai said Hong Kong Disneyland welcomes new events and highlights to inject momentum into the city's tourism industry.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Chinese Manufacturers' Association of Hong Kong has urged the government to provide more fiscal and tax support for local enterprises, including extending the principal moratorium arrangements to allow companies to delay their loan payments for a longer time.
 <br>
  <br>
  This was among an array of proposals it put forward to the administration on Thursday ahead of the financial budget next month.
  <br>
  <br>
  The association’s president Wingco Lo said small and medium-sized companies are facing several challenges at the moment.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Currently we are facing a couple of difficulties, like the pricing from the importer, and also the geopolitical pressure, and also the operating [costs]. We are suggesting the government have more support for the small and medium companies to promote local businesses," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  With Donald Trump set to return to the White House next week, Lo said more efforts are needed to diversify businesses to minimise the impact of possible tariffs and Sino-US tensions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lawmaker Jimmy Ng, and the association's executive committee member, said he wants to see more bilateral free trade agreements between the SAR and emerging economies.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We should now focus more on the Asean countries and the Belt and Road countries. For a traditional market they are either not rich enough now or they are not very friendly to us. So the international market is no longer only the States and Europe. We should look for other business economies for a better future."

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Airport Authority on Thursday unveiled a new development called "SKYTOPIA" for Hong Kong's Airport City, aiming to develop it into a world-class landmark.
 <br>
  <br>
  The authority unveiled the Airport City development blueprint which includes measures to expand AsiaWorld-Expo, build the city’s largest yacht bay, and set up the city’s first art storage facility.
  <br>
  <br>
  The three-runway system at the airport commenced operation in November last year, and will boost the airport’s capacity to 120 million passengers a year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chairman of the Airport Authority, Fred Lam, said the Airport City will be more than just about serving travellers using the airport.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We envisage that our airport will not be just a place for passengers to board their planes or a portal for entering Hong Kong,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Our vision is to develop SKYTOPIA into a landmark of its own and also a world leading destination, attracting visitors from within Hong Kong and its prosperous Greater Bay Area, as well as major markets in Asia and around the world.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Cissy Chan, an executive director with the authority, said the Airport City will integrate commercial and cultural activities, and will be a key economic driver for Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said the project would not only consolidate Hong Kong’s status as an international aviation hub, but also boost the city’s development in art trading and entertainment.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Airport Authority said the project would cost about HK$100 billion, including HK$30 billion on infrastructure.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police say they believe they have caught one of four people who raided a jewellery store in Sheung Shui on Wednesday evening and the man, 23, will be charged with robbery.
 <br>
  <br>
  Jewellery worth HK$1.5 million was stolen from a shop on San Fung Avenue by a group of people wielding knives and hammers who escaped in a private car, officers said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Weapons believed to be linked to the raid were later found in a car involved in a crash on Lam Kam Road, while clothes and masks officers suspect were worn by the robbers were found on a nearby hillside.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Through our investigation, we suspect that the vehicle that we mentioned had been surveilling the crime scene a couple of days before the incident took place," Chief Inspector Law Like-him said at a media briefing.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We suspect this shows it was a pre-planned, organised crime."
  <br>
  <br>
  The suspect, who was arrested in Pat Heung in the early hours of Thursday, is expected to appear in Tuen Mun Magistrates' Courts on Saturday, police said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Another Hongkonger held captive in Southeast Asia has been released and returned to Hong Kong on Thursday, officials said.
 <br>
  <br>
  No details were revealed as to what had happened to the SAR resident or how their ordeal came to an end.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Security Bureau, along with colleagues from the police force and the Immigration Department, immediately went to the airport to follow up, confirming that the rescued individual had arrived safely," an official post on social media said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Secretary for Security Chris Tang described the return as "good news".
  <br>
  <br>
  "My team and I will continue to follow up and hope that every Hong Kong resident [detained] can come home safely," he wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier this week, officials said 12 Hongkongers were being held prisoner in Myanmar and Cambodia after being tricked into travelling to Thailand on the false promise of well-paid work there. The captives are said to have been forced into taking part in scams.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police on Wednesday said two women also recently returned to Hong Kong after suffering a similar fate, with their families paying ransoms to secure their release.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tang met representatives from the Royal Thai Consulate-General on Thursday to discuss rescue plans for those still detained in the region.
  <br>
  <br>
  A government taskforce also went to Bangkok earlier this week to talk to officials there about the situation.

    First concert test to happen at main Kai Tak Stadium

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A charity concert is set to take place on Saturday at Kai Tak Sports Park, marking the main stadium's inaugural non-sporting event, with authorities saying it will serve as a test to simulate the logistics for future large-scale performances at the venue.
 <br>
  <br>
  Authorities said approximately 18,000 spectators will attend, with about 4,000 gathering on the ground-level turf area.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tang King-shing, the venue's director for strategic planning, said that assessing the turf's use will be one area of focus during their testing.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The stage and the spectators will be sitting on protective layer using I-track, it's the name of the protective layer, so there won't be any question of damaging the turf itself. So that's why before we have been emphasising the fact that as far as the surface of the main stadium is concerned, it's a flexible arrangement," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We can use genuine turf for high-quality football or rugby events and use the layer underneath, the I-track, for concert events like the one coming this Saturday by simply removing the turf."
  <br>
  <br>
  Commissioner for Sports George Tsoi said event organisers have chosen to close the roof for this concert to better test their acoustics and audio effects.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We hope we can have the opportunity to test out all the different elements and the coordination amongst our different staff and as well as the arrival and dispersal of our audience," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We hope that we can have good experience and further improve our operations in future."
  <br>
  <br>
  Tsoi said doors will open for concert goers at 4pm, with the performance scheduled to start at 6pm and wrap up before 8pm.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that attendees should have already gotten their tickets in advance and they should review the list of prohibited items prior to arriving.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tsoi said more test events are to come, with each one increasing in scale and sophistication, highlighting another large test on January 24 with over 60,000 participants to prepare for the official opening of the Sports Park in March.
  <br>
  <br>
  Principal Transport Officer/Urban of the Transport Department Eric Wan said the MTR will implement special service arrangements, including increased train frequencies, and KMB and Citybus will organise three bus routes serving East Kowloon, West Kowloon and Hong Kong Island during the dispersal period.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Security minister Chris Tang said on Thursday that a government taskforce's trip to Thailand this week has improved the chances of securing the release of a dozen Hongkongers being held captive in Southeast Asia.
 <br>
  <br>
  Tang said the delegation, led by his deputy Michael Cheuk, exchanged important information with Thai counterparts, as well as the Chinese Embassy.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Of course our country helps a lot. During their trip, our officials met officials at the Chinese Embassy in Thailand. Organisations from our country are also working behind the scenes to get the 12 home safely," he told NOW TV.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tang conceded, however, that it will not be easy to rescue those being held prisoner.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will do everything we can in the hope that we can secure the safe return of the 12," the minister said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tang said the Hongkongers, in their early 20s to 40s, were tricked into travelling to Thailand by gangs who falsely promised them well-paid jobs and good accommodation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two other SAR residents who suffered a similar fate were recently freed after their families paid ransoms, according to the police. Tang said people should contact the police if they are asked to hand over money to secure the release of relatives held captive.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tang also offered advice for people who suspect they have been tricked into travelling abroad, saying they should scream while in a public place and seek help immediately.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said from 2022 to 2023, 46 people from Hong Kong were deceived into working for scamming syndicates in Southeast Asia, with the majority eventually returning to the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said such crimes resurfaced in the second quarter of last year.

 Sources on Thursday said a man has been arrested in Pat Heung, in connection with an armed robbery in Sheung Shui the previous evening.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a statement released earlier, police said they suspect that four men, wielding knives and hammers, had robbed a jewellery shop on San Fung Avenue at around 6.30pm on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officers said the suspects fled the scene in a private car, which later crashed with another vehicle on Lam Kam Road near Ng Tung Chai.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police said three men then fled the crash scene.

 A lawmaker on Thursday said the great importance that both Hong Kong and Thai officials have attached to tackling the problem of so-called scam farms in Southeast Asian countries will help prevent citizens falling prey to fake job offers in future.
 <br>
  <br>
  This came as police in Hong Kong arrested a woman for allegedly luring two females from the SAR to Southeast Asia and forcing them to take part in scams.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 32-year-old has been charged with conspiracy to defraud.
  <br>
  <br>
  Undersecretary for Security Michael Cheuk led a delegation to Thailand earlier in the week to help 12 Hong Kong residents who were detained in Myanmar and Cambodia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme, Johnny Ng noted the two governments took the matter very seriously.
  <br>
  <br>
  He believes this will allow the public to realise the seriousness of the matter.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is a very, very good education to let the general public know that we cannot take free air tickets, or free hotels, hospitality... in order to get more unbalanced [rewards] from some jobs," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He suggested the SAR government reach out to its Myanmar and Cambodian counterparts directly, as well as step up cooperation with international police with the help of the central government.
  <br>
  <br>
  While Hong Kong raised the travel alert for Thailand to amber in 2014 due to mass demonstrations in the country, Ng said there was no urgent need to raise the alert level amid the current situation, as it remains a safe destination.

 Police on Wednesday said they arrested a man for attempted snatching, after the 39-year-old allegedly tried to take a police officer’s gun at the Tsim Sha Tsui police station.
 <br>
  <br>
  A statement said officers subdued the man, who was held at the station for an investigation in another case.
  <br>
  <br>
  The force said the arrested person is an off-duty officer who had earlier been arrested on suspicion of voyeurism.
  <br>
  <br>
  The man, along with two officers who subdued him, sustained injuries and was taken to hospital.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police in Hong Kong on Wednesday said they had arrested and charged a woman after two people from the SAR were lured to Southeast Asia and forced to take part in scams, with the victims' families paying ransoms to have them freed.
 <br>
  <br>
  The announcement came as SAR officials vowed to work with Bangkok to try to rescue a dozen Hongkongers being held captive in countries neighbouring Thailand.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police said a beauty worker, 32, had been charged with conspiracy to defraud and was due to appear at Shatin Magistrates' Courts on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a press conference, officers said she was suspected of enticing two women, aged 21 and 23, to Thailand in late December. The women were driven to a "scam hub" in Myanmar where they were forced to take part in fraudulent activities, officers said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The pair returned to Hong Kong this month after their families paid ransoms, police said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The women told officers there were armed guards at the site where they were held and the area was surrounded by a barbed wire fence.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chief Inspector Yu Pok-hon said the arrested woman is believed to have socialised with the two victims to gain their trust, before offering them free travel and job opportunities in Thailand.
  <br>
  <br>
  The force urged people to be wary of online adverts promising jobs with large salaries, and not to put too much trust in friends they have made only recently.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Security Secretary Chris Tang said he has been briefed by a government task force sent to Thailand over reports of other Hongkongers being held in dangerous locations after being tricked into travelling to Bangkok.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tang said the administration will continue to liaise with Thai authorities to bring home 12 SAR residents being held prisoner in Myanmar and Cambodia.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than a dozen other victims have already returned to Hong Kong, officials said on Tuesday.

    HK saw more than 44 million visitors in 2024

<img alt="The government said the 44.5 million visitor arrivals last year were in line with estimates. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1787653_1_20250115153427.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Wednesday said that Hong Kong saw 44.5 million tourist arrivals in 2024, in part boosted by Beijing's relaxation of visa rules for Shenzhen residents.
 <br>
  <br>
  Tourism minister Rosanna Law said the figure represented a near one-third increase from the year before, and was in line with estimates.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since the start of December, Shenzhen residents with the visas have been allowed to visit the SAR for as many times as they like, compared to a previous restriction of one trip per week.
  <br>
  <br>
  Law said last month, there were more than 3.1 million mainland visitor arrivals, or an average of more than 100,000 a day.
  <br>
  <br>
  That was a 17-percent rise from the daily average in November.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The government will make good use of the various measures benefiting Hong Kong to promote the all-round development of Hong Kong’s tourism industry," the minister said in a written reply to the legislature.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said officials will maintain communication with different ministries of the central government, with a view to enable more travellers from the mainland to visit the SAR in a flexible and convenient manner.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Tourism Board, meanwhile, noted that for the annual number of visitors, more than 10 million were from places outside the mainland, representing a 44 percent jump year on year.
  <br>
  <br>
  It noted that out of the 44.5 million arrivals, half of them spent at least one night in Hong Kong, and they stay for around three nights here on average.
  <br>
  <br>
  DAB lawmaker Brave Chan asked if the government would get the United Nation's culture agency, Unesco, to include Hong Kong on its list of "World Cities of Gastronomy".
  <br>
  <br>
  Law said there are now 50 such cities, with Macau, Chengdu, Shunde, Yangzhou, Huaian and Chaozhou the six Chinese places on the list.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said officials will study the matter with reference to the experience of cities on the list.

    EV charging providers urged to improve transparency

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Consumer Council on Wednesday urged charging service providers to improve transparency following complaints about electric vehicle (EV) charging facilities across Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  The watchdog received 179 complaints last year on issues such as unstable power supply, insufficient charging spots and fee disputes.
  <br>
  <br>
  In one case, an EV owner found his overnight charging sessions had been interrupted and his vehicle was left without sufficient power.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another complainant reported she was charged HK$150 in idle fees without being notified – nearly ten times the actual charging cost.
  <br>
  <br>
  The council’s chief executive, Gilly Wong, said service providers should explain the way they set fees.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is a free market, they can charge according to different business models. It could be charged by kilowatts, it could be charged by time, or it could be charged by a monthly plan,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We urge the service providers to align and standardise the unit that they use."
  <br>
  <br>
  The council reminded EV owners to carefully review charging plans and pricing details before use, and to promptly vacate charging spots to avoid idle fees.

    'Some tumblers have lower capacity than advertised'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Some brands of tumblers and travel mugs have a lower capacity than is claimed, the Consumer Council said on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The watchdog also found that plastic mugs are not as effective in keeping drinks hot or cold.
  <br>
  <br>
  The council tested 18 models of tumblers and travel mugs, which claimed a capacity from 350ml to 900ml.
  <br>
  <br>
  But only four models had the actual capacity that was stated. The rest of them held less liquid than claimed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Five mugs or tumblers, from Muji, 24Bottles, Decathlon, National Geographic, and PoleBear, were found to have a discrepancy in capacity of more than 10 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The Council reminds manufacturers that their product design must take into consideration the actual usage by consumers and clearly and accurately state on the product label the actual capacity,” said convenor of the council’s advisory group on digital economy and information technology Jack Poon.
  <br>
  <br>
  The watchdog also passed the results to the Customs and Excise Department for potential follow up actions.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the thermal insulation efficacy test, two stainless steel tumblers from NOC and Stanley performed well as they were able to keep the water temperature at over 60 degrees Celsius after six hours.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thirteen models could maintain the water temperature at above 40 degrees Celsius, but the water temperature in three plastic mugs or tumblers, dropped significantly to between 29 and 26.3 degrees.
  <br>
  <br>
  For cold drinks with temperatures from five degrees to minus one degree Celsius, temperatures from three plastic models rose to as much as 22 degrees after six hours.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two-thirds of samples showed a satisfactory performance in the leak-proof test.
  <br>
  <br>
  The council reminded people to clean their tumblers or mugs as often as they could and recommended they use tools like small brushes to wash narrow bottles.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It's better for you to clean it thoroughly because you never know when the pathogenic bacteria will breed in your container. So the cleaner it is, the better for your food safety,” the council’s chief executive Gilly Wong said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “When you buy this kind of tumbler, check out how many parts they have so that you know you have to open it up and how to clean it and put it back, ensure that you know it performs as well as its original,” she said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong may need to import halal food for all the Muslim tourists it aims to entice to the city, a minister said on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Plans for new measures to attract visitors from the Middle East and Southeast Asia were announced in last year's chief executive policy address.
  <br>
  <br>
  On RTHK's Overview Policy programme, Deputy Chief Secretary Warner Cheuk said as Hong Kong develops into a Muslim-friendly tourist destination, halal food could be brought in from abroad.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong may not have many Muslims, but we need to make a lot of halal food. There are many Muslim countries in Asean, and we can attract restaurants and import food from these nations," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other government moves aimed at attracting more visitors from Muslim nations include encouraging hotels to set up worship facilities, and persuading taxi drivers to provide information in Arabic.

    'Alimony mediation helps divorcees reach settlement'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A pilot scheme which helps separating or divorcing couples from low-income families handle spouse maintenance has processed nearly 40 cases in the first two months since its introduction, taking less than a month on average to close a file.
 <br>
  <br>
  In October last year, authorities introduced a programme through the Community Care Fund to offer free mediation services.
  <br>
  <br>
  The initiative, set to last for three years, aims to process a total of 1,200 cases and help 2,400 people who are going through a separation or divorce.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alice Mak, secretary for home and youth affairs, said the scheme handled 38 cases relating to alimony as of the end of November.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Sixty percent of the cases have either reached an agreement or partially made an agreement, meaning there's an outcome from the mediation. For those completed cases, it takes roughly 24 days from opening to closing a file," she said during an exclusive interview with RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We can see that these mediation services have indeed helped some divorcees to reach maintenance agreements. Some of the participants told us that they found it helpful and they would recommend programme to those in need around them."
  <br>
  <br>
  As for the remaining 40 percent, Mak said the administration would look into possible follow-up actions after collecting more data.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, the minister said her bureau and the Family Council will jointly organise the "Hong Kong Excellent Family Awards" in the second quarter, with participants being judged on a number of areas.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said families must show how well they support each other and whether they have experiences on educating the next generation which are worthy of being referenced, among other criteria.

 Undersecretary for Security Michael Cheuk said he hopes 12 Hong Kong residents who remain unlawfully detained in Southeast Asia can come home before Chinese New Year, as a six-member task force he led concluded their two-day trip to Thailand.
 <br>
  <br>
  Cheuk was also pleased with the progress made by the task force, and expressed gratitude to their Thai counterparts for attaching great importance to the matter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters upon landing at Hong Kong airport on Tuesday evening, the former assistant police commissioner confirmed that 11 of the trapped SAR residents are in Myanmar, while the remaining one is in Cambodia.
  <br>
  <br>
  He described their locations as chaotic and not safe, while armed forces are also present.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cheuk pointed out that all of the victims fell for job scams, and were lured by the syndicates to Bangkok and picked up at the airport.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So far, none of the 72 people who sought assistance were abducted. In this regard, Thailand remains a very safe place," he said, although he cautioned against visiting regions bordering Myanmar, Laos or Cambodia.
  <br>
  <br>
  SAR authorities will now reach out to their counterparts in Myanmar, but admitted the situation was quite complicated.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cheuk also quoted Thai officials as saying that safety measures will be rolled out this week to enhance the safety of tourists.
  <br>
  <br>
  These include a 24-hour hotline that supports eight languages, and a mobile app that allows users to share their real-time location to law enforcement in emergency situations.
  <br>
  <br>
  The number two security official in Hong Kong also explained why the task force embarked on a visit to Thailand when the SAR residents are held elsewhere.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said Thailand has a lot of exchanges with neighbouring countries both historically and culturally, and Thai officials have numerous ways to talk to people in the region, including unofficial means.
  <br>
  <br>
  Before he left the airport, Cheuk received a petition letter from a man whose brother is among those unlawfully detained.
  <br>
  <br>
  The man, who gave his name as Kelvin, hopes to meet the task force soon and receive the latest update on the situation.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police will begin using rapid test kits to detect a regulated sedative from Saturday to tackle the emerging use of the space oil drug.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chief Inspector of the narcotics bureau Kelvin Cheung said the test will serve as an aid during operations when officers suspect products could contain etomidate, a short-acting anaesthetic normally used as an ingredient for the narcotic.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The officers will conduct the stop-and-search in an ordinary manner. When they find the vapes, they will conduct enquiries, they will ask questions, and they will also conduct observations before conducting the interception," Cheung said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If they, after conducting all the necessary enquiries at the scene, are still unable to form the reasonable belief, and they still suspect that the vapes actually contain etomidate... they will use the test kit."
  <br>
  <br>
  The kit contains a testing strip used to swab samples of alternative smoking products. It will then be mixed with a solution that can show a positive or negative result in less than a minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  The accuracy of the test can reach up to 99 percent, Cheung said, adding that the force has procured a sufficient amount of testing kits.
  <br>
  <br>
  Etomidate is a controlled drug that is prescribed by a doctor and is currently classified as a Part 1 poison.
  <br>
  <br>
  The number of arrests relating to the controlled drug skyrocketed from eight in 2023 to 206 in the first 11 months of last year. Nearly 23 percent of those arrested last year were people aged below 21, with the youngest being only 12 years old.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sky, who is said to be about 20 years old, first got a taste of the space oil drug at a bar. Speaking at a police press event, Sky said it looked like a normal e-cigarette. Sky later became addicted to the drug and started experiencing memory loss.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Sometimes I forgot what I did. I also had errors in my judgement. When my friends saw the traffic light was red, I thought it was green and walked out onto the road," Sky said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Leo Man, from the Hong Kong Federation of Youth Groups, told the same event that etomidate is very addictive. He said there has been a case where someone taking the drug died after mistaking a window for a door.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government is planning to list etomidate as a dangerous drug on February 14.
  <br>
  <br>
  Once listed, those illegally possessing or consuming space oil drugs containing the sedative would face a maximum of seven years in prison and a fine of HK$1 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  And those trafficking or illegally importing the drug would be liable to a maximum penalty of life imprisonment and a fine of HK$5 million.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The government's task force to help Hong Kong residents who were allegedly lured to Southeast Asian countries to engage in illegal work on Tuesday concluded its visit to Thailand.
 <br>
  <br>
  Led by Under Secretary for Security Michael Cheuk, the task force arrived in the country on Sunday to follow up on the cases.
  <br>
  <br>
  A government statement said Cheuk received positive feedback in a Tuesday meeting to exchange intelligence with Thailand's senior inspector general Thatchai Pitaneelaboot.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pitaneelaboot said Thai authorities will further strengthen the prevention of transnational crimes, and do their utmost to assist the safe return of Hong Kong residents.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cheuk also met Thailand's vice minister for tourism and sports Jakkaphon Tangsutthitham and the commissioner of the tourist police bureau Saksira Pheuak-um to learn about the latest measures to protect tourists.
  <br>
  <br>
  Members of the task force later met a deputy commissioner general of the Thai National Police Prachuab Wongsuk to reflect the situation of the cases involving Hong Kong residents.
  <br>
  <br>
  The statement also said Cheuk expressed gratitude to the Chinese Embassy in Thailand and Thai authorities for attaching great importance to the requests for assistance from Hong Kong people.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[Authorities] will continue to maintain close liaison with the embassy and the Thai authorities in the future to exchange intelligence on the latest situation of the cases, and to provide appropriate advice and all practicable assistance to the assistance seekers and their families," it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The task force is expected to return to Hong Kong on Tuesday night.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A scholar has been convicted of killing his wife and daughter with a yoga ball filled with lethal gas following a retrial, with a High Court judge sentencing him to life imprisonment.
 <br>
  <br>
  A seven-member jury unanimously found Khaw Kim Sun, a former Chinese University medical professor, guilty of causing the deaths of his wife and second child, after less than four hours of deliberation.
  <br>
  <br>
  The academic appeared calm when the verdict was handed down and chose not to make a mitigation plea.
  <br>
  <br>
  He had been accused of putting a yoga ball filled with carbon monoxide in the boot of a Mini Cooper in 2015, with the gas leaking out and killing the pair.
  <br>
  <br>
  Khaw was first convicted of two counts of murder in 2018 and sentenced to life behind bars.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2023, the top court quashed his murder conviction and ordered a retrial, after ruling the initial trial judge had misdirected the jury.
  <br>
  <br>
  During the retrial that began in November last year, Khaw opted to defend himself and claimed he had bought carbon monoxide for an experiment.
  <br>
  <br>
  But prosecutors challenged his claims, saying the experiment was a "sham" to hide his real motive of possessing the lethal gas.
