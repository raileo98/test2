   The observatory says it will issue the Standby Signal No 1 between 10pm on Thursday and 4am on Friday as Tropical Cyclone Trami edges closer to the SAR.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It said Trami is expected to gradually move towards the vicinity of Hainan and come within 800 kilometres of Hong Kong on Thursday night or Friday morning.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The observatory said a higher typhoon signal could be possible on Friday or Saturday, depending on the storm's movement and any change in local wind conditions.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The observatory said Trami could linger in the vicinity of Hainan or move eastwards across central and northern parts of the South China Sea early next week.

  <img alt="Ombudsman Jack Chan says the Planning Department and Lands Department need to work together more rather than solely focusing on their own affairs.

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Two separate government departments that deal with unauthorised land use should start working more closely with each other and share intelligence to put a stop to offenders, the Ombudsman said on Thursday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Jack Chan said he has come up with 16 recommendations for the planning and lands departments on how they can better tackle the hundreds of complaints they get each year about problems such as people filling in ponds without permission or turning green belt land and conservation zones into car parks.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Chan said the Planning Department's enforcement action sometimes fails to deter repeat offenders and such people should be given less and less time to comply with enforcement notices for each subsequent breach they make.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Lands Department, meanwhile, needs to improve guidelines and training for staff so they can better deal with priority cases in a timely manner, Chan said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Ombudsman said getting different parts of the government to collaborate more is one of his major goals and to this end, the planning and lands departments "should work together in such cases and to sort it out, instead of one department handling its own matters."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Chan also recommended the two departments establish a database for unauthorised development cases "to facilitate interdepartmental intelligence sharing and enforcement, as well as formulate targeted measures for high-risk sites to nip problems in the bud".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In response, the two departments vowed to strengthen cooperation with each other, such as by conducting joint enforcement operations against large-scale unauthorised cases through a pilot scheme, and setting up a high-level communication platform.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Planning Department also said it would continue to tackle illegal developments to meet public expectations and streamline its enforcement workflow.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   For the Lands Department, it said it would review existing guidelines and enhance staff training to follow up on cases in a timely manner.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   The development minister on Thursday said that her bureau will consider merging the City Gallery in Central with a new exhibition hall in Wan Chai, which will showcase major development projects.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Development Bureau said the HK$600 million exhibition will feature projects such as the Northern Metropolis as well as the Kau Yi Chau Artificial Islands.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Speaking on a Commercial Radio programme, Bernadette Linn acknowledged that some people have expressed concerns over the amount of money involved in the project, but stressed that the construction fee is similar to that of other government buildings.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   She also revealed that the government will take into consideration lawmakers’ suggestion to merge the City Gallery with the new exhibition hall.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The City Gallery showcases Hong Kong's planning history. It also exhibits part of the Northern Metropolis project because we don't have anywhere else to showcase the project," she said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Lawmakers have suggested the existing exhibits in the City Gallery could be merged together with our proposed facility in a larger gallery hall, so that the City Gallery can be vacated. We think it's a good suggestion."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Linn added they hope the new facility in Wan Chai will open in 2027.

    'Use MPF records to counter fake qualifications'

  <div class="itemFullText">
   A concern group for construction site safety on Thursday said authorities could consider using Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF) records as a more reliable way to verify workers’ employment histories.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The suggestion came after the anti-graft agency ICAC said it arrested 148 people for allegedly using fake qualifications to obtain excavator operator and electrician licences, which involved applicants attending phony courses, and receiving documents claiming they attained the required work experience.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The chair of the Hong Kong Institute of Safety Practitioner’s Education and Training Committee, Lee Kwong-sing, said people are seeking shortcuts to obtain licences to improve their job prospects because the construction industry is doing well.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The expert also pointed out that there is a loophole in the current way work experience is verified, in which only an employer’s letter is required.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "If authorities required MPF contribution records, it would be much harder to fake qualifications. Applicants would need three to five years of records to qualify, which requires long-term planning," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "But that's not the case now. At the moment they can just verify using an employer's letter, which seems a bit casual."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Labour Department said 100 excavator operator and 32 electrician licences have been revoked so far.

   Mainland tourists joining new tours of Hong Kong shopping malls won't be obliged to go on a spending spree, a retail industry representative said on Thursday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Travel Industry Council and Retail Management Association have devised 14 different itineraries for "in-depth tours" of five shopping centres in the city, with participants promised the chance to hear some  "urban legends" during their two-hour visits.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Association chairwoman Annie Yau Tse said that while participants will be received by a mall representative and will be offered discounts on their spending, they will be free to roam around and can decide for themselves where to make any purchases.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   With concerns that tourists are spending less in Hong Kong, Tse said it will be down to the shops in the malls to try to get visitors to splash the cash.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The most important thing is that there are customers around. Once they come into the malls, we can think of ways to attract them to consume," she said on an RTHK programme.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "But if there are no customers at all, then really nothing can be done. So when there are more people around, that's already an advantage for us."

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The first-ever discovery of dinosaur fossils in Hong Kong is a "momentous" achievement and could mark the beginning of a series of exciting finds in the wider region, a palaeontologist said on Thursday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Officials announced on Wednesday that dinosaur fossils believed to date back to the Cretaceous period, about 145 million to 66 million years ago, have been discovered on Port Island in the northeastern waters of the SAR.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The discovery of these bones is super exciting because we have rocks of the right age and the right environment but having looked for so many years, different people have not been able to find dinosaur bones, including myself," said Michael Pittman from the School of Life Sciences at Chinese University.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "From what I hear they seem to be from some larger dinosaurs. I've seen pictures of models that are of long-neck dinosaurs and the hadrosaur dinosaurs, so these are among the biggest."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Pittman said the find was also "very lucky" since Hong Kong isn't an ideal location for fossil preservation, given that the territory had a lot of volcanic activity in the past.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He added that finding dinosaur bones in the SAR is challenging due to the topography and landscape.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "There have been Jurassic-age fish, there have been older Devonian fish. Very interesting, but not like large volumes of fossils, and that's partly because there's not much area to look for fossils. Also, the rocks are quite hard and they don't readily erode out fossils," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "When we look for fossils, we typically go to a place where you can easily access them, and we focus on places where there are lots and lots of fossils, so it's rich in fossils and makes it easier. So because of those various reasons I mentioned, Hong Kong hasn't been a focus point for looking for fossils."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He said China is one of four main countries in the world for dinosaur fossils, along with the US, Canada and Argentina, but the Guangdong area is famous only for dinosaur eggs.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Pittman also welcomed the signing of an agreement between the Development Bureau and the mainland's Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology, to deepen exchanges and cooperation.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Obviously, finding some fossils in Hong Kong enriches our local palaeontology heritage. But my hope is the agreement would help to further exchanges with the institute, which people like myself have been working for for more than a decade," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The dinosaur fossils will be on public display at the Heritage Discovery Centre in Kowloon Park from Friday.

    'Civil servants welcome new family-friendly measures'

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The government on Thursday revealed that civil servants and unions have welcomed its move to offer more family-friendly measures, with officials expressing the hope that the rest of society would follow suit.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It comes after Chief Executive John Lee proposed in his Policy Address last week that civil servants with children under three can get three days of childcare leave annually starting next April.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   On an RTHK radio programme on Thursday, the Secretary for the Civil Service Ingrid Yeung was asked if the government is taking the lead by rolling out more family-friendly measures, to which she responded: “We hope the whole society can offer more childcare measures to help parents.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   She added that the reaction to the new measure has been "really good". "The unions and other civil servant colleagues have welcomed the measure and are looking forward to it."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Speaking to reporters after the show, she said the government will monitor the measure – expected to benefit some 12,000 employees – after it takes effect.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We will review how this works out and see if there is room for improvement, or whether it really affects our work seriously.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The minister also pointed out that a number of factors have led to a 10-percent vacancy rate in the civil service, and that the government needs more time to deal with the manpower crunch.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "In the past few years, we've seen a high retirement wave. It's simply because of the age of civil servants. And also, the number of graduates is not as many as a decade ago. So we have to really compete for talents,” Yeung said.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   A longer and greener Wine and Dine Festival opened on Wednesday, as locals and tourists flocked to the harbourfront to indulge themselves in culinary treats and fine wines.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Acting Financial Secretary Michael Wong kicked off the event and told the crowd, "Do not get drunk. You have one more day to enjoy all the great wines. And I know you will do it judiciously, prudently and soberly.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I'm proud to say that Hong Kong has emerged as a global wine hub, where wine lovers can enjoy ever-growing selections of wines from all over the world."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   For the first time, the festival starts on Wednesday night and lasts five days - up from four previously - until Sunday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Organisers are also keen to cut down waste, with disposable plastic cups now prohibited at the venue, in line with the government's ban on single-use plastics. Visitors can encouraged to bring their own glasses, or they can purchase one on-site for HK$50.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Hundreds of tourists who arrive on cruises have been invited to join the fest, according to tourism chief Kevin Yeung, while shuttle buses also run between the venue and the Shenzhen Bay checkpoint to facilitate cross-border visitors.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The annual flagship event by the Tourism Board features over 300 booths, serving foods and drinks from 35 countries and regions.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Bayley, a tourist from the United States, was impressed by the event.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "[It's] very different from a festival in the States… [In the US] it wouldn't be this organised," she told RTHK.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Having it not only in country, but also they say wine and food, and having all the pictures. That's not a thing in the States."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It was German tourist Tanja's first time at the festival.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I'm overwhelmed because there's so much to see, and so much to discover. We enjoy very much. It's very nice. We do not know where to start and where to end…We have to come back again," she said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   For Anton, a German expat working in Hong Kong, wine was what attracted him to the fair.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He was surprised to see so many people turn up on opening night, given it's only Wednesday and most still needed to work the next morning.

    Govt mulls ways to crack down on fake accountants

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Officials on Wednesday said they are looking at ways to crack down on unlicensed accountants in the city by revising auditing standards, with lawmakers saying the measure will help maintain Hong Kong's status as a global financial hub.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury Christopher Hui said that accountants may be required to provide their practising certificate number when signing audit reports.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   On his blog, he wrote that companies may also be required to provide the practising certificate number of accountants who helped sign the audit report along with their profits tax returns.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Accounting sector lawmaker Edmund Wong said that currently, it is almost impossible for the government to check if the accountants signing the reports are licensed or not, as most of these documents are submitted in paper form.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "They are pretending that they are licensed to sign off audit reports and sign off reports recklessly without any supporting document behind. In such cases, the unlicensed issues have seriously damaged and impacted our profession's reputation in the past years," he told RTHK.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Wong said the proposed measure would help uphold the SAR's reputation and status as an international financial centre, though he admitted it may take some time for companies to get used to the change.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It might be causing some inconvenience and difficulties at the beginning, especially for the first few years," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "But as we all know, by 2030, the profits tax return has to be filed electronically. By that time, all those data, including the practising numbers could easily be collected by the government."

   A 34-year-old man and a 47-year-old woman remain in police detention, after Narcotics Bureau officers on Tuesday discovered 24 litres of suspected liquid cocaine, hidden in red wine bottles.

    More workers, funding needed for social services

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   A council that represents non-governmental social services organisations on Wednesday said most groups they spoke to are facing manpower shortages and money issues, with nearly half of them expecting less funding next year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Hong Kong Council of Social Service said it surveyed more than 140 organisations and found that nearly 86 percent of them faced staff shortages and that a lot of experienced social workers have retired or left the industry.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Its chief executive Chua Hoi-wai said it is vital to invest in new talent.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I think different kinds of training [are needed]. And not only this, but we also should try to attract more people joining our profession, joining our sector," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We want more people to understand the impact of social welfare services so that we can gather more cross-sector collaboration and we can also attract more talents to join our sector."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In terms of funding, Chua said the council found that 78 percent of the organisations polled are dealing with cash shortfalls.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He said the economic situation in the SAR is contributing to a drop in donations, adding the survey found that nearly half of the firms it spoke to anticipate a decrease in funding and donations for 2024-25.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We would not have enough resources to provide the needy social services, and another issue is when we say that we have a lack of manpower, actually the cost of manpower has increased in these few years," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Chua also said the council encouraged NGOs to invest more in digital transformation to help reduce costs or increase efficiency.

    New book addresses questions about sex, relationships

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The Family Planning Association has introduced a new book to address questions about relationships and changes during puberty.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Chau Wai-wai, an education officer from the association, on Wednesday said the book covers various topics including body image, sexual orientation and sexual identities.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "When we are addressing body image, when we are addressing bodily changes, when we are addressing sexual desire, we try to make it positive. It's part of life, it's part of growing up," she said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Hong Kong's sex education came under the spotlight recently when officials released a set of teaching materials suggesting that rather than acting upon sexual impulses, young people should consider going to play badminton instead.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Critics said the advice was “out of touch”, but the Education Bureau said the materials aim to teach pupils how to protect themselves.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Chau said she wants to see more comprehensive sex education in the school curriculum.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “Hong Kong is a stressful society. Also in schools, teaching time is very limited. In that case, sex education is squeezed into different subjects,” she said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “So there's no independent subject or not even compulsory in the curriculum. In that sense, of course, we would like to see sex education included more in the curriculum.”

    Wine and Dine vendors keep spirits high

  <img alt="The Wine and Dine Festival will run for five days until Sunday. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1775865_1_20241023171411.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Vendors at this year’s Wine and Dine Festival have expressed confidence in business, with some expecting double-digit growth.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The event runs until Sunday at the Central Harbourfront with over 300 booths offering food and drink.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   One of those reappearing at the festival is MyiCellar, which specialises in Kweizhou Zhenjiu.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Co-founder Tomy Wu said his company is eyeing a 30-to-50 percent increase in business amid the growing popularity of Chinese baijiu.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “More and more people know about baijiu, so we expect the revenue and sales to increase quite significantly, compared with last year,” Wu said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “We expect, in the long run, sales to increase, because the lower tax rate is beneficial to those middle- to high-end products. Very likely, we will also use the tax cut to decrease the price of the products.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   For the first time, the festival features exhibition areas about the United Kingdom, Australia, Chile and Thailand.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Tracy Cheung, senior brand manager of Edrington Hong Kong, is optimistic about the company’s debut at the festival.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “We expect there will be quite a lot of customers interested in the products because this is the first time we have a ‘UK Pavilion’ at the Wine and Dine Festival, and it’s also our first time to participate in this big festival,” Cheung said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “We are expecting roughly 1,000 to 2,000 cocktails per day.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Unlike in the past, this year’s festival lasts for five days instead of four.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Zachary Chan, co-founder of Hong Kong Liquor Store which has joined the festival for about a decade, said the longer event will help.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “We should be able to do better sales than last year. This year, we got some new products we are promoting at our booth. We got whiskey and gin from different places. We’ll be doing a lot of cocktails. I think that’s one of the areas of growth is a lot of people are looking for cocktails. That’s one of the focuses we are doing this year,” Chan told RTHK.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “With the extra day and everything, we are hoping to do 15 percent more than we did last year overall.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Forum Restaurant, which last took part in 2017, is expecting business to grow 30 to 40 percent.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Executive chef Adam Wong said the boost could come from people who choose to stay in Hong Kong to spend.

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The government said on Wednesday that officials have approved applications for nearly 29,000 imported workers in the past year, after restrictions on overseas labour were lifted for 26 types of job.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The approval figure relates to the Enhanced Supplementary Labour Scheme (ESLS) which began in September last year and is separate from similar programmes that allow the importation of workers for  construction, transport and care home posts.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In a written reply to unionist lawmaker Chau Siu-chung, Labour Secretary Chris Sun said officials received applications to import more than 66,000 workers.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The 29,000 or so given approval amount to 44 percent of the total number of applications.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Waiters topped the list of workers coming in with 5,200 approvals, followed by 3,200 cooks and 2,900 junior cooks, Sun said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Chau asked the government to suspend the scheme to protect local workers.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "[The Labour Department] has been closely monitoring the implementation of ESLS, and will review [the scheme] prior to the lapse of its two-year implementation period," Sun said in response.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The minister added that officials have received 62 complaints from the imported workers, mainly over issues involving wages and working hours.

    ICAC arrests 148 over fake professional qualifications

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The ICAC on Wednesday said they arrested 148 people for allegedly using fake qualifications to obtain excavator operator and electrician licences.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Those arrested include construction workers and people who are suspected of providing fake qualifications services.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The anti-graft body's principal investigator Glory Leung assured the public that no safety issues have been found so far.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We have [reviewed] works they handled [in the past], whether there's any industrial accident, or other event that led to safety issues, but so far there are no safety issues in those applications involving false qualifications," Leung said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The ICAC said the cases involved criminal masterminds who provided fake courses, with training for excavator operator licences costing about HK$22,000 and those for electrician licences costing between HK$500 to HK$1,000.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Upon completion of a fake course, applicants would receive a document claiming they attained the required work experience.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Meanwhile, the Labour Department, and the Electrical and Mechanical Services Departments (EMSD) – which are involved in the issuance of working licences for both professions – said they have been cooperating with the watchdog in the law enforcement process.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Labour Department said it launched investigations on training course providers, and its staff members, while the EMSD said it reviewed the registrations of those concerned.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   One hundred excavator operator and 32 electrician licences have been revoked so far.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The departments said they will continue to review and improve their admission and approval procedures to ensure registration standards.

   Culture and tourism minister Kevin Yeung on Wednesday said the authorities will continue to work on getting event organisers to make use of the Kai Tak Cruise Terminal.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   During a Legco meeting, lawmaker Chan Yuet-ming said business near the terminal is bleak, especially when compared with the situation around Ocean Terminal in Tsim Sha Tsui.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In response, Yeung said it was unreasonable to compare the two facilities as their purposes are different, adding that it would be impossible to use a lot of the Kai Tak Cruise Terminal for commercial purposes without a complete revamp.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But he said the authorities are trying their best to make use of the facility and attract local residents to visit it.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We understand that there won't be cruises docking at the terminal every day. On days without a cruise, we want to make use of the area. There are different exhibitions held, and we encourage organisers to hold large-scale events," Yeung said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "But we have to consider the timing, there may only be four or five consecutive days without a cruise, and this limits the variety of events to be held at the terminal."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   DAB lawmaker Edward Leung suggested building helipads at the terminal to boost the low-altitude economy.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "[We want to] build our cruise economy and attract tourists to come to Hong Kong to take a ride on the helicopter. We are now trying to promote a low-altitude economy, so cruise passengers could take helicopter rides to view Victoria Harbour or go to the Geopark," Leung said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Yeung said the government is looking into whether there is any room to build new facilities at the site.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We definitely have to consider the feasibility technically, for example, whether the load-bearing capacity of the cruise terminal is enough for more facilities or holding more events... but this would be one of the ways of development to be considered," he said.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   The government on Wednesday said Hong Kong saw a 16-percent jump in visitors from ten mainland cities in the third quarter, following Beijing's decision to allow individual visits from these places.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Individual Visit Scheme was expanded in March and May, and it involved the cities of Qingdao, Xi'an, Taiyuan, Hohhot, Harbin, Lhasa, Lanzhou, Xining, Yinchuan and Urumqi.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Tourism Bureau revealed the boost in mainland tourist numbers in a response to a question from tourism sector lawmaker Perry Yiu, who also chairs the China Travel Service.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It said more than 140,000 inbound visitors came from the ten cities between July and September, adding that since the visit scheme's expansion, some officials had visited these places and encouraged their trade representatives to tour the SAR.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Since April this year, the Tourism Board has distributed nearly 30,000 sets of discount vouchers, each valued at HK$200, to visitors from the ten cities through travel agents and airlines," the bureau said in a written reply.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It added that it will continue to work with the trade to look for business opportunities and promote two-way tourism exchanges with mainland cities.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   The government on Wednesday gave the green light for the Regal Oriental Hotel in Kowloon City to be partially converted into a youth hostel.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Non-governmental organisation Yan Oi Tong will take ownership of 80 rooms, providing 160 beds.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Named "YOT Hub", it is the fifth such project to be granted approval under the Subsidy Scheme for Using Hotels and Guesthouses as Youth Hostels which began last year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "YOT Hub is well connected by public transport with comprehensive community facilities in the vicinity. This project not only provides young people with a comfortable living environment but also enables them to broaden their horizons and achieve their personal development goals through various self-enhancement activities," a government spokesman said in a statement.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Programmes such as training and internship will be provided for tenants to deepen their understanding of national development opportunities.

    Emma Raducanu becomes latest to pull out of HK Open

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Hong Kong Tennis Open organisers on Wednesday announced that former US Open champion Emma Raducanu will not take part in the tournament, a development that comes on the heels of star player Naomi Osaka's decision to drop out.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   With two of the big names out, organisers stressed there will still be an "incredible line-up of marquee stars" at the event.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It pointed out that top players – including defending champion Leylah Fernandez, former world number one Simona Halep, and Wimbledon quarter-finalist Lulu Sun – will be taking part in the event which runs from October 26 to November 3.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Hong Kong China Tennis Association said in a statement that it was unfortunate that Raducanu will not be participating in the all-female tournament and wished her a speedy recovery.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Injuries are an unfortunate part of the game, and we do hope that she will be back competing as soon as possible," the statement added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Raducanu's decision comes after four-time Grand Slam champion Naomi Osaka announced her withdrawal from the tournament.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The 21-year-old Briton continues to rehab from a foot injury she sustained in the quarter-finals of the Korea Open in September.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “I’m sorry to say that I will not be able to play in Hong Kong next week," Raducanu said in a statement through the association. "While my foot is making good progress, I need a little more time before I am match fit," she added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Raducanu's spot in the draw has since been filled by 2020 Australian Open winner Sofia Kenin.

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Former education and housing secretary Michael Suen, who was best known for his measures to combat a housing crisis two decades ago, has died at the age of 80.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Suen joined the government in 1966 and held various positions.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   During his tenure as housing minister, he rolled out nine measures to revive the property market in 2002, after it plummeted to record lows following the Asian financial crisis in 1997.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The measures included halting regular land auctions, as well as suspending the Home Ownership Scheme and the selling of subsidised housing.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Critics argued that the drastic reduction in housing supply brought on by the measures led to housing shortages and soaring property prices.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Suen served as education minister from 2007 to 2012 before retiring.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Chief Executive John Lee expressed sorrow over the death, saying Suen made great contributions to the government over the years.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "He had formulated strategies and provided counsel to the HKSAR in various policy areas, addressing different challenges while promoting Hong Kong's development. He commanded great respect from government colleagues and members of the community with his dedicated service to the public over the years," Lee said in a statement.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Housing Secretary Winnie Ho also expressed sorrow, saying Suen's connections with housing affairs started when he joined the Housing Authority in 1973.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Education minister Christine Choi said Suen put in place many important education policies including the "334" academic structure, adding that his achievements will continue to have an impact.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Cultural, sports and tourism chief Kevin Yeung, meanwhile, praised Suen for his contributions to various government policies.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Executive Council convenor and New People’s Party lawmaker Regina Ip said Suen played a crucial role in the SAR's development.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "He was in charge of many important policy areas, including constitutional development, land, housing and planning, and before his retirement, education. When I first met him, he was a district officer in Sha Tin, and he was responsible for clearance of Tai Wai to make room for the construction of Sha Tin City One. So he really played a very important role in Hong Kong's development over many decades," Ip said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In 2011, Suen was diagnosed with kidney failure and contracted Legionnaires’ disease the same year.

    'No bid splitting for the govt's Youth Post hostel'

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The government on Wednesday said it does not plan to split the bidding for its proposed youth hostel and cultural exchanges facility, saying that could contradict its aim of fostering exchanges.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Chief Executive John Lee had announced in his Policy Address that authorities would convert the existing Kai Tak Community Isolation Facility into the Youth Post, where young people coming from outside Hong Kong would stay and interact with locals.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Secretary for Home and Youth Affairs Alice Mak told an RTHK programme that bid splitting is not cost effective and will also contradict the government's aim of setting up the place.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Our bidding direction is that the operator has to have relevant experience. It doesn't have to be in charge of the whole venue, which is so big, because there are a lot of different areas," she said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It can look for groups or organisations to manage this place together. But if we were to split the bidding, it would actually restrict the operator's plan on how to use this facility."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Authorities hope to begin the bidding process by the end of this year, and open the facility in 2025.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   And with officials already drafting the tender for the bidding, Mak emphasised that the operator has to be financially independent.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The operator has to consider how it is going to operate the site. They have to be financially autonomous. The government won't invest anymore. The government might also consider charging for rent – I believe the plot of land won't be given for free. The operator has to consider how to manage their losses and gains."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   As for improving the transport network in the area, Mak said she hopes to tackle the issue with other departments.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Another monkey at the Hong Kong Zoological and Botanical Gardens has died, bringing the death toll to 12.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Leisure and Cultural Services Department said a De Brazza’s monkey that had been put under isolation died on Tuesday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A necropsy has been carried out to determine the cause of death.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It followed the deaths of 11 monkeys since the middle of the month, caused by sepsis after they caught melioidosis.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Officials said earlier workers had dug up the ground near the monkey enclosure and might have brought in contaminated soil on their shoes.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The government said the zoo's mammal section remains closed.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It also said the health conditions of 78 mammals and staff caring for the animals there are normal.

    Fresh bid to draw tourists to shopping malls

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The Travel Industry Council (TIC) on Tuesday announced a new programme to arrange in-depth tours for tourists at shopping malls during mega events in Hong Kong.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In collaboration with the hotel and retail sectors, the TIC has put 14 itineraries from six travel agencies on the China Mobile "MyLink" app targeting mainland visitors.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A bar-hopping tour in Tsim Sha Tsui during the Wine and Dine festival and a tour featuring Hong Kong's urban legends are among those on offer.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Fanny Yeung, the TIC's executive director, said the programme aims to leverage the city's mega events and encourage visitors to explore shopping malls.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Because right now a lot of individual travellers seldom visit shopping malls, and it didn't help us in our retail area. So we would like to include the retail part into this kind of in-depth tour to target this group of travellers," she said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Annie Yau Tse, chairwoman of the Retail Management Association, said five shopping malls will be covered, namely the IFC mall in Central, K11 Musea and THE ONE in Tsim Sha Tsui, Langham Place in Mong Kok, and the Temple Mall in Wong Tai Sin.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Tse said participants will receive gifts and discounts.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "After the pandemic, individual travellers come to Hong Kong for tourism experiences rather than shopping, so the current capacity is enough. [The new initiative] to bring group tourists to shopping malls is well within our capacity to accommodate," she said.

   <br/>
   Officers received a report at 10.30pm on Monday that a flat at the Wonderland Housing Estate was burgled, with three watches worth around HK$290,000 being stolen.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Two men, aged 31 and 36, were arrested on suspicion of burglary and attempted burglary, criminal damage and assaulting a police officer.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We found that the two suspects were hiding under a motorcycle cover outside a house in the village. When police identified themselves to the suspects, one of them tried to struggle and flee. He even pushed the police, causing the officer to suffer from a broken finger," said chief inspector Tam Tsz-wai.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Police said both suspects are two-way permit holders.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Tam added that the burgled flat is 1 kilometre away from Tsang's home, which was broken into on Sunday evening. A small amount of jewellery, watches and cash were stolen.

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Cathay Pacific has announced that its employees will receive a bonus equivalent to one month's salary, after the flag carrier said it saw good results this year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Alex McGowan, Chief Operations and Service Delivery Officer on Tuesday said he felt the company has to find ways to keep the best people in the industry.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Moving forward, of course, we always want to keep our remuneration competitive so that we can attract and retain the best people. We're very pleased, I think, over the course of the last year to have seen our turnover rates, our attrition rates, particularly in our pilot community, to come down to levels that we haven't seen for decades, not even pre-pandemic," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "But pilot turnover is now at historic lows, and I hope that that's testimony to the fact that our pilots enjoy working for Cathay and the opportunities that working for Cathay provides."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The group had in August posted a net profit of HK$3.6 billion for the first half of the year, but that was down 15 percent compared with the same period in 2023. It recorded a 14 percent on-year rise in revenue to HK$49.6 billion for the same period.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   McGowan was speaking to reporters after the celebration ceremony for the order of up to 150 aircraft with Airbus, during which the group's CEO, Ronald Lam said the expansion and modernisation of the Cathay fleet come as Hong Kong International Airport prepares to open its three-runway system at the end of the year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "From 2026, we'll start to take delivery of the second order of our narrow-body passenger aircraft, which will consist of A321neo as well as A320neo into both the Cathay Pacific, as well as HK Express fleet," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Then from 2027, we'll start to take delivery of A350 freighter to expand our cargo fleet so that we can continue to strengthen Hong Kong's number one air cargo hub status. From 2028 onwards, we'll start to take delivery of A330 new aircraft, the new generation A330," Lam added.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   MTR officials have warned that services on the Tung Chung Line are expected to be curtailed late on Saturday night, with no trains travelling between Tung Chung and Sunny Bay.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Free shuttle buses will be provided for people to travel between the two stations as major track diversion works take place as part of the Tung Chung Line extension in the two hours before the line's usual closure time.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The railway company said the last train from Tung Chung will depart at 11.01pm, while the last train going all the way to Tung Chung will leave Hong Kong Station at 11.07pm.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Trains from Hong Kong to Sunny Bay and vice-versa will run as usual.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The company’s chief of airport segment, Ben Lui, said services might also be affected on Sunday if there is any delay to the works.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “We have done a lot of preparation and planning, and our team will work closely together. Hopefully, we will have all the works completed before the next traffic day,” he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “We will try our best, and strive for the early completion of the works, without affecting train services on the next day.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   With a tropical cyclone expected to move closer to Hong Kong, the works may be postponed to the following Saturday if the weather is too bad, Lui said.

    Auctions for Lunar New Year fair stalls kick off

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Four fast food stalls at Victoria Park's annual Lunar New Year fair were auctioned off on Tuesday for a total of more than HK$600,000 with authorities saying the result reflected the current market sentiment.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Bidding for the stalls – one of which would have cost more than HK$500,000 before the Covid pandemic – saw two of the successful offers reaching the base price of HK$124,700. The amount for the most expensive stall reached HK$182,000, while the fourth stall was sold at HK$2,000 less than that amount.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department, which is in charge of the auction, said the prices reflected the current market situation.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The top bidder, surnamed Ng, said there were just a handful of bidders this time around, compared to more than a dozen in the preceding year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I will probably earn less of a profit compared to last year. But it's still worth a shot," he told reporters.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The bidding was less competitive because I know some fellow snack sellers are having a tough time making a living out there. So they didn't join the bidding."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A florist who successfully acquired a stall at the fair also thought the competition for flower stalls was not too fierce, because some sellers ended up with a lot of unsold stock last year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Auctions for other stalls, including those for dry goods, will be held in the next two days.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The fair will feature nearly 400 stalls at Victoria Park for a week starting from January 23.

   The observatory says it will issue the Standby Signal No 1 late on Thursday or early Friday, if Tropical Cyclone Trami follows its projected path and edges closer to Hong Kong.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "According to the present forecast, Trami to the east of the Philippines will intensify gradually and enter within 800 kilometres of Hong Kong," meteorologists said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Trami, which is Vietnamese for a type of Camellia, is expected to move west towards the vicinity of Hainan in the coming days.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The observatory said a higher typhoon warning signal could eventually be possible, depending on the storm's movement and wind conditions.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Forecasters also warned that the weather will deteriorate this weekend.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Under the combined effect of Trami and the northeast monsoon, it will be windy and become cloudy with a few showers over the coast of southern China later on Friday and over the weekend."

    'Lack of care led to sports association data breach'
   </title>

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data (PCPD) on Tuesday accused the South China Athletic Association (SCAA) of having inadequate policies and a lack of care, after a data breach affecting more than 72,300 members.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   An attack by a hacker in March resulted in a breach of members’ personal information, including ID card numbers, passport details, phone numbers, photos and addresses.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The privacy watchdog said the SCAA accidentally exposed its servers to the internet, which the hacker took advantage of to infiltrate the network and launch the attacks.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The association was also accused of lacking a proper detection system for attacks. The watchdog said the attacker made over 20,000 attempts to log in to one of the servers for four hours, without being interrupted.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The PCPD said the same hacker had successfully installed malicious software on the sports organisation's system two years ago, although no data was stolen at the time.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Privacy Commissioner Ada Chung criticised the SCAA for failing to spot that attack until the data leak this year, saying it didn’t carry out regular checks or risk assessments
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “The association, as a long-established sports association holding a significant amount of personal data, should be vigilant about cybersecurity and data security. I am very disappointed that the association failed to implement effective information system security measures to safeguard members' personal data prior to the incident.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “I believe that if the association had deployed sufficient detection measures or alert tools back in 2022, there would have been a good chance of detecting the malicious activities at the early stage of the [March] hacking attack,” Chung said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The PCPD ruled that the SCAA violated the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance, and an enforcement notice was issued to the association to fix the issue.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In response, the SCAA said it acknowledged the investigation findings and will adhere to the PCPD’s enforcement notice.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It said it imposed a series of remedial measures after the incident in question, and pledged to prevent similar incidents from happening again.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Separately, the PCPD said it has observed a concerning rise in data breaches involving non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and schools.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The watchdog received 61 data breach notifications from schools and NGOs last year, an increase of about 1.5 times compared to 2022.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Chung said NGOs and schools often hold a lot of sensitive personal data, making them attractive targets for hackers.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   She urged them to stay vigilant against cyber attacks and bolster their data security resources.

    Kevin Yeung praised for 'swift' monkey deaths response

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday praised the Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism for his quick response over a spate of monkey deaths at Hong Kong's zoo, after two more of the apes died over the weekend.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The latest squirrel monkey deaths at the Hong Kong Zoological and Botanical Gardens takes the total number of fatalities to 11.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Speaking to reporters, Lee said Kevin Yeung did exactly what was expected of him.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "[In] the first instance, the problem was contained to stop it from spreading. Monitoring measures were put in place. Autopsy examinations and tests have been expedited. The result was instantly disseminated to the general public," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Authorities are still determining if the two monkeys that recently died were infected with melioidosis like the other nine.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Chief Executive's praise came after Yeung was seemingly put on notice last week, when Lee unveiled in the annex of his third Policy Address that he had 'instructed' the minister to complete the blueprint for the Arts and Culture and Creative Industries Development, which is behind schedule.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Yeung had told reporters he did not feel that he was being pressured, adding he will finish the blueprint soon.

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday said key performance indicators (KPI) that he introduced after assuming office have helped Hong Kong climb in some international rankings.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Speaking to reporters before an Executive Council meeting, Lee noted that Hong Kong went up in a number of global assessments, including in one report published last month by think tanks based in Britain and Shenzhen, in which the SAR surpassed Singapore.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I'm glad to see that in almost two-and-a-half years' governance, and also the new measures that we've introduced, the position of Hong Kong as an international financial centre has increased one position, so we've come back to top three."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   When asked by reporters about officials not completing six of the 150 tasks Lee set out in last year's Policy Address, he explained that there were reasonable causes for the delays and that he is satisfied with the overall KPI results.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Indicators are means. Indicators are not themselves an end. We must see how these indicators will work for us," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Chief Executive also stressed that the people in general agree with the need for reform, which was the main theme of his policy blueprint last week.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday said a six-month "adaption period" following the start of a ban on various single-use plastics went smoothly.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The end of a grace period means violators can now face fines of up to HK$100,000.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Talking to reporters ahead of an Executive Council meeting, Lee said the aim is to bring about behavioural change rather than punish people.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I am glad to see that there are good results in the catering sector, in the building management sector, in the hotel sector, which indicated that there has been a lot of disposable cutlery saved as a result of this plastic-free culture we want to build," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lee said the government needs to consider a range of factors before moving on to the next phase of the plastics ban which will cover takeaway items, among other things.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We will, first of all, prepare society and the businesses, particularly when we decide as to how we will go to the next stage, i.e. whether there will be sufficient alternative products available in the market for society to move smoothly into the next stage, and, more importantly, affordable prices, because what we learned from the first phase is, despite the fact that we all subscribe to this plastic-free culture, it is an important change of behaviour," the CE said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We also want businesses to be able to go through the process in a smooth manner, and people will be paying an affordable price for all this change of behaviour."

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The Alice Ho Miu Ling Nethersole Hospital said on Tuesday that it's expanding its services providing "upgraded" benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) surgeries, so more patients can be treated.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A new service model, used to treat BPH, has been in use since late 2022, and has treated about 250 patients since then.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Ng Chi-fai, a cluster service coordinator at the New Territories East Cluster, said a minimally invasive procedure had been adopted, allowing patients to be treated outside the operating room.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We are using water steam to heat up the prostate tissue, to make the prostate tissue die, and it will shrink the size of the prostate, or using some small pins to compress on the prostate tissue so that the prostate lumen, the channel, can be widened. Therefore, the patient can void better," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Traditionally, we are doing this procedure in the operating theatre. In our new surface model, we are using local anaesthesia, and we also perform the procedure in our day treatment centre."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Ng added that patients normally have to stay at the hospital for two days if they undergo the traditional surgery, but this is unnecessary with the upgraded service model.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Patients have the procedure done within 15 to 30 minutes, and then after we observe them for maybe one or two hours, they will be discharged," he said, adding that whole process is completed within half a day.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Ng said the new service model enabled them to double the number of patients being treated, and the waiting time for patients had fallen to four months, from 12 months originally.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He said about 65 percent of patients using urinary catheters could receive the surgery within two months.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Hong Kong Tennis Open organisers on Monday said that four-time Grand Slam champion Naomi Osaka is pulling out of this month's tournament due to injury, though the Japanese star will still meet fans in the SAR.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The former world number one injured her back during the China Open earlier this month, and has since skipped multiple tournaments, including the Japan Open.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “I love visiting the [SAR] tournament and despite the obvious disappointment of not being able to play, I want to reassure all my wonderful Hong Kong fans that I will still be attending the event," Osaka said in a statement through the Hong Kong China Tennis Association.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I am very much looking forward to meeting you all."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The association expressed disappointment, but stressed that the event will still be highly competitive.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Participating players include defending champion Leylah Fernandez, two-time Grand Slam champion and former world number one Simona Halep, as well as former US Open Champion Emma Raducanu.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Qualifiers for the local tournament, a WTA250 series, are due to take place at Victoria Park on Saturday. (Additional reporting from Reuters)

    'More effort needed to revive exhibition industry'

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The head of a major trade exhibition company in Hong Kong on Monday said he wants to see more measures to revive the struggling convention and exhibition industry.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Last week’s Policy Address outlined plans to spend HK$500 million on launching the Incentive Scheme for Recurrent Exhibitions 2.0, to help the sector stay afloat and promote the mega-event economy.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But Duncan Cheung, director of ComAsia Limited, said geopolitical tensions and manpower shortages are hindering recovery.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “In Hong Kong, the exhibition business also suffers from the lack of manpower. For the recovery of the industry, I think it needs more time because you saw so many geopolitical problems,” he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Cheung said the government should allocate more money to the international exhibition industry and extend the scheme beyond 2026.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "International exhibitions can bring international exhibitors and also international buyers and visitors to come to Hong Kong. These kinds of visitors or exhibitors have to live in hotels and [benefit] the hotel industry, food and beverage industry and also travel industry."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Cheung said the exhibition industry has downsized due to the pandemic and has now only resumed to around 70 percent of pre-Covid levels.

    Arabic learning drive a ticket to success: scholar

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   A misunderstanding over the government’s apparent ambitions to require taxi drivers learn Arabic has been a hot topic of discussion in recent days, and has even been a target of derision by some in the trade.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But the head of the University of Hong Kong’s Arabic programme, Amjad Refai, says this is actually a great idea for Hongkongers – and learning Arabic isn’t as difficult as some may think.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Chief Executive John Lee had said in his latest Policy Address that relevant sectors should provide service information in Arabic to lure in more Middle Eastern tourists, but officials have since clarified that this doesn’t mean cabbies will be expected to learn to converse in Arabic.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development Algernon Yau said on Monday that they just want more information to be made available in Arabic to help travellers find taxis or Muslim-friendly facilities more easily.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Transport chief Lam Sai-hung also said it would be a good thing if drivers could learn a few simple Arabic phrases such as greetings.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Refai agrees that learning to say hello: أهلاً (ahlaan) or thank you: شكراً (shkraan) isn’t the toughest thing in the world.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “I don't believe there is an easy language or there is a difficult language. There is no such thing,” he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The academic, who has written a textbook for people learning Arabic as a second language, says while learning a language that’s very different from the mother tongue of students makes things challenging, it’s far from insurmountable.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “We need to make an easy approach for the students,” Refai said. “I don't think Arabic is a difficult language – it's different… new… so students may face challenges and they need to [make] efforts to be familiar with it.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Refai said more and more universities and even private schools here have been offering Arabic courses in recent years, and there was a spike in the number of students learning the language between 2016 and 2019.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   However, he says since Covid hit, there has been a “shocking” decline in student numbers in Hong Kong in contrast to the mainland, where people seem to be more aware of the advantages of learning a language spoken in countries that are becoming increasingly important trading partners both to the territory and the nation.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “I was expecting that everyone will try to compete to learn Arabic and the numbers are increasing but I don't see this on ground,” Refai lamented.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “In [the] mainland for decades we know the importance of Arabic language and nearly all universities –  even the regional universities – teach Arabic as majors, and a lot of students are studying Arabic on the mainland because they can see the potential of the Arab world.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He says the advent of artificial intelligence may have affected peoples’ appetite for learning new languages, as AI makes translation and communications much easier. But he’s still shocked that people here aren’t seizing the career opportunities that would be afforded by learning Arabic.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “It's still a decent amount of people are learning Arabic, but less than the years I'm talking about – 2016 and 2019 – which has not only surprised me, it shocked me actually, because the Hong Kong and China governments, as part of the initiative of the New Belt and Road, are extending hands towards the Arab world.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He says the best way to learn a new language is via in-person classes, where teachers can best use the human element to communicate face-to-face with their students.

    'Slashed liquor duty boosts Wine and Spirits Fair'

  <div class="itemFullText">
   The Hong Kong Trade Development Council on Monday said the government's decision to reduce the city's spirits duty came just in time for the Wine and Spirits Fair, with more vendors expected to showcase a wider selection of liquor.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Six hundred exhibitors from 20 countries and regions will take part in the fair, and it comes on the heels of the government's decision to cut the duty on liquor with an alcohol content of over 30 percent and with an import price of more than HK$200 to 10 percent from 100 percent for the portion above HK$200.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Speaking at a media preview for the event, the council's Deputy Executive Director, Sophia Chong, said more than 20 percent of vendors would be bringing hard liquor to the fair, which takes place from November 7 to 9.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Like this time, we have whiskey from Ireland as well. All these liquor, brandy, tequila, and all these spirits and liquor can also be traded via Hong Kong to the rest of Asia, including mainland China," she said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Vendor Andrew Wong said more people will have the chance to taste high-end spirits.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "People may be drinking medium or low-level [spirits], and they now can have more room to drink good quality [spirits] with a reasonable price," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But fellow vendor Simon Disler said the duty reduction was not big enough to give him the wiggle room to offer more discounts.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "For five or ten percent of my items, I would be able to offer discounts to my customers. But for the other 90 percent, there won't be a discount," he explained.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The fair will be held at the Convention and Exhibition Centre where wines and spirits, including baijiu, sake and vodka will be showcased.

    Civil servants to get three days of childcare leave

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The government says it plans to offer three days of childcare leave a year to civil servants with children under three, a move expected to benefit some 12,000 employees.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The administration on Monday said the family-friendly policy is expected to start in April.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   At a Legco public service panel meeting, several unionist lawmakers asked why officials have decided on three days and then only for parents of children under three.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   They asked whether more days off could be offered and whether the leave could be extended to parents of older children.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Federation of Trade Unions lawmaker Kwok Wai-keung said Singapore offers six days of childcare leave.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Civil service chief Ingrid Yeung said officials are already striking a balance between several factors, adding that the scheme will be reviewed after implementation.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We roll out government-friendly measures for government workers, but then there's also a need for manpower, and operational needs for departments. We have to be prudent with this new measure," she said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "At that preschool age below three, children usually stay at home. They need more care at home. That's why we set the threshold at three years old."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Finance sector lawmaker Ronick Chan and former minister Lai Tung-kwok of the New People's Party asked whether civil servants could be given a day off for their birthday, with Lai saying this would provide a morale boost to those who don't have children.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Yeung said officials will consider the suggestion, but providing leave does come with a financial burden for the government.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   A company that supplies wooden and bamboo forks, knives and spoons to restaurants on Monday said price has become a far less significant factor for eateries when making purchases of cutlery.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “Maybe I can use the knife as an example. At the beginning people are just concerned about the price. They choose a wooden knife and fork but because of the functionality of the wood it cannot cut like a harder steak. So people now choose the bamboo fork and knife which can be used to cut the steak easily,” Alvis Yip, founder of Supply Ching Company said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He said his products were initially about 20 percent to 30 percent more expensive than the plastic ones, but his prices have now dropped by about 10 percent, benefiting from economies of scale.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Yip was one of four suppliers invited by the Environmental Protection Department to showcase their products to the press six months ago.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   During the event, another supplier demonstrated how its knife and fork can be used to cut steak, but the fork snapped during two attempts.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Asked whether the issue affected his sales in any way, Yip said it actually gave customers more confidence in his products.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “At the beginning we were concerned about that incident, that will it affect the reputation of sustainable food packaging. But after that event it kind of benefits us because while the citizens are often laughing at the presentation, the restaurants are actually more concerned about the functionality. That event created chances or situations for us to explain more of our products' details to our customers,” he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Yip said he also noticed a significant drop in reliance on one-off cutlery as people adapt to more sustainable options, but stressed he is not worried about his sales.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “It’s like that restaurants are preparing for, for example, 10,000 sets of cutlery because they are using the assumption from plastic cutlery, but then they end up just using 5,000 for a month. So monthly usage can drop by 50 percent,” he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “But I can draw more customers using our quality and new designs and new materials by increasing our functionalities… We will just have some good quality supplies left in the market in the end.”

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism Kevin Yeung on Monday said the authorities will consider reopening the mammals section of the Zoological and Botanical Gardens when a health scare involving monkeys there comes to an end.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A De Brazza’s monkey, three common squirrel monkeys, four white-faced sakis and three cotton-top tamarins have died in the past week or so, with tests on some of them revealing they had melioidosis, an infectious disease caused by a type of bacteria in soil.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Officials said workers had dug up the ground near the monkey enclosure earlier this month and may have brought in contaminated soil on their shoes.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   On a radio programme, Yeung said one monkey is still undergoing quarantine.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "When the situation is back to normal, we'll consider reopening the area. We've observed their behaviour and sometimes it was a little unusual compared to normal," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The condition of the monkey in quarantine fluctuates. Sometimes it is bad and sometimes it is good. It's receiving medical treatment."

    Single-use plastics ban running smoothly: EPD

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The Environmental Protection Department says the first phase of the city's single-use plastics ban has been implemented smoothly and orderly, with a six-month adaptation period concluding on Monday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In an interview with RTHK, deputy director of the department Kenneth Cheng said 80 percent of customers of chain restaurants have stopped using takeaway cutlery, while 30 percent of eateries have chosen not to offer any takeaway utensils.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The department estimates that 30 million fewer sets of disposable cutlery than usual have been given out by the catering sector since the ban took effect in April, Cheng said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He praised the hotel sector for being “ahead of the international trend” by reducing its use of plastics by 80 percent over the past six months.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Cheng said shopping malls and office buildings have stopped giving out disposable umbrella bags and few people have been using glow sticks or party hats during festive events, showing that a culture of reducing plastic is gradually developing.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The end of the grace period means that people who fail to comply with the rules now face fines of up to HK$100,000, but Cheng said the department will prioritise education over punishment.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “We can see that the culture of reducing plastic is progressing. We don't believe that heavily penalising businesses is the right way to implement this culture. Instead, we think it should be achieved through promotion and education. But of course we will enforce the law after the adaptation period, but the focus will be on primary suppliers,” he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “We inspected the selling points in the past and identified those that have not yet met the requirements. We will inspect them again and will issue a written warning to them if they haven’t improved. We will give them 10 more days to make the necessary changes.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Asked when the second phase of the ban, which will cover items including takeaway plastic lunch boxes and cups, will be introduced, Cheng said there is currently no specific timetable.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He said the move will depend on factors such as social acceptance, available replacements and international trends.

    We want to make better use of cruise terminal: Govt

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Culture, sports and tourism minister Kevin Yeung on Monday said officials will study how to make better use of the Kai Tak Cruise Terminal.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In last week's Policy Address, Chief Executive John Lee said the SAR will publish an action plan on developing cruise tourism to enhance the terminal's role as a hub for conventions and exhibitions.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We now hope to see if we can better utilise the space of the cruise terminal. For example, can we make use of the rooftop area? It's currently a park. Is there anything else we can do there? How can we promote more convention and exhibition activities?" Yeung told a radio programme.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Asked about Singapore receiving more cruise ships than Hong Kong in July and August, the minister said it's not a fair comparison.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Traditionally, Hong Kong's typhoon season runs from May to August. This doesn't exist in some places, for example Singapore. So, comparing cruise ship numbers in July and August is not the best," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It's not about how many typhoons we have in July and August, but because cruise lines won't take risks in their scheduling during the typhoon season."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Yeung also said more will be done to develop "horse racing tourism" as outlined in the policy blueprint, such as working with the Jockey Club to promote international horse-racing events.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But he said authorities need to carefully consider whether the current 18-year-old age limit for racegoers would be lowered.

    'HK ready to extend ban on single-use plastics'

  <img alt="Edwin Lau of The Green Earth says Hong Kong should push ahead with its ban on single-use plastics. File Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1775377_1_20241020185910.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The head of a green group believes Hong Kong is prepared to extend its ban on single-use plastics, as the six-month adaptation period under the first phase of the ban ends on Monday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The end of the grace period means that people who fail to comply with the rules face fines of up to HK$100,000.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   According to the rules, restaurants are prohibited from using or selling polystyrene utensils, plastic straws, cutlery and plates.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Hotels are also banned from freely distributing bathroom items made of plastic, including plastic-handled toothbrushes, plastic-packed toothpaste and shower caps.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Other prohibited products include cotton buds, umbrella bags and glow sticks.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Edwin Lau, founder and executive director of The Green Earth, said eateries and hotels are generally adapting well to the new regulations.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “Through my observation, I gathered that most of the restaurants... I think most of them have done a good job to follow the single-use plastics ban, and they quickly can find the alternative.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “I am aware that for the hotel industry they are still trying to find an alternative for shower caps. But apart from this item, the rest of the items, I heard them saying that hotels are quite alright in getting all those other alternatives or advising customers to use their own private sets,” he told RTHK.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The second phase, set to begin in 2025, will extend the ban to include plastic cups, food containers for takeouts, as well as plastic dental floss and tablecloths.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lau sees no difficulties for businesses to adjust to the regulations, adding that phase 2 should be rolled out as soon as possible.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “I'm sure with the first phase, they have adapted to the changes quite well. And I believe they are well-prepared for the introduction of the second phase of the single-use plastics ban. You can see there are many non-plastic alternatives for takeaway lunch box, congee bowl, and this is no big problem for them,” he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lau also noted that currently, many alternatives for plastic products are still of the single-use type, and officials should enhance promotion and encourage people to bring their own lunch boxes and cutlery.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Environmental Protection Department estimated that the catering sector has cut down on the use of 30 million sets of disposable cutlery since April.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In a statement, the department also noted that 80 percent of customers at chain restaurants have stopped using takeaway cutlery, while 30 percent of eateries have decided to stop providing disposable cutlery for takeaways.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   The government on Sunday said the second isolated common squirrel monkey from the Hong Kong Zoological and Botanical Gardens had died, taking the monkey death toll to 11.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The death of the common squirrel monkey followed earlier news of a tenth death, also of a common squirrel monkey. Both had been in isolation following a spate of monkey deaths at the gardens that began about a week ago.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   On Friday, the government said nine monkeys had died of sepsis after catching melioidosis, potentially because workers dug up soil near their habitat. Autopsies found a large amount of a bacteria that causes the disease in the monkeys' organs.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department will conduct necropsy to see whether the cause of death was the same as the other cases earlier.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   One monkey, a De Brazza Monkey, remains in isolation.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Officials added that the bacteria are unlikely to be transmitted from animals to humans.

    Ethnic minorities get boost in job search

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   While ethnic minority job seekers said language barriers remain their biggest obstacle, some companies have improved their prospects by adding more English to training materials and lowering their Chinese language requirements.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Various government departments and firms were recruiting staff at a job fair held on Sunday by the Equal Opportunities Commission (EOC). One of them was a franchised bus company offering positions such as bus captains, technicians and customer service officers.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Citybus said all Chinese guidelines have been translated into English to accommodate ethnic minority workers. It also said the requirement for bus captains now is basic communication in Cantonese, compared with reading and writing Chinese and speaking fluent Cantonese in the past.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The firm has about 30 ethnic minority staff.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I think they are quite embedded in our whole population, our local bus captains are happy to work with them. All the people in the company, they know that the company is an inclusive employer," said Citybus general manager Roger Wong.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Rojal, who's from Nepal and has been in Hong Kong for almost a decade, submitted an application with a bank.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He said he found it hard to land a job here because of language barriers.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The employers are really looking for someone who actually can speak the language," he said. "I'm not exactly sure why that's the case, perhaps the clients want you to speak in Chinese or the documents could be in Chinese."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Another job seeker, Bharvani, echoed the sentiment.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Even though I studied here, my Chinese reading and writing skills are not that great. So it (throws out) at least half or three-fourths of the job opportunities," said the ethnic Indian who was born and raised in Hong Kong.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The head of the EOC, Linda Lam, said more should be done to create job opportunities for ethnic minorities.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "In fact, there are many young ethnic minorities with qualifications, outstanding attitude, and are [highly-skilled], and they are suitable to work in various levels of an organisation," she said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "In the future, we will be organising other activities to continue our efforts, to promote the breaking down of stereotypes, to help the ethnic minorities to have more opportunities to participate in different levels in the workforce."

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Housing minister Winnie Ho said on Sunday that the government could start prosecuting landlords of illegal subdivided flats by the end of 2026 at the earliest, with the possibility of jail terms.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In his Policy Address last week, Chief Executive John Lee announced plans to regulate subdivided units, renaming the vetted flats "basic housing units" (BHUs) and making those smaller than 86 square feet illegal.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Ho said if all goes smoothly, laws would be passed by the end of next year, and that would be followed by a period for landlords to register and a grace period for them to renovate the flats to meet the new requirements.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "[If] a one-year registration period is enough, that would take us to the end of 2026," she said on a Commercial Radio programme.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "If landlords don't register during the period and continue to operate homes that violate our regulations, then law enforcement could begin at the end of 2026, or at the start of 2027 at the earliest. That's within the term of the current administration."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Deputy Financial Secretary Michael Wong, who heads a government task force on the matter, said the timeline is not set in stone, citing an upcoming public consultation exercise and discussion with lawmakers.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Wong also said he doesn't think there'll be a significant drop in supply, pointing to the availability of more BHUs in the market in future.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He added that among tenants of current subdivided flats, 60 percent of them are eligible to apply for public housing and the rest could look for BHUs or transitional housing units, insisting everyone will have a roof over their heads.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   On a TVB programme, Lee said landlords of subdivided flats are allowed to raise rents by a maximum of 10 percent under existing rent-control laws. The CE also said tenants can move from one BHU to another in future, in the event rents go up.

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Chief Executive John Lee said giving public housing tenants a greater chance to buy Home Ownership Scheme units is a step towards helping them climb the housing ladder and should not be deemed unfair to the broader public.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In his Policy Address on Wednesday, Lee announced a revision of the allocation ratio for the subsidised flats, changing it from 4:6 to 5:5 between green form, or current public housing residents, and white form applicants.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   During a TVB programme aired on Sunday, the CE was asked whether the move was intended to "pressure" the general public into pursuing private property to boost the market, given the quota for green form applicants had not been fully utilised in the past two years.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Don't resort to conspiracy theories,” Lee said in response.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “Frankly, when you're allocating housing, flexibility is crucial.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “The ratio between green and white form applicants could be different every single time. If one side doesn't use up the quota, then it could be re-allocated. There can easily be differences, and it's the role of the government to adjust these.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lee also rejected suggestions the revised allocation favours well-off public housing tenants, who are being urged to move out in accordance with government policy.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Typically we expect a duration of about 10 years for residents to make progress. Then we'll give them the opportunity to return the public housing units to those who need them. I believe this approach is reasonable,” he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Meanwhile, Lee said the relaxation of mortgage rules as announced in this year's Policy Address was based on the assessment that the private housing market is developing in a healthy manner.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Under the new policy, the maximum loan-to-value ratio for all homes has been adjusted to 70 percent, regardless of their value, and the maximum debt servicing ratio has been raised to 50 percent.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The CE said he has not detected speculation following the change, and stressed that the chances of speculative activity under present market conditions are very low.

  <img alt="Paul Chan echos the Chief Executive's idea of further developing Hong Kong's gold market.

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Financial Secretary Paul Chan said on Sunday gold trading in Hong Kong has great room for growth amid global market developments, and building up the SAR's market is of great strategic significance.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In announcing his Policy Address last week, Chief Executive John Lee spoke of the vision to turning Hong Kong into an operating centre for international commodity trading, including storage, delivery and shipping.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Chan, for his part, said commodities trading is an important part of economic activities as it could play a pivotal role in ensuring the stable supply of raw materials.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Creating a commodity trading ecosystem can become a new point of support for the development of Hong Kong as an international financial, aviation and trading hub," he wrote on his weekly blog.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The minister said this could drive the development of aviation and trading for the Greater Bay Area, and offer stability to the supply chain in the region.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The priority is to boost trade volume in the short to medium term, Chan said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The minister said as geopolitical uncertainties rise, demand for gold is expected to stay high for risk-averse investors, and some market players expect trade volume to multiply.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He said once the local infrastructure for gold storage and trading is built up, the SAR can further look into fostering closer links with the mainland gold market.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Chan said developing more risk-management and derivative products can help boost the country's global influence in the gold market in the long run.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   This, he said, has great strategic significance in raising Hong Kong's status as an international financial centre.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Deputy Chief Secretary Warner Cheuk said a new government body aimed at developing tourist hotspots will hold its first meeting next month.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Chief Executive John Lee announced in his Policy Address on Wednesday the setting up of a Working Group on Development Tourist Hotspots, which involves at least seven government departments.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Speaking on a radio programme on Sunday, Cheuk, who leads the group, said it wants to develop projects that are inventive, attractive and feasible, and it's open to suggestions from the public.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Hong Kong has a lot of resources for tourism, such as Victoria Harbour, food, films, etc. We will develop new projects involving the use of these resources," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "For example food, you can see from YouTube a lot of tourists look for food in Hong Kong. This might be familiar to us but for tourists, it is very attractive. We can think about developing night markets, or building a food city.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Hong Kong also has its film culture and natural environment. We can also consider developing new photo-taking spots."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lee said on Saturday the working group will uncover must-see destinations across Hong Kong as it hopes to unearth hidden gems beyond Victoria Harbour.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Cheuk also said consumption habits of tourists have changed since the Covid-19 pandemic, and businesses have to think of new ways to attract tourists to spend.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We cannot only complain about why tourists don't come here to spend. It's not that people don't spend money, there have to be places where they think it's worth spending money," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The official said tourists are more demanding nowadays and it is crucial to find products that are unique to Hong Kong to attract more visitors.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Separately, Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism Kevin Yeung said he's confident his bureau will announce the Blueprint for Arts and Culture and Creative Industries Development soon.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The CE said in the Policy Address that the Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau needs more time to come up with the blueprint.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We received a lot of opinions, and we made big changes due to changes in the economy. In this case, we hope to have thorough discussions with the Culture Commission, and there may be changes after that. We will also have to include good suggestions in the blueprint. We still hope to announce the blueprint as soon as possible," Yeung said.

    Adequate measures taken over monkey deaths: Govt

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Culture, sports and tourism minister Kevin Yeung said the government has taken sufficient preventive measures at the Zoological and Botanical Gardens on news of the death of a tenth monkey there.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The latest death involves a common squirrel monkey, which had been put under isolated surveillance since nine other animals died about a week ago.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Officials said a necropsy will be conducted to find out the cause of death.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Two other animals, a common squirrel monkey and a De Brazza's Monkey, are in isolation.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Speaking to reporters after attending a radio programme on Sunday, Yeung said there are no abnormalities among some 70 monkeys at the zoo in Central.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Because of the latest death, the relevant departments have held another meeting and we visited the gardens. Overall, we think [the preventive measures] in place are sufficient, and we'll continue with this plan," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "There are still two other monkeys in isolation, and we'll take care of them. We know their condition may go up and down, sometimes they're better and sometimes worse. If there's anything new we'll definitely update the public."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   On Friday, the government said the nine monkeys died of sepsis after catching melioidosis, potentially because workers dug up soil near their habitat.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Autopsies found a large amount of the melioidosis-inducing bacteria in the monkeys' organs.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Officials added that the bacteria are unlikely to be transmitted from animals to humans.

    Low-altitude trials to include Cyberport, Science Park

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The first phase of pilot projects on developing the low-altitude economy will focus on using drones for food delivery and transporting cargo with Cyberport and Science Park being in the pipeline, the government said on Saturday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In this week's Policy Address, the chief executive said the government will set up a working group that will explore how the city can benefit from the use of drones and other aerial technology to provide services such as transporting goods and people.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Deputy Financial Secretary Michael Wong, who led the working group, told a press conference that officials will work with industry partners on pilot projects, starting applications at the end of this year and launching "regulatory sandboxes" early next year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We expect that the first phase will mainly focus on aerial monitoring and some drone cargo delivery, such as delivering food and transporting lightweight goods like mail and medications," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We also hope that the pilot locations and routes can cover areas in Hong Kong with different terrains, landscapes, and densities. Some areas that could be considered include Science Park, Cyberport, outlying islands, and the Northern Metropolis."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   This plan requires amending existing laws and creating new ones, especially a regulatory framework for drones over 25 kg.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Wong said the government aims to submit a draft bill to the Legislative Council in early 2025.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He said while the mainland's low-altitude economy is growing rapidly, it's too early to estimate Hong Kong's potential revenue from this sector.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "As our work is in its initial stages, it would be somewhat unrealistic to mention many specific figures at this point or to predict future economic contributions. This is because the mainland is a bit ahead of us in this area, and their data comes from big data."

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The Secretary for Environment and Ecology Tse Chin-wan said the government's plan to reduce waste in Hong Kong remains unchanged despite the shelving of the waste charging scheme, adding that raising public awareness and increasing recycling facilities instead has achieved great results.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The government announced earlier this year that they would not implement the citywide waste charging scheme in August as originally planned, but the environment chief said at a press conference on Saturday that good recycling and waste management practice has increased immensely.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He said that the total amount of recycling has increased by more than half in the past six months.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We saw when we were advertising the waste scheme that even though public opinion was to postpone it, people were very supportive of waste reduction and recycling practices. So we are now seizing the opportunity by enhancing recycling facilities and strengthening public education to promote a good waste reduction and recycling culture in society," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We will also study how to optimise the waste charging scheme so that people can be more adaptable and accepting of waste reduction and recycling measures when implemented in the future."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Tse said that they will optimise a plan and share their progress with the Legislative Council in the middle of next year.

    97% of HK's riverbank waste is plastic: Greenpeace

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Greenpeace on Saturday said more than 3,200 pieces of rubbish have been collected in its clean-up operations along two of Hong Kong's riverbanks in the past four months, with 97 percent of it being plastic.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The top items found in the Lam Tsuen and Pui O Rivers were food and beverage packaging, disposable plastic tableware, and shipping materials, the environmental group told RTHK.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Greenpeace campaigner Leanne Tam said microplastics from these sources can enter ecosystems and food chains, potentially affecting human health.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It easily get into the ecosystem because they are small, maybe eaten by animals. Or even when we drink it or we eat through the food chain, they will enter our blood system or even our brain," she said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Tam said the government should implement a HK$1 deposit system for beverage bottles, rather than the proposed 10-cent incentive, to better tackle plastic waste.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The government should add the reduction target on single-use packaging and also the reuse target for the overall package and overall beverage packaging system," she added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The advocate added that individuals and companies can also play a part by choosing packaging-free items and changing their business models to phase out single-use plastics.

    Bus parade, exhibition mark PRC's 75th anniversary

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Buses ranging from museum pieces to state-of-the-art machines on Saturday rolled through the city to mark the 75th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The parade, organised by the Transport Department and three franchised bus operators, featured retired and in-service buses.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The procession started in Victoria Park, passing along the northern shore of Hong Kong Island and finishing up at the Central Ferry Piers.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   There is also a four-day bus exhibition underway at Victoria Park.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Speaking at the departure ceremony, transport minister Lam Sai-hung said buses have long been an indispensable part of people's livelihoods.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The rapid development of new energy technologies of our country in recent years has enriched Hong Kong's choices of new energy public transport," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Numerous electric double-decker buses and hydrogen fuel cell buses introduced into Hong Kong in the past few years were China-made models."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Many bus lovers gathered to take photos of the parading buses, including Mr Lee, who purposely came from Guangzhou, to see some of the SAR's antique buses.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I have never seen these discontinued buses in a public event parading before, so I think this opportunity is very rare. I purposely came from the mainland to see them," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Another spectator, Mr Chan, was ecstatic to see history passing through the streets of Hong Kong.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I didn't think they would host a bus tour. I saw some new buses. It turns out that one of them is a new Citybus that is probably not in service yet. I couldn't believe that new buses would be featured in the parade. It’s really exciting. I hope the government will organise more parades in the future."

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Chief Secretary Eric Chan said the government plans to bring in 10,000 skilled technicians to ease the manpower shortage, adding that they hope to attract younger workers to bring down the average working age in the industry.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Speaking on a radio programme on Saturday, he said that Hong Kong is projected to face a shortage of approximately 180,000 workers across different sectors in the future, with about 60,000 vacancies earmarked for skilled technicians.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He stressed that the remaining 50,000 spots would be reserved for locals who are interested.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "There are certain conditions for the people coming in. They must first have a licence, and secondly, they can only engage in their own industry when they come to Hong Kong. They cannot work in another field. This is the way to go," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We hope to choose younger people because we hope that they can work for a long time, and we want to make the workforce younger. That is very important for our future."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He added that labour importation schemes are short-term solutions, and that they would continue to train local workers to alleviate the problem in the coming years.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Stated in the new Policy Address, the government will build a campus for the Hong Kong Institute of Information Technology, under the Vocational Training Council, and develop its Lift and Escalator Technology Centre.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Chan said that both universities and the Vocational Training Council would also focus on the demand for high-tech talents, with institutions increasing incentives for research.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "High technology plays a huge role in the development of our future, so whether it is in our universities, or through the Vocational Training Council, there will be courses catered to this type of demand. Even in our universities, we will add more scholarships for students to do some research and study for master's and doctoral degrees," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It is mainly for the industries that we need. We will encourage them to do their best and provide them with more incentives to train and study in the future, and it's all towards high-tech development."

    New tourism working group to uncover hidden gems: CE

  <div class="itemFullText">
   A new working group on developing tourist hotspots will uncover must-see destinations across Hong Kong and will ease the workload of the Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau, Chief Executive John Lee said on Saturday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In his third Policy Address, Lee said the working group, led by Deputy Chief Secretary Warner Cheuk, will strengthen cross departmental co-ordination and leverage community efforts in identifying and developing tourist hotspots.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Speaking on an RTHK radio programme, the CE said officials hope to unearth hidden gems beyond Victoria Harbour.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "For example, the Champs-Élysées in France... it has many unique features, and everyone goes there. Hong Kong of course has its own attractions. We already have Victoria Harbour, which we'll continue to develop," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "But we also have many other treasures. How can we showcase our Geopark? We've discussed this before. There are many various aspects. We hope to pay more attention to public opinion."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The policy blueprint also outlined plans to develop the SAR into an international tertiary education hub by creating the "Study in Hong Kong" brand and encouraging more local students to pursue advanced studies.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Asked how to attract exchange students with the city's high cost of living, Lee said Hong Kong has much to offer with its freedom, convenience, and cultural diversity.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Sometimes I like a girl because she's beautiful, sometimes because she's virtuous, and sometimes because of her knowledge. Hong Kong also appeals in many ways. Of course, we're not as big [geographically] as other big cities. That's the reality. But we still have many other appealing features," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   On another radio programme, the CE was asked if he was dissatisfied that cultural and tourism officials failed to announce its Blueprint for Arts and Culture and Creative Industries Development as scheduled.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In response, Lee said, "When you look at the 2023 Policy Address, around four to five items are behind schedule. When I set indicators, I look at whether there are reasons for the delay and if those reasons are justified. The purpose is to make sure that we accomplish what we have promised to do."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It comes as, in the Policy Address annex, Lee pointed out the bureau "requires more time to revise the draft blueprint to cater for the long‑term development of the sector".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In response to queries about the matter on Friday, cultural and tourism minister Kevin Yeung said the blueprint is "nearly complete" and he didn't feel that the CE had publicly urged him in any way.

    Melioidosis to blame for monkey deaths: officials

  <img alt="Officials say there is no need to shut down the whole zoo, as the melioidosis-causing bacteria do not easily transmit from animals to humans. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=10&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1775197_2_20241018200137.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Nine monkeys from the Hong Kong Zoological and Botanical Gardens died of sepsis after catching melioidosis, authorities revealed on Friday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Part of the zoo has been shut down since Monday after eight monkeys, including three critically-endangered cotton-top tamarins, were found dead the previous day.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   One more death was registered later, while another monkey was taken away for observation.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Subsequent autopsies found a large amount of the melioidosis-inducing bacteria in the monkeys' organs.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Culture and tourism minister Kevin Yeung offered a possible explanation of where the bacteria came from.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He said works performed at the zoo earlier this month required the digging up of soil near the monkeys' habitat. Workers were then believed to have brought contaminated soil into the cage through their shoes.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   According to the Centre for Health Protection, the bacterium is particularly common in moist clay soil. It can affect both humans and animals.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But Yeung stressed that it is not necessary to seal off the whole facility from the public.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We have taken all the cleansing and disinfection measures on the cages. With all these measures, we believe that it's now clean and free of the bacteria," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We have also cordoned off the whole mammals section for the time being, so there will be no sort of contact between normal citizens with the animals."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Protective gear has been provided to staff after the incident, and those who may have had contact with the monkeys tested negative for the bacterium.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Thomas Sit, assistant director of Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation, said operators had performed check-ups for the animals as soon as possible.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Before the animals lost appetite, they were a bit incompetent, quiet, abnormal, and the time of onset of all the clinical signs only took two days, and then there was a sudden death of the animals," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The vets already took measures to treat the monkeys. However, the affected monkeys could not make it and [we] had to perform post-mortem and isolate [them] to prevent the spread of the disease."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sit said the facility has been instructed to step up cleansing work, and staff should maintain good hygiene to avoid a repeat of the incident.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   An infectious disease expert said the bacteria usually lie deep down in the soil, meaning contact with humans and animals was unlikely.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "But if there had been work done to this soil with digging, and also if these bacteria in the deep soil had been elevated to the surface, then the animals there could have been exposed to a large number of bacteria, so that would probably have contributed to this outbreak in these monkeys," Wilson Lam told RTHK.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It would be prudent to shut down the area temporarily, the doctor said, as the bacteria may still be present in the environment.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But he played down fears of humans contracting the disease from monkeys.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Transmission from animals to human is really, really rare, so we are more worried about the presence of bacteria in the soil, and also the environment in the park at this moment."

    Kai Tak Sports Park to host test events this month
   </title>

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Cultural and tourism minister Kevin Yeung on Friday said there will be various test events at the Kai Tak Sports Park starting as early as the end of this month, to check transport facilities and crowd dispersal measures.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   With mega events such as Coldplay concerts lined up for the sports park when it opens in the first quarter of next year, there have been calls for officials to improve transport solutions.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Yeung told a press conference that such efforts are underway.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We may start with some small-scale games. For example, we have a smaller sports ground at Kai Tak with 5,000 seats. Some competitions will start to be held there," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Of course during these so-called test events, we will try out the venue and its supporting facilities, and also things like crowd dispersal to see how we can do it best."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Asked about a review of the redevelopment plan for Hong Kong Stadium – a move mentioned in this week's Policy Address – Yeung said officials need to examine how it can keep up with the city's development needs, and whether there are sufficient venues for mega events even after the Kai Tak site opens.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In the Policy Address annex, Chief Executive John Lee pointed out that the Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau failed to announce its Blueprint for Arts and Culture and Creative Industries Development as scheduled.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In response to questions about the matter, Yeung said the blueprint is nearly complete and he will follow the CE's instructions to finish it as soon as possible.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I don't think the chief executive has publicly urged me to do anything... I think everyone needs to be pragmatic. When the CE mentioned me yesterday, it was in response to questions about tourism work. He used tourism as an example. I was there yesterday too. He talked about the division of work between the relevant working groups and the bureau. I don't feel there was any urging there," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The blueprint, expected to be promulgated later this year, will outline the vision and initiatives for developing high-quality arts, cultural and creative industries.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Hong Kong's unemployment rate remained steady at three percent in the three-month period ending in September, which is the same as the June-to-August period.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Official figures from the Census and Statistics Department on Friday showed the underemployment rate also remained unchanged at 1.2 percent.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In a statement, the Secretary for Labour and Welfare, Chris Sun, said the unemployment rates of various sectors showed diverse movements during the period, although the changes were not significant.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The overall labour market should remain tight in the near term alongside the sustained economic growth, though the employment situation may vary across sectors depending on their business performances,” he said.
