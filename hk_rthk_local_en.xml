  <div class="itemFullText">
   Officials said about 20 more test events will be held before the Kai Tak Sports Park officially opens next year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A local football league match which concluded at the Kai Tak Youth Sports Ground on Sunday was the first of a series of test events.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Over 1,500 spectators turned up in the end, 50 percent more than the original estimate.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The game, featuring Second Division sides Sai Kung and Wong Tai Sin, ended in a 2-2 draw.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Chief Secretary Eric Chan said the overall arrangements were smooth, with most people making use of the MTR to arrive and leave the venue.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The first batch of spectators were able to exit the stadium within six to seven minutes, reaching Sung Wong Toi station another few minutes later, he added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The ultimate goal, officials said, is to host a test event with a full crowd of 50,000 people at the main stadium. The first such event at the core hub is scheduled for January next year, with about 10,000 spectators.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We start from a small scale, but gradually, we will arrange around 20 trial events, and then by that time, we will increase the number of people to up to 50,000," Chan explained.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We are confident that with all these arrangements, all these preparations... we [would have] sufficiently tried everything before it officially opens."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sports and culture minister Kevin Yeung said more transportation methods would be provided in the future.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We hope people can mainly make use of the MTR, the mass transit system, when they leave the venue. But for test events which include more people, we will also arrange bus services, or special bus routes," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Yeung added that questionnaires were distributed to attendees on Sunday, and their comments will be analysed to identity areas of improvement.

    Police to monitor Lan Kwai Fong on Halloween with CCTV

  <img alt="Police said 50 sets of CCTVs have been installed across Lan Kwai Fong ahead of Halloween this Thursday. File Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1776448_1_20241027183843.jpg&q=80" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Police said on Sunday that a system which can analyse real-time foot traffic will be put to use for the first time at Lan Kwai Fong on Halloween, when revellers are expected to swarm the area to celebrate the festival.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Around 25,000 people are estimated to turn up in the nightlife district on Thursday, similar to last year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Traffic arrangements will be implemented in phases from 2pm. Most roads in the vicinity will be closed to vehicles at night, and party-goers can only enter the area through D'Aguilar Street and exit from Wyndham Street.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Acting Superintendent Fung Chung-pang said CCTV signals will be streamed directly to police's command centre.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The CCTVs will provide real-time footage from various angles, allowing officers to understand the situation live.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The force will also make use of a people-counting system to work out the crowd density at the scene through visual analysis. This will allow us to identify underlying safety risks, and to implement crowd management measures should they be needed," Fung said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Officers said a total of 50 sets of CCTVs have been installed in the area, as well as a public broadcast system to alert citizens in case of emergencies.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Taxi ambassadors will also roam the area to assist revellers to hail a cab home.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Police also warned anyone planning to dress up for the night not to carry any imitation firearm or offensive weapons to avoid falling foul of the law.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   They added that artificial intelligence technology may be used in the future to identify accidents or events at which police assistance is needed.

    Smooth sailing as football match goes ahead in Kai Tak

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   A local football league match on Sunday kicked off a series of test events at the Kai Tak Sports Park before it officially opens in the first quarter of next year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Authorities expected 1,000 spectators streamed into the Kai Tak Youth Sports Ground for a Second Division League fixture between Sai Kung and Wong Tai Sin. Around 1,500 turned up in the end.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   One of them was Stephen, an engineer who has worked on the Kai Tak project since five years ago.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Pretty much a bit of professional pride, and proud of what we've built for Hong Kong," he told RTHK.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "[It's] almost there. We're quite excited because it's been five years, and like any other construction projects, it's had its ups and downs. And now we can see it’s almost open."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Another spectator Ivy, who walked from Kowloon City to the stadium, said security was quite strict at the door.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But she was happy to attend the match and support her friend, who’s playing on one of the teams.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "[It's] really exciting. It's huge… My friend is playing football here," she said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Spectators were encouraged to get to the sports ground from Sung Wong Toi - instead of Kai Tak - MTR station.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The MTR Corporation said it had implemented special arrangements at both stations. Plenty of signs were put up pointing passengers to the stadium.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sports minister Kevin Yeung and sports commissioner George Tsoi were both spotted at the stadium.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Also in attendance was security chief Chris Tang, who was happy with what he saw so far before the match.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Everything is smooth. When people depart [from] the MTR, there’s sufficient announcements, as well as notice direction showing how they come here," he told RTHK.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We have adopted a phased approach, so at different stages, we have different [arrangements]. On this occasion, apart from making sure that it’s safe, it's also training to our frontline officers, so that's the reason why we are bringing extra officers to come here to make themselves familiar with the environment."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Another event has been scheduled at the Youth Sports Ground in mid-November, as Hong Kong Men's Rugby Team host Brazil for a two-match international series.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The second match will be played in Kai Tak, with an estimated attendance of 3,000 people.

    Subdivided unit residents fear losing their homes

  <img alt="The Sham Shui Po Housing Concern Mothers’ Group says rent of future subdivided flats may go up under a government initiative to wipe out inadequate housing. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1776430_1_20241027160717.jpg&q=65" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   A concern group on Sunday said residents of subdivided flats may be left homeless as the government proposed plans to put an end to inadequate housing.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The chief executive announced plans in the Policy Address to eradicate substandard subdivided units.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A future legislation will mandate the registration of such dwellings as "basic housing units". Each must be no less than eight square metres, or 86 square feet, in size, and fitted with an individual toilet and at least one window.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Units which fail to meet the set of standards will be outlawed. That could be a headache for tenants, who have to relocate elsewhere.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Sham Shui Po Housing Concern Mothers' Group surveyed about 70 residents of subdivided flats following the announcement of the proposal.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   About eight in 10 respondents said they wished to be directly allocated a public flat, instead of moving to temporary solutions such as light public housing, or transitional homes.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   One of them was Amber, who was worried her landlord would evict them in the future because the unit had to be renovated in order to comply with the rules.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The mother of two added possible rehousing plans by the authorities may not be suitable.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Even if they offer us a light public housing flat or transitional housing, I won't consider. The location is far. I'm not familiar with the new environment, and I don't want my children to transfer to another school," she explained.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Another group member, Lily, feared paying higher rent since there's a minimum size for future units.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We hope they can build more public housing flats quickly. Some of us have waited for eight to 10 years," she appealed to the government.

  <img alt="Two special polling stations were set up in Sheung Shui to facilitate Hongkongers returning from the mainland to vote in the 2023 District Council election. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1776411_1_20241027114458.jpg&q=65" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Constitutional and mainland affairs chief Erick Tsang has revealed the government is looking into setting up more polling stations near the border for Hongkongers on the mainland to vote in next year's Legislative Council elections.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The measure was first implemented in 2021, when the city's borders were shut due to Covid. In the end 17,569 voters cast their ballots at Heung Yuen Wai, Lo Wu and Lok Ma Chau checkpoints without having to enter Hong Kong.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   For last December's District Council election, officials allowed eligible voters on the mainland to vote at one of the designated polling stations near the border in Sheung Shui, sparing them a trip to their home district. Almost 10,000 people made use of the arrangement.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "If necessary, we will continue to set up these polling stations, or even enhance and expand [the arrangement], which we are also considering," he told a televised interview on Sunday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "There might be more choices by then, depending on where the site would be, or whether the location would be suitable as a polling station."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Tsang also confirmed the electronic poll register system would remain in use for the upcoming polls.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The system broke down during last year's DC election, causing major delays at certain stations and prompting Electoral Affairs Commission chairman David Lok to issue a teary apology.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Tsang also said there's no need to further amend the current electoral system, saying it's in line with Hong Kong's long-term development.

    FS reiterates need to issue bonds for development

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Sunday said the government will rely more on long-term capital for infrastructure development in the SAR, including the Northern Metropolis.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Speaking on a radio programme, Chan revealed that the government's recurrent expenditure has gone up by HK$4 billion per year to facilitate new Policy Address measures.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Authorities will continue to issue up to HK$130 billion worth of bonds a year to fund various projects. He pointed out that outstanding government bonds make up only 6 percent of Hong Kong's gross domestic product, a level which is very low compared to other parts of the world.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Hong Kong faces economic restructuring, and geopolitical uncertainties.... we need to take preventive measures, and at the same time we need to enhance development to make ourselves secure," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Chan also estimated the government would return to fiscal balance in about three years. One way of achieving that, he said, was to slash expenditure by one percent each year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   On a separate note, the former development minister said authorities must continue to create land, even as the property market remains volatile.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Recalling the early 2000s when authorities froze their land sale programmes and stopped creating land in response to a market downturn, Chan said the impact of those decisions became evident now.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We can better make use of the land in remote places, so prices for properties near the city centre won't be too high, when compared with remote places," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The financial chief's hectic schedule continues with a visit to Saudi Arabia on Monday, just days after returning from the United States.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Writing on his weekly blog, Chan confirmed he will lead a delegation from the financial and innovation and technology sectors to Riyadh, with an aim to promote Hong Kong and explore business opportunities.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   They will attend the Future Investment Initiative conference, and witness the launch of two exchange-traded funds tracking SAR stock indices on the Saudi Exchange.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   The Observatory has cancelled all typhoon signals at 12:20 am on Sunday as Trami continued to move westwards away from Hong Kong.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It had issued the Strong Wind Signal Number 3 at 10:40 am, after Trami intensified into a typhoon, skirting to the south of Hong Kong at a distance of about 500 kilometres.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Observatory said winds will be strong offshore and on high ground overnight and in the morning.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Members of the public are advised to stay away from the shoreline and remain on alert.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It is expected that Trami will linger and weaken over the coast of central Vietnam today and tomorrow. It may then turn eastward, moving across the central part of the South China Sea again.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Observatory will closely monitor its movement.

   The Observatory said on Saturday that the Strong Wind Signal No. 3 will stay in place at least until 10 pm, adding that local winds are expected to strengthen with a few squally showers in Hong Kong, as the winds veer to the east later on.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   However, it expects the winds to ease off gradually on Sunday morning as Trami leaves.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Earlier, the forecaster had issued the Strong Wind Signal No. 3 at 10.40 am on Saturday, after Trami intensified into a typhoon in the morning, skirting to the south of Hong Kong at a distance of about 500 kilometres.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Education Bureau said kindergartens and schools for children with physical and intellectual disabilities were suspended for the day.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The organiser of the Hong Kong Food Carnival said the event has been postponed due to the typhoon.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Tourism Commission said the light-and-sound show, "A Symphony of Lights", will be cancelled.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Harbour Lounge at the Hong Kong Wine & Dine Festival is also closed, but the doors of the festival remain open as usual.

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Secretary for welfare Chris Sun on Saturday said it’s not necessary to disclose every violation that happens at care homes, saying it depends on the severity of individual incidents.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Social Welfare Department has issued warnings to 15 care homes for persons with disabilities, in the past year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   One of them was issued to Hong Chi Association in August, which operates a care home in Tai Po.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A 38-year-old staff member from the facility has been charged on suspicion of sexually assaulting two residents while on duty.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The case was confirmed by the Social Welfare Department on Wednesday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Speaking to reporters, Sun said the standard procedure for the department is to upload the issuance of warnings to its website.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He said it’s not necessary to share details of every case to the public.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “It depends on the severity of individual violations as well as social awareness. These are judgments we need to make. For example, regarding the Hong Chi case, of course we think the incident was serious, and society is highly concerned, so we believe it’s necessary to explain to the public the details of the case,” he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “Some other violations are really about technical problems. For such violations, we just follow procedures that we think are suitable.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sun reiterated that he doesn't think it's wrong to delay the announcement for two months, adding that officials want to make sure the alleged victims and their families are in a stable emotional state and will not experience further harm.

   The two giant pandas presented to Hong Kong by the central government - An An and Ke Ke - have completed their month-long isolation period.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Ocean Park said on Saturday that the pair's health conditions have met the requirements of the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But it will take at least another 30 days before the public can meet the pandas, as they are still adapting to their new home.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The park revealed that the duo enjoy tailor-made facilities at their habitats.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Separately, the public is invited to suggest new names for the giant pandas until tomorrow. Participants have to submit their proposals along with a 100-word explanation.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A drawing competition for people to portray the pandas will last until November 8.

    'Market drives the site for gold storage facilities'

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury Christopher Hui said on Saturday that gold storage facilities do not have to be located at the airport.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The government unveiled in the Policy Address last week that it hopes to build an international gold trading market by promoting the development of world-class gold storage facilities.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The capacity of the gold vault at the city's international airport stands at 150 tonnes, and the Airport Authority announced that it is finalising the expansion plan of precious metal depository in line with the government's initiative.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   However, speaking on an RTHK radio programme, Hui said storage facilities do not have to be sited at the airport.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Of course, the airport has an innate advantage, because it's safe and secure. In terms of planning, it also allows us to get a better idea of the quantity and scale involved, because the plot of land is relatively level," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "But can we say that other sites can't be used as storage facilities? I don't think so. It's mainly driven by the market, and whether we could meet the storage requirements."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Hui also revealed that he will set up a working group to review the drive of world-class storage facilities in the region, by the end of this year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   While Hong Kong has always been a distribution centre for gold, apart from import and export of the precious metal, Hui hopes the city can make a breakthrough in trading as well as prices of gold.

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Secretary for transport Lam Sai-hung on Saturday said the bureau will do all it can to cope with the series of test events to be held at the Kai Tak Sports Park.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The first test event will take place on Sunday, featuring a youth football match with about 1,000 invited spectators.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   There will be no parking or drop-off areas available at the Sports Park and people were urged to use MTR to enter the area.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Writing on his official blog, Lam noted that the bureau is aware of the broad public's concerns about transport arrangements for the sports park during large-scale events.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He said the government anticipated many spectators will use the Kai Tak Station and Sung Wong Toi Station to access the park, stressing that the MTR will strengthen services on the Tuen Ma line and Kwun Tong line based on actual needs and circumstances.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lam said there are also plenty of nearby buses connecting all parts of Hong Kong near the park and bus operators will launch special bus routes to cope with special transportation needs during major events.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He added that the transport bureau‘s emergency coordination centre will work closely with other governmental departments and public transport operators to monitor the situation and issue timely updates to the public.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Hong Kong Rugby Sevens, scheduled to take place from March 28 to 30 in 2025, is expected to be the first major event to be held at the Sports Park.

    Expansion of '1+' mechanism to lift healthcare quality
   </title>

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The Secretary for Health emphasised that the expansion of the "1+" mechanism will not affect the quality of medicine.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Starting next month, the mechanism will cover all new drugs, including vaccines and advanced therapy products. Currently, it only includes new drugs for treating life-threatening or severely debilitating diseases.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Speaking on a Commercial Radio programme on Saturday, Lo Chung-mau pointed out that the relaxation only changes the mode of approval, not the requirements for approval.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He believes the move will elevate the region's healthcare standard - the reason being that Hong Kong-registered drugs can be used in designated health institutions on the mainland, even if they have not been registered there.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We will be able to, one, allow patients in Hong Kong and even in the Greater Bay Area to enjoy more advanced therapy products or new drugs...with the improvement of healthcare standard in the whole area."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Two, with more choices, the cost of these new treatment drugs or advanced therapy products will be lowered. Thirdly, it will promote the development of R&D - research and development - in the area."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lo pointed out that the move will be attractive for pharmaceutical companies, as they can enjoy access to a bigger market.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Once the drug or device gets approved and registered in Hong Kong and is in-use at public hospitals, it will have a 'green channel' for use in the 86 million population of the GBA."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Meanwhile, Chief Executive John Lee voiced his support towards building a third medical school by local universities, in his third policy blueprint.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The health chief said it's "definitely good" to have one more medical institute, but warned that if the third medical institute is not up to scratch, it may affect the quality of the current two schools.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We have to be cautious, because a medical school involves a lot of resources, not just capital, for medical training, such as professors...a teaching hospital, and even patients. Because teaching is not only held in classrooms, we need medical cases to do so."

    Crime up slightly in first nine months of 2024

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Police Commissioner Raymond Siu on Saturday unveiled that Hong Kong recorded 70,015 crimes in the first nine months of the year, marking a 4.8 percent increase from the same period last year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The rise mainly comes from a surge in fraud, theft and blackmail cases.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Former police chief Andy Tsang’s home in Tai Po was recently burglarised, with reports saying that over HK$100,000 worth of items were stolen.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   On a Commercial Radio programme, Siu mentioned that burglary cases saw a 50 percent year-on-year increase in the first quarter.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He noted the force had since enhanced prevention measures, leading to a decline in such crimes in the first nine months, when compared with last year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We have strengthened patrols, especially on village houses and detached homes. We have also done more intelligence gathering, and we're using technology as well. We use drones from the Government Flying Service to monitor remote areas to identify if there are suspicious persons,” he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “Moreover, we have enhanced communication with residents, and urged them to report to the police immediately if they spot any suspicious activities. All these measures have led to a noticeable improvement.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Siu noted there were 32,120 fraud cases in the first nine months of the year, 2,470 more compared with the same period last year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He highlighted that the surge primarily came from a new method of deception, where scammers pretend to be customer service representatives at e-commerce stores.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The police chief went on to say that the force had implemented targeted promotions and initiatives aimed at combating these types of fraud crime in the past few months, leading to a monthly decline in figures since July.

   The Observatory has issued the Strong Wind Signal No. 3 at 10.40am on Saturday and said it will remain in force for most of the day.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The forecaster said Trami intensified into a typhoon this morning, skirting to the south of Hong Kong at a distance of about 500 kilometres.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Education Bureau said kindergartens and schools for children with physical and intellectual disabilities would be suspended for the day.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Social Welfare Department said all child-care centres, facilities providing after-school care programmes, elderly services centres, rehabilitation units as well as day activity centres, will remain open during normal operating hours.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The organiser of the Hong Kong Food Carnival said the event has been postponed due to the typhoon, noting that the carnival will be cancelled for the rest of the day if Signal No. 3 remains in force after 1pm.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Tourism Commission said the light-and-sound show, "A Symphony of Lights", will be cancelled.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Habour Lounge at the Hong Kong Wine & Dine Festival is also closed under the strong wind signal number 3, but the doors of the festival remain open as usual.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Observatory said the Strong Wind Signal No. 3 will stay in place at least until 10pm, adding that local winds are expected to strengthen with a few squally showers in Hong Kong, as the winds veer to the east later on.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   However, it expects the winds to ease off gradually on Sunday morning as Trami leaves.

   The Observatory says it will issue the Strong Wind Signal No. 3 at 10.40am as Severe Tropical Storm Trami skirts the SAR.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Education Bureau said kindergartens and schools for children with physical and intellectual disabilities would be suspended for the day.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Observatory said local winds are expected to pick up gradually in Hong Kong as the winds veer to the east later on, and some places which were previously sheltered become exposed.

   However, it expects the winds to ease off gradually on Sunday morning as Trami leaves.
   <br/>

   It said Trami was an estimated 560 kilometres south of Hong Kong, and is forecast to move across the South China Sea in the direction of the waters south of Hainan Island.

   Thousands descended upon Central Harbourfront on Friday to bask in the evening atmosphere and indulge in the finer things at the Wine and Dine Festival.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The annual flagship culinary event organised by the Tourism Board is featuring more than 300 booths from around the world.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Phil from South Africa was in a long queue outside a booth selling wines from the UK. He said the festival this year was bigger than even those before the pandemic.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “I’ve been here previously, like pre-Covid. There’re a lot more people here. It seems a bit bigger. I’m having a really good time, so it’s interesting,” he told RTHK.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He also said the nation’s alcohol producers have made leaps and bounds.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “I had a Chinese Chardonnay earlier, and it was good... I had some Chinese wines like 10 or 15 years ago, and it was terrible. Now, it’s like quite good.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   At another booth was Umesh, who was enjoying a glass of Finnish wine. He said he was able to taste drinks that he had never tried before.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “We’ve tried Finland’s. We’ve tried China’s. We’ve tried France’s. Not disappointed yet. I can’t wait to see the others, because I’ll probably find stuff that I don’t know existed,” he said of his first Wine and Dine Festival experience.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The five-day festival will end on Sunday.

    Relaxed approval rules for all new drugs from Nov 1

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   A streamlined regulatory regime aimed at speeding up the arrival in Hong Kong of medicines for serious diseases will be extended to cover all new drugs from November 1, the government said on Friday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Under the “1+” mechanism, a new drug can be registered in the SAR if just one reference regulatory authority in the world has approved it, rather than two in the past.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The mechanism was introduced last November for new drugs to treat life-threatening or severely debilitating diseases, and five products have been approved under it so far.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Department of Health said extending the relaxed regime to all new medicines will bring more choice for patients and strengthen the city’s ability to evaluate drugs.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Alex Lam, chairman of concern group Hong Kong's Patients’ Voices, said Hongkongers will benefit from lower prices and a larger variety of drugs on the market. But he cautioned that quality may be undermined.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Previously we had two regulatory authorities’ approval, now we only need one. If that one authority comes from a country where the standing is not too high in the world, the quality may be lower and the risk to patients may be higher than before," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lam said the World Health Organisation has stated which countries have higher standards regarding drug regulation, with most of them in Europe. In Asia, only Singapore and South Korea make it onto the list, he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "When we expect more drugs coming from countries that are not listed as the highest standard, there may be a compensation of cost in terms of quality and risk associated with this kind of medicine. We have to be careful when we use it on patients in Hong Kong," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lam added that the government needs to act as a gatekeeper to ensure patient safety, suggesting public hospitals should monitor the outcomes when patients are prescribed drugs approved under the mechanism, to check for any problems.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Vendors at this year’s Wine and Dine Festival said on Friday that they hope the weather doesn't dampen business over the weekend.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A storm that prompted the observatory to issue a No 1 signal is expected to come within 500 kilometres of Hong Kong on Saturday morning.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Jeremy Li from a local gin brand said his business mainly welcomed locals in the first two days of the festival.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He told RTHK that the weather will play a part in how well they do over the weekend.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “Last year was the first year we joined the Wine and Dine [Festival], the weekend was really, really packed and busy,” he told RTHK.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “Hopefully if the weather is nice, I guess [business] should be good [this weekend] too.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Kit Leung, a merchant in the newly designated zone featuring British products, is also hoping for good weather.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “[Our business] depends on the typhoon. We are looking at the sky,” he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The annual festival kicked off on Wednesday and will last for five days, instead of the usual four.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Customs officers on Friday said they seized smuggled goods with a market value of over HK$100 million during an operation last week.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   They inspected a 40-foot container scheduled to set sail to Taichung, confiscating products including electronic appliances, routers, CPUs, computers and circuit boards.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   No arrests have been made so far.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Shirley Woo, an investigator of Customs' syndicate crimes investigation bureau, said it's believed the intended final destination for the goods was the mainland.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “We believe that, given the huge demand for these smuggled products on the mainland, criminals are taking an indirect route to first smuggle the cargo to Taichung, and then use various means to smuggle it back to the mainland,” she said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Woo added that more than HK$10 million in taxes would have been evaded if the smuggling had been successful.

   The Hong Kong Observatory on Friday said the Standby Signal No. 1 will stay up until at least 6 am on Saturday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Severe Tropical Storm Trami is expected to skirt about 500 kilometres to the south of Hong Kong on Saturday morning, it said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The forecaster predicted strong winds in some areas, especially offshore and on high ground due to the combined effects of Trami and a northeast monsoon.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But It said local winds will not strengthen much because the prevailing winds will mainly be northerlies.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “Depending on the distance of strong winds associated with Trami from the Pearl River Estuary and the change in local wind conditions, the observatory will assess the need of issuing the Strong Wind Signal No. 3 during the day [on Saturday]," it said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Local winds are expected to weaken on Sunday when Trami moves further away, the observatory added.

    Govt hopes probe will help prevent abuse at care homes

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The secretary for labour and welfare said on Friday that he hopes an investigation by an operator of a care home into alleged abuse there could help prevent cases in future.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A care home worker of Hong Chi Association was arrested on suspicion of sexually assaulting two residents while on duty. The association has terminated the employee and promised its own probe.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I hope Hong Chi Association's independent review committee can complete its work as soon as possible, look into details if any improvements can be made systematically, and ensure that such unfortunate incidents won't happen again in the future," Chris Sun said on an RTHK radio programme.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He also said the government is not in a position to offer details of abuse cases reported from four other care facilities, citing privacy concerns.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sun added that the Social Welfare Department has issued warnings to 15 care homes in the past year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "A warning letter is intended to inform care homes of any shortcomings, or if it's suspected of breaking the rules. We have to warn them. But the public has to understand that the warnings cannot include all the details.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "So we've always adopted a similar practice in issuing warning letters. The main point of doing so is to notify care homes of inappropriate actions and shortcomings. This can also allow the industry to know that they have to focus on a certain area and step up their efforts in this regard."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Social Welfare Department will review the licence of the care home operated by Hong Chi Association annually in the wake of the case, instead of the current practice of every three years.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sun said the department's next move depends on the findings of the independent review committee.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The operation of a care home depends on its quality and whether its operations are up to the required standard. That's one thing. But if someone does bad things for an ulterior motive, that's mostly down to the individual. The two things have to be separated," he said.

   People gathered bright and early on Friday morning to catch a glimpse of the first-ever dinosaur fossils found on home soil, as they went on display at the Hong Kong Heritage Discovery Centre in Kowloon Park.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Officials announced earlier this week that dinosaur fossils believed to date back to the Cretaceous period had been discovered on Port Island in the northeastern waters of the SAR.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Chong Got was the first to arrive for the opening of the display.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “I don’t know about it actually, that’s why I’m coming here to learn from it. It’s amazing to see the fossils. When I was young, going to the museum, to the souvenir shop, and looking at this small, tiny piece of stone, and then you could find the fossil of a silhouette of, like, a beetle or a shell. It’s already amazing enough,” he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “Here we are talking about dinosaurs. I don’t know how many millions of years now. So it really would be an amazing opportunity for me, to open my eyes.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Also at the exhibition was Rick Dong who said he has seen dinosaur fossils in other museums, but was excited to see the first found in Hong Kong.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “It’s a very good opportunity for the local citizens to come here to see this fossil. And with the development, I think we’ll have more fossils to develop and be shown here for the citizens to see,” he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “[It’s a] very good operation, because for science, there’s no boundary. We should work together with the scientists from all over the world to develop and do research.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Gavin Kwai had taken his six-year-old son Joshua to the exhibition, saying it was an educational opportunity.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “It’s a very good chance for them to learn… When we went to, like, the Science Park’s exhibition beforehand about dinosaurs, sometimes they asked us if we are going to see dinosaurs in Hong Kong or if we are going to discover some. Or they will ask us if it was discovered in Hong Kong and where it was in Hong Kong,” he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “But like beforehand, we usually disappointed them by saying, ‘It’s from other countries, you are not likely to find something like this in Hong Kong.’ It’s very amazing this time that we can really truly discover something in Hong Kong.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   History lover Nitin Gupta said he didn't know much about dinosaurs, but was glad there were staff available to explain the fossils to him.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Ringo Ng, assistant curator of archaeological preservation at the centre, said staff will be arranged to provide explanations from time to time, but they hope to have guides stationed there in the future.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   The Observatory issued the Standby Signal No. 1 early on Friday, and said the signal will remain in force until at least 6pm as Severe Tropical Storm Trami moves across the central and northern parts of the South China Sea.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It said Trami is forecast to stay more than 600 kilometres from Hong Kong for most of the daytime hours, and its strong winds have not yet had an effect on the vicinity of the Pearl River Estuary.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Observatory warned that the combined effect of Trami and the northeast monsoon would bring occasionally strong winds offshore and on high ground, but it also said local winds won't strengthen significantly during the day due to terrain sheltering effect.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The need to issue Strong Wind Signal No. 3 thereafter will depend on the distance between Trami and Hong Kong and the change in local wind strength," it said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Observatory added that Trami will move towards the vicinity of Hainan Island and local winds will weaken later on Sunday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It said it would closely monitor Trami and assess the need to keep the signal in effect.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Observatory warned people living in low-lying areas or places exposed to the high winds should take precautions.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It advised the public not to engage in water sports and fishing vessels in the open sea should seek shelter.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   The government on Thursday strongly condemned overseas individuals exerting improper pressure on a senior judge, labelling it as blatant interference of ongoing criminal proceedings in the SAR.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   There have been media reports that Court of Final Appeal non-permanent judge Patrick Keane was met by protests when he spoke at an event in Sydney, with demonstrators calling for the release of former media tycoon Jimmy Lai.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The 66-year-old joined the bench of Hong Kong's top court in 2023, following his retirement from the High Court of Australia.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Any attempt by any organisation or individual to exert pressure on judges and judicial officers, and interfere with the criminal justice process by means of political power or any other means, is clearly a reprehensible act undermining the rule of law of the SAR and should be vehemently condemned," a government spokesman said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The spokesman pointed out legal proceedings regarding Jimmy Lai's case are still ongoing, and it was inappropriate for any person to comment on the details of the case, or exert improper interference.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "All defendants will receive a fair trial strictly in accordance with laws applicable to Hong Kong and as protected by the Basic Law and the Hong Kong Bill of Rights," the statement added.

   Three pedestrians were hospitalised after the glass wall of a Tsuen Wan shopping mall shattered on Thursday, sending pieces of glass onto the pavement below.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Police said that at about 6.30pm, a five-by-three-metre section of the curtain wall cracked and fell from the fifth floor of Citywalk One.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Images from the scene show shards of glass littered across a cordoned-off section of the pavement on Wo Tik Street.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The pedestrians were hurt in the forehead and shoulders, and have been sent to Yan Chai Hospital for treatment.

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Secretary for Labour and Welfare Chris Sun on Thursday said he is highly concerned about an abuse case at a care home and that the government will take serious follow-up actions.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Hong Chi Association, which operates the facility, said in a statement on Wednesday that the case was discovered in August, and they immediately reported it to police and the Social Welfare Department.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The department confirmed the case on Wednesday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sun told reporters on Thursday that officials wanted to ensure that the alleged victims and their families were in a stable emotional state.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “We want to prevent them from experiencing further harm. Therefore we felt it was important to wait until their situation was stable before making the announcement,” he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “This is a matter of balance that we hope to achieve.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The case involved a 38-year-old male staff member of the care home, who has been arrested for allegedly sexually assaulting two residents while on duty.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The association said they terminated the employee, and will set up an independent review committee to evaluate protective measures for service users.

   The observatory says it will issue the Standby Signal No 1 between 10pm on Thursday and 4am on Friday as Tropical Cyclone Trami edges closer to the SAR.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It said Trami is expected to gradually move towards the vicinity of Hainan and come within 800 kilometres of Hong Kong on Thursday night or Friday morning.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The observatory said a higher typhoon signal could be possible on Friday or Saturday, depending on the storm's movement and any change in local wind conditions.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The observatory said Trami could linger in the vicinity of Hainan or move eastwards across central and northern parts of the South China Sea early next week.

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Two separate government departments that deal with unauthorised land use should start working more closely with each other and share intelligence to put a stop to offenders, the Ombudsman said on Thursday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Jack Chan said he has come up with 16 recommendations for the planning and lands departments on how they can better tackle the hundreds of complaints they get each year about problems such as people filling in ponds without permission or turning green belt land and conservation zones into car parks.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Chan said the Planning Department's enforcement action sometimes fails to deter repeat offenders and such people should be given less and less time to comply with enforcement notices for each subsequent breach they make.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Lands Department, meanwhile, needs to improve guidelines and training for staff so they can better deal with priority cases in a timely manner, Chan said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Ombudsman said getting different parts of the government to collaborate more is one of his major goals and to this end, the planning and lands departments "should work together in such cases and to sort it out, instead of one department handling its own matters."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Chan also recommended the two departments establish a database for unauthorised development cases "to facilitate interdepartmental intelligence sharing and enforcement, as well as formulate targeted measures for high-risk sites to nip problems in the bud".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In response, the two departments vowed to strengthen cooperation with each other, such as by conducting joint enforcement operations against large-scale unauthorised cases through a pilot scheme, and setting up a high-level communication platform.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Planning Department also said it would continue to tackle illegal developments to meet public expectations and streamline its enforcement workflow.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   For the Lands Department, it said it would review existing guidelines and enhance staff training to follow up on cases in a timely manner.

   The development minister on Thursday said that her bureau will consider merging the City Gallery in Central with a new exhibition hall in Wan Chai, which will showcase major development projects.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Development Bureau said the HK$600 million exhibition will feature projects such as the Northern Metropolis as well as the Kau Yi Chau Artificial Islands.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Speaking on a Commercial Radio programme, Bernadette Linn acknowledged that some people have expressed concerns over the amount of money involved in the project, but stressed that the construction fee is similar to that of other government buildings.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   She also revealed that the government will take into consideration lawmakers’ suggestion to merge the City Gallery with the new exhibition hall.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The City Gallery showcases Hong Kong's planning history. It also exhibits part of the Northern Metropolis project because we don't have anywhere else to showcase the project," she said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Lawmakers have suggested the existing exhibits in the City Gallery could be merged together with our proposed facility in a larger gallery hall, so that the City Gallery can be vacated. We think it's a good suggestion."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Linn added they hope the new facility in Wan Chai will open in 2027.

    'Use MPF records to counter fake qualifications'

  <div class="itemFullText">
   A concern group for construction site safety on Thursday said authorities could consider using Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF) records as a more reliable way to verify workers’ employment histories.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The suggestion came after the anti-graft agency ICAC said it arrested 148 people for allegedly using fake qualifications to obtain excavator operator and electrician licences, which involved applicants attending phony courses, and receiving documents claiming they attained the required work experience.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The chair of the Hong Kong Institute of Safety Practitioner’s Education and Training Committee, Lee Kwong-sing, said people are seeking shortcuts to obtain licences to improve their job prospects because the construction industry is doing well.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The expert also pointed out that there is a loophole in the current way work experience is verified, in which only an employer’s letter is required.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "If authorities required MPF contribution records, it would be much harder to fake qualifications. Applicants would need three to five years of records to qualify, which requires long-term planning," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "But that's not the case now. At the moment they can just verify using an employer's letter, which seems a bit casual."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Labour Department said 100 excavator operator and 32 electrician licences have been revoked so far.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Simon Tang, co-founder of home decoration consultancy Deco Academy, told RTHK that unlicensed electrical work might lead to improper installations and high repair costs.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "For the installation part, if the lines are just installed in the concrete directly without passing through the plastic pipe, when there is water leakage, for example, then it may cause high repair costs and it may cause danger for the residents," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Tang said an electrician's licence is often needed for those carrying out home renovation work, but the authorities don't always scrutinise these licences.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The checking is a very selective process. So they do not check every case. And also, they do not scrutinise all details. Basically, they do not scrutinise every submission. And there's no penalty if the submission is not successful," he said.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Mainland tourists joining new tours of Hong Kong shopping malls won't be obliged to go on a spending spree, a retail industry representative said on Thursday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Travel Industry Council and Retail Management Association have devised 14 different itineraries for "in-depth tours" of five shopping centres in the city, with participants promised the chance to hear some  "urban legends" during their two-hour visits.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Association chairwoman Annie Yau Tse said that while participants will be received by a mall representative and will be offered discounts on their spending, they will be free to roam around and can decide for themselves where to make any purchases.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   With concerns that tourists are spending less in Hong Kong, Tse said it will be down to the shops in the malls to try to get visitors to splash the cash.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The most important thing is that there are customers around. Once they come into the malls, we can think of ways to attract them to consume," she said on an RTHK programme.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "But if there are no customers at all, then really nothing can be done. So when there are more people around, that's already an advantage for us."

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The first-ever discovery of dinosaur fossils in Hong Kong is a "momentous" achievement and could mark the beginning of a series of exciting finds in the wider region, a palaeontologist said on Thursday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Officials announced on Wednesday that dinosaur fossils believed to date back to the Cretaceous period, about 145 million to 66 million years ago, have been discovered on Port Island in the northeastern waters of the SAR.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The discovery of these bones is super exciting because we have rocks of the right age and the right environment but having looked for so many years, different people have not been able to find dinosaur bones, including myself," said Michael Pittman from the School of Life Sciences at Chinese University.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "From what I hear they seem to be from some larger dinosaurs. I've seen pictures of models that are of long-neck dinosaurs and the hadrosaur dinosaurs, so these are among the biggest."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Pittman said the find was also "very lucky" since Hong Kong isn't an ideal location for fossil preservation, given that the territory had a lot of volcanic activity in the past.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He added that finding dinosaur bones in the SAR is challenging due to the topography and landscape.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "There have been Jurassic-age fish, there have been older Devonian fish. Very interesting, but not like large volumes of fossils, and that's partly because there's not much area to look for fossils. Also, the rocks are quite hard and they don't readily erode out fossils," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "When we look for fossils, we typically go to a place where you can easily access them, and we focus on places where there are lots and lots of fossils, so it's rich in fossils and makes it easier. So because of those various reasons I mentioned, Hong Kong hasn't been a focus point for looking for fossils."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He said China is one of four main countries in the world for dinosaur fossils, along with the US, Canada and Argentina, but the Guangdong area is famous only for dinosaur eggs.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Pittman also welcomed the signing of an agreement between the Development Bureau and the mainland's Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology, to deepen exchanges and cooperation.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Obviously, finding some fossils in Hong Kong enriches our local palaeontology heritage. But my hope is the agreement would help to further exchanges with the institute, which people like myself have been working for for more than a decade," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The dinosaur fossils will be on public display at the Heritage Discovery Centre in Kowloon Park from Friday.

    'Civil servants welcome new family-friendly measures'

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The government on Thursday revealed that civil servants and unions have welcomed its move to offer more family-friendly measures, with officials expressing the hope that the rest of society would follow suit.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It comes after Chief Executive John Lee proposed in his Policy Address last week that civil servants with children under three can get three days of childcare leave annually starting next April.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   On an RTHK radio programme on Thursday, the Secretary for the Civil Service Ingrid Yeung was asked if the government is taking the lead by rolling out more family-friendly measures, to which she responded: “We hope the whole society can offer more childcare measures to help parents.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   She added that the reaction to the new measure has been "really good". "The unions and other civil servant colleagues have welcomed the measure and are looking forward to it."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Speaking to reporters after the show, she said the government will monitor the measure – expected to benefit some 12,000 employees – after it takes effect.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We will review how this works out and see if there is room for improvement, or whether it really affects our work seriously.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The minister also pointed out that a number of factors have led to a 10-percent vacancy rate in the civil service, and that the government needs more time to deal with the manpower crunch.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "In the past few years, we've seen a high retirement wave. It's simply because of the age of civil servants. And also, the number of graduates is not as many as a decade ago. So we have to really compete for talents,” Yeung said.

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   A longer and greener Wine and Dine Festival opened on Wednesday, as locals and tourists flocked to the harbourfront to indulge themselves in culinary treats and fine wines.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Acting Financial Secretary Michael Wong kicked off the event and told the crowd, "Do not get drunk. You have one more day to enjoy all the great wines. And I know you will do it judiciously, prudently and soberly.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I'm proud to say that Hong Kong has emerged as a global wine hub, where wine lovers can enjoy ever-growing selections of wines from all over the world."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   For the first time, the festival starts on Wednesday night and lasts five days - up from four previously - until Sunday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Organisers are also keen to cut down waste, with disposable plastic cups now prohibited at the venue, in line with the government's ban on single-use plastics. Visitors can encouraged to bring their own glasses, or they can purchase one on-site for HK$50.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Hundreds of tourists who arrive on cruises have been invited to join the fest, according to tourism chief Kevin Yeung, while shuttle buses also run between the venue and the Shenzhen Bay checkpoint to facilitate cross-border visitors.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The annual flagship event by the Tourism Board features over 300 booths, serving foods and drinks from 35 countries and regions.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Bayley, a tourist from the United States, was impressed by the event.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "[It's] very different from a festival in the States… [In the US] it wouldn't be this organised," she told RTHK.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Having it not only in country, but also they say wine and food, and having all the pictures. That's not a thing in the States."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It was German tourist Tanja's first time at the festival.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I'm overwhelmed because there's so much to see, and so much to discover. We enjoy very much. It's very nice. We do not know where to start and where to end…We have to come back again," she said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   For Anton, a German expat working in Hong Kong, wine was what attracted him to the fair.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He was surprised to see so many people turn up on opening night, given it's only Wednesday and most still needed to work the next morning.

    Govt mulls ways to crack down on fake accountants

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Officials on Wednesday said they are looking at ways to crack down on unlicensed accountants in the city by revising auditing standards, with lawmakers saying the measure will help maintain Hong Kong's status as a global financial hub.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury Christopher Hui said that accountants may be required to provide their practising certificate number when signing audit reports.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   On his blog, he wrote that companies may also be required to provide the practising certificate number of accountants who helped sign the audit report along with their profits tax returns.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Accounting sector lawmaker Edmund Wong said that currently, it is almost impossible for the government to check if the accountants signing the reports are licensed or not, as most of these documents are submitted in paper form.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "They are pretending that they are licensed to sign off audit reports and sign off reports recklessly without any supporting document behind. In such cases, the unlicensed issues have seriously damaged and impacted our profession's reputation in the past years," he told RTHK.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Wong said the proposed measure would help uphold the SAR's reputation and status as an international financial centre, though he admitted it may take some time for companies to get used to the change.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It might be causing some inconvenience and difficulties at the beginning, especially for the first few years," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "But as we all know, by 2030, the profits tax return has to be filed electronically. By that time, all those data, including the practising numbers could easily be collected by the government."

   A 34-year-old man and a 47-year-old woman remain in police detention, after Narcotics Bureau officers on Tuesday discovered 24 litres of suspected liquid cocaine, hidden in red wine bottles.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Police arrested the mainland man and local woman in an anti-drug operation at a car park on Tat Chee Avenue in Sham Shui Po.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Officers allegedly found the suspected liquid cocaine hidden in 16 1.5-litre bottles, inside a suitcase belonging to the woman.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Police put the street value of the liquid cocaine at HK$11 million.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The pair were arrested on suspicion of trafficking in dangerous drugs.

    More workers, funding needed for social services

  <div class="itemFullText">
   A council that represents non-governmental social services organisations on Wednesday said most groups they spoke to are facing manpower shortages and money issues, with nearly half of them expecting less funding next year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Hong Kong Council of Social Service said it surveyed more than 140 organisations and found that nearly 86 percent of them faced staff shortages and that a lot of experienced social workers have retired or left the industry.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Its chief executive Chua Hoi-wai said it is vital to invest in new talent.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I think different kinds of training [are needed]. And not only this, but we also should try to attract more people joining our profession, joining our sector," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We want more people to understand the impact of social welfare services so that we can gather more cross-sector collaboration and we can also attract more talents to join our sector."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In terms of funding, Chua said the council found that 78 percent of the organisations polled are dealing with cash shortfalls.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He said the economic situation in the SAR is contributing to a drop in donations, adding the survey found that nearly half of the firms it spoke to anticipate a decrease in funding and donations for 2024-25.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We would not have enough resources to provide the needy social services, and another issue is when we say that we have a lack of manpower, actually the cost of manpower has increased in these few years," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Chua also said the council encouraged NGOs to invest more in digital transformation to help reduce costs or increase efficiency.

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The Family Planning Association has introduced a new book to address questions about relationships and changes during puberty.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Chau Wai-wai, an education officer from the association, on Wednesday said the book covers various topics including body image, sexual orientation and sexual identities.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "When we are addressing body image, when we are addressing bodily changes, when we are addressing sexual desire, we try to make it positive. It's part of life, it's part of growing up," she said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Hong Kong's sex education came under the spotlight recently when officials released a set of teaching materials suggesting that rather than acting upon sexual impulses, young people should consider going to play badminton instead.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Critics said the advice was “out of touch”, but the Education Bureau said the materials aim to teach pupils how to protect themselves.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Chau said she wants to see more comprehensive sex education in the school curriculum.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “Hong Kong is a stressful society. Also in schools, teaching time is very limited. In that case, sex education is squeezed into different subjects,” she said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “So there's no independent subject or not even compulsory in the curriculum. In that sense, of course, we would like to see sex education included more in the curriculum.”

    Wine and Dine vendors keep spirits high

  <img alt="The Wine and Dine Festival will run for five days until Sunday. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1775865_1_20241023171411.jpg&q=90" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Vendors at this year’s Wine and Dine Festival have expressed confidence in business, with some expecting double-digit growth.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The event runs until Sunday at the Central Harbourfront with over 300 booths offering food and drink.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   One of those reappearing at the festival is MyiCellar, which specialises in Kweizhou Zhenjiu.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Co-founder Tomy Wu said his company is eyeing a 30-to-50 percent increase in business amid the growing popularity of Chinese baijiu.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “More and more people know about baijiu, so we expect the revenue and sales to increase quite significantly, compared with last year,” Wu said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “We expect, in the long run, sales to increase, because the lower tax rate is beneficial to those middle- to high-end products. Very likely, we will also use the tax cut to decrease the price of the products.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   For the first time, the festival features exhibition areas about the United Kingdom, Australia, Chile and Thailand.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Tracy Cheung, senior brand manager of Edrington Hong Kong, is optimistic about the company’s debut at the festival.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “We expect there will be quite a lot of customers interested in the products because this is the first time we have a ‘UK Pavilion’ at the Wine and Dine Festival, and it’s also our first time to participate in this big festival,” Cheung said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “We are expecting roughly 1,000 to 2,000 cocktails per day.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Unlike in the past, this year’s festival lasts for five days instead of four.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Zachary Chan, co-founder of Hong Kong Liquor Store which has joined the festival for about a decade, said the longer event will help.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “We should be able to do better sales than last year. This year, we got some new products we are promoting at our booth. We got whiskey and gin from different places. We’ll be doing a lot of cocktails. I think that’s one of the areas of growth is a lot of people are looking for cocktails. That’s one of the focuses we are doing this year,” Chan told RTHK.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “With the extra day and everything, we are hoping to do 15 percent more than we did last year overall.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Forum Restaurant, which last took part in 2017, is expecting business to grow 30 to 40 percent.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Executive chef Adam Wong said the boost could come from people who choose to stay in Hong Kong to spend.

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The government said on Wednesday that officials have approved applications for nearly 29,000 imported workers in the past year, after restrictions on overseas labour were lifted for 26 types of job.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The approval figure relates to the Enhanced Supplementary Labour Scheme (ESLS) which began in September last year and is separate from similar programmes that allow the importation of workers for  construction, transport and care home posts.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In a written reply to unionist lawmaker Chau Siu-chung, Labour Secretary Chris Sun said officials received applications to import more than 66,000 workers.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The 29,000 or so given approval amount to 44 percent of the total number of applications.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Waiters topped the list of workers coming in with 5,200 approvals, followed by 3,200 cooks and 2,900 junior cooks, Sun said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Chau asked the government to suspend the scheme to protect local workers.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "[The Labour Department] has been closely monitoring the implementation of ESLS, and will review [the scheme] prior to the lapse of its two-year implementation period," Sun said in response.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The minister added that officials have received 62 complaints from the imported workers, mainly over issues involving wages and working hours.

    ICAC arrests 148 over fake professional qualifications

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The ICAC on Wednesday said they arrested 148 people for allegedly using fake qualifications to obtain excavator operator and electrician licences.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Those arrested include construction workers and people who are suspected of providing fake qualifications services.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The anti-graft body's principal investigator Glory Leung assured the public that no safety issues have been found so far.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We have [reviewed] works they handled [in the past], whether there's any industrial accident, or other event that led to safety issues, but so far there are no safety issues in those applications involving false qualifications," Leung said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The ICAC said the cases involved criminal masterminds who provided fake courses, with training for excavator operator licences costing about HK$22,000 and those for electrician licences costing between HK$500 to HK$1,000.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Upon completion of a fake course, applicants would receive a document claiming they attained the required work experience.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Meanwhile, the Labour Department, and the Electrical and Mechanical Services Departments (EMSD) – which are involved in the issuance of working licences for both professions – said they have been cooperating with the watchdog in the law enforcement process.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Labour Department said it launched investigations on training course providers, and its staff members, while the EMSD said it reviewed the registrations of those concerned.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   One hundred excavator operator and 32 electrician licences have been revoked so far.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The departments said they will continue to review and improve their admission and approval procedures to ensure registration standards.

    Event organisers asked to make use of cruise terminal

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Culture and tourism minister Kevin Yeung on Wednesday said the authorities will continue to work on getting event organisers to make use of the Kai Tak Cruise Terminal.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   During a Legco meeting, lawmaker Chan Yuet-ming said business near the terminal is bleak, especially when compared with the situation around Ocean Terminal in Tsim Sha Tsui.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In response, Yeung said it was unreasonable to compare the two facilities as their purposes are different, adding that it would be impossible to use a lot of the Kai Tak Cruise Terminal for commercial purposes without a complete revamp.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But he said the authorities are trying their best to make use of the facility and attract local residents to visit it.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We understand that there won't be cruises docking at the terminal every day. On days without a cruise, we want to make use of the area. There are different exhibitions held, and we encourage organisers to hold large-scale events," Yeung said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "But we have to consider the timing, there may only be four or five consecutive days without a cruise, and this limits the variety of events to be held at the terminal."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   DAB lawmaker Edward Leung suggested building helipads at the terminal to boost the low-altitude economy.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "[We want to] build our cruise economy and attract tourists to come to Hong Kong to take a ride on the helicopter. We are now trying to promote a low-altitude economy, so cruise passengers could take helicopter rides to view Victoria Harbour or go to the Geopark," Leung said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Yeung said the government is looking into whether there is any room to build new facilities at the site.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We definitely have to consider the feasibility technically, for example, whether the load-bearing capacity of the cruise terminal is enough for more facilities or holding more events... but this would be one of the ways of development to be considered," he said.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   The government on Wednesday said Hong Kong saw a 16-percent jump in visitors from ten mainland cities in the third quarter, following Beijing's decision to allow individual visits from these places.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Individual Visit Scheme was expanded in March and May, and it involved the cities of Qingdao, Xi'an, Taiyuan, Hohhot, Harbin, Lhasa, Lanzhou, Xining, Yinchuan and Urumqi.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Tourism Bureau revealed the boost in mainland tourist numbers in a response to a question from tourism sector lawmaker Perry Yiu, who also chairs the China Travel Service.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It said more than 140,000 inbound visitors came from the ten cities between July and September, adding that since the visit scheme's expansion, some officials had visited these places and encouraged their trade representatives to tour the SAR.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Since April this year, the Tourism Board has distributed nearly 30,000 sets of discount vouchers, each valued at HK$200, to visitors from the ten cities through travel agents and airlines," the bureau said in a written reply.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It added that it will continue to work with the trade to look for business opportunities and promote two-way tourism exchanges with mainland cities.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   The government on Wednesday gave the green light for the Regal Oriental Hotel in Kowloon City to be partially converted into a youth hostel.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Non-governmental organisation Yan Oi Tong will take ownership of 80 rooms, providing 160 beds.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Named "YOT Hub", it is the fifth such project to be granted approval under the Subsidy Scheme for Using Hotels and Guesthouses as Youth Hostels which began last year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "YOT Hub is well connected by public transport with comprehensive community facilities in the vicinity. This project not only provides young people with a comfortable living environment but also enables them to broaden their horizons and achieve their personal development goals through various self-enhancement activities," a government spokesman said in a statement.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Programmes such as training and internship will be provided for tenants to deepen their understanding of national development opportunities.

    Emma Raducanu becomes latest to pull out of HK Open

  <img alt="Emma Raducanu has already missed four tournaments on the WTA's Asian Tour.

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Hong Kong Tennis Open organisers on Wednesday announced that former US Open champion Emma Raducanu will not take part in the tournament, a development that comes on the heels of star player Naomi Osaka's decision to drop out.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   With two of the big names out, organisers stressed there will still be an "incredible line-up of marquee stars" at the event.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It pointed out that top players – including defending champion Leylah Fernandez, former world number one Simona Halep, and Wimbledon quarter-finalist Lulu Sun – will be taking part in the event which runs from October 26 to November 3.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Hong Kong China Tennis Association said in a statement that it was unfortunate that Raducanu will not be participating in the all-female tournament and wished her a speedy recovery.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Injuries are an unfortunate part of the game, and we do hope that she will be back competing as soon as possible," the statement added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Raducanu's decision comes after four-time Grand Slam champion Naomi Osaka announced her withdrawal from the tournament.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The 21-year-old Briton continues to rehab from a foot injury she sustained in the quarter-finals of the Korea Open in September.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “I’m sorry to say that I will not be able to play in Hong Kong next week," Raducanu said in a statement through the association. "While my foot is making good progress, I need a little more time before I am match fit," she added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Raducanu's spot in the draw has since been filled by 2020 Australian Open winner Sofia Kenin.

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Former education and housing secretary Michael Suen, who was best known for his measures to combat a housing crisis two decades ago, has died at the age of 80.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Suen joined the government in 1966 and held various positions.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   During his tenure as housing minister, he rolled out nine measures to revive the property market in 2002, after it plummeted to record lows following the Asian financial crisis in 1997.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The measures included halting regular land auctions, as well as suspending the Home Ownership Scheme and the selling of subsidised housing.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Critics argued that the drastic reduction in housing supply brought on by the measures led to housing shortages and soaring property prices.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Suen served as education minister from 2007 to 2012 before retiring.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Chief Executive John Lee expressed sorrow over the death, saying Suen made great contributions to the government over the years.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "He had formulated strategies and provided counsel to the HKSAR in various policy areas, addressing different challenges while promoting Hong Kong's development. He commanded great respect from government colleagues and members of the community with his dedicated service to the public over the years," Lee said in a statement.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Housing Secretary Winnie Ho also expressed sorrow, saying Suen's connections with housing affairs started when he joined the Housing Authority in 1973.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Education minister Christine Choi said Suen put in place many important education policies including the "334" academic structure, adding that his achievements will continue to have an impact.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Cultural, sports and tourism chief Kevin Yeung, meanwhile, praised Suen for his contributions to various government policies.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Executive Council convenor and New People’s Party lawmaker Regina Ip said Suen played a crucial role in the SAR's development.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "He was in charge of many important policy areas, including constitutional development, land, housing and planning, and before his retirement, education. When I first met him, he was a district officer in Sha Tin, and he was responsible for clearance of Tai Wai to make room for the construction of Sha Tin City One. So he really played a very important role in Hong Kong's development over many decades," Ip said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In 2011, Suen was diagnosed with kidney failure and contracted Legionnaires’ disease the same year.

    'No bid splitting for the govt's Youth Post hostel'

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The government on Wednesday said it does not plan to split the bidding for its proposed youth hostel and cultural exchanges facility, saying that could contradict its aim of fostering exchanges.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Chief Executive John Lee had announced in his Policy Address that authorities would convert the existing Kai Tak Community Isolation Facility into the Youth Post, where young people coming from outside Hong Kong would stay and interact with locals.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Secretary for Home and Youth Affairs Alice Mak told an RTHK programme that bid splitting is not cost effective and will also contradict the government's aim of setting up the place.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Our bidding direction is that the operator has to have relevant experience. It doesn't have to be in charge of the whole venue, which is so big, because there are a lot of different areas," she said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It can look for groups or organisations to manage this place together. But if we were to split the bidding, it would actually restrict the operator's plan on how to use this facility."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Authorities hope to begin the bidding process by the end of this year, and open the facility in 2025.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   And with officials already drafting the tender for the bidding, Mak emphasised that the operator has to be financially independent.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The operator has to consider how it is going to operate the site. They have to be financially autonomous. The government won't invest anymore. The government might also consider charging for rent – I believe the plot of land won't be given for free. The operator has to consider how to manage their losses and gains."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   As for improving the transport network in the area, Mak said she hopes to tackle the issue with other departments.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Another monkey at the Hong Kong Zoological and Botanical Gardens has died, bringing the death toll to 12.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Leisure and Cultural Services Department said a De Brazza’s monkey that had been put under isolation died on Tuesday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A necropsy has been carried out to determine the cause of death.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It followed the deaths of 11 monkeys since the middle of the month, caused by sepsis after they caught melioidosis.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Officials said earlier workers had dug up the ground near the monkey enclosure and might have brought in contaminated soil on their shoes.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The government said the zoo's mammal section remains closed.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It also said the health conditions of 78 mammals and staff caring for the animals there are normal.

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The Travel Industry Council (TIC) on Tuesday announced a new programme to arrange in-depth tours for tourists at shopping malls during mega events in Hong Kong.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In collaboration with the hotel and retail sectors, the TIC has put 14 itineraries from six travel agencies on the China Mobile "MyLink" app targeting mainland visitors.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A bar-hopping tour in Tsim Sha Tsui during the Wine and Dine festival and a tour featuring Hong Kong's urban legends are among those on offer.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Fanny Yeung, the TIC's executive director, said the programme aims to leverage the city's mega events and encourage visitors to explore shopping malls.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Because right now a lot of individual travellers seldom visit shopping malls, and it didn't help us in our retail area. So we would like to include the retail part into this kind of in-depth tour to target this group of travellers," she said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Annie Yau Tse, chairwoman of the Retail Management Association, said five shopping malls will be covered, namely the IFC mall in Central, K11 Musea and THE ONE in Tsim Sha Tsui, Langham Place in Mong Kok, and the Temple Mall in Wong Tai Sin.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Tse said participants will receive gifts and discounts.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "After the pandemic, individual travellers come to Hong Kong for tourism experiences rather than shopping, so the current capacity is enough. [The new initiative] to bring group tourists to shopping malls is well within our capacity to accommodate," she said.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Police on Tuesday said they are investigating whether two men arrested in Tai Po for suspected burglary are connected to Sunday's break-in at the home of former police commissioner Andy Tsang.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Officers received a report at 10.30pm on Monday that a flat at the Wonderland Housing Estate was burgled, with three watches worth around HK$290,000 being stolen.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Two men, aged 31 and 36, were arrested on suspicion of burglary and attempted burglary, criminal damage and assaulting a police officer.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We found that the two suspects were hiding under a motorcycle cover outside a house in the village. When police identified themselves to the suspects, one of them tried to struggle and flee. He even pushed the police, causing the officer to suffer from a broken finger," said chief inspector Tam Tsz-wai.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Police said both suspects are two-way permit holders.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Tam added that the burgled flat is 1 kilometre away from Tsang's home, which was broken into on Sunday evening. A small amount of jewellery, watches and cash were stolen.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Cathay Pacific has announced that its employees will receive a bonus equivalent to one month's salary, after the flag carrier said it saw good results this year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Alex McGowan, Chief Operations and Service Delivery Officer on Tuesday said he felt the company has to find ways to keep the best people in the industry.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Moving forward, of course, we always want to keep our remuneration competitive so that we can attract and retain the best people. We're very pleased, I think, over the course of the last year to have seen our turnover rates, our attrition rates, particularly in our pilot community, to come down to levels that we haven't seen for decades, not even pre-pandemic," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "But pilot turnover is now at historic lows, and I hope that that's testimony to the fact that our pilots enjoy working for Cathay and the opportunities that working for Cathay provides."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The group had in August posted a net profit of HK$3.6 billion for the first half of the year, but that was down 15 percent compared with the same period in 2023. It recorded a 14 percent on-year rise in revenue to HK$49.6 billion for the same period.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   McGowan was speaking to reporters after the celebration ceremony for the order of up to 150 aircraft with Airbus, during which the group's CEO, Ronald Lam said the expansion and modernisation of the Cathay fleet come as Hong Kong International Airport prepares to open its three-runway system at the end of the year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "From 2026, we'll start to take delivery of the second order of our narrow-body passenger aircraft, which will consist of A321neo as well as A320neo into both the Cathay Pacific, as well as HK Express fleet," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Then from 2027, we'll start to take delivery of A350 freighter to expand our cargo fleet so that we can continue to strengthen Hong Kong's number one air cargo hub status. From 2028 onwards, we'll start to take delivery of A330 new aircraft, the new generation A330," Lam added.

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   MTR officials have warned that services on the Tung Chung Line are expected to be curtailed late on Saturday night, with no trains travelling between Tung Chung and Sunny Bay.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Free shuttle buses will be provided for people to travel between the two stations as major track diversion works take place as part of the Tung Chung Line extension in the two hours before the line's usual closure time.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The railway company said the last train from Tung Chung will depart at 11.01pm, while the last train going all the way to Tung Chung will leave Hong Kong Station at 11.07pm.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Trains from Hong Kong to Sunny Bay and vice-versa will run as usual.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The company’s chief of airport segment, Ben Lui, said services might also be affected on Sunday if there is any delay to the works.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “We have done a lot of preparation and planning, and our team will work closely together. Hopefully, we will have all the works completed before the next traffic day,” he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “We will try our best, and strive for the early completion of the works, without affecting train services on the next day.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   With a tropical cyclone expected to move closer to Hong Kong, the works may be postponed to the following Saturday if the weather is too bad, Lui said.

    Auctions for Lunar New Year fair stalls kick off

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Four fast food stalls at Victoria Park's annual Lunar New Year fair were auctioned off on Tuesday for a total of more than HK$600,000 with authorities saying the result reflected the current market sentiment.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Bidding for the stalls – one of which would have cost more than HK$500,000 before the Covid pandemic – saw two of the successful offers reaching the base price of HK$124,700. The amount for the most expensive stall reached HK$182,000, while the fourth stall was sold at HK$2,000 less than that amount.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department, which is in charge of the auction, said the prices reflected the current market situation.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The top bidder, surnamed Ng, said there were just a handful of bidders this time around, compared to more than a dozen in the preceding year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I will probably earn less of a profit compared to last year. But it's still worth a shot," he told reporters.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The bidding was less competitive because I know some fellow snack sellers are having a tough time making a living out there. So they didn't join the bidding."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A florist who successfully acquired a stall at the fair also thought the competition for flower stalls was not too fierce, because some sellers ended up with a lot of unsold stock last year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Auctions for other stalls, including those for dry goods, will be held in the next two days.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The fair will feature nearly 400 stalls at Victoria Park for a week starting from January 23.

   The observatory says it will issue the Standby Signal No 1 late on Thursday or early Friday, if Tropical Cyclone Trami follows its projected path and edges closer to Hong Kong.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "According to the present forecast, Trami to the east of the Philippines will intensify gradually and enter within 800 kilometres of Hong Kong," meteorologists said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Trami, which is Vietnamese for a type of Camellia, is expected to move west towards the vicinity of Hainan in the coming days.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The observatory said a higher typhoon warning signal could eventually be possible, depending on the storm's movement and wind conditions.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Forecasters also warned that the weather will deteriorate this weekend.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Under the combined effect of Trami and the northeast monsoon, it will be windy and become cloudy with a few showers over the coast of southern China later on Friday and over the weekend."

    'Lack of care led to sports association data breach'

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data (PCPD) on Tuesday accused the South China Athletic Association (SCAA) of having inadequate policies and a lack of care, after a data breach affecting more than 72,300 members.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   An attack by a hacker in March resulted in a breach of members’ personal information, including ID card numbers, passport details, phone numbers, photos and addresses.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The privacy watchdog said the SCAA accidentally exposed its servers to the internet, which the hacker took advantage of to infiltrate the network and launch the attacks.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The association was also accused of lacking a proper detection system for attacks. The watchdog said the attacker made over 20,000 attempts to log in to one of the servers for four hours, without being interrupted.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The PCPD said the same hacker had successfully installed malicious software on the sports organisation's system two years ago, although no data was stolen at the time.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Privacy Commissioner Ada Chung criticised the SCAA for failing to spot that attack until the data leak this year, saying it didn’t carry out regular checks or risk assessments
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “The association, as a long-established sports association holding a significant amount of personal data, should be vigilant about cybersecurity and data security. I am very disappointed that the association failed to implement effective information system security measures to safeguard members' personal data prior to the incident.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “I believe that if the association had deployed sufficient detection measures or alert tools back in 2022, there would have been a good chance of detecting the malicious activities at the early stage of the [March] hacking attack,” Chung said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The PCPD ruled that the SCAA violated the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance, and an enforcement notice was issued to the association to fix the issue.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In response, the SCAA said it acknowledged the investigation findings and will adhere to the PCPD’s enforcement notice.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It said it imposed a series of remedial measures after the incident in question, and pledged to prevent similar incidents from happening again.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Separately, the PCPD said it has observed a concerning rise in data breaches involving non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and schools.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The watchdog received 61 data breach notifications from schools and NGOs last year, an increase of about 1.5 times compared to 2022.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Chung said NGOs and schools often hold a lot of sensitive personal data, making them attractive targets for hackers.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   She urged them to stay vigilant against cyber attacks and bolster their data security resources.

    Kevin Yeung praised for 'swift' monkey deaths response

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday praised the Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism for his quick response over a spate of monkey deaths at Hong Kong's zoo, after two more of the apes died over the weekend.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The latest squirrel monkey deaths at the Hong Kong Zoological and Botanical Gardens takes the total number of fatalities to 11.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Speaking to reporters, Lee said Kevin Yeung did exactly what was expected of him.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "[In] the first instance, the problem was contained to stop it from spreading. Monitoring measures were put in place. Autopsy examinations and tests have been expedited. The result was instantly disseminated to the general public," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Authorities are still determining if the two monkeys that recently died were infected with melioidosis like the other nine.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Chief Executive's praise came after Yeung was seemingly put on notice last week, when Lee unveiled in the annex of his third Policy Address that he had 'instructed' the minister to complete the blueprint for the Arts and Culture and Creative Industries Development, which is behind schedule.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Yeung had told reporters he did not feel that he was being pressured, adding he will finish the blueprint soon.

    Govt KPIs helped HK climb in global rankings: CE

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday said key performance indicators (KPI) that he introduced after assuming office have helped Hong Kong climb in some international rankings.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Speaking to reporters before an Executive Council meeting, Lee noted that Hong Kong went up in a number of global assessments, including in one report published last month by think tanks based in Britain and Shenzhen, in which the SAR surpassed Singapore.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I'm glad to see that in almost two-and-a-half years' governance, and also the new measures that we've introduced, the position of Hong Kong as an international financial centre has increased one position, so we've come back to top three."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   When asked by reporters about officials not completing six of the 150 tasks Lee set out in last year's Policy Address, he explained that there were reasonable causes for the delays and that he is satisfied with the overall KPI results.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Indicators are means. Indicators are not themselves an end. We must see how these indicators will work for us," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Chief Executive also stressed that the people in general agree with the need for reform, which was the main theme of his policy blueprint last week.
