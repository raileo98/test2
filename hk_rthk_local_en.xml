  <div class="itemFullText">
   Worker representatives on Thursday met the labour secretary, who they said promised to take steps to stop the exploitation of migrant employees.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Mainland employees seeking work in Hong Kong under various labour importation schemes must apply through authorised agents, which reportedly charge them fees that can add up to tens of thousands of dollars.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Following a meeting with Secretary for Labour and Welfare Chris Sun, an employee representative on the Labour Advisory Board, Lam Wai-kong, said the minister had promised to take legal and administrative steps to tackle the issue.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “Actually the secretary didn’t specify what the legal and administrative steps would be. But from my own understanding,  the salary for the import workers should be based on the median salary of local workers. If they are not paid correctly that means the agents have broken the law,” he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “As for administrative steps, in the vetting process for individual labour import applications, I believe the Labour and Welfare Bureau has the ability to make changes to decide whether each case gets approved or not.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lam added that Sun had also agreed to review labour importation schemes sooner, instead of waiting every two years.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Meanwhile, another representative on the board, Jenny Tam, said they are also worried about the government’s plan to bring in 10,000 skilled workers aged 35 or under over the next three years.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “The secretary had cited the shortage of A-Grade electricians as an example. But we think there are actually enough workers in this field, with many holding licences. We are worried that importing more workers could affect local employment,” she said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Tam added that Sun responded by saying officials will be prudent and listen to different views.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Snooker superstar Ronnie O’Sullivan has become a Hong Kong resident through the Quality Migrant Admission Scheme, the Immigration Department said on social media on Thursday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The 48-year-old, known as the Rocket for his fast and attacking playing style, said he enjoyed his time in the SAR in the past and his sport is very popular in the city.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   O'Sullivan also said it’s a great place to live because of the food, culture and a low tax regime.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "My plan in Hong Kong is, obviously, here to do some work. But I love the food. I love to just, relax here in Hong Kong," he said in a video clip on Instagram.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Maybe I'm going to play some snooker, just see some friends maybe. It's just really nice to be back in Hong Kong again."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   O'Sullivan, currently ranked fifth in the world, won the Hong Kong Snooker Masters two years ago, saying at the time that he enjoyed the hiking trails in the city.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   His decision to obtain Hong Kong residency comes after a similar move last year by retired basketball star Stephon Marbury, whose playing career spanned over two decades in the National Basketball Association in the US and the Chinese Basketball Association.

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Researchers from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology on Thursday said they have developed a new AI medical model that answers questions like ChatGPT.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The chatbot is one of four new AI models unveiled by the university which can diagnose up to 30 types of cancers and diseases.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Professor Chen Hao, who led the project, said the "MedDr" model can generate reports and provide initial diagnoses based on medical images.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Users can send close-up images and the chatbot will then analyse what is wrong and offer treatment suggestions.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He said it can save a lot of time spent on doctor's appointments.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “We hope to actually see 30 to 40 percent [reduction in time]. Some doctors are very interested in using this in the waiting room, because the patients spend a lot of time in the waiting room but when they see a doctor it’s just actually a few minutes,” he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “We wanted to actually leverage this multimodal language model to let the patients ask the questions and then you have a summary and then doctors will quickly actually see the summary and understand the background of the patients.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Chen added that the university will work with local hospitals and consult more medical practitioners to ensure the tool's accuracy.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Up to 20 students per year are to be given scholarships to study postgraduate courses at the University of Cambridge, under an initiative launched by the world-renowned British institution and City University of Hong Kong (CityU).
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The funding, totalling HK$10 million per year, will enable the students to do a one-year, full-time master's programme at Lucy Cavendish College, one of the largest constituent colleges of Cambridge.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The aim is to have our students, graduates going for this course, to stay at Lucy Cavendish [College] and become a graduate for the world," said CityU president Freddy Boey on Thursday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "This programme does not require them to come back to Hong Kong, but I'm pretty sure, as graduate alumni of this special programme, they will do us proud anywhere in the world."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The programme, which will initially run for five years, will also accept applications from other students if the slots are not filled up by CityU graduates.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Madeleine Atkins, president of Lucy Cavendish College, said graduates of all disciplines are welcome, adding that Hong Kong students are "highly competitive candidates" for master's courses at Cambridge.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We take students from across all the master's programmes at Cambridge, because we believe that many of the problems in this world require interdisciplinary solutions. By living and learning together on this programme, students from different academic backgrounds do benefit from the experience of working closely on projects and teams with those from other disciplines," said Atkins.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   CityU has also partnered with the British college for the Future Global Leaders Programme, which equips students with skills to address pressing global issues.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Bar owners can expect Halloween to bring them at least a 10 percent boost in business, industry representatives said on Thursday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lan Kwai Fong Group chairman Allan Zeman said the build up to Halloween this year has been the best to date, with people heading out to celebrate since last Saturday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "This year especially, what the restaurants in Lan Kwai Fong are doing, one's doing a hell's wedding theme, with Halloween menus. Another one's got cult class zombie movies with a big banquet. Every restaurant's doing dress-up parties," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Zeman said he believes business will surge by 10 to 25 percent, adding that restaurants in the area are almost fully booked.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It's been packed. I think tonight will be very very busy, and I am not even sure it will go until tomorrow or even Sunday. But it's totally different. It's not a one-day holiday now, this year especially they started early... I was surprised, totally surprised along with everyone else."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Chin Chun-wing who chairs the Hong Kong Bar and Club Association said he is anticipating a minimum 10 percent growth in business over the next two nights.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Halloween isn't a thing on the mainland. Therefore we see a lot of mainlanders coming to Hong Kong to really experience the vibes, as well as take photos with revellers," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Many people put on Halloween make-up. You can see that this year, there were a lot more youths of around 20 years old, all of them put on heavy make-up to enjoy the festival."

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Wednesday spent a second day in Riyadh promoting business opportunities for Hong Kong in Saudi Arabia.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The financial chief is leading a delegation of more than 110 people on a three-day trip to the Saudi capital.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Following the morning listing ceremony for the first exchange-traded fund in Saudi Arabia that invests in Hong Kong stocks on the Saudi Exchange, Chan met with Chinese Ambassador to Saudi Arabia, Chang Hua, at noon.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Chan updated the ambassador on Hong Kong's economy while the pair talked about cooperation between China and Saudi Arabia.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The financial secretary then co-hosted a roundtable with the chairman of the Saudi Capital Market Authority, Mohammed bin Abdullah Elkuwaiz, in which representatives from regulatory bodies and various asset management firms gathered to discuss recent developments in financial markets.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Chan later met with the Governor of the Saudi Central Bank, Ayman Alsayari, and pair discussed strengthening ties in investment and financial markets between Hong Kong, Saudi Arabia and the Middle East, along with cooperation in digital finance.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In the evening, the Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks held an event featuring over 20 startups in fields like green tech and AI, hoping to connect with investors and business partners.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Chan will wrap up his visit today and is expected to arrive back in Hong Kong at around noon on Friday.

    'Give Choi Hung Estate residents more housing options'

  <img alt="The redeveloped Choi Hung Estate will be able to accommodate 9,200 households, up from the current 7,400.

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Lawmaker Bill Tang on Wednesday urged the government to offer more options to residents of Choi Hung Estate who need to be rehoused in the first phase of a massive redevelopment plan.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Authorities say 2,450 flats at the new Mei Tung Estate in Wong Tai Sin will be available to house the first batch of residents affected when construction starts in 2028, and they can also consider buying a Home Ownership Scheme flat.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But Tang, who represents the Kowloon East Constituency, says authorities should also allow affected residents to move into any empty flats available in other parts of Choi Hung Estate that will only be redeveloped in 2035 or later.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The residents who live in the first phase… they know they need to move out, but they really want to stay in Choi Hung. We suggest there should be diverse options for the phase one residents," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The lawmaker also noted that volunteers will need to be recruited to assist elderly families that will have to relocate.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Tang also expressed concerns that the current timetable for the entire redevelopment project spans two decades from 2028 to 2048, saying buildings will be so old by the end they may be unsafe.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The residents living in Choi Hung [Estate] must live with a construction site for over 20 years,” he said. “The first building will be removed and then rebuilt and from the first building to the last building, it will be over 20 years. That means the last building will be removed maybe at the age of 80 years old," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Choi Hung resident Tsang said while the current arrangements aren’t perfect, he’s planning to move to Mei Tung Estate.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I'm somewhat satisfied but transportation is not as convenient as Choi Hung. You have to walk quite a bit either to Lok Fu or Wong Tai Sin Station – but what can you do? It's better than nothing and we have a place to settle down," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Fellow resident Pang said he will be closing his small shop of 20 years in Choi Hung Estate soon.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It's hard to maintain a small shop in a public housing estate, especially with everyone shopping up north. The spending patterns have changed significantly and the ageing population is increasing," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A woman surnamed Fan meanwhile, said she hopes that authorities could maintain some key elements of Choi Hung Estate – famed for its rainbow colour scheme – as they bring good memories to many people.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Choi Hung Estate will be redeveloped in three phases, with the first batch of affected residents set to be relocated in about four years’ time, according to a paper submitted by housing authorities on Wednesday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The redevelopment plan’s timeline for the estate built in the 1960s and famous for its rainbow colour theme was unveiled in a paper submitted to the Wong Tai Sin District Council, in which the Housing Department said the first phase would involve three blocks – Pik Hoi House, Kam Pik House and Tan Fung House – as well as two vacant school sites.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The new Mei Tung Estate, which is expected to start taking in residents in 2028-29, will provide 2,450 units for the first phase of relocation, accommodating about one-third of the affected Choi Hung Estate residents," the paper said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   After the area in the first phase is cleared out, construction will begin immediately and it will be able to provide about 3,200 units to residents of four blocks affected by the second stage of redevelopment, expected to take place from 2035-36.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The area involved in the second phase will then be able to take care of the last batch of households. These residents will move into some 4,100 newly built units between 2042 and 2043.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The relocation process would take roughly 15 years, the department added, and by 2048, the last phase of the estate is expected to be redeveloped to offer 1,900 flats.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In total, the new Choi Hung Estate will be able to accommodate 9,200 households, up from the current 7,400.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Officials said the redevelopment would also provide an opportunity to improve traffic conditions at the Choi Hung Interchange.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “The Housing Authority has begun discussions with relevant departments to free up part of the Choi Hung Estate site to alleviate traffic congestion in the area,” the paper said.

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The University of Hong Kong on Wednesday said diabetes patients can lower the risk of getting colorectal and liver cancers, the second and fifth most common in the SAR, by controlling their blood glucose levels.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Faculty of Medicine conducted two territory-wide analyses using 17 years of Hospital Authority data involving 140,000 diabetes patients.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It found that by controlling blood glucose levels, such patients can lower the chances of getting colorectal cancer by 28 percent, and liver cancer by 30 percent.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Cancer cells, when they have a lot of sugar around them, they are able to grow faster. This is in essence the way which patients with diabetes, if it is poorly controlled, they will have an increase risk of both bowel cancer and liver cancer," explained the university's Dr Walter Seto, who led the project.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Speaking at a media briefing, Seto added that those with diabetes are twice as likely to get these cancers compared with healthy individuals.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Meanwhile, Dr Paul Lee, who specialises in endocrinology and diabetes, told RTHK that patients can improve their blood glucose levels through a good diet and more exercise.

    'Sports arbitration system to settle disputes quickly'

  <img alt="A veteran arbitrator says a new sports arbitration resolution mechanism will help resolve disputes such as the Messi no-show saga more quickly.

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   A legal expert on Wednesday said the government's plan to establish a new sports arbitration resolution mechanism will help resolve issues such as the Messi no-show saga more quickly and amicably.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Thousands of fans were left angry and disappointed after Argentinian superstar Lionel Messi sat out an Inter Miami football match in the SAR back in February, triggering complaints and calls for ticket refunds.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Nicholas Chan, who heads the AALCO Hong Kong Regional Arbitration Centre, said such situations could be eased with the new mechanism in place.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "In Hong Kong, we don't have class action for litigation. And even if we had class action, it's not cheap for thousands of ticket holders to launch a dispute," he told RTHK.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We could resolve everything quickly by mediation, if not by arbitration. So it saves all the parties the headache of having to try to find the proper forum for dispute, spend a lot of money on resolving disputes by going to courts or otherwise."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   International sports arbitration is dominated by Western countries, with the Court of Arbitration for Sport in Switzerland a prominent example.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "But the official working language is French, Spanish, or English. You don't really have much of a choice to use Chinese, Malay, Arabic, or other languages very common in the developing world. So it is not ideal to spend a lot of time and cost where it could be resolved more cost-effectively," Chan said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The plan is also seen as an opportunity for retired athletes to pursue a second career in sports mediation and arbitration, Chan added.

   The Development Bureau on Wednesday said about 5,600 people have visited an exhibition showcasing the first-ever dinosaur fossils found on home soil.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Writing on social media, it said the people who were trying to catch a glimpse of the bones displayed at the Heritage Discovery Centre at Kowloon Park included students and tourists.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It added that temporary studios and showrooms at the centre will open by the end of the year, and visitors would even be able to watch paleontologists prepare fossils.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The bureau also said that mainland and local experts are still carrying out excavation work on Port Island, where the fossils were found.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It pointed out that the team had to carry generators and excavation tools to the island, in the northeastern waters of the SAR, as there is no electricity supply.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Authorities added that apart from collaborating with mainland experts from the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology, they are also contacting local experts for future research and education endeavours.

    HK newborns to get mainland entry permits on the spot

  <div class="itemFullText">
   The mainland is set to issue one-off permits to allow Hong Kong newborns to travel there, according to DAB chairman Gary Chan.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Chan said on Wednesday that DAB lawmakers have received calls for help from parents saying they had hoped to travel across the border with their newborns, but applications for temporary mainland travel permits take at least five working days to process.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In a letter to Chan, national immigration officials said parents of Hong Kong-born babies "with urgent need to travel to the mainland" can get a one-off permit at Luohu, Huanggang, Shekou or Shenzhen airport.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Parents will be required to provide their newborn's identity document and birth certificate for the permit valid for one return trip between Hong Kong and the mainland within a three-month period.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "As long as the parents need a permit, they can bring the relevant documents to the four border crossings to apply for a document and collect it on the spot. It is more convenient and quicker than before, and can meet the needs of parents with newborns," Chan said, adding that he hoped the new arrangement could be extended to other border control points.

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The government on Wednesday said the number of domestic violence cases handled by social welfare officials has fallen in recent years, but there's been a rise in the number of children in need of protection.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In a written reply to lawmakers, welfare minister Chris Sun said that overall, domestic violence cases dropped by 13.5 percent from 2019 figures, to nearly 3,400 last year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But child protection cases rose by 45 percent in the same period, to more than 1,450.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   These cases were referred to the Social Welfare Department for follow-up action after reports were filed to the police.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sun said for cases considered to be high risk by police officers, the department makes a crisis intervention and provides a wide range of support, including psychological help, as well as centres for family crisis support, refuges and residential and daily child care.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He added that some people who refuse help are given a card with the details of other places they can seek assistance.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   There are promotional campaigns from the department and the police encouraging people to seek help early and avoid resorting to violence, the minister said.

    New offence planned to tackle abandoned cars

  <img alt="The government says current legislation lets owners abandon unwanted vehicles on roads and in public spaces. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1776816_1_20241030120311.jpg&q=75" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Transport officials say they have come up with a way to help stop people dumping cars they no longer want in alleys and at the side of roads, by plugging a loophole that lets owners off the hook if they stop renewing a vehicle's licence.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   At present, a vehicle's registration is automatically cancelled if it hasn't had a valid licence for two years. The person whose name the vehicle is registered under can then no longer be held liable for anything related to it.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Some irresponsible owners take advantage of this arrangement and abandon their unwanted vehicles on public roads and public back alleys, causing environmental hygiene and congestion issues," the Transport and Logistics Bureau says in a paper to Legco.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   To address the matter, the bureau is proposing an amendment to road traffic regulations which would scrap the automatic cancelling of a vehicle's registration and instead enable officials to send owners a notice after two years, giving them three months to either renew their licence or take action to de-register the vehicle themselves.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Options for de-registration include having the vehicle scrapped, or shipping it out of Hong Kong.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The bureau is proposing fines of up to HK$10,000 and prison terms of up to three months for people who ignore the notices, with a subsequent conviction for the same offence leading to fines of up to HK$25,000 and jail terms as long as six months.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   If the fines go unpaid, the authorities would refuse to issue or renew the offender's driving licence or to license any vehicle in their name.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The bureau said a commencement date for the proposed new offence is expected to be fixed by notice in the Gazette in the fourth quarter of next year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Wesley Wan, honorary life president of the Hong Kong Automobile Association, told RTHK he welcomes the proposed changes, saying they could put a stop to vehicles being dumped.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "They will impose a penalty which is more expensive than scrapping the car. So I think that's a good way to avoid people abandoning a car after the licence expires," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lawmaker Gary Zhang said he thinks there should be exemptions in some cases.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "If a situation doesn't really involve illegal abandonment, for example, some car owners may simply not renew their registration due to personal reasons, or they don't plan to drive any more, or just park in their garage, I think the government shouldn't interfere too much," he said.

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   There's growing interest for jurisdictions to conduct trade in their own currency, Financial Secretary Paul Chan said on Wednesday, adding that a multi-central bank digital currency platform is "worth pushing forward".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   At the annual Future Investment Initiative summit in Saudi Arabia, Chan said Hong Kong has been involved in the mBridge project, a platform supporting cross-border payments and foreign exchange transactions using central bank digital currencies and distributed ledger technology.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "A lot of jurisdictions want to trade in their own currency. So the challenge is how to create a system to take care of that," Chan said in Riyadh.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Say, for example, Hong Kong, along with Saudi Arabia and a few other jurisdictions, we have an mBridge project facilitating trade settlements. I mean trading transactions denominated in their own local currency. And through digitalisation this can be settled by using their own currency. And this is gaining increasing confidence and increasing interest."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   During the summit, Chan witnessed the signing of a strategic cooperation agreement between Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks and Beta Lab, a startup incubator in Saudi Arabia.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The financial chief is leading a 100-strong delegation to the Saudi capital for three days, after taking the first direct passenger flight between the SAR and Riyadh since 2017.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We're meeting with business, finance and technology companies, with investors and government leaders, too. Our goal is clear: To expand ties with Saudi Arabia, building friendship and exploring the many mutually beneficial collaboration opportunities this renewed connection will surely create," Chan told a cocktail reception.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He also said the resumption of flights between the two cities "underlines the strategic importance" of Saudi Arabia's location "at the crossroad between three continents", while boosting ties between Beijing and Riyadh.

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Police on Tuesday said they had arrested a man on suspicion of murder after a 25-year-old woman's body was found in a shallow beach at the bottom of Waterfall Bay in Aberdeen.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The male suspect's wife was also arrested for allegedly aiding an offender.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The force said it had received a report at around 7:30am on Monday. Emergency personnel rushed to the scene, but the woman was pronounced dead on site.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Speaking at a press briefing, superintendent Sin Kwok-ming said the victim was a domestic helper from Southeast Asia.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   She had injuries on the back of the head and forehead, but an autopsy will determine her exact cause of death.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Initial evidence suggested the woman arrived at the scene with the male suspect in a taxi late on Sunday night.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The man then left alone about 30 to 40 minutes later, before heading to the mainland with his wife.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Police eventually locked down their identities and arrested them when they returned to the city on Tuesday afternoon.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sin also explained why the case wasn't classified as a murder at the beginning.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The arrested man's actions raise a lot of questions, like why the police weren't called right away and why he left Hong Kong immediately afterwards," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Some evidence has also gone missing for no good reason. All these factors lead us to believe that the woman's death wasn't due to natural reasons."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sin added the victim had known the man for some time, but was not employed by the suspect, a foreign national holding a Hong Kong identity card.

  <img alt="Director of Broadcasting Eddie Cheung told a Legislative Council panel that RTHK has 3.8 million daily real-time streams and 500,000 daily visits to its website. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1776736_1_20241029204047.jpg&q=85" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Efforts by Radio Television Hong Kong to promote its programmes are starting to bear fruit, Director of Broadcasting Eddie Cheung said on Tuesday as he noted a gradual shift in the way people receive their content.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   At a Legislative Council panel meeting, several legislators raised concerns about the public broadcaster's performance.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Michael Luk of the Federation of Trade Unions praised the quality of RTHK programmes in recent years, but felt the organisation could do more to expand its reach.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Of course we understand RTHK is not a commercial radio or television station. But when it comes to delivering messages to a mass audience, it cannot be too nonchalant towards viewership and listenership," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In response, Cheung said RTHK has already launched a promotional campaign, citing both outdoor and online advertisements which he said were effective.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Giving the Paris Olympics and Paralympics as examples, he revealed the hit rates and viewership of RTHK's streaming platforms doubled during that period.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Cheung noticed a fundamental change in the media consumption pattern, saying many people are no longer glued to their TV sets, and instead rely on mobile devices for information.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "On the RTHK website, every day we're seeing 3.8 million real-time streams, while our programmes are played 620,000 times and the website is accessed 500,000 times. We also record about 1.5 million daily views at our news website," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The figures, he believed, are proof the broadcaster's programmes can arouse interest among the Hong Kong audience.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Meanwhile, Liberal Party’s Peter Shiu suggested RTHK team up with schools to produce content which educate students on national policies.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development Algernon Yau pledged to take his recommendation into account.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "RTHK has a strong focus on national education for youth and promoting Chinese culture. We will do more and consider lawmakers' ideas for raising national awareness and education," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Yau added RTHK will spare no effort to promote and broadcast the 15th National Games, scheduled for November next year. Hong Kong will host eight competitive events, including track cycling, fencing and golf.

    Smart food waste bins to debut in Tai Hang

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   A project that encourages residents to recycle their food waste will soon kick off in Tai Hang, with organisers setting up smart bins in the neighbourhood with an expected reach of up to 1,000 households.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sponsored by the government’s Environment and Conservation Fund, the initiative will focus on 40 older single-block buildings and so called three-nil buildings – blocks that lack a residents’ organisation, owners corporation or property management – in the area.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The five bins, sporting a purple colour scheme, will be set up in Tai Hang from November and will serve the community there until September.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   They also have features such as fill-level detection and auto-deodorisation.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The New People's Party’s Jeff Wong, who is helping to coordinate the project, said organisers will also set up a street station there to collect food waste twice a week.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “We are aiming for 700 to 1,000 households to use our scheme or use our recycling system,” he said after attending the scheme’s opening ceremony on Tuesday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “Later on, we will organise a lot of activities and events such as talks or workshops to educate the residents to use our recycling system,” he added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   As part of a pilot scheme last December, authorities installed smart food waste recycling bins at a number of private housing estates that were chosen through an application process.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday expressed the hope that the Hong Chi Association will review the operations of its care homes, after a former staff member was charged for the alleged sexual assault of two intellectually impaired residents at its Tai Po facility.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lee described the incident – which Hong Chi said took place in August and saw the 38-year-old suspect sacked – as despicable, saying police should investigate the matter thoroughly.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Chief Executive noted that an independent review committee formed by the association should file a report over the matter as soon as possible to ensure that the interest of residents came first.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “I hope the committee will look at the home’s overall operation, including the services it provides to residents, as well as effective management and supervision systems,” he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “There should be a comprehensive system for training, discipline and supervision of its staff. They must put the interests of the residents first."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lee also said he thinks the Social Welfare Department did the right thing by cutting short the licence review period for the Tai Po home from three years to one.

    RainLily sees rise in reports of sexual offences

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Rape crisis centre RainLily on Tuesday urged officials to reform laws on sexual offences and improve the city’s sex education.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   RainLily said the number of cases reported to the centre nearly doubled from just over 1,000 in 2009-2013 to almost 2,000 in 2019-2023.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It also found a significant delay in help-seeking, with people waiting an average of around four years before asking the group for assistance in the past five years.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Doris Chong, the centre’s executive director, said it’s not easy for people to seek help.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “For example, they don't know how to seek help or where to seek help. Also, they don't know how to tell the incidents to others because they always think that it's a shame incident,” she said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The group also said many cases never get to court because complainants do not feel protected enough.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Albert Yau, a senior research officer with RainLily, stressed the need for a more supportive environment to encourage victims to speak up.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “There may be a lot of stigma attached to such incidents. So I think in order to encourage the victims to seek help promptly, we have to create a more friendly environment to tell them that you will be supported by us,” he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The centre wants the government to define “consent” more clearly in the law and to expand the scope of rape offences to better protect victims.

    US ban on China tech investment will harm all: CE

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday hit out at the US government for finalising plans to ban American investments in AI and other advanced technology sectors in China, including Hong Kong and Macau.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The US Treasury Department said overnight that a ban on investments in semiconductors, microelectronics and quantum information technologies will come into effect in January, citing national security concerns.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Speaking before the weekly Executive Council meeting, Lee said the Biden administration's move will be a two-edged sword, harming the interests of both China and the US.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It once again shows that American politicians seek their own political interests, undermining normal investment and trade, the free market and economic order. This will harm the global supply chain," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "This harms the interests of others, as well as that of the US as a nation, its people and its companies. They will reap what they sow.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The SAR government will defend its own interests and the interests of Hong Kong companies. We will also work with the country to protect national interests."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In a statement issued on Tuesday afternoon, the SAR government said it strongly opposes the proposed ban.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A spokesperson noted that in the past decade, the US had enjoyed a trade surplus of US$271.5 billion with Hong Kong, the largest among its global trading partners, and the surplus would suffer because of Washington's move.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Meanwhile, the chief executive said he will lead a delegation to Shanghai next Monday to attend the opening of the China International Import Expo, which will also host a dedicated session promoting investment in Hong Kong.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lee said more than 300 Hong Kong companies will take part in the expo, making up of around a tenth of the total participating firms, adding that SAR officials will sign pacts with their Shanghai counterparts on several key projects.

   Government data on Tuesday showed that home prices dropped last month to their lowest level since August 2016.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Private residential prices in September were down 1.67 percent month-on-month and 12.5 percent year-on-year, according to the Rating and Valuation Department.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Rents, meanwhile, rose for the seventh consecutive month to reach a five-year high.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Eddie Kwok from CBRE Hong Kong said measures announced in the recent Policy Address, such as an adjustment to the maximum loan-to-value ratio for mortgages, helped stabilise prices in the past two weeks.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Kwok said prices are likely to bottom out soon.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Yield-seeking investors may be a demand driver entering the residential market as residential prices reached a relatively low level, coupled with expected lower financing costs going forward," he said in a statement.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Kwok said that rents, which were 5.8 percent higher in September year-on-year, are likely to continue to rise, but should moderate in the short term now that students from overseas have already moved into their new homes for the academic year.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday said authorities will make use of the first discovery of dinosaur fossils in Hong Kong to attract more visitors, with officials planning to develop Port Island, where the bones were found, into a tourist attraction.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Officials believe that more of these fossils might be found on the island in the northeastern waters of the SAR.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Speaking to reporters before the Executive Council meeting, Lee said excavation work is ongoing on Port Island, which has geological features he described as “spectacular”.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The discovery on Port Island is in the area of our Geopark... we actually have a very famous and spectacular spot, which is the volcanic hexagonal rock columns. And that is, I think, one of the strongest attractions for people who are interested in natural resources, natural heritage, and also enjoying the nature," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We will be making use of this opportunity to develop some special tourist lines so that they can look at, first of all, the volcanic hexagonal rock columns, as well as all the other attractions of our Geopark, and including some exhibitions of the dinosaur fossils."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lee also said authorities will make use of the Hong Kong Heritage Discovery Centre in Kowloon Park for workshops and exhibitions, and set up long-term displays for people to learn about paleontology.

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   A sports figure has welcomed the Justice Department's plan to set up a pilot scheme for a sports dispute resolution system.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The idea was first unveiled in the recent Policy Address and comes amid a rise in the complexity of sports disputes.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Ronnie Wong, who chairs the Hong Kong China Swimming Association, said the move could save clubs time and money.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But he said the arbitrators should meet certain criteria.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "First, they shouldn't have any conflict of interest with the cases that they're dealing with. Second, they must have experience in handling disputes related to the particular sports involved," Wong said on a Commercial Radio programme.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It would be better if it's something that they've done in the past, and they understand the sports."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Wong said his association would be open to joining the pilot scheme.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Hong Kong Law Society president Roden Tong suggested on the same programme that the arbitration be carried out online, adding that the fees "wouldn't be a problem" for those involved.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Basically the costs are very low, to the point that some [people] don't even charge a fee. For simple disputes, for example, some athletes may be very busy, or some associations don't have the time to come out and meet the parties involved," he said.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday said the authorities will continue to hold test events at the new Kai Tak Sports Park.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Speaking ahead of the weekly Executive Council meeting, Lee said officials will learn from the experience of the first test run at the park last Sunday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He said a second test event will be held at the Youth Sports Ground in mid-November, with a trial planned in the main 50,000-seat stadium in January.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The challenge of course is the dispersal of crowds after an event which will comprise of 50,000 spectators. That is a challenge we must take up boldly," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "That is also why I have been demanding different levels of drills, so as to test different elements of operational procedures, different areas of risks, and also to learn about the experiences of those who may eventually become the final spectators of the 50,000 audience."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lee added that the government will draw up various contingency plans, including on how to deal with unstable weather and emergencies.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The park is due to officially open in the first quarter of next year.

    No such thing as time limit for prosecution: officials

  <img alt="Secretary for Justice Paul Lam says setting a time limit for prosecution is inconsistent with the principle of the rule of law. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1776594_1_20241028210802.jpg&q=75" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Some 6,000 people arrested but not charged during the 2019 protests could live normally, Secretary for Justice Paul Lam has stressed, while dismissing suggestions on setting a time limit for prosecution.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In newspaper interviews published on Monday, Lam said individuals under investigation for their acts during the social unrest were not bound by any restrictions, and could exercise their freedoms like anyone else.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The justice chief shot down calls to stop pursuing suspects after a certain period of time, clarifying there's no time limit on prosecution for "serious criminal cases".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Setting a deadline, he added, would be "inconsistent" with the principle of the rule of law.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Our decision to prosecute is based on existing evidence. But there were instances in the past...where there could be changes in circumstances or the emergence of new evidence in the future that's unknown to us, which might make it necessary to re-examine the prosecution decision," Lam explained.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   His views were echoed by security minister Chris Tang, who was asked the same topic in a media interview on Monday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Dropping prosecution after a certain period of time, he said, was like "making things that are illegal lawful".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Unless the law stipulates a time limit, we will initiate prosecution when there's evidence," Tang said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The former police chief denied it was unfair to keep arrested individuals waiting for years.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It would only be wrong, he said, if law enforcement agencies have sufficient evidence but choose not to prosecute swiftly.

    HKO seeks HK$55m for new radar system

File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1776578_1_20241028175838.jpg&q=85" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The Hong Kong Observatory (HKO) is hoping to set up a new radar system to better monitor and predict severe weather across the city.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The "phased array weather radar system" would provide detailed weather images that update quickly, helping to detect fast-changing weather conditions.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Environment and Ecology Bureau is seeking funding approval from Legco for HK$55 million to buy three sets of the radars.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   At a Legco panel meeting on Monday, Environment Secretary Tse Chin-wan said the system would benefit the development of a low-altitude economy.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Weather of course is important when it comes to low-altitude flying. This radar system could detect weather changes up to a few hundred metres above ground, So the weather radar system will help to enhance the safety of low-altitude vehicles and devices," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Together with an existing one in Sha Lo Wan, the proposed new radars in Cheung Chau, Lau Fau Shan and Tung Lung Chau would cover the whole territory.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Asked how to monitor "ionospheric scintillation" which affects drones, HKO's assistant director Chan Sai-tick said the observatory is using space weather data from the mainland and other countries and looking for ways to track ionosphere changes.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Chan added that the new radars offer higher resolution and faster updates, allowing more accurate predictions of severe weather such as hail and tornadoes.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Cathay Pacific on Monday relaunched direct passenger flights between Hong Kong and Saudi Arabia’s capital, Riyadh, with Financial Secretary Paul Chan taking the first flight servicing the two cities since the route was suspended in 2017.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The flag carrier will operate three flights per week, as authorities push for more cooperation with Middle East countries.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Chan who was aboard flight CX647 is leading a delegation of over 100 representatives from the financial and innovation and technology sectors to Riyadh.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “This symbolises a more frequent and direct people-to-people flow and also trade and cargo flow between the two regions. Cathay Pacific will be increasing its services to this region,” he said before boarding.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “[We are] opening up new markets, attracting new sources of capital, new sources of investment. This is an important move.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Cathay’s chief customer and commercial officer, Lavinia Lau, said the carrier’s aim was to reach 100 worldwide destinations by next year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   She said Cathay received a good response from travellers on the resumption of direct flights to Riyadh.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “The booking is pretty promising, at least for the first few flights… but going forward, we are also seeing a variety of travellers on our flights,” Lau said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “Some of them originating from Hong Kong, a lot actually coming back from the other side, Saudi Arabia, to Hong Kong to visit, or going via Hong Kong to places like Japan to visit. We also see good traffic flows from Southeast Asia, via Hong Kong to Riyadh.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Another passenger on the flight to Riyadh was Nelson. The startup worker said flying direct was much more convenient.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “Last time, I think we had to change from Qatar, so this is really convenient for us. It’s a direct flight. The difference is, first of all, time, and also it’s more convenient for business,” he told RTHK.

    Fast payments to mainland banks possible in 2025: HKMA

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The Monetary Authority on Monday said that locals will soon be able to transfer small amounts of money to mainland accounts through a scheme similar to the Faster Payment System (FPS).
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Its chief executive Eddie Yue said officials are working with their mainland counterparts on the details, and a trial scheme could kick off in the middle of next year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   On the sidelines of the Hong Kong Fintech Week, Yue told reporters that cross-border transfers could be done around the clock and could be made to an account that is linked with a mainland phone number, much like how FPS operates.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Separately, the Securities and Futures Commission said it will consult the trade early next year in creating the roadmap for a new regulatory regime for virtual asset trading platforms.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Currently, three such licences have been approved, with the commission saying it is processing more applications.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The SFC’s intermediaries executive director, Eric Yip, said all licensees will be invited to take part in the consultative panel.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We expect the panel deliberation will result in a comprehensive virtual assets white paper that outlines the development roadmap for products and services, as well as potential enhancement in compliance and risk management," he said in his speech at Fintech Week.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Next is our work to piece the rest of the regulatory regime puzzle. To establish a comprehensive framework for virtual assets, we should make reference to how trading, settlement, and custody work in the traditional securities market."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Yip added that the commission will step up investor education regarding virtual assets, as well as its monitoring of suspicious platforms and alerting investors of potential harm.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   A newly approved hostel project for young Hongkongers has started taking applications, with the first batch of tenants expected to move in as early as December.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Last week, the government gave the green light for the Regal Oriental Hotel in Kowloon City to be partially converted into a youth hostel named “YOT Hub”.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Non-governmental organisation Yan Oi Tong will take ownership of 80 rooms, accommodating up to 160 adults under 30.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Hostel tenants will be asked to take part in 200 hours of activities each year, such as training courses and trips to other parts of the Greater Bay Area.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Henry Cheng, who chairs the organisation’s board of directors, said on Monday that tenants can choose what activities to join.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “The goal to organise these activities is to broaden their horizon and for their personal development,” he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “National education is just one of them. We are looking to take them to the Greater Bay Area, to different enterprises, to let them know how the country has changed, as China has grown quite substantially for the last 10 years.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Employed individuals who meet the income and asset requirements can make single-person applications to be matched with a roommate, or apply as a pair for the same unit.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The total monthly rent of a room ranges from HK$9,000 to HK$9,300.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   As of 4pm on Monday, the project had received about 110 applications, according to the charitable organisation.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The youth hostel will initially run for three years, with tenants signing a two-year contract.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Former Cyberport CEO Peter Yan has been appointed as Director-General of the Office for Attracting Strategic Enterprises (OASES).
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The government made the announcement on Monday following an open recruitment exercise.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Unveiled in the 2022 Policy Address, OASES aims to attract high-potential and representative enterprises to Hong Kong from industries including fintech, AI and data science.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Yan will assume office on Tuesday and has left his role as a member of the board of directors of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEX).
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He has worked in the technology field for over 39 years and held various senior management positions in large consulting and information technology services companies.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Financial Secretary Paul Chan said in a statement that Yan has rich experience and extensive knowledge in the field of information technology.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I am confident that Mr Yan will lead OASES in attracting more strategic enterprises to Hong Kong, thereby contributing to the city's innovation and technology development as well as its economic upgrading and transformation," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Meanwhile, Herbert Chia has taken the spot on the HKEX board vacated by Yan.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Chia is chairman of the data governance advisory committee of Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks Corporation and a venture partner of Sequoia Capital China.

    S Korea's Tom Kim sets sights on HK Open prize

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   South Korean phenom Tom Kim on Monday said he is feeling confident ahead of his return to the Link Hong Kong Open in November, for the first time since 2020.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Kim was speaking to reporters on the heels of a nail-biting defeat to compatriot An Byeong-hun at the 2024 Genesis Championship in Incheon on Sunday, a loss which he is hoping to use as motivation for the SAR tournament.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Link Hong Kong Open, which will be staged for a 63rd time at the Hong Kong Golf Club in Fanling from November 21 to 24, is set to feature a star lineup with the likes of Englishman Justin Rose, who won in 2015.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I'm not thinking too much ahead of myself. I think that's the biggest thing," said the world number 25 – who last year became the youngest golfer since Tiger Woods to land three PGA Tour titles.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Golf is golf – anything can happen. Just because you're the highest-ranked player in the world, it doesn't always mean you're going to get the win."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But the 22-year-old, who already has two Asian Tour titles to his name, said he remains unfazed by the pressure, as he begins training to improve on his previous showing in the SAR when he finished 18th.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Seoul-born athlete also shared how looking past the burden of growing expectations has helped him navigate the many challenges of his golf career.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Looking at my career from the very beginning, I've always had steps that I've grown into," Kim said. "And over the past year, there've been times where I've felt stuck."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "So long as I take these hits and learn from them, I can be humble and grateful for when good moments do come," he added.

    Govt announces AI policy statement for finance market

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The government delivered a policy statement on Monday on the responsible use of artificial intelligence (AI) in the finance market, saying it is addressing challenges the technology brings and encouraging its development.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In the statement, the administration said it is both open and prudent towards the application of AI, while saying it wants the sector to use it in a responsible manner, noting issues such as cybersecurity and intellectual property rights.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Financial Secretary Paul Chan said officials will closely monitor market developments and draw on experiences on the mainland and overseas.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He said the government will promote the use of AI in finance to accelerate the development of new quality productive forces tailored to Hong Kong's conditions.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We consider it appropriate to adopt a dual-track model to AI. We will continue to encourage the adoption of AI to capture opportunities, while assessing its associated risks from time to time and mitigate them," the minister said during a speech at Hong Kong Fintech Week.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury Christopher Hui said the University of Science and Technology will allow financial firms to use its AI language model, called InvestLM.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "[The university is] going to make their model available for use, not just for the big firms, but also the small firms in the financial services sector, including accounting and others, in such a way that they can try for themselves how AI can improve their work processes," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Hui added that around 38 percent of institutions in the local financial sector use AI, about 12 percentage points higher than the global average.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In the policy statement, the government added that it thinks the use of AI in finance is data-driven and dynamic, yet also double-edged in that it has both potential and risks. It said AI is a tool and shouldn't replace human judgement and analysis.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Financial institutions should formulate an AI governance strategy to provide direction on how AI systems should be implemented and used. A risk-based approach should be adopted in the procurement, use and management of AI systems and human oversight will be crucial to mitigating the potential risks," it said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The government said risks posed by the technology have been suitably reflected in relevant regulations and guidelines issued by financial regulators.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Officials also said the police have been exchanging intelligence with their overseas counterparts and the AI industry to address the cyber policing challenges posed by AI.

    'More considered discussion on student suicide needed'

  <img alt="A concern group says there should be more considered discussion of student suicides following a backlash over a scholar's remarks on the issue. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1776522_1_20241028115226.jpg&q=85" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   A concern group on Monday called for more considered and respectful discussion of student suicides, after a scholar's remarks on the issue sparked a backlash.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It came after Professor Ricky Tse, who is with the Life Education Centre of Hong Kong Nang Yan College of Higher Education, said students wouldn't kill themselves if they thought more about social responsibility and parental expectations.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Tse also suggested life education such as watching chicks hatch would prevent students from "doing anything stupid".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Speaking on a radio programme, Heather Yeung from the Hong Kong Student Alliance on Student Suicide, said blaming the students was not helpful.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Pointing the finger at students for their 'wrong values' is not good. The reasons for student suicide are complex and can't be explained by just one cause," she said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We should not attribute suicidal behaviour solely to students' personal values, because it overlooks the influence of other factors."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Paul Yip, head of the Centre for Suicide Research and Prevention at the University of Hong Kong, told the same programme that student suicides should be addressed carefully.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He said terms like "doing stupid things" - commonly used in Chinese to refer to taking one's life - should be avoided because they can be interpreted as blame or dismissal.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The World Health Organisation has said we should not stigmatise suicide. So I always encourage young people: 'It's okay not to be okay.' As long as you're willing to take a step forward and seek help, the help is available," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   RTHK has reached out to Professor Tse for a response.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   The Hong Kong Tourism Board on Monday hailed the success of the Wine and Dine Festival, saying the event recorded 10 percent more visitors compared with the previous year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The board said the five-day festival welcomed about 155,000 locals and tourists, including those from the mainland, the United States, Australia, Japan and Southeast Asia.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Hong Kong also welcomed three international cruise liners as the festival was held, with passengers checking out the more than 300 booths featuring fine cuisine and drinks from around the world.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The board, meanwhile, said the celebration is not over as it holds its Taste Around Town campaign with 400 restaurants and bars offering extensive deals until the end of November.

    Twenty more trial events set for Kai Tak Sports Park

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Officials said about 20 more test events will be held before the Kai Tak Sports Park officially opens next year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A local football league match which concluded at the Kai Tak Youth Sports Ground on Sunday was the first of a series of test events.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Over 1,500 spectators turned up in the end, 50 percent more than the original estimate.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The game, featuring Second Division sides Sai Kung and Wong Tai Sin, ended in a 2-2 draw.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Chief Secretary Eric Chan said the overall arrangements were smooth, with most people making use of the MTR to arrive and leave the venue.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The first batch of spectators were able to exit the stadium within six to seven minutes, reaching Sung Wong Toi station another few minutes later, he added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The ultimate goal, officials said, is to host a test event with a full crowd of 50,000 people at the main stadium. The first such event at the core hub is scheduled for January next year, with about 10,000 spectators.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We start from a small scale, but gradually, we will arrange around 20 trial events, and then by that time, we will increase the number of people to up to 50,000," Chan explained.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We are confident that with all these arrangements, all these preparations... we [would have] sufficiently tried everything before it officially opens."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sports and culture minister Kevin Yeung said more transportation methods would be provided in the future.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We hope people can mainly make use of the MTR, the mass transit system, when they leave the venue. But for test events which include more people, we will also arrange bus services, or special bus routes," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Yeung added that questionnaires were distributed to attendees on Sunday, and their comments will be analysed to identity areas of improvement.

   Police said on Sunday that a system which can analyse real-time foot traffic will be put to use for the first time at Lan Kwai Fong on Halloween, when revellers are expected to swarm the area to celebrate the festival.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Around 25,000 people are estimated to turn up in the nightlife district on Thursday, similar to last year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Traffic arrangements will be implemented in phases from 2pm. Most roads in the vicinity will be closed to vehicles at night, and party-goers can only enter the area through D'Aguilar Street and exit from Wyndham Street.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Acting Superintendent Fung Chung-pang said CCTV signals will be streamed directly to police's command centre.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The CCTVs will provide real-time footage from various angles, allowing officers to understand the situation live.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The force will also make use of a people-counting system to work out the crowd density at the scene through visual analysis. This will allow us to identify underlying safety risks, and to implement crowd management measures should they be needed," Fung said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Officers said a total of 50 sets of CCTVs have been installed in the area, as well as a public broadcast system to alert citizens in case of emergencies.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Taxi ambassadors will also roam the area to assist revellers to hail a cab home.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Police also warned anyone planning to dress up for the night not to carry any imitation firearm or offensive weapons to avoid falling foul of the law.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   They added that artificial intelligence technology may be used in the future to identify accidents or events at which police assistance is needed.

    Smooth sailing as football match goes ahead in Kai Tak

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   A local football league match on Sunday kicked off a series of test events at the Kai Tak Sports Park before it officially opens in the first quarter of next year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Authorities expected 1,000 spectators streamed into the Kai Tak Youth Sports Ground for a Second Division League fixture between Sai Kung and Wong Tai Sin. Around 1,500 turned up in the end.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   One of them was Stephen, an engineer who has worked on the Kai Tak project since five years ago.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Pretty much a bit of professional pride, and proud of what we've built for Hong Kong," he told RTHK.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "[It's] almost there. We're quite excited because it's been five years, and like any other construction projects, it's had its ups and downs. And now we can see it’s almost open."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Another spectator Ivy, who walked from Kowloon City to the stadium, said security was quite strict at the door.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But she was happy to attend the match and support her friend, who’s playing on one of the teams.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "[It's] really exciting. It's huge… My friend is playing football here," she said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Spectators were encouraged to get to the sports ground from Sung Wong Toi - instead of Kai Tak - MTR station.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The MTR Corporation said it had implemented special arrangements at both stations. Plenty of signs were put up pointing passengers to the stadium.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sports minister Kevin Yeung and sports commissioner George Tsoi were both spotted at the stadium.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Also in attendance was security chief Chris Tang, who was happy with what he saw so far before the match.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Everything is smooth. When people depart [from] the MTR, there’s sufficient announcements, as well as notice direction showing how they come here," he told RTHK.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We have adopted a phased approach, so at different stages, we have different [arrangements]. On this occasion, apart from making sure that it’s safe, it's also training to our frontline officers, so that's the reason why we are bringing extra officers to come here to make themselves familiar with the environment."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Another event has been scheduled at the Youth Sports Ground in mid-November, as Hong Kong Men's Rugby Team host Brazil for a two-match international series.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The second match will be played in Kai Tak, with an estimated attendance of 3,000 people.

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   A concern group on Sunday said residents of subdivided flats may be left homeless as the government proposed plans to put an end to inadequate housing.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The chief executive announced plans in the Policy Address to eradicate substandard subdivided units.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A future legislation will mandate the registration of such dwellings as "basic housing units". Each must be no less than eight square metres, or 86 square feet, in size, and fitted with an individual toilet and at least one window.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Units which fail to meet the set of standards will be outlawed. That could be a headache for tenants, who have to relocate elsewhere.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Sham Shui Po Housing Concern Mothers' Group surveyed about 70 residents of subdivided flats following the announcement of the proposal.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   About eight in 10 respondents said they wished to be directly allocated a public flat, instead of moving to temporary solutions such as light public housing, or transitional homes.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   One of them was Amber, who was worried her landlord would evict them in the future because the unit had to be renovated in order to comply with the rules.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The mother of two added possible rehousing plans by the authorities may not be suitable.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Even if they offer us a light public housing flat or transitional housing, I won't consider. The location is far. I'm not familiar with the new environment, and I don't want my children to transfer to another school," she explained.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Another group member, Lily, feared paying higher rent since there's a minimum size for future units.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We hope they can build more public housing flats quickly. Some of us have waited for eight to 10 years," she appealed to the government.

  <img alt="Two special polling stations were set up in Sheung Shui to facilitate Hongkongers returning from the mainland to vote in the 2023 District Council election. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1776411_1_20241027114458.jpg&q=65" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Constitutional and mainland affairs chief Erick Tsang has revealed the government is looking into setting up more polling stations near the border for Hongkongers on the mainland to vote in next year's Legislative Council elections.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The measure was first implemented in 2021, when the city's borders were shut due to Covid. In the end 17,569 voters cast their ballots at Heung Yuen Wai, Lo Wu and Lok Ma Chau checkpoints without having to enter Hong Kong.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   For last December's District Council election, officials allowed eligible voters on the mainland to vote at one of the designated polling stations near the border in Sheung Shui, sparing them a trip to their home district. Almost 10,000 people made use of the arrangement.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "If necessary, we will continue to set up these polling stations, or even enhance and expand [the arrangement], which we are also considering," he told a televised interview on Sunday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "There might be more choices by then, depending on where the site would be, or whether the location would be suitable as a polling station."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Tsang also confirmed the electronic poll register system would remain in use for the upcoming polls.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The system broke down during last year's DC election, causing major delays at certain stations and prompting Electoral Affairs Commission chairman David Lok to issue a teary apology.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Tsang also said there's no need to further amend the current electoral system, saying it's in line with Hong Kong's long-term development.

    FS reiterates need to issue bonds for development

   Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Sunday said the government will rely more on long-term capital for infrastructure development in the SAR, including the Northern Metropolis.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Speaking on a radio programme, Chan revealed that the government's recurrent expenditure has gone up by HK$4 billion per year to facilitate new Policy Address measures.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Authorities will continue to issue up to HK$130 billion worth of bonds a year to fund various projects. He pointed out that outstanding government bonds make up only 6 percent of Hong Kong's gross domestic product, a level which is very low compared to other parts of the world.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Hong Kong faces economic restructuring, and geopolitical uncertainties.... we need to take preventive measures, and at the same time we need to enhance development to make ourselves secure," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Chan also estimated the government would return to fiscal balance in about three years. One way of achieving that, he said, was to slash expenditure by one percent each year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   On a separate note, the former development minister said authorities must continue to create land, even as the property market remains volatile.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Recalling the early 2000s when authorities froze their land sale programmes and stopped creating land in response to a market downturn, Chan said the impact of those decisions became evident now.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We can better make use of the land in remote places, so prices for properties near the city centre won't be too high, when compared with remote places," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The financial chief's hectic schedule continues with a visit to Saudi Arabia on Monday, just days after returning from the United States.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Writing on his weekly blog, Chan confirmed he will lead a delegation from the financial and innovation and technology sectors to Riyadh, with an aim to promote Hong Kong and explore business opportunities.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   They will attend the Future Investment Initiative conference, and witness the launch of two exchange-traded funds tracking SAR stock indices on the Saudi Exchange.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   The Observatory has cancelled all typhoon signals at 12:20 am on Sunday as Trami continued to move westwards away from Hong Kong.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It had issued the Strong Wind Signal Number 3 at 10:40 am, after Trami intensified into a typhoon, skirting to the south of Hong Kong at a distance of about 500 kilometres.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Observatory said winds will be strong offshore and on high ground overnight and in the morning.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Members of the public are advised to stay away from the shoreline and remain on alert.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It is expected that Trami will linger and weaken over the coast of central Vietnam today and tomorrow. It may then turn eastward, moving across the central part of the South China Sea again.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Observatory will closely monitor its movement.

   The Observatory said on Saturday that the Strong Wind Signal No. 3 will stay in place at least until 10 pm, adding that local winds are expected to strengthen with a few squally showers in Hong Kong, as the winds veer to the east later on.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   However, it expects the winds to ease off gradually on Sunday morning as Trami leaves.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Earlier, the forecaster had issued the Strong Wind Signal No. 3 at 10.40 am on Saturday, after Trami intensified into a typhoon in the morning, skirting to the south of Hong Kong at a distance of about 500 kilometres.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Education Bureau said kindergartens and schools for children with physical and intellectual disabilities were suspended for the day.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The organiser of the Hong Kong Food Carnival said the event has been postponed due to the typhoon.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Tourism Commission said the light-and-sound show, "A Symphony of Lights", will be cancelled.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Harbour Lounge at the Hong Kong Wine & Dine Festival is also closed, but the doors of the festival remain open as usual.

   <br/>
   The Social Welfare Department has issued warnings to 15 care homes for persons with disabilities, in the past year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   One of them was issued to Hong Chi Association in August, which operates a care home in Tai Po.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A 38-year-old staff member from the facility has been charged on suspicion of sexually assaulting two residents while on duty.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The case was confirmed by the Social Welfare Department on Wednesday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Speaking to reporters, Sun said the standard procedure for the department is to upload the issuance of warnings to its website.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He said it’s not necessary to share details of every case to the public.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “It depends on the severity of individual violations as well as social awareness. These are judgments we need to make. For example, regarding the Hong Chi case, of course we think the incident was serious, and society is highly concerned, so we believe it’s necessary to explain to the public the details of the case,” he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “Some other violations are really about technical problems. For such violations, we just follow procedures that we think are suitable.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sun reiterated that he doesn't think it's wrong to delay the announcement for two months, adding that officials want to make sure the alleged victims and their families are in a stable emotional state and will not experience further harm.

   The two giant pandas presented to Hong Kong by the central government - An An and Ke Ke - have completed their month-long isolation period.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Ocean Park said on Saturday that the pair's health conditions have met the requirements of the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But it will take at least another 30 days before the public can meet the pandas, as they are still adapting to their new home.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The park revealed that the duo enjoy tailor-made facilities at their habitats.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Separately, the public is invited to suggest new names for the giant pandas until tomorrow. Participants have to submit their proposals along with a 100-word explanation.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A drawing competition for people to portray the pandas will last until November 8.

    'Market drives the site for gold storage facilities'

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury Christopher Hui said on Saturday that gold storage facilities do not have to be located at the airport.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The government unveiled in the Policy Address last week that it hopes to build an international gold trading market by promoting the development of world-class gold storage facilities.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The capacity of the gold vault at the city's international airport stands at 150 tonnes, and the Airport Authority announced that it is finalising the expansion plan of precious metal depository in line with the government's initiative.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   However, speaking on an RTHK radio programme, Hui said storage facilities do not have to be sited at the airport.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Of course, the airport has an innate advantage, because it's safe and secure. In terms of planning, it also allows us to get a better idea of the quantity and scale involved, because the plot of land is relatively level," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "But can we say that other sites can't be used as storage facilities? I don't think so. It's mainly driven by the market, and whether we could meet the storage requirements."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Hui also revealed that he will set up a working group to review the drive of world-class storage facilities in the region, by the end of this year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   While Hong Kong has always been a distribution centre for gold, apart from import and export of the precious metal, Hui hopes the city can make a breakthrough in trading as well as prices of gold.

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Secretary for transport Lam Sai-hung on Saturday said the bureau will do all it can to cope with the series of test events to be held at the Kai Tak Sports Park.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The first test event will take place on Sunday, featuring a youth football match with about 1,000 invited spectators.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   There will be no parking or drop-off areas available at the Sports Park and people were urged to use MTR to enter the area.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Writing on his official blog, Lam noted that the bureau is aware of the broad public's concerns about transport arrangements for the sports park during large-scale events.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He said the government anticipated many spectators will use the Kai Tak Station and Sung Wong Toi Station to access the park, stressing that the MTR will strengthen services on the Tuen Ma line and Kwun Tong line based on actual needs and circumstances.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lam said there are also plenty of nearby buses connecting all parts of Hong Kong near the park and bus operators will launch special bus routes to cope with special transportation needs during major events.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He added that the transport bureau‘s emergency coordination centre will work closely with other governmental departments and public transport operators to monitor the situation and issue timely updates to the public.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Hong Kong Rugby Sevens, scheduled to take place from March 28 to 30 in 2025, is expected to be the first major event to be held at the Sports Park.

    Expansion of '1+' mechanism to lift healthcare quality
   </title>

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The Secretary for Health emphasised that the expansion of the "1+" mechanism will not affect the quality of medicine.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Starting next month, the mechanism will cover all new drugs, including vaccines and advanced therapy products. Currently, it only includes new drugs for treating life-threatening or severely debilitating diseases.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Speaking on a Commercial Radio programme on Saturday, Lo Chung-mau pointed out that the relaxation only changes the mode of approval, not the requirements for approval.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He believes the move will elevate the region's healthcare standard - the reason being that Hong Kong-registered drugs can be used in designated health institutions on the mainland, even if they have not been registered there.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We will be able to, one, allow patients in Hong Kong and even in the Greater Bay Area to enjoy more advanced therapy products or new drugs...with the improvement of healthcare standard in the whole area."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Two, with more choices, the cost of these new treatment drugs or advanced therapy products will be lowered. Thirdly, it will promote the development of R&D - research and development - in the area."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lo pointed out that the move will be attractive for pharmaceutical companies, as they can enjoy access to a bigger market.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Once the drug or device gets approved and registered in Hong Kong and is in-use at public hospitals, it will have a 'green channel' for use in the 86 million population of the GBA."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Meanwhile, Chief Executive John Lee voiced his support towards building a third medical school by local universities, in his third policy blueprint.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The health chief said it's "definitely good" to have one more medical institute, but warned that if the third medical institute is not up to scratch, it may affect the quality of the current two schools.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We have to be cautious, because a medical school involves a lot of resources, not just capital, for medical training, such as professors...a teaching hospital, and even patients. Because teaching is not only held in classrooms, we need medical cases to do so."

    Crime up slightly in first nine months of 2024

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Police Commissioner Raymond Siu on Saturday unveiled that Hong Kong recorded 70,015 crimes in the first nine months of the year, marking a 4.8 percent increase from the same period last year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The rise mainly comes from a surge in fraud, theft and blackmail cases.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Former police chief Andy Tsang’s home in Tai Po was recently burglarised, with reports saying that over HK$100,000 worth of items were stolen.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   On a Commercial Radio programme, Siu mentioned that burglary cases saw a 50 percent year-on-year increase in the first quarter.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He noted the force had since enhanced prevention measures, leading to a decline in such crimes in the first nine months, when compared with last year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We have strengthened patrols, especially on village houses and detached homes. We have also done more intelligence gathering, and we're using technology as well. We use drones from the Government Flying Service to monitor remote areas to identify if there are suspicious persons,” he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “Moreover, we have enhanced communication with residents, and urged them to report to the police immediately if they spot any suspicious activities. All these measures have led to a noticeable improvement.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Siu noted there were 32,120 fraud cases in the first nine months of the year, 2,470 more compared with the same period last year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He highlighted that the surge primarily came from a new method of deception, where scammers pretend to be customer service representatives at e-commerce stores.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The police chief went on to say that the force had implemented targeted promotions and initiatives aimed at combating these types of fraud crime in the past few months, leading to a monthly decline in figures since July.

   The Observatory has issued the Strong Wind Signal No. 3 at 10.40am on Saturday and said it will remain in force for most of the day.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The forecaster said Trami intensified into a typhoon this morning, skirting to the south of Hong Kong at a distance of about 500 kilometres.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Education Bureau said kindergartens and schools for children with physical and intellectual disabilities would be suspended for the day.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Social Welfare Department said all child-care centres, facilities providing after-school care programmes, elderly services centres, rehabilitation units as well as day activity centres, will remain open during normal operating hours.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The organiser of the Hong Kong Food Carnival said the event has been postponed due to the typhoon, noting that the carnival will be cancelled for the rest of the day if Signal No. 3 remains in force after 1pm.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Tourism Commission said the light-and-sound show, "A Symphony of Lights", will be cancelled.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Habour Lounge at the Hong Kong Wine & Dine Festival is also closed under the strong wind signal number 3, but the doors of the festival remain open as usual.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Observatory said the Strong Wind Signal No. 3 will stay in place at least until 10pm, adding that local winds are expected to strengthen with a few squally showers in Hong Kong, as the winds veer to the east later on.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   However, it expects the winds to ease off gradually on Sunday morning as Trami leaves.

   The Observatory says it will issue the Strong Wind Signal No. 3 at 10.40am as Severe Tropical Storm Trami skirts the SAR.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Education Bureau said kindergartens and schools for children with physical and intellectual disabilities would be suspended for the day.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Observatory said local winds are expected to pick up gradually in Hong Kong as the winds veer to the east later on, and some places which were previously sheltered become exposed.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   However, it expects the winds to ease off gradually on Sunday morning as Trami leaves.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It said Trami was an estimated 560 kilometres south of Hong Kong, and is forecast to move across the South China Sea in the direction of the waters south of Hainan Island.

   Thousands descended upon Central Harbourfront on Friday to bask in the evening atmosphere and indulge in the finer things at the Wine and Dine Festival.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The annual flagship culinary event organised by the Tourism Board is featuring more than 300 booths from around the world.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Phil from South Africa was in a long queue outside a booth selling wines from the UK. He said the festival this year was bigger than even those before the pandemic.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “I’ve been here previously, like pre-Covid. There’re a lot more people here. It seems a bit bigger. I’m having a really good time, so it’s interesting,” he told RTHK.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He also said the nation’s alcohol producers have made leaps and bounds.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “I had a Chinese Chardonnay earlier, and it was good... I had some Chinese wines like 10 or 15 years ago, and it was terrible. Now, it’s like quite good.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   At another booth was Umesh, who was enjoying a glass of Finnish wine. He said he was able to taste drinks that he had never tried before.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “We’ve tried Finland’s. We’ve tried China’s. We’ve tried France’s. Not disappointed yet. I can’t wait to see the others, because I’ll probably find stuff that I don’t know existed,” he said of his first Wine and Dine Festival experience.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The five-day festival will end on Sunday.

    Relaxed approval rules for all new drugs from Nov 1

  <div class="itemFullText">
   A streamlined regulatory regime aimed at speeding up the arrival in Hong Kong of medicines for serious diseases will be extended to cover all new drugs from November 1, the government said on Friday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Under the “1+” mechanism, a new drug can be registered in the SAR if just one reference regulatory authority in the world has approved it, rather than two in the past.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The mechanism was introduced last November for new drugs to treat life-threatening or severely debilitating diseases, and five products have been approved under it so far.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Department of Health said extending the relaxed regime to all new medicines will bring more choice for patients and strengthen the city’s ability to evaluate drugs.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Alex Lam, chairman of concern group Hong Kong's Patients’ Voices, said Hongkongers will benefit from lower prices and a larger variety of drugs on the market. But he cautioned that quality may be undermined.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Previously we had two regulatory authorities’ approval, now we only need one. If that one authority comes from a country where the standing is not too high in the world, the quality may be lower and the risk to patients may be higher than before," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lam said the World Health Organisation has stated which countries have higher standards regarding drug regulation, with most of them in Europe. In Asia, only Singapore and South Korea make it onto the list, he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "When we expect more drugs coming from countries that are not listed as the highest standard, there may be a compensation of cost in terms of quality and risk associated with this kind of medicine. We have to be careful when we use it on patients in Hong Kong," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lam added that the government needs to act as a gatekeeper to ensure patient safety, suggesting public hospitals should monitor the outcomes when patients are prescribed drugs approved under the mechanism, to check for any problems.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Vendors at this year’s Wine and Dine Festival said on Friday that they hope the weather doesn't dampen business over the weekend.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A storm that prompted the observatory to issue a No 1 signal is expected to come within 500 kilometres of Hong Kong on Saturday morning.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Jeremy Li from a local gin brand said his business mainly welcomed locals in the first two days of the festival.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He told RTHK that the weather will play a part in how well they do over the weekend.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “Last year was the first year we joined the Wine and Dine [Festival], the weekend was really, really packed and busy,” he told RTHK.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “Hopefully if the weather is nice, I guess [business] should be good [this weekend] too.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Kit Leung, a merchant in the newly designated zone featuring British products, is also hoping for good weather.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “[Our business] depends on the typhoon. We are looking at the sky,” he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The annual festival kicked off on Wednesday and will last for five days, instead of the usual four.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Customs officers on Friday said they seized smuggled goods with a market value of over HK$100 million during an operation last week.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   They inspected a 40-foot container scheduled to set sail to Taichung, confiscating products including electronic appliances, routers, CPUs, computers and circuit boards.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   No arrests have been made so far.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Shirley Woo, an investigator of Customs' syndicate crimes investigation bureau, said it's believed the intended final destination for the goods was the mainland.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “We believe that, given the huge demand for these smuggled products on the mainland, criminals are taking an indirect route to first smuggle the cargo to Taichung, and then use various means to smuggle it back to the mainland,” she said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Woo added that more than HK$10 million in taxes would have been evaded if the smuggling had been successful.

   The Hong Kong Observatory on Friday said the Standby Signal No. 1 will stay up until at least 6 am on Saturday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Severe Tropical Storm Trami is expected to skirt about 500 kilometres to the south of Hong Kong on Saturday morning, it said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The forecaster predicted strong winds in some areas, especially offshore and on high ground due to the combined effects of Trami and a northeast monsoon.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But It said local winds will not strengthen much because the prevailing winds will mainly be northerlies.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “Depending on the distance of strong winds associated with Trami from the Pearl River Estuary and the change in local wind conditions, the observatory will assess the need of issuing the Strong Wind Signal No. 3 during the day [on Saturday]," it said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Local winds are expected to weaken on Sunday when Trami moves further away, the observatory added.

    Govt hopes probe will help prevent abuse at care homes

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The secretary for labour and welfare said on Friday that he hopes an investigation by an operator of a care home into alleged abuse there could help prevent cases in future.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A care home worker of Hong Chi Association was arrested on suspicion of sexually assaulting two residents while on duty. The association has terminated the employee and promised its own probe.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I hope Hong Chi Association's independent review committee can complete its work as soon as possible, look into details if any improvements can be made systematically, and ensure that such unfortunate incidents won't happen again in the future," Chris Sun said on an RTHK radio programme.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He also said the government is not in a position to offer details of abuse cases reported from four other care facilities, citing privacy concerns.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sun added that the Social Welfare Department has issued warnings to 15 care homes in the past year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "A warning letter is intended to inform care homes of any shortcomings, or if it's suspected of breaking the rules. We have to warn them. But the public has to understand that the warnings cannot include all the details.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "So we've always adopted a similar practice in issuing warning letters. The main point of doing so is to notify care homes of inappropriate actions and shortcomings. This can also allow the industry to know that they have to focus on a certain area and step up their efforts in this regard."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Social Welfare Department will review the licence of the care home operated by Hong Chi Association annually in the wake of the case, instead of the current practice of every three years.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sun said the department's next move depends on the findings of the independent review committee.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The operation of a care home depends on its quality and whether its operations are up to the required standard. That's one thing. But if someone does bad things for an ulterior motive, that's mostly down to the individual. The two things have to be separated," he said.

    Dinosaur fans excited to see HK fossils

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   People gathered bright and early on Friday morning to catch a glimpse of the first-ever dinosaur fossils found on home soil, as they went on display at the Hong Kong Heritage Discovery Centre in Kowloon Park.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Officials announced earlier this week that dinosaur fossils believed to date back to the Cretaceous period had been discovered on Port Island in the northeastern waters of the SAR.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Chong Got was the first to arrive for the opening of the display.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “I don’t know about it actually, that’s why I’m coming here to learn from it. It’s amazing to see the fossils. When I was young, going to the museum, to the souvenir shop, and looking at this small, tiny piece of stone, and then you could find the fossil of a silhouette of, like, a beetle or a shell. It’s already amazing enough,” he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “Here we are talking about dinosaurs. I don’t know how many millions of years now. So it really would be an amazing opportunity for me, to open my eyes.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Also at the exhibition was Rick Dong who said he has seen dinosaur fossils in other museums, but was excited to see the first found in Hong Kong.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “It’s a very good opportunity for the local citizens to come here to see this fossil. And with the development, I think we’ll have more fossils to develop and be shown here for the citizens to see,” he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “[It’s a] very good operation, because for science, there’s no boundary. We should work together with the scientists from all over the world to develop and do research.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Gavin Kwai had taken his six-year-old son Joshua to the exhibition, saying it was an educational opportunity.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “It’s a very good chance for them to learn… When we went to, like, the Science Park’s exhibition beforehand about dinosaurs, sometimes they asked us if we are going to see dinosaurs in Hong Kong or if we are going to discover some. Or they will ask us if it was discovered in Hong Kong and where it was in Hong Kong,” he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “But like beforehand, we usually disappointed them by saying, ‘It’s from other countries, you are not likely to find something like this in Hong Kong.’ It’s very amazing this time that we can really truly discover something in Hong Kong.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   History lover Nitin Gupta said he didn't know much about dinosaurs, but was glad there were staff available to explain the fossils to him.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Ringo Ng, assistant curator of archaeological preservation at the centre, said staff will be arranged to provide explanations from time to time, but they hope to have guides stationed there in the future.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   The Observatory issued the Standby Signal No. 1 early on Friday, and said the signal will remain in force until at least 6pm as Severe Tropical Storm Trami moves across the central and northern parts of the South China Sea.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It said Trami is forecast to stay more than 600 kilometres from Hong Kong for most of the daytime hours, and its strong winds have not yet had an effect on the vicinity of the Pearl River Estuary.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Observatory warned that the combined effect of Trami and the northeast monsoon would bring occasionally strong winds offshore and on high ground, but it also said local winds won't strengthen significantly during the day due to terrain sheltering effect.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The need to issue Strong Wind Signal No. 3 thereafter will depend on the distance between Trami and Hong Kong and the change in local wind strength," it said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Observatory added that Trami will move towards the vicinity of Hainan Island and local winds will weaken later on Sunday.
