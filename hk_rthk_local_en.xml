<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office director Xia Baolong was briefed by Financial Secretary Paul Chan on his plan to boost the economy during his inspection trip to the tech zones in Hetao and Qianhai on Sunday, according to a government statement.
 <br>
  <br>
  The statement said Xia told the SAR to "continue to be bold in reform, dare to break new ground, and to innovate continuously".
  <br>
  <br>
  The top mainland official was accompanied by Acting Chief Executive Eric Chan and the financial secretary in his visit to the Hong Kong Park of the Hetao Shenzhen-Hong Kong Science and Technology Innovation Co-operation Zone.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xia listened to officials’ presentations on the latest development progress and the focus of work for the park.
  <br>
  <br>
  He later visited the Qianhai cooperation zone and hosted a four-hour discussion session, in which Paul Chan told Xia on what he will do to boost the economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xia and SAR officials also discussed how Hong Kong could accelerate reforms to foster progress, enhance cooperation with Guangdong and better integrate into the Greater Bay Area.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xia said he hopes the SAR government would thoroughly implement the spirit of the important speeches by President Xi Jinping in Macau and the third plenary session of the 20th Central Committee of the Communist Party.
  <br>
  <br>
  Paul Chan said the SAR government is determined to undertake reforms, dare to be innovative, and actively integrate into the national development and align with national development strategies.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also said Hong Kong will co-ordinate development and security, as well as maintain financial and economic security, while promoting the acceleration of economic progress amid a complex external environment.

    Hongkong Post to accept US-bound parcels again

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hongkong Post said it will resume parcel services to the United States from Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Authorities said they made the announcement after the US confirmed it would not impose additional duty on mail items containing goods from Hongkong Post.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last week, Hongkong Post stopped accepting US-bound parcels, as the United States Postal Service (USPS) suspended inbound parcels from mainland China and the SAR and then reversed the decision in less than a day.
  <br>
  <br>
  The suspension by the USPS followed President Donald Trump's order for an additional 10 percent levy on Chinese imports, alongside an elimination of a duty-free exemption for low value packages.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hongkong Post reminds members of the public that the United States government is constantly changing policies and may further change its policies at any time. There may also be backlogs for mail items destined to the United States and delay of delivery, which may cause inconvenience or even losses to the public," a statement read.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government also reiterated its strong disapproval of additional US duty imposed on Hong Kong products, and urged Washington "to take urgent actions to rectify its wrongdoing".

    'Flavoured tobacco ban will further hit bar business'

<img alt="The Long-term Tobacco Policy Concern Group said a ban on flavoured tobacco and shisha would drive customers away. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1791056_1_20250210185326.jpg&q=60">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A smoking policy concern group on Monday said a government proposal banning flavoured cigarettes and shisha products would greatly affect the business of local bars.
 <br>
  <br>
  This came a day after health minister Lo Chung-mau said the government aims to table an amendment to the anti-smoking law at Legco in April, which will include a ban on e-cigarettes and flavoured tobacco, among other measures.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Long-term Tobacco Policy Concern Group said according to its survey of 514 bar customers in Lan Kwai Fong and Knutsford Terrace last month, four out of five said they would go to bars less often if the government pushes ahead with the ban, while 70 percent said they will consider visiting bars on the mainland instead.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Licensed Bar and Club Association of HK echoed that view, saying "extreme" tobacco-control measures would deal a further blow to the nighttime economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  In response, the Health Bureau said shisha is only allowed in 10 percent of the city's bars, so it won't have a strong impact.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bureau also said the government will consider offering a grace period to bars and patrons before the new law takes effect.

<img alt="The Consumer Council received over 40,000 complaints last year, up 20 percent from 2023. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1791030_1_20250210162013.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A football legend's no-show at an exhibition match and the sudden closure of a local gym chain have mostly contributed to the rise of complaints filed to Hong Kong's consumer watchdog over the past year.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Consumer Council on Monday said it received 40,839 complaints in total last year, up 20 percent from 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  Excluding complaints regarding mainland online shopping platforms, the figure stood at 37,590 in 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The increase was mainly due to two disputes during the year which raised widespread public concern and affected many consumers, including [Lionel] Messi's controversial non-appearance at an exhibition match in February, as well as the abrupt closure of the Physical Fitness chain in September," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Complaints arising from the two incidents involved about HK$210 million, the watchdog said.
  <br>
  <br>
  There were 1,476 complaints relating to Messi and another 5,619 about the fitness chain.
  <br>
  <br>
  The council said "food and entertainment services" remained the category that received the most complaints for the third straight year, with 5,810 cases involving over HK$15.2 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  Food and entertainment-related complaints "still accounted for the lion's share" overall even after excluding certain incidents like Messi's no-show and Physical Fitness' closure, the body added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Overall, the watchdog noted the SAR was affected by a number of factors such as the global economic downturn, the boom in the digital economy, the trend of northbound travel, and the resumption of the multi-entry visa scheme for Shenzhen residents.
  <br>
  <br>
  "While new traders entered the market, industries were faced with unprecedented opportunities and challenges, and some businesses made the difficult decision to close down, resulting in a surge in related consumer complaints," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The council urged businesses to "promptly improve the quality of services and goods" to be more competitive and appealing, to stimulate people's desire to spend.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The chef de mission of the Hong Kong, China delegation to the Harbin Asian Winter Games, Kenneth Fok, on Monday said the international governing body for ice hockey has suspended four Turkmenistan players involved in an altercation with SAR players.
 <br>
  <br>
  Three Hong Kong players were injured in a post-match scuffle after defeating Turkmenistan 5-1 in a match on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fok said the Sports Federation and Olympic Committee of Hong Kong, China (SF&OC) welcomed "the quick and fair response" from the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF).
  <br>
  <br>
  "We were notified on Monday afternoon that the IIHF has suspended with immediate effect the four Turkmen athletes, who had intentionally assaulted the Hong Kong team," he said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fok said the Turkmenistan players wouldn't be able to play in their final game of the tournament, a matchup for ninth place against Kuwait in Monday evening.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also confirmed that the three SAR players only suffered light injuries and would be ready to play in the quarter-finals on Monday night.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I want to emphasise that our Team Hong Kong China's players had always stayed respectful and friendly when competing, even when facing disrespectful and threatening actions," Fok said in a video released to the press before the suspension announcement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our players definitely did not retaliate or do anything reckless. This is worthy of our praise and recognition."

    HKU introduces new blood-cancer treatment

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The University of Hong Kong Faculty of Medicine has unveiled a new oral formulation of arsenic trioxide for the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukaemia, otherwise known as APL.
 <br>
  <br>
  APL is a blood cancer that occurs suddenly with a high fatality rate, leading to bone marrow dysfunction and increased risk of infections and bleeding.
  <br>
  <br>
  The new treatment, called Oral-ATO, obviates the need for chemotherapy and bone marrow transplant, which decreases the relapse rate.
  <br>
  <br>
  Clinical Associate Professor at HKU, and the study's lead investigator, Dr Harinder Gill, said that with all abnormal cells gone, around one percent of patients under this treatment experience a relapse.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So most of these patients are essentially cured with this oral formulation," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Moreover, patients who take this new treatment do not need to be hospitalised and can just go to an out-patient clinic to collect medications after the initial diagnosis, allowing them to retain a normal life.
  <br>
  <br>
  The production cost for this new oral formula is also much lower than traditional treatments, hence it is currently free and available at all hospitals in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But since this is an uncommon form of acute leukaemia, we would have this treatment centralised at Queen Mary Hospital and the University of Hong Kong where these patients would receive meticulous initial supportive care to reduce the early death rate," Dr Gill added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Oral-ATO has obtained orphan drug designation from US Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency.
  <br>
  <br>
  The research was done in collaboration with experts from around Asia, as well as teams from the UK and the US.

    Do more to get tourists on HK hiking trails: lawmaker

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lawmaker Vincent Cheng on Monday called for the government to develop more facilities around Hong Kong's hiking trails as a way to attract more tourists.
 <br>
  <br>
  This came after a charity chaired by Cheng polled more than 380 people from late January to early February. Around half of the respondents agreed there was a lack of water fountains, and almost one-third were concerned about the safety of trails.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cheng said the government could provide more comprehensive information on different trails.
  <br>
  <br>
  "One of our suggestions is we do have more professionals to evaluate all trails in Hong Kong, classify them into different difficulties, so we can provide more beginner-friendly trails as well," he said at a press briefing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cheng added that as well as increasing the number of water fountains and toilets, the administration should set up stations for hikers to get replenishments, taking reference from Japan's mountain houses and Nepal's tea houses.
  <br>
  <br>
  In terms of promoting trails globally, Cheng said Hong Kong could participate in international travel exhibitions and invite celebrities such as actor Chow Yun-fat or snooker star Ronnie O'Sullivan to become ambassadors.
  <br>
  <br>
  When asked how to strike a balance between tourism and environmental protection, Cheng said a clear classification of trails will be needed.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have so many trails in Hong Kong. Different people have different needs. If we target one or two trails for tourism, we can promote that trail more. Some of the trails, maybe they are for locals, then we can meet local needs," he said.

 Sunday's fight involving ice hockey players from Turkmenistan and Hong Kong, China may have escalated due to the physical nature of the sport.
 <br>
  <br>
  That's according to Education University physical education lecturer Lobo Louie.
  <br>
  <br>
  "During the ice hockey game, it is quite violent. So in terms of our philosophy and sports development, there is a debate for games that have physical contact. If you play table tennis, you are separated [from your opponent] by the table. But for [contact] games like rugby, boxing, and ice hockey, how do we handle the emotions of athletes, that should be part of the game," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Louie added the incident would serve as a lesson for athletes to learn how to control their stress levels during and after competitions.
  <br>
  <br>
  He made it clear that contact sports often have stricter rules to protect athletes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The athletes have to stand out for a couple of minutes, or may be they are suspended for a few games or are even [given] a more serious penalty," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Louie hoped the incident would not affect the performance of the Hong Kong, China team in later matches at the Asian Winter Games in Harbin, and urged more promotion of professional sports ethics among athletes.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Monday paid a visit to ice hockey players who were injured during a post-game fight between players from Hong Kong, China and Turkmenistan at the Winter Asian Games in Harbin.
 <br>
  <br>
  SAR sports officials are demanding action from relevant authorities and have condemned the "deliberate attack and injury" by Turkmenistan athletes after Sunday's game.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee, who's in Harbin, went to the athletes' village to meet three Hong Kong players hurt in the brawl.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the trio were fine and should be able to play in Monday night's quarter-final clash against Kyrgyzstan.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CE praised the players for staying calm and showing restraint during the incident, saying they showed professionalism and displayed sportsmanship.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I encourage them to maintain the best mental condition and play with a professional attitude, not to be affected by any incident," Lee wrote on social media.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I also expressed the support of Hong Kong people for the ice hockey team, and encourage the team members to keep it up and focus on the upcoming games."
  <br>
  <br>
  The chief executive also called on the Sports Federation and Olympic Committee of Hong Kong, China, and the Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau to follow up on the matter, and ensure the safety of the SAR's athletes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee was flanked by sports minister Rosanna Law and Chief Executive's Office director Carol Yip as he met the ice hockey team.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Commerce chief Algernon Yau has expressed hope for Radio Television Hong Kong (RTHK) to be flexible and innovative, saying the broadcaster would continue to work with counterparts across the border and in Belt and Road countries to showcase the SAR.
 <br>
  <br>
  The secretary for commerce and economic development on Monday said RTHK would also promote and broadcast this November's National Games, during a Lunar New Year event organised by the broadcaster.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I look forward to seeing RTHK strengthen cooperation and exchanges with broadcasters on the mainland and in Belt and Road countries, to demonstrate Hong Kong as a global metropolis where the East meets the West with vibrancy and diversity, to continue to tell the story of Hong Kong," Yau said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Director of Broadcasting Angelina Kwan said the broadcaster would promote the city's advantages and characteristics to the rest of the world in the coming year, while jointly introducing a number of programmes with the government.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another focus for RTHK would be on the use of technology such as artificial intelligence, which Kwan said could break barriers on production.

 The Sports Federation and Olympic Committee of Hong Kong, China (SF&OC) is demanding action from relevant authorities after two SAR ice hockey players were injured by their Turkmen counterparts at the Asian Winter Games on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The two players are in a stable condition after getting checks by the team doctor and a local hospital.
  <br>
  <br>
  The altercation came at the end of the men's Group C match between Hong Kong, China and Turkmenistan, which the SAR came away 5-1 winners.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to Xinhua news agency, scuffles broke out when the two sides were shaking hands.
  <br>
  <br>
  Videos circulating on social media showed multiple SAR players on the ice as they were attacked by their opponents. At least one of them, Alvin Sham, looked to be in pain as he clutched his head with both arms.
  <br>
  <br>
  Referees and team officials then quickly intervened and broke up the fight.
  <br>
  <br>
  The match report stated three Turkmen players were assessed "game misconduct" penalties.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, the SF&OC strongly condemned what it called the "deliberate attack and injury" by Turkmen athletes.
  <br>
  <br>
  After reviewing video footage, Kenneth Fok, the Chef de Mission of Team Hong Kong, got in touch with relevant authorities and demanded disciplinary action be taken to ensure the personal safety of athletes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong won all three of its group matches and will fight for a quarter-final slot with Kyrgyzstan on Monday night.

<img alt="Lo Chung-mau says new anti-smoking measures will be implemented in phases. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790913_1_20250209163325.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Health chief Lo Chung-mau said the government aims to table anti-smoking legislation at the Legislative Council in April.
 <br>
  <br>
  Authorities want to further reduce the number of smokers in the SAR and cut down on tobacco products, by banning e-cigarettes and flavoured tobacco.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a TVB programme, the secretary for health said the measures would be implemented in phases, while also stressing the need to crack down on cigarette smuggling.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The first will be introducing duty-paid labels, and the second would be heavier fines towards illicit cigarettes. After this, we will move onto other issues," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Another problem we are concerned about is e-cigarettes. Hong Kong has implemented an import ban in April 2022. Theoretically, no one should be able to buy them. Those who are still having e-cigarettes either have a lot in hand or bought them through illegal channels."
  <br>
  <br>
  On the proposed ban on flavoured tobacco, which Lo said is used by 40 percent of smokers, the health minister said the government will first seek to outlaw non-mint flavoured tobacco.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lo said in future, anyone entering Hong Kong can bring with them 19 flavoured cigarette sticks for personal use without paying tax, and up to 20 packs with tax.
  <br>
  <br>
  He made it clear smoking led to strong economic losses. "A lot of examples and data tell us when our health is affected by smoking, the economic loss is huge. An HKU study says the economic loss in Hong Kong per year, including medical expenses and loss in manpower due to smoking, reaches more than HK$8 billion."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lo also said the government's anti-tobacco policies hope to protect public health without hindering economic development.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong runners made great strides in the annual Hong Kong Marathon on Sunday morning despite the chilly weather, while the event was also marred by a number of disqualifications.
 <br>
  <br>
  SAR runner Christy Yiu claimed victory in the women's half-marathon, crossing the finish line at Victoria Park in 1 hour, 15 minutes and 9 seconds.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said her performance was within expectations, crediting the weather conditions for making the race smoother than she had anticipated.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think the weather was really good. The humidity was only about 40 percent. The temperature was about 10 to 12 degrees, so it was nice and cool. When I got on the course, I found that it wasn't that windy (even though) it was windy at night," Yiu said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was pretty good. I didn't need to use my raincoat. The track changed a bit, but was still good for running. There were fewer places with strong winds."
  <br>
  <br>
  In the men's half-marathon, Vincent Lam from Hong Kong, who originally came in third, was awarded the title after the top two finishers – He Yingbing and Sun Xiaoyang of China – were disqualified.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I was faster by a minute when compared to my results from last year. I am also satisfied with myself. I have laid a very good foundation in the past year. I always had good communication with my coach. The weather was very good. Although the Observatory said it was a bit cold, it was not that hard to run," Lam said.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the 10km race for women, Candy Tsang from Hong Kong defended her title with a time of 35 minutes and 16 seconds.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the men's event, SAR triathlete Wong Tsz-to became runner-up after Lan Jiehuai of China, who had finished second, was disqualified. China's Liu Aiyan won the race.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dennis Ng, executive director of Hong Kong, China Association of Athletics Affiliates, said after the event that three male runners were disqualified.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Especially for the prize winners, we will verify their identities after the race. Officials found that the bibs they were wearing did not belong to that runner, so after we reported to the referees as well as other key officials, the organisers confirmed that the results were disqualified," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kenya dominated the podium in the men's marathon, with Bethwell Kipkemboi taking gold in 2 hours, 11 minutes and 13 seconds, while compatriots Kennedy Kipyeko and Seroi Anderson came second and third.
  <br>
  <br>
  Belarusian runner Volha Mazuronak won the women's marathon in 2 hours and 27 minutes, followed by Ethiopia's Emebet Niguse and Tadelech Bekele.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among the runners on Sunday was Hong Kong movie icon Chow Yun-fat, who completed the half-marathon in about 2 hours and 24 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chow said the atmosphere was fantastic, and he aims for even better results next year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I hope I can finish under 2 hours when I turn 80!" he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  About 74,000 runners signed up this year, including more than 15,000 international athletes from 101 countries and regions.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Local designers and creators could reach new horizons by taking advantage of the city's connectivity with the mainland and the rest of the world, Financial Secretary Paul Chan said on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The finance chief also noted that a number of designers in Hong Kong have become industry leaders amid the rise of the "goods economy" – a market centred on products tied to the universe of anime, comics and games.

  <br>
  In his weekly blog post, Chan said several designer toys made by Hong Kong creators have been hugely popular in the region, with the cultural products bringing in value worth hundreds of millions of dollars.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong's designers and creators have a broad vision, and they understand the culture and the needs of the mainland, the Asian and even the international markets," he wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Taking advantage of Hong Kong's connectivity to the huge markets on the mainland and the world, as long as they create IP products that are unique, personalised and resonate with the public, they will have a chance to reach new horizons."
  <br>
  <br>
  The cultural and creative industries are crucial to the SAR's social and economic development and are an important component of "Brand Hong Kong", Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added branding the city is not only about offering products and services, but also providing unique experiences that demonstrate diversity and promote cultural exchanges.

 Hong Kong's sole delegate to the nation's top legislature, Starry Lee, on Sunday said she is planning to propose ways to attract highly-skilled professionals to the SAR and expand a visa scheme during the annual plenary meetings in Beijing next month.
 <br>
  <br>
  One of the focuses is to further promote Hong Kong as an international hub for high-calibre talent and help them with accommodation, Lee said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We would like to suggest to have a special corridor, just like the stock market connect. If similar arrangements can be established for property usage or property-related expenditure, I think it can facilitate Hong Kong to serve and attract more talent," the National People's Congress Standing Committee member said after a radio programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Of course, our attraction should not focus on the mainland. We should attract talent globally."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee will be one of the SAR delegates attending the National People's Congress and Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference meetings, also known as the Two Sessions, in the capital in March.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another idea she wants to raise in Beijing is the expansion of the multi-entry visa scheme for Shenzhen residents, to cover more cities in the Greater Bay Area with Guangzhou being the priority.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee also spoke about the challenges facing Hong Kong amid the current geopolitical situation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Now the situation is complex and complicated. The Hong Kong government should work closely with the central government on the one hand," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "On the other hand, we should maintain our international contact with different parts of the world, so as to continue to bring more talent, resources and technology through Hong Kong to our country."

 Customs officers said they have arrested a man in Prince Edward on suspicion of drug trafficking after they seized about 1.5 kilogrammes of suspected methamphetamine with a street value of about HK$800,000.
 <br>
  <br>
  Officers said on Saturday that they arrested a 76-year-old man, after searching his premises the day before and finding a batch of suspected methamphetamine, along with drug packaging paraphernalia.
  <br>
  <br>
  He has been charged with one count of trafficking in a dangerous drug, and will appear at West Kowloon Magistrates' Court on Monday.

 With the recent flurry of tariffs and policy announcements by US President Donald Trump, there's been increasing discourse in Hong Kong over economic responses and adaptation, including in the upcoming budget.
 <br>
  <br>
  Executive councillor Chan Kin-por on Saturday urged the public to see the reasoning behind the government's need to prune spending and pare its fiscal deficit.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a Commercial Radio programme, Chan, who is also an insurance sector lawmaker, said that when Financial Secretary Paul Chan hands down his budget on February 26, he has to show that he's in control of government expenditure.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The financial secretary is under great pressure this time around. If he fails to control expenditure, it may affect Hong Kong’s credit rating. The situation is grim. I hope Hong Kong people can understand that there's no choice but to cut spending,” Chan Kin-por said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the government can consider cutting staff-related expenditures, while spending on welfare, such as Comprehensive Social Security Assistance and benefits for the elderly, can remain at this stage.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked about how geopolitics and tariffs would affect Hong Kong's economy, Chan Kin-por said there would be a negative impact, but he believes there will be appropriate response measures from both the central and SAR governments.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on the same programme, the chairman of the Hong Kong Shippers' Council, Willy Lin, said he supports the SAR government's decision to file a complaint to World Trade Organization over Washington imposing an additional 10 percent tariff on Hong Kong products.

 Roughly 1.4 million tourists came to Hong Kong during the eight-day mainland Spring Festival golden week, including 1.2 million visitors from the mainland, according to the executive director of the Travel Industry Council.
 <br>
  <br>
  Fanny Yeung told an RTHK programme on Saturday that of the total, about 79,000 people visited in tour groups - 83 percent of which stayed overnight.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeung was optimistic with the fact that 15 percent of those from tour groups had stayed two or three nights in the SAR - an uptick from last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Although the number of inbound tourists dropped, they stayed here for longer and we are happy to see this phenomenon,” Yeung said.
  <br>
  <br>
  But she said the city needs more tour guides who can speak foreign languages other than Chinese and English.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeung said some travel agencies were unable to host group tours from countries like Thailand, as they could not find guides who speak Thai.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on the same programme, tourism sector lawmaker Perry Yiu said the hotel occupancy rate reached about 90 percent during the golden week, and room rates dropped about 10 percent compared to last year.

    'Remains to be seen when flu season will peak'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 It remains uncertain when the flu season is likely to peak, according to the Director of Health.
 <br>
  <br>
  Dr Ronald Lam told reporters on Saturday after a Commercial Radio programme that the H1 influenza A virus is now the dominant strain - as detected in over 90 percent of the specimen.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The flu season has (arrived) since January this year, and we are seeing the rise in flu activity, and also right now the flu activity remains at a high level. But we cannot confirm how and when the flu activity will reach its peak," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The schools are going to resume classes after the holidays, so there's still possibility that there will be further transmission of flu in the community."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lam revealed that there were 137 death cases among adults, and over 75 percent of them were not vaccinated.
  <br>
  <br>
  Apart from appealing to the public to get their flu jabs, he also called on those planning to travel abroad to reschedule their trips if they feel unwell.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They have to learn more about the situation about the destinations, like whether or not the place they're going to is experiencing a big flu season," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And also for those who have chronic illness... diabetes, hypertension, kidney diseases and so forth, they should seek medical consultation first to get timely advice regarding what they should be aware of and what medications they should bring along with them."
  <br>
  <br>
  While some members of the public undergo self-testing for flu using rapid antigen kits, Lam noted they should check if the kits are listed by the government.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also urged the public to only take flu medication after consulting a physician, as they often comes with side effects.

    'Small AI chip firms can benefit from DeepSeek tide'

<img alt="Analysts say DeepSeek will boost the global proliferation of smaller AI chip firms. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790790_1_20250208102758.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The global recognition of Chinese AI star, DeepSeek, is expected to serve as a catalyst for small AI chip companies to massively scale up around the world.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Hangzhou-based startup rattled Silicon Valley last month with the launch of its low-cost, but powerful AI model, which wiped out around half a trillion US dollars in chip leader Nvidia's market cap because it was built without using cutting edge chips, due to American export restrictions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on RTHK's Trending China programme, Esther Wong, founder of 3C AGI Partners, noted that DeepSeek's breakthrough came as the global AI cycle transitioned from "training" to "inferencing".
  <br>
  <br>
  Inference refers to the act of applying AI to make predictions or decisions based on the processing of new information and data in real time, instead of training the AI model to learn patterns, relationships or features.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's equivalent to Generative AI, more focused on AI's real applications where AI can serve users differently in a tailored way," Wong explained.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[So if] inferencing is going to be used by some seven billion people in the world. You can imagine the explosion of demand is going to be so much that in the words of Jensen Huang, the inferencing demand is literally one billion times bigger than the training demand."
  <br>
  <br>
  "[But] If we do not change how AI is being manufactured now, the world will run out of power very, very soon," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong, who previously worked as managing director at Chinese AI leader SenseTime, noted the new opportunities following DeepSeek's rise as the firm's open-source model would help other small AI chip firms to challenge the current market landscape that is dominated by big players such as Nvidia, with investors eyeing alternatives to their chips.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The moment DeepSeek emerged, it can actually help the proliferation of all those basic chips, i.e. chips apart from Nvidia, that are also very good for inferencing purposes. And that applies for both domestic chips in China or chips produced by startups in the West," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The veteran banker and investor also stressed that despite the narratives that AI breakthroughs could be achieved with smaller computing power and lower investments, demand for such power as well as funds would only increase.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The inferencing demand is one billion times bigger than the training demand, and by making inferencing so cheap and accessible [due to DeepSeek's model being open-sourced], we actually need a lot more computing powers so that more people can afford inferencing," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are seeing that the Large Language Models [LLMs] are quickly being commoditised, so it's difficult to make money out of it because the marginal cost of producing intelligence is close to zero. But that is very good for the application layers where a lot of usage can be proliferated as they can be commercialised."

<div class="itemFullText">
 The SAR government on Friday said it would file a complaint to the World Trade Organisation over the United States' decision to impose an additional 10 percent tariffs on Hong Kong products.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, a government spokesperson said the US measure was “grossly inconsistent” with WTO rules.
  <br>
  <br>
  The spokesperson added that Washington had ignored that the city is a separate customs territory as stated in Article 116 of the Basic Law, and recognised by the WTO.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The HKSAR Government will formally launch procedures in accordance with the WTO Dispute Settlement Mechanism against the US' unreasonable measures to defend our legitimate rights."
  <br>
  <br>
  The spokesperson also said the SAR supports the rules-based multilateral trading system.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SAR government urged the US to rectify its measures immediately.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Forecasters on Friday said that runners taking part in Sunday's Hong Kong Marathon could face the coldest day this winter.
 <br>
  <br>
  Some 74,000 runners are expected to take part in the race, with more than 15,000 of them coming from more than a hundred countries and regions.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Observatory said the temperature could dip to as low as nine degrees Celsius in the urban areas on Sunday, and even lower in the New Territories.
  <br>
  <br>
  Senior scientific officer, Hon Kai-kwong, said as strong winds were expected, runners could feel colder than what the mercury indicates, otherwise known as the wind chill effect.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Because northern winds for the day should be relatively strong, we expect the wind chill effect to be rather significant - especially in open areas and on high grounds," he told an RTHK programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  For his part, the Hospital Authority's chief manager, Dr Larry Lee, said because of the weather, runners shouldn't over exert themselves.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Before the start of the race, [runners] should keep their heads and hands warm, and they should stay hydrated," he said on the same programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And because of the strain on their bodies, from an event like this, runners should make sure that they spend enough time warming up. If they find they can't go on, runners should rest."
  <br>
  <br>
  Top local runner Virginia Lo said the cold weather should help athletes achieve good times.
  <br>
  <br>
  She called on participants to wear raincoats and running sleeves to keep warm.
  <br>
  <br>
  Former world marathon champion Rose Chelimo is among the world's finest joining the competition and she'll be making her Hong Kong debut this weekend.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 35-year-old Kenyan-born Bahraini won gold at the World Championships in London eight years ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I've been preparing for long, since last year. It needs a lot of discipline and dedication from yourself, not following your coach or anybody," she said.

  Ethiopia-born runner Gashau Ayale, who represents Israel, will also be making his Hong Kong debut, and thinks the local course is a challenging one.

    'HK businesses won't be hugely affected by US tariffs'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Chinese General Chamber of Commerce on Friday said Hong Kong's businesses would not be hugely affected by the additional tariffs imposed by the United States.
 <br>
  <br>
  The US announced an extra 10 percent duties on Chinese imports that also covers goods from the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  The chamber's chairman Jonathan Choi said the issue is in the spotlight, but he is not worried about the impact on Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The total percentage of trade between Hong Kong and the US is not very big. Therefore, actually it's not very much affected, but the way they do it is quite unfair to us," he spoke to reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Choi said Hong Kong businesses are flexible and have started to explore new markets, such as in Asean and Middle East countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added the government is facing a deficit, and he hopes the financial secretary's budget - due to be announced later this month - could introduce measures to increase revenue and minimise spending.
  <br>
  <br>
  Choi said unprecedented global changes created more challenges to Hong Kong's economy, but support measures by the central government acted as a "guiding light" for the business community.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the Chinese Manufacturers’ Association said it expects growth in the SAR’s merchandise trade exports to slow down because of the additional tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Its president, Wingco Lo, said he agreed with the SAR government's decision to file a complaint at the World Trade Organisation over the US move.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lo expressed confidence regarding Hong Kong’s economy this year, saying he expects GDP growth of between 2.5 and 3 percent.

    No need to up criminal record checks on teachers: govt

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong authorities don't need to carry out annual criminal record checks on teachers despite a rise in cases of misconduct, Education Secretary Christine Choi said on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lawmakers were told there were 304 professional misconduct cases involving teachers last year, three times the number in 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  Seventy-one teachers were struck off last year, 38 got reprimand letters and 149 received written warnings.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some of the more serious cases involved child abuse, theft, and teachers having inappropriate relationships or improper physical contact with students.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Education Bureau currently checks the criminal records of all registered teachers every three years.
  <br>
  <br>
  But several legislators on the Legco education panel said they were worried this is insufficient, and checks should be made every year.
  <br>
  <br>
  In response, Choi said the rise in misconduct cases last year was actually a result of the bureau acting upon issues flagged up by criminal record checks.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said the administration has a zero-tolerance approach regarding teachers who don't meet ethical or moral standards, but more frequent checks aren't necessary.
  <br>
  <br>
  “If a teacher commits a crime while employed, we get the record immediately, so there's no need to wait three years. The checks conducted every three years are for those not currently working in schools who commit crimes that might not be reported,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the idea of requiring teachers to apply to renew their licence every 10 years, Choi said the bureau is always open-minded about ways to uphold professionalism.

    MTR to get minimum HK$1m fine for East Rail disruption

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The MTR Corporation will be fined at least HK$1 million over disruption to East Rail Line services that lasted for more than seven hours on Wednesday, the government says.
 <br>
  <br>
  The money will be spent on rebates for passengers.
  <br>
  <br>
  An engineer's train broke down near Tai Wo Station and remained on the tracks during the morning rush hour and up until lunchtime. Officials said intervals between trains were as long as 24 minutes at some stations during the disruption.
  <br>
  <br>
  “According to the preliminary information submitted by the MTR, this incident triggered the service performance rebate mechanism. This means the MTR will need to set aside at least HK$1 million as rebates for passengers,” Deputy Secretary for Transport and Logistics Kirk Yip told lawmakers on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yip said the government has asked for a report into the incident within a month and wants to know what caused the train to break down and what improvement measures MTR officials come up with in case of similar issues in future.
  <br>
  <br>
  The MTR's Managing Director for Hong Kong Transport Services, Jeny Yeung, told legislators the company will learn from the incident and will look at how repairs can be carried out quicker if such a situation happens again.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Special measures brought in before Christmas to deal with increased demand for A&E services will remain in place for now given the number of people turning up for treatment, the Hospital Authority said on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Staff levels, bed capacity and laboratory testing services for flu and other viruses have been stepped up during the winter period.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chief Manager Dr Larry Lee told RTHK that medical wards are operating at above 100 percent capacity and paediatric wards have also seen an increase in patients.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The number of patients has risen significantly. There are around 5,500 patients at accident and emergency units per day and around 1,100 patients are admitted to the general wards each day," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It seems that this pressure will continue, mainly because of the cold weather, and because of the public coming back from overseas travel and students returning to school."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee said that in the past two weeks, 158 people were put in intensive care units or died due to influenza A, adding that this was a similar number to last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said nine children suffered serious complications from their flu infections, and urged parents to get their children vaccinated.
  <br>
  <br>
  The observatory has warned that temperatures could drop to nine degrees Celsius in urban areas on Sunday which it says could be a record low this winter.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The SAR’s speed skater Sidney Chu said his team is fully ready for the Asian Winter Games which will kick off in Harbin on Friday night.
 <br>
  <br>
  The city is sending more than 70 athletes to participate in the Games this year, the largest number ever.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 25-year-old speed skater was the flag bearer for the Hong Kong, China team at the Beijing Winter Olympics in 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chu said he will participate in eight races in speed skating and short-track speed skating this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We arrived and trained in Harbin five days ahead of the start of competition. That gives us enough time to get used to the temperature and the ice surface at the venue," he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Although the ice is harder than what we are used to, we have adjusted our techniques, and the way we move and our equipment. I hope we can perform well."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chu and his teammates will also participate in the men's 5,000m relay and the mixed team 2,000m short-track speed skating relay.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is the first time for SAR athletes to participate in relay races of short-track speed skating at large-scale competitions. This is a critical moment for us. I'm happy to see my team's growth and development," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The athlete said he won the support of mainland audiences at the 2022 Games, and he hopes that he will not disappoint his supporters in Harbin.

 Hongkong Post says it will continue to turn away postal items containing goods to the United States, even as the US Postal Service ditched its earlier suspension of inbound parcels from mainland China and the SAR.
 <br>
  <br>
  The announcement comes two days after Hongkong Post was told by its US counterpart not to dispatch packages containing goods, "unless a 'formal entry' has been completely and accurately filed with the United States Customs and Border Protection in accordance with the United States law".
  <br>
  <br>
  A government spokesman said in a statement early on Friday morning that Hongkong Post is now communicating with USPS to clarify certain matters, including the imposition of additional duty.
  <br>
  <br>
  The spokesman reiterated the government's strong disapproval to charge additional duty for Hong Kong products, and urged Washington to rectify its wrongdoing to "avoid causing confusion and inconvenience to the public owing to its constantly changing policies".

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ocean Park has apologised for its "lack of sensitivity" and taken down a panda-themed watch, after the product sparked a public outcry over the use of alligator skin.
 <br>
  <br>
  The park had teamed up with a local tourbillon brand to introduce a watch, which featured the six giant pandas. The strap of the watch was said to be made with alligator leather.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Thursday, the park expressed deep regret over the lack of sensitivity of the team in promoting a product that "does not meet the core values of conservation".
  <br>
  <br>
  "The product has not been purchased by any consumers, and has been immediately removed from the shelves. We are discussing with our authorised partners on procuring other materials to make the watch straps," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ocean Park vowed to review its design, production and procurement guidelines while strengthening staff training to ensure its operations are consistent with the core values of conservation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Posts on social media and the store's website about the watch have been removed.
  <br>
  <br>
  The park had previously called on the public to refrain from purchasing and using crocodile products.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also named a crocodile as an animal ambassador for visitors to learn about preserving local biodiversity.

<img alt="The Hong Kong General Chamber of Small and Medium Business said products from the mainland and Hong Kong might still be competitive after the tariff hike. File photo: Xinhua" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790572_1_20250206185139.jpg&q=45">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The deputy head of a local chamber for small to medium-sized firms on Thursday said companies from mainland China and Hong Kong focused on e-commerce may still have profit margins, despite higher US tariffs.
 <br>
  <br>
  US authorities began charging an extra 10 percent levy on top of existing tariffs, and cancelled a tax exemption for parcels with a retail value of US$800 or less.
  <br>
  <br>
  A vice president of the Hong Kong General Chamber of Small and Medium Business, Stanley Lee, said while the tariff rise might have come abruptly, some products can still be competitive in the US market.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For example, in traditional retail, it costs US$20 to buy an item. It's US$15 for them to buy on [American] online platforms, but it's US$10 on [Chinese] e-platforms before the rise," he explained to RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So even with [25 to 35 percent extra tariffs], it's still cheaper to buy [Chinese products] than the traditional way."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee, who also heads the chamber's e-commerce policy committee, said his own firm was relatively unaffected by the new US policies, as his products are stored in warehouses on American soil and they clear customs regularly.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said he expects some mainland e-commerce firms to do the same if they no longer find the parcel-mailing strategy profitable.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee added that companies mostly expected the trade spat to intensify, and have therefore turned to different markets in search for potential customers.

 An eight-vehicle pile-up on the West Kowloon Corridor in Cheung Sha Wan on Thursday afternoon has left at least three people injured.

  Police received reports at around 5pm of the collision involving six private cars, a taxi and a small truck heading west towards Mei Foo.
  <br>
  <br>
  Online footage from the scene showed the taxi wedged between some of the vehicles, suffering severe damage to the rear, while at least one of the private cars had a shattered windshield.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officers said drivers of three of the vehicles were sent to hospital. One was taken to Queen Elizabeth Hospital while the other two were rushed to Caritas Medical Centre.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Transport Department said some lanes of the West Kowloon Corridor near Hing Wah Street were closed due to the incident, and advised drivers to consider alternative options.

<div class="itemFullText">
 CEO of the West Kowloon Cultural District Authority (WKCDA) Betty Fung on Thursday said the arts hub's operating deficit for the current fiscal year is expected to be HK$1 billion, similar to that of the previous year.
 <br>
  <br>
  At a press event, Fung said the number of visitors to the district last year was lower than expected, and revenue from ticket sales and museum merchandise fell 20 percent year-on-year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The hub's catering businesses also brought in lower revenues than expected, she said, adding that the authority will continuing operating on loans for the time being.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fung pledged that the WKCDA will continue to strictly manage its expenditure, while rolling out more exhibitions to attract visitors.
  <br>
  <br>
  Those planned for this year include an exhibition of more than 60 works of Spanish artist Pablo Picasso at the M+ museum between March and July, and a special exhibition featuring Chinese cuisine and related artworks at the Hong Kong Palace Museum between March and June.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Palace Museum will also hold the city's largest exhibition of ancient Egyptian treasures for decades, with some 250 objects loaned from several influential museums.
  <br>
  <br>
  The cash-scrapped authority aims to submit a development application to the Town Planning Board in the coming weeks for building housing blocks on a plot in the area spanning 20,000 square metres.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Court of Appeal has rejected a bid by the Communications Authority (CA) to challenge a ruling over the now-defunct RTHK programme
 <i>
  Headliner
 </i>
 .
 <br>
  <br>
  Last September, the court quashed the authority's finding that a 2020 episode of the satirical show breached broadcasting rules by denigrating the police and failing to ensure that its content was accurate.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CA then applied to take the matter to the Court of Final Appeal.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Thursday, the Court of Appeal dismissed the application and ordered the authority to pay costs of HK$180,000, ruling that the CA had failed to distinguish the content of the programme as fact or personal opinion.

<img alt="CUHK is launching a new school designed to cultivate mathematics talent. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790542_1_20250206170116.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The vice-chancellor of Chinese University, Professor Dennis Lo, says the institution is ready to handle any funding cut.
 <br>
  <br>
  Education minister Christine Choi said earlier that the University Grants Committee will adjust funding for the city's eight public universities over the next three years, due to a significant government deficit.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We know there are challenges in public finance. We only heard about the government adjusting funding of universities through media reports. We don’t have any confirmed information yet. But as part of society, we will go through tough times together,” Lo said at a media gathering on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CUHK president also laid out the university's next five-year plan, saying the main focus will be on enhancing the student experience, boosting innovation and research, attracting talent, improving alumni engagement and promoting internationalisation.
  <br>
  <br>
  The plan includes offering more special professor roles to attract overseas academics to join the university, as well as possibly establishing a graduate college, Lo said.
  <br>
  <br>
  CUHK also announced that its new Zhizhen School of Interdisciplinary Mathematical Sciences will open from the next academic year, with renowned mathematics professor Yau Shing-tung serving as the founding director.
  <br>
  <br>
  The school will offer an eight-year bachelor and PhD degree programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  CUHK said it hopes to have 40 students with special mathematics talent in the inaugural year, with at least 10 of them being locals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Students as young as those in secondary two can apply, without the need to take any university admission exam.

    US tariffs 'wrong' and must be rectified: Algernon Yau

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development Algernon Yau on Thursday criticised the United States for imposing an additional 10 percent tariff on all Chinese imports – which also covers goods from Hong Kong – and called on the Trump administration to rectify the situation as soon as possible.
 <br>
  <br>
  Yau also said higher US tariffs won't have much of an impact on the SAR, citing 2023 figures showing HK$6.1 billion worth of exports to the US represented only about 0.1 percent of the city's total exports.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We can see that the impact on Hong Kong should not be huge," the commerce minister told an RTHK programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But most importantly, the US ignored the fact that Hong Kong is a separate customs territory as stated in Article 116 of the Basic Law and recognised by the World Trade Organisation (WTO).
  <br>
  <br>
  "The move by the US is very unreasonable and ignores the rules of an international organisation."
  <br>
  <br>
  Yau also said Hong Kong merchants have diversified supply chains and manufacturing locations, in view of the shift in the geopolitical landscape and international trade.
  <br>
  <br>
  China has filed a complaint with the WTO over the tariffs, saying the actions by Washington are protectionist and break the trade body's rules.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on RTHK’s Hong Kong Today programme, Tim Huxley, chairman of Mandarin Shipping, said the tariffs won't have a strong negative impact on the local shipping industry.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong... is a significant shipowning centre, but it's also very much driven by shipping services. There’s a lot more to Hong Kong shipping than the container port, which is important. But when Hong Kong-owned ships are trading all over the world, they're carrying bulk cargoes, oil, as well as containers. So that will not have a huge impact.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong, remember, is very much now a service-driven economy... Maritime lawyers, bankers, insurance brokers, all these are the services that go on to make the shipping industry a large contributor to Hong Kong's economy," Huxley said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Three puppies found dead in Sheung Shui are suspected to have been poisoned, police said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Officers said they had opened an animal cruelty investigation following the discovery of the dogs' bodies near a warehouse in Lin Tong Mei.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vomit was found next to the puppies, who were around two months old, police said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another dog was found alive and was handed over to the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.
  <br>
  <br>
  No arrests had been made, police said.
  <br>
  <br>
  District councillor Corey Lau said he joined animal rescue volunteers in saving two injured dogs from the same site late last month, and they had also spotted several puppies there.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We had to settle the two rescued dogs and then we planned to return to the place and save the puppies. However, when we returned to the scene, we found that three of the puppies had already died and one was barely alive inside the warehouse," he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lau also said he had come across more than 50 cases of dog poisonings in the past three months, many of them in North District and Yuen Long.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Popular sushi chain Sushiro on Wednesday expressed concern after a video showing a boy apparently putting a communal tong in his mouth at one of its restaurants was circulated online.
 <br>
  <br>
  The video showed the boy playing with a tong – used to pick up slices of ginger – with his hand and mouth, before dropping the utensil.
  <br>
  <br>
  "All ginger slice containers and ginger slice tongs in the store have been thoroughly cleaned and disinfected," Sushiro said in a statement in response to the incident.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Sushiro Hong Kong severely condemns this behaviour and will seriously respond to this incident, including taking relevant legal actions."
  <br>
  <br>
  The chain also said it will reconsider the way it provides cutlery and plates, adding it will strictly implement quality control measures.

 The annual Operation Santa Claus charity drive raised more than HK$13.2 million this year, organisers RTHK Radio 3 and the South China Morning Post announced on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  A closing ceremony was held in Central in the evening, attended by donors, beneficiaries, as well as the senior management of RTHK and the SCMP. They presented a large cheque for the amount of HK$13,267,888 on stage.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We thank all donors for their selfless giving, which not only brought warmth to disadvantaged groups, but also provided tangible support to enhance their quality of life," said Acting Assistant Director of Broadcasting Angel Cheng.
  <br>
  <br>
  SCMP's chief operating officer, Kevin Huang added that Operation Santa Claus "has always been that benchmark and that gold standard in terms of giving back to our community."
  <br>
  <br>
  Since its establishment in 1988, the campaign has raised more than HK$396 million and supported over 364 charities.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 2024 campaign, themed "Everyday Heroes", funded 11 charities focusing on children, the elderly, environmental causes, and medical services.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A five-year-old girl who suffered a cardiac arrest during a suturing procedure at Yan Chai Hospital last May has died, the Hospital Authority said on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lai Sum-yuet had been in intensive care in Princess Margaret Hospital since her heart stopped beating for 18 minutes while she was being given stitches for a head wound.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two staff members were later charged with ill-treatment or neglect over the incident.
  <br>
  <br>
  A spokesman for the Kowloon West hospital cluster said the girl's condition deteriorated earlier this week and she died on Wednesday morning.
  <br>
  <br>
  The spokesman expressed deep sadness over the death, adding that the cluster will do what it can to help the girl's family.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The hospital cluster takes this incident very seriously and will fully cooperate with relevant judicial proceedings. The case has been referred to the coroner for follow-up," the spokesman said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 People in Hong Kong who wish to send mail to the United States expressed their frustration at the situation on Wednesday, after the US stopped receiving parcels from mainland China and the SAR.
 <br>
  <br>
  The United States Postal Service announced on Tuesday that it was temporarily suspending inbound parcels from mainland China and Hong Kong until further notice.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hongkong Post's website showed postal services regarding packets and parcels to the US were temporarily not available. But people could still mail letters to the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  A woman at the General Post Office in Central said she was baffled by the arrangement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm sending a gift to my son in college. They said I can't send a package, I can only send a letter. I'm not happy. I'm going to try SF Express and DHL," she told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another woman said she wanted to send a card and a congratulatory gift after her friend in the US had a baby.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They weren't sure why, what happened. They just said it's suspended for now. I'm going to find somewhere else and see if I can send it another way," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  RTHK reached out to various international shipping companies, and DHL's customer service office said it was still accepting packages to the US.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the company said guidelines are updated every half an hour and things may change.
  <br>
  <br>
  FedEx and UPS, meanwhile, said postal services were not affected, but it may take a longer time for parcels to arrive in the US.
  <br>
  <br>
  The arrangement came after US President Donald Trump imposed an additional 10 percent tariff on Chinese goods, and scrapped a duty-free exemption policy for low-value packages.

    Extra US tariffs on Chinese imports also cover HK

<img alt="The Hong Kong Shippers' Council said it was surprised that SAR goods are also subject to the latest US tariffs. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790374_1_20250205161715.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The additional 10 percent tariffs slapped on Chinese imports by US President Donald Trump also apply to Hong Kong, officials say.
 <br>
  <br>
  The confirmation came in a notice from US Customs and Border Protection.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong Trade Development Council (HKTDC) on Wednesday said the vast majority of goods from the SAR are now subject to the extra 10 percent tariffs, on top of regular and other potential extra duties.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong is also affected by Washington's move to end the "de minimis" exemption that meant US shoppers didn't have to pay tariffs for shipments with a retail value of US$800 or less, the HKTDC said.
  <br>
  <br>
  It noted that the US imported US$4.1 billion worth of goods from Hong Kong in 2023, with the duties paid totalling US$58 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With the additional 10 percent duty in place, Hong Kong products would have faced US$411.6 million in additional duty liability in 2023, while mainland Chinese products would have faced US$42,081 million in additional duty liability," the HKTDC said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The chairman of the Hong Kong Shippers' Council, Willy Lin, said he had been caught off-guard by Hong Kong's inclusion in the latest trade spat.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong customs and US customs do work very, very closely together to fight crime and fight drugs etc. We were quite surprised to see that Hong Kong was being labelled," Lin told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think a 10 percent tariff is not really detrimental to Hong Kong, but it is reputation-wise," he said, adding that people will question why the SAR is being targeted.
  <br>
  <br>
  In announcing the extra tariffs, Trump said China needed to stop the flow of fentanyl, a deadly opioid, into the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing has rejected accusations of complicity in the fentanyl trade and in response to Trump's move it has imposed tariffs of its own on multiple US products, while also announcing it would file a complaint with the World Trade Organization.

    Broken down train disrupts East Rail Line services

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An equipment fault that stranded an engineer's train near Tai Wo MTR Station disrupted services on the East Rail Line on Wednesday morning.
 <br>
  <br>
  Some stations saw 24-minute intervals between trains during the morning rush hour, with crowd management measures put in place.
  <br>
  <br>
  The MTR Corporation apologised for the disruption. Shortly after 1pm it said the train had been moved away from the area and normal services were resuming.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee Kim-hung, the railway firm's chief of operations engineering maintenance, said the equipment fault was related to the train's levelling system.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We found one of the sensors in the levelling system to be faulty, so we had to get it fixed and to make sure that the train can operate safely on the way back," he told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some passengers RTHK spoke to said the disruption to their journey was minimal.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Because I already learned about [the disruption] early in the morning after paying attention to the news before going to work, so there wasn't a problem for me," a woman surnamed Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  A passenger surnamed Yim said he expected a bit of a delay.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I am not in a rush, so it isn't much of an issue... I think I'll be half an hour late," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Transport Department said it asked the railway firm to "make all-out efforts to follow up and complete the necessary maintenance" to resume normal service as soon as possible.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The [department's] Emergency Transport Co-ordination Centre has been closely monitoring the traffic conditions and public transport services of various districts and affected stations," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bus companies beefed up services for some routes in response to the extra passenger demand.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) on Wednesday said the number of flu cases was still on the rise and expected the flu season to last until March or April.
 <br>
  <br>
  The CHP recorded about 200 serious or death cases involving adults since the start of the year, in which 65 percent of them were elderly people.
  <br>
  <br>
  The controller of the CHP, Edwin Tsui, said the influenza A, sub-type H1, virus is currently circulating in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Many Hong Kong people travel abroad. We cannot focus only on the situation in the SAR, we also have to look into the influenza strains in other countries," he told an RTHK radio programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Popular tourist destinations, like Japan, South Korea, Europe, North America and the mainland, are currently also having cases of influenza A (H1)."
  <br>
  <br>
  Tsui expects the number of cases to continue rising, and urged people to get vaccinated as soon as possible.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's the flu season for other countries in January every year. People travel abroad, and when they come back from their holidays, there may be outbreaks at schools and workplaces," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also urged people to go and see the doctor immediately if they are sick.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on the same programme, family doctor Lam Wing-wo said the number of appointments for flu vaccinations doubled after the Lunar New Year holiday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lam said about 20 people have made appointments for flu vaccines every day, and some belonged to the relatively low-risk age group of 18 to 50.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said there is a sufficient supply of vaccines, and urged parents to bring their children to clinics for flu jabs.

    Businesses are prepared for latest US tariffs: HKGCC

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Businesses in Hong Kong are prepared for the latest round of 10 percent tariffs that Washington imposed on Beijing, according to the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce (HKGCC).
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on RTHK’s Hong Kong Today programme on Wednesday, HKGCC CEO Patrick Yeung said the new tariffs would affect the region, as they could disrupt global supply chains.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But in recent years, Hong Kong's exports have actually become very diversified, and the markets that Hong Kong exporters deal with has also been expanded," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So in this context, we believe that the Hong Kong export sector is already relatively prepared, at least psychologically, because President Trump has already said that there will be a tariff war, and it's just started right now."
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeung noted with the SAR expanding into new markets, particularly Asean and the Middle East, and achieving positive growth, it has partially helped offset the decline in trade due to the imposition of US tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hunter Chan, Greater China economist at Standard Chartered, told the same show that compared to the previous trade war that took place during Trump's first presidency, Chinese exporters are more prepared this time round.
  <br>
  <br>
  He expects the tariffs to cause a drop of about one percentage point in Chinese GDP in the coming 12 months.
  <br>
  <br>
  The economist noted that some Chinese exporters to the US have relocated their factories overseas.
  <br>
  <br>
  They have also re-exported to other places to avoid tariffs, he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said while market sentiment remains cautious, investors are still hoping there will be positive results from any potential talks between Trump and President Xi Jinping.

    SAR eyes next-gen wealth owners in family office push

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong is looking to tap the next generation of wealth owners in its push to promote the SAR as a place for family offices, according to treasury chief Christopher Hui.
 <br>
  <br>
  The secretary for financial services and the treasury also said many family offices have to better allocate their assets in this multipolar world, a trend Hong Kong needs to take note of.
  <br>
  <br>
  On RTHK's Overview Policy programme, Hui said the territory has an institute – the Hong Kong Academy for Wealth Legacy – catering to successors of affluent families who are set to inherit and manage wealth.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are not looking for people who are already in power, but those who will potentially be in leadership roles. [The academy] provides them with exchange opportunities, allowing them to learn about Hong Kong's investment opportunities and management of financial legacies," Hui said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister said his bureau and data company Bloomberg have teamed up for an initiative, called Hong Kong Family Office Nexus, to lure family offices from around the world to either set up shop in the SAR, or expand their presence here.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bloomberg would hold a wealth management conference that will "create synergy" with the Wealth for Good in Hong Kong Summit next month, according to Hui.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added Hong Kong is on track to meet the official target of attracting at least 200 new family offices by this year.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Authorities on Tuesday announced that the Kai Tak Sports Park's main stadium will officially open on March 1.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau made the announcement on social media, where it said the 50,000-seat facility will be a “top choice venue” for international sports tournaments and large-scale entertainment events.
  <br>
  <br>
  British band Coldplay will perform there on April 9, 11, and 12.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, about 50,000 people participated in a drill at the sports park on Tuesday night, when the main stadium's retractable roof opened for the first time.
  <br>
  <br>
  They watched a Hong Kong Premier League U22 match between Kitchee and North District.
  <br>
  <br>
  With the roof open, the Environmental Protection Department also monitored audio levels to see if the noise generated at the venue could affect nearby residents.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Tourism minister Rosanna Law on Tuesday said 4.74 million tourists visited Hong Kong last month, with 3.73 million of them coming from the mainland, setting new single-month records since the pandemic.
 <br>
  <br>
  At a Legco panel meeting on economic development, Law said the figures represent a 24 and 25 percent year-on-year rise respectively.
  <br>
  <br>
  She also said Hong Kong saw a “good start” in the Year of the Snake after the territory received more than 1.2 million tourists in the first seven days of the mainland’s Lunar New Year holiday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the first seven days of this year’s mainland Spring Festival golden week, the visitor arrivals reached nearly 1.25 million, including 1.06 mainland visitors and over 180,000 non-mainland visitors. The overall hotel occupancy rate reached 90 percent,” Law said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Over 2,000 tour groups had visited Hong Kong including more than 440 tours on Friday, setting the highest single-day record for mainland tour groups visiting Hong Kong,” she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Law also said bustling crowds were seen at major tourist attractions, with visitors enjoying various districts and taking part in mega events.
  <br>
  <br>
  She pointed out that events like the new year fairs, the night parade, fireworks display, horse racing, the LNY Cup, as well as attractions like temples and hiking trails, have brought tourists unique and festive experiences.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A Hongkonger who was recently freed from a scam farm in Myanmar is in "good mental and physical condition" and has returned to the SAR on Tuesday, officials confirmed.
 <br>
  <br>
  Accompanied by members of a government task force, the woman flew out of Thailand and arrived in Hong Kong on Tuesday evening.
  <br>
  <br>
  "According to our understanding, this Hong Kong resident did not pay any ransom," Assistant Secretary for Security Paddy Yuen, who was part of the task force, told reporters at the Hong Kong International Airport.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The government is highly concerned about these cases and have maintained communication with the Hongkongers who need help and their families. We have also collaborated with Thailand, and followed up on the cases with Myanmar and Cambodia," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement released earlier, the Security Bureau said "its dedicated task force met with the Hong Kong resident in Bangkok this morning and was delighted to find that she was in good mental and physical condition".
  <br>
  <br>
  "She expressed gratitude for the active coordination and liaison of the dedicated task force with relevant units of the Thai authorities, as well as for the assistance of different parties that enabled her to return to Hong Kong shortly after her rescue to reunite with her family as soon as possible."
  <br>
  <br>
  The statement added that the bureau would continue to actively follow up on the remaining cases of SAR residents still believed to be held captive in Southeast Asia.

    Cut taxes to get international stars to HK: institute

<img alt="The Taxation Institute wants more tax cuts to lure international stars. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790229_1_20250204171155.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Taxation Institute on Tuesday urged Financial Secretary Paul Chan to provide more tax incentives to attract international singers and sports stars to Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  Ahead of the budget later this month, the institute proposed a 50 percent reduction in tax rates for non-local entertainers and sportspeople, and a tax deduction of up to 200 percent for filming activities in the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ada Ma, a council member of the institute, said these measures would boost the hotel and retail sectors and promote the new Kai Tak stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Last year we talked about a lot of entertainers or sportspeople who went to Singapore or other countries to hold concerts. And there's some debate about why they don't come to Hong Kong," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We just want to encourage them to come to Hong Kong from a tax angle, not just to compare with other countries, but we also want to promote our stadium in Kai Tak and also other businesses in Hong Kong."
  <br>
  <br>
  The institute also suggested that the top marginal salaries tax rate be lowered to 16 percent from 17 percent, and that the standard tax rate be increased from 16 to 17 percent for those earning above HK$5 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  Winnie Shek, the institute's president, said they would also like to see the waiving of stamp duty for first-time homebuyers for properties up to HK$6.5 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's part of the proposal that we advocate to improve the livelihood of Hong Kong general public. So the Hong Kong general public, probably the younger generation in Hong Kong, are still experiencing difficulties in buying their first home," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  With an estimated HK$100 billion fiscal deficit this year, the institute said it's not the best time to introduce new taxes given the uncertain global economic landscape.

<img alt="Chris Tang said the legal changes would further clarify the criminal liability of such a serious offence." src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790219_1_20250204160658.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Tuesday said it plans to double the maximum penalty for illegally manufacturing and trafficking firearms to up to 20 years behind bars.
 <br>
  <br>
  This is to bring local laws in line with a United Nations firearms protocol, which began to apply in the country, including the SAR, early last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Security minister Chris Tang said to reflect the seriousness of the crime, officials plan to make manufacturing firearms, their components and ammunition a separate offence.
  <br>
  <br>
  "No person should manufacture firearms or ammunition unless they're doing it by way of trade or business, or holds a dealer's licence. As this may be a national security threat, we will enhance the prison term to 20 years instead of 10," he said at a security panel meeting at the legislature.
  <br>
  <br>
  He told lawmakers that in the past five years, the authorities uncovered complete firearms on 12 occasions, while detecting two cases of firearm manufacturing and three cases of illegal imports.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tang said the new offence would cover those who use 3D printing techniques to manufacture a legitimate firearm, while those who print air guns without a licence could be subject to punishment under existing laws.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the government plans to table a bill to the legislature in April, and complete the legal changes within this year.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Shares in Hong Kong rallied more than three percent in the morning session, in line with an advance across Asian markets after Donald Trump and the leaders of Mexico and Canada reached deals to delay US tariffs for a month.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Hang Seng Index rallied 3.11 percent in the morning session, or 629 points, to 20,846.
  <br>
  <br>
  Markets were sent tumbling on Monday after the US president at the weekend signed off 25 percent duties against Mexico and Canada, fanning concerns for the stuttering global economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, investors were given a much-needed shot in the arm after the Trump administration said it had struck deals with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum on immigration and fentanyl, and would postpone the measures.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump added he would hold talks with Beijing "probably in the next 24 hours" to avoid new 10 percent tariffs on Chinese imports.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chinese markets remain closed due to the Lunar New Year holiday. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 People wrapped up warm on Tuesday as local temperatures fell to 12 degrees Celsius.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Observatory said districts like Tai Po, Tuen Mun and Sha Tin saw temperatures lower than that.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said an intense northeast monsoon is bringing cold weather to the coast of Guangdong, which is why temperatures dipped on Tuesday morning.
  <br>
  <br>
  One man told RTHK he wasn't too bothered by the colder weather, but made sure he wrapped up warm.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's very cold. It's much colder than I expected, but it's still pleasant right now. I've got to make sure I'm wearing two to three layers," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another person hoped it would get warmer again.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I don't like this. I feel more comfortable with warmer weather," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Centre for Health Protection reminded the public, especially the elderly and people with chronic illnesses, to protect their health.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Elderly people have less insulating fat beneath their skin to keep them warm, and their body temperature control mechanisms may be weaker. Their body may not be able to appropriately respond to the cold weather," a spokesman said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Forecasters said temperatures would rise slightly in the coming few days, but would drop again over the weekend.

    Lawmakers urge govt departments to cut spending

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Legislators on Tuesday said government departments should study ways to reduce spending to tackle a fiscal deficit estimated to be just below HK$100 billion.
 <br>
  <br>
  Federation of Trade Unions lawmaker Bill Tang told a radio programme that the government should review the size and work of the civil service to save public money.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For example, among more than 2,000 civil servants in the Labour Department, around 600 of them are working on employment services, which are not related to law enforcement. For employment services, shouldn't we consider outsourcing them to the third sector?" he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tang said the Labour Department spends around HK$600 to HK$800 million annually on employment services, but some work could be delegated to non-profit organisations instead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on the same programme, Liberal Party chairman Peter Shiu said the administration should look for ways to cut spending on education and healthcare.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our birth rate is very low. We now have around half as many children as we did a decade ago. But we don't see primary education fees being reduced by half. Instead, it keeps going up every year. We need to look into this," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  On whether HK$2 subsidised transport fares for the over 60s should be adjusted, Tang said he thinks distance-based fares should be implemented instead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Shiu said officials could consider setting usage limits or excluding some people still in work from getting the subsidised fares, depending on which sector they are employed in.
  <br>
  <br>
  Financial Secretary Paul Chan will deliver his budget speech on February 26.

    Hong Kong's economy grew by 2.5 percent in 2024

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's economic growth slowed to 2.5 percent in 2024, officials said on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The figure matched government forecasts, but was down from the 3.2 percent growth recorded in 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  Figures from the Census and Statistics Department showed a relatively faster pace of growth in the last quarter of 2024 – at 2.4 percent year-on-year – compared to 1.9 percent in the third quarter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Looking ahead, a government spokesperson said the economy is expected to register further growth in 2025, despite heightened uncertainties in the external environment.
  <br>
  <br>
  The spokesperson said while US "protectionist policies" could affect Hong Kong's exports, supportive measures from Beijing will help offset some of the impact and the authorities will continue to take various measures to spur growth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Terence Chong, an economics professor at Chinese University, said the city's latest growth was partially driven by stimulus measures from Beijing last September, as well as supportive policies in Chief Executive John Lee's Policy Address last October.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The fourth quarter performance was actually much better than the third quarter's, basically it was driven by the exports of services and also by the government expenditure," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But if you look at the consumption and also investment, they dropped."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chong said falling retail sales are among the most concerning components weighing on the SAR's growth.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Looking ahead, we may [also] expect some reductions in the export sectors, because of the trade tensions between the US and other economies like China," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chong said he expects Hong Kong's annual economic growth to swing between two and four percent in the coming year, as a declining property sector gradually stabilises due to interest rate cuts boosting transaction volumes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I would say that the property markets have reached the bottom and the sector will bounce back in the first half of 2025," he said, adding that the city's stock markets are also picking up steam.

<img alt="A government spokesman says retail sales declined further in December, partly due to more Hong Kong residents travelling abroad during the holidays. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790100_1_20250203170154.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Retail sales dropped 9.7 percent in December year-on-year, marking the 10th consecutive month of declines.
 <br>
  <br>
  According to figures from the Census and Statistics Department released on Monday, the value of total retail sales in December was estimated at HK$32.8 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  The decrease followed a revised 7.3 percent fall in November.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sales of motor vehicles and parts saw a sharp decline of 36.3 percent, while those of furniture and fixtures saw a 22 percent fall.
  <br>
  <br>
  A government spokesman said retail sales declined further in December, partly due to more Hong Kong residents travelling abroad during the holidays.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the provisional data showed retail sales for the whole of 2024 decreased by 7.3 percent when compared with the previous year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The near-term performance of the retail sector would continue to be affected by the change in consumption patterns of visitors and residents," a government spokesman said.
  <br>
  <br>
  But it said the retail sector would benefit due to various measures introduced by the central government and proactive efforts by the SAR authorities to promote tourism, boost market sentiment and increase employment earnings.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bond Law, the executive director of the Retail Management Association, said while the sector is expecting a continuous decline in business for January and February, there is some cause for optimism.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There is hope for the increased business from mainland tourists, especially with the resumption of the multiple-entry individual visit scheme for Shenzhen residents," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Members are observing changes in tourist foot traffic, spending patterns and basket sizes. While foot traffic may increase, purchasing power remains weak and we need time to see the foot effects."

 Housing minister Winnie Ho said on Monday that a plan to criminalise serious abuse of public housing  isn't about prosecuting people or getting them out of their homes, but ensuring the proper use of public resources.
 <br>
  <br>
  Under proposed legal changes, people deemed to have seriously abused their tenancy, such as subletting their flat or using it for commercial purposes, would risk a prison term of up to 12 months and a fine as high as HK$500,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho said if all goes smoothly, officials plan to table the relevant bill to the legislature in the next quarter, with a view to the law coming into effect in the second quarter of next year at the earliest.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a Legco housing panel meeting, she told lawmakers that tenants would be allowed to work from home, as long as business activities don't take place inside the unit.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Many people nowadays work from home. Also, many people are interested in making some handicrafts and they sell them somewhere else, instead of using the flat for commercial purposes. All these will be allowed," the minister said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho said tenants won't be allowed to "run the flat like a tuition centre or a gym room" with many people going in and out or price lists available, even if they also live in the unit.
  <br>
  <br>
  She called on tenants to exercise caution if they use the address for business registration purposes, because it might raise suspicions.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister stressed that the authorities will use common sense when they handle breaches of the rules.
