<div class="itemFullText">
 Tourists and locals were treated to a spectacular Lunar New Year fireworks display over Victoria Harbour on Thursday, the second day of the Year of the Snake.
 <br>
  <br>
  Divided into nine named pyrotechnic scenes, the show began with "A Brand New Beginning", featuring the lucky number eight in red.
  <br>
  <br>
  It then moved on to gold ingots, symbolising prosperity and abundance.
  <br>
  <br>
  The eighth scene "Double Luck and Goodness" showed six panda faces, representing the number of pandas in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  The show concluded with "Year of the Snake". This scene filled the sky with star-patterned pyrotechnics to the sound of Chinese gongs and drums.
  <br>
  <br>
  The display began at 8 pm and lasted 23 minutes. It was coordinated by the Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau.

 Thousands of people gathered around Victoria Harbour on Thursday for the New Year firework display, traditionally held on the second day of the Lunar New Year.
 <br>
  <br>
  A secondary school student told RTHK she had arrived at 3.30 pm.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I wanted to enjoy the festive atmosphere, and get a good spot. This is the first time I have come to see the fireworks. I think the weather is quite good today. I decided to go out and see how much better watching the fireworks is, compared to seeing them on television," she said, adding that she brought a book and some food to kill time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another man said he is looking forward to seeing the panda patterns, which appear in one of the scenes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I came at around one, and I think it's worth it. I brought a tripod and a camera to take photos. I think fireworks are so beautiful," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  A tourist from Shenzhen said he had come to Hong Kong just for the display.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think having more than 20,000 fireworks will be magnificent, and the themes are also very meaningful. I was busy seeing my relatives on the first day of the Lunar New Year, so I missed the fireworks in Guangzhou. I can also appreciate the view of Victoria Harbour, while seeing the fireworks here," the man said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police closed off a number of roads on both sides of the harbour ahead of the display.

    Lunar New Year restaurant reservations up 10 percent

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A catering representative said on Thursday that reservations at Chinese restaurants over Lunar New Year were up ten percent from last year.
 <br>
  <br>
  Association for Hong Kong Catering Services Management chairman, Leung Chun-wah, said despite a number of Hong Kong residents travelling during the holidays, those who stayed in the city were willing to spend.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Lunar New Year is the happiest festival for Chinese people. The number of people flying out was not too many, somewhere between 300,000 to 400,000 people. People still have to eat their meals, and they want to be happy while doing so. So, our business and reservation numbers both saw a ten percent increase," he said on an RTHK programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  A total of 357,927 Hong Kong residents departed the city on Wednesday, according to Immigration Department figures.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, Leung said restaurants generally saw just one round of customers early in the evening, as people's eating habits had changed during the Covid pandemic.
  <br>
  <br>
  "People eat early and leave early. We don't really see a second round of customers - those who go to restaurants at 8:30 pm for dinner," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Leung also noted that customers were spending less than before the pandemic.
  <br>
  <br>
  This year, the average spending per person was between HK$350 to HK$400 - similar to last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that the resumption of the multi-entry visa for Shenzhen residents only benefited restaurants in tourist spots, which recorded an around 20 percent increase in business.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Monetary Authority on Thursday said there's a chance that interest rates in the city will remain at "relatively high levels" for a while, after the US central bank kept the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Federal Reserve had left key overnight interest rates steady in the 4.25 percent to 4.50 percent target range, with its chair Jerome Powell saying there would be no rush to cut them again.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong's de-facto central bank said in response that the policy decision was "in line with market expectations".
  <br>
  <br>
  "However, the pace of future rate cuts remains uncertain as it is dependent on US inflation and labour market data developments, the effect of previous rate cuts, as well as the impact of fiscal, economic and trade policies adopted by the new administration on economic activity," the authority said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Interest rates in Hong Kong might still remain at relatively high levels for some time, and the extent and pace of future US interest rate cuts are subject to considerable uncertainty."
  <br>
  <br>
  The public should exercise caution when making property purchase, mortgage or other borrowing decisions, it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The authority added it would continue to closely monitor market developments and maintain monetary and financial stability.
  <br>
  <br>
  It stressed that the city's financial and monetary markets have continued to operate in a smooth and orderly manner.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Market liquidity condition has remained stable, and the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate stays steady," the authority said.

    Fortune urges practical measures, says rural chief

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A rural leader has urged officials to come up with policies that are practical rather than window dressing in the upcoming budget, after drawing a fortune stick for Hong Kong in an annual Lunar New Year ritual.
 <br>
  <br>
  On Thursday morning, Heung Yee Kuk chairman Kenneth Lau picked a No 24 "neutral" stick at the Che Kung Temple in Sha Tin.
  <br>
  <br>
  The stick corresponds to a prophecy that roughly translates to: "Live a life without wrongdoing, it is only greed that stirs up trouble; with the help of noble people, don't waste your efforts."
  <br>
  <br>
  Interpreting the message, Lau said it means doing the right thing and that Hong Kong needs the support of the country. He also appealed to Financial Secretary Paul Chan to roll out practical economic measures in his budget, which will be unveiled on February 26.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I hope the financial secretary will particularly take care of the middle class and the underprivileged, and not increase fees or taxes," Lau said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When putting in resources, officials should not do things that are just window dressing, they should be practical... Under this global economic situation and high interest rate environment, the government has to promote the economy."
  <br>
  <br>
  Each year, the head of the rural body goes to the Che Kung Temple on the second day of the Lunar New Year to draw a fortune stick.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lau initially thought he drew the number 20 stick, but later said he had made a mistake.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, the chairman of the Sha Tin Rural Committee drew an ill-omened No 82 stick for the Sha Tin community.
  <br>
  <br>
  Of the 96 sticks in the cup, 35 are “positive” sticks, 17 are “negative” ones, while 44 are "neutral".

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Lunar New Year parade took place in Tsim Sha Tsui on Wednesday, with Chief Executive John Lee opening the event.
 <br>
  <br>
  In his speech, the Chief Executive told the crowd that there was no better place to ring in the Chinese New Year than Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Only in Hong Kong, the world's East-meets-West centre for cultural exchange and day-and-night entertainment, all around town you'll be greeted by the magnificent spectacle of our festivities and the warm hospitality of the people of Hong Kong, as we share the joy of the year with all of you. I wish you all a happy, healthy, and eventful Year of the Snake."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee said this year's parade, themed "Unfold a Year of Good Fortune", featured 55 performing groups and floats, which showcased Hong Kong, as well as 14 countries and regions.
  <br>
  <br>
  They are "here in the world city of Hong Kong to dance, sing and perform, skip, juggle, cheerlead and otherwise amaze and delight you in this most auspicious of days," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The night parade started at the Hong Kong Cultural Centre Piazza at 8 pm, then headed down Canton Road, Haiphong Road, and Nathan Road, before ending at the Sheraton Hong Kong Hotel and Towers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier, organiser Hong Kong Tourism Board said it expected around 100,000 people to turn up for the event.
  <br>
  <br>
  As part of the Spring Festival celebrations, Lee added that the floats and some of Wednesday night's performances will move to Lam Tsuen for Thursday's Hong Kong Well-wishing Festival. The floats will be on display there until February 13.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other festivities include a 23-minute firework show on both sides of Victoria Harbour on the second day of the Lunar New Year, as well as horse racing at Sha Tin on the third day.

 Crowds gathered in Tsim Sha Tsui on Wednesday for the Lunar New Year parade .
 <br>
  <br>
  Themed "Unfold a Year of Good Fortune", it features nine floats showcasing unique elements from the SAR, alongside 46 performing groups from around the globe.
  <br>
  <br>
  It will start at the Hong Kong Cultural Centre Piazza, then head down Canton Road, Haiphong Road, and Nathan Road, before ending at the Sheraton Hong Kong Hotel and Towers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Road closures and traffic diversions have been put in place.
  <br>
  <br>
  A woman surnamed Leung said she came to support her daughter, who will be performing in the parade.
  <br>
  <br>
  "My daughter will be dancing, so I must show my support. I have been here since around 3 pm, after sending her to the assembly venue. I am very excited about seeing her, and it is also my first time to see the parade in person," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  A tourist surnamed Jia from Northeast China said she had come to Hong Kong for the festive atmosphere.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think Hong Kong has a very strong Lunar New Year vibe and I love the culture around the Greater Bay Area. I know there will be a parade tonight and fireworks tomorrow, and I booked my hotel last November," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  A Shenzhen tourist surnamed Huang said this is her second time at the parade..
  <br>
  <br>
  "Last year, I did not pick a good spot. So this year, I learned from my past experience and arrived at 2.30 pm. The location I am in is the performance area, so the lighting will be nicer," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Huang said she found the float designs delicate and the performing groups from around the world very attractive.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Tourism Board expects around 100,000 people to turn up for the event.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Airport Authority’s acting chief executive Vivian Cheung on Wednesday said she expected passenger numbers to be about 30 percent higher this Lunar New Year holiday, when compared to last year.
 <br>
  <br>
  She said the airport had been operating smoothly and around 160,000 people had passed through on the first day of the Year of the Snake. That's about 20 percent fewer than on the peak days earlier in the week.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The last few days were a peak period and the airport saw around 200,000 people a day, which almost reached the level before the pandemic,” Cheung said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “For example, we have around 75 pairs of flights between Hong Kong and 13 Japanese cities every day, meaning there’s a flight every 15 minutes. It’s very convenient for Hongkongers to travel,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cheung also expected flight movements this year to return to the pre-pandemic level, with the airport seeing around 1,100 flights taking off and landing each day.

 People headed to the Lam Tsuen Wishing Tree in Taipo on Wednesday, a traditional event on the first day of Lunar New Year.
 <br>
  <br>
  It's believed that throwing a placard with one's wishes, and a mandarin, onto the tree will make the wish come true.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I wished everyone good fortune, good health and for wishes to come true. And for a better year. Everyone went through Covid over the past few years, I hope everyone's luck will improve every year. My grandson successfully threw the placard onto the tree on his first try. It's the first time, we got so lucky," said a man surnamed Pang, who arrived at around 9 am.
  <br>
  <br>
  A boy surnamed Pang said it took him four times to make his wish.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I threw the placard a few times before it landed on the tree. It's so difficult. The wind affects where it lands, and it falls off. I had to jump to make sure it hung on the tree," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I wished for better exam results because my scores are bad. I hope I get better grades in Maths, English and Chinese. I also wished to go to Japan because the place has a lot of food and things that I like," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sophie, who's originally from England, said she came early to avoid the crowds.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We thought it was going to be very busy. We made a wish on the tree, and we put a wish in the lotus pond as well. On my card, I said I wanted a year of adventure and fun. I've only lived in Hong Kong for four months, and I have lots to learn about this beautiful city," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tourism minister Rosanna Law was also at the venue. She wished for Hong Kong athletes to achieve good results in all competitions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to the press, she said she hoped tourists would enjoy a happy Lunar New Year in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have a float parade tonight, fireworks for tomorrow, horse racing on the third day, and the Lunar New Year Cup on the fourth day. There's also a lot of activities at temples, and today is also a great day for hiking. I believe everyone will spend a happy Spring Festival in Hong Kong," Law said.
  <br>
  <br>
  This year, the Lam Tsuen Well-wishing Bazaar has been scaled up, with a Tai Po district council member saying it will boost the festive atmosphere and local economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  The event, introduced last year, starts on Wednesday and runs until February 12.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a RTHK programme, Lo Hiu-fung said he expected an increase in footfall of at least 10 percent this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We saw a lot of nearby residents and tourists coming to the bazaar at night, last year. So this year, we decided to host the event again, and we made it bigger. The number of food stalls have doubled to more than 20," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the event would again feature floats this year.

    Space oil drug problem worsened alarmingly last year

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Security Chris Tang said the space oil drug problem in Hong Kong has got worse at a rapid rate over the past year.
 <br>
  <br>
  The government is planning to list etomidate, a main component of the substance, as a dangerous drug on February 14.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on RTHK’s Overview Policy programme, Tang said the number of cases related to space oil increased drastically last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Actually the situation has worsened rapidly over the past year. The number of cases in 2024 was seven times more than in 2023, and the number of those arrested increased 11 fold. The amount of space oil drug seized also increased at least four times," Tang said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We can see how serious the problem is and therefore, we need to handle it through legislation,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tang said the government will boost education related to the substance on social media and schools, and also equip teachers to help identify students who use the drug.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, Tang also spoke about the proposed legislation on protection of critical infrastructures. He said the legislation is to ensure the operations of key facilities such as water and electricity, if they come under cyber-attacks.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said large corporations will have the responsibility to protect their computer systems, and to report to the government if they face cyber-attacks, as well as having a contingency plan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tang said individuals and small businesses will not be affected by the proposed law.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Citybus has said it is providing training for their drivers to help them better understand the needs of older passengers.
 <br>
  <br>
  More than 850 bus captains have attended Citybus' one-day training programme since it was rolled out last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  As part of the training, drivers put on special outfits and goggles to restrict their sight and movement, and carry canes to simulate what senior passengers experience when they take the bus.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some elderly residents were also invited to the training sessions to tell drivers what they can do to make their journeys safer and more comfortable.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Currently, Citybus is the only bus operator in Hong Kong to provide such training to our bus captains. We will continue to provide this kind of training. We forecast that by 2026, all of our 4,000 [drivers] will have attended such training to provide them knowledge on how to take care of our elderly passengers in Hong Kong,” Citybus General Manager Roger Wong said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong also revealed that there are about 100 bus captain spots vacant at Citybus, despite recording a net increase of more than 400 drivers last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the bus company would focus more on recruitment and come up with different campaigns to attract prospective drivers.
  <br>
  <br>
  In August of last year, Citybus rolled out a new recruitment campaign to look for drivers who want to work three days a week.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bus operator said it received more than 1,000 applications from the recruitment drive, and hired and trained 160 people.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) on Tuesday said three more children are in intensive care with severe flu.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, the centre said the first case involved a six-year-old boy with good past health. It said his household contacts so far have no symptoms and there was no flu outbreak at his school.
  <br>
  <br>
  The second involves a 12-year-old boy with an underlying illness. He lives in a school dormitory and seven other students from the same school recently had upper respiratory symptoms.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The above-mentioned two boys had no travel history during the incubation period. An initial investigation revealed that they did not receive 2024/25 SIV [seasonal influenza vaccine]," a spokesman for the CHP said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The third case is an eight-year-old boy with good past health. He was diagnosed with flu and another serious infection.
  <br>
  <br>
  The centre says this brings to eight the number of severe flu cases in children, since the flu season began this month. It said six of the children were unvaccinated against seasonal flu.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday visited a Lunar New Year fair in Tuen Mun, before the fairs end early tomorrow morning on the first day of the Year of the Snake.
 <br>
  <br>
  He bought 10 gladiolus, or sword lilies, which symbolise perfectness and moving forward, along with a pinwheel for good deeds and good luck, and an ornament that represents connecting the community together.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to the press, Lee said he thinks business at the fair will improve later in the evening.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The popularity of stalls and products differ. Some are doing well, while some are still struggling. I believe when it gets darker, business at the fair will get better as we get closer to the New Year," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee gave citizens his best wishes and called for Hongkongers to shop at the fair.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It will be the Year of the Snake tomorrow. The snake is agile, which indicates that Hong Kong will seek and respond to changes. I wish everyone good luck, have a great time during the Lantern Festival and other activities, and also good health," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Financial Secretary Paul Chan went to a fair at Victoria Park, where he chatted with a few stall owners and took pictures with citizens.
  <br>
  <br>
  He spent around HK$1,000 to purchase a giant panda plush toy, a cushion, a pinwheel, and some orchids.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister said he hopes more citizens will visit Lunar New Year fairs across the city ahead of the festival.

 Vendors were on the fence on Tuesday about how much revenue they would generate as people flocked to wet markets to buy food for their family reunion dinners.
 <br>
  <br>
  Reunion dinner on Lunar New Year’s Eve is traditionally regarded as the most important meal of the year in Chinese culture.
  <br>
  <br>
  One man said he spent over HK$1,000 shopping at the wet market.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I picked up things like clams and shrimp. They are a little pricier this year, about 10 percent more than last year. But it’s New Year, so that’s expected,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  A vegetable seller at Kowloon City Market said business was pretty rough overall, noting that lettuce was the only top seller because it symbolises the generation of wealth in Chinese.
  <br>
  <br>
  But a poultry vendor at the same market was not worried about her sales.
  <br>
  <br>
  “People usually buy one or two chickens and don’t mind the price. They are willing to spend big as long as the chickens are fresh. Whether it’s HK$300, HK$400 or HK$500 it doesn’t matter,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “During New Year, everything is a bit pricier and that’s just part of the festive atmosphere. People don't even bother asking about the price.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Simon Wong, president of the Federation of Restaurants and Related Trades, said business activity for the catering sector was better than expected.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said that while many Hongkongers travel to the mainland during the holiday, those who stay in the city are more willing to dine out.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Overall, I believe business over the Lunar New Year holiday is more than 10 percent better than last year,” he said.

 Chief Executive John Lee issued a Lunar New Year message on Tuesday, saying that Hong Kong would be agile and resilient in the Year of the Snake, and would continue to seek innovation and change.
 <br>
  <br>
  In the pre-recorded message, John Lee said the city has had a year full of cheer, including the gift of two giant pandas from Beijing and the birth of two panda cubs - which will greet the public in mid-February.
  <br>
  <br>
  The video also featured various snake and panda decorations, along with a variety of Lunar New Year specialities.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee also wished good health and good fortune to Hongkongers in the coming year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This year is the Year of the Snake - which is nimble and agile, and symbolises prosperity and wealth. This year, Hong Kong will again show off its agility, and resilience, with flexible thinking - to innovate, reform and develop," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "My wife and I wish Hong Kong's people good health in the Year of the Snake. May you have joy, prosperity and good fortune," he added.

 Cross border coach operators will increase their frequency of services by 20 percent over the Lunar New Year holiday, the Hong Kong Guangdong Boundary Crossing Bus Association said today.
 <br>
  <br>
  Vice chairman Freeman Cheung told an RTHK radio programme that he expects the city to see the highest number of Hongkongers heading north on Thursday and Friday, while the number of travellers returning from the mainland is expected to peak on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Usually, cross-border coaches are less than 50 percent full. But during the Lunar New Year holiday and other festivities, this can rise to 80 percent - or even 100 percent,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cheung welcomed the government's decision not to operate border checkpoints beyond the usual hours during the period, as he expects there will only be a slightly higher flow of tourists on the second day of the holiday due to the fireworks display.
  <br>
  <br>
  He believes by arranging more coaches at hotspots such as Wan Chai, West Kowloon and Prince Edward an hour after the fireworks show – which he expected to be the peak period of travellers heading home – they would be able to divert the flow of visitors.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also said the move would allow operators to allocate more resources for the rush hour during the daytime.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on the same programme, local florist Yeung Siu-lung pointed out that business had improved by 10 percent compared with the same period last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said he had not raised prices in recent years amid the poor economy and inflation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Apart from selling orchids at the Victoria Park flower market, he also grows and sells them in Yuen Long.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The people who buy more flowers tend to drive, and they get pots. Why do I say business is up by 10 percent this year? It's because the old customers have recommended the market to new customers. There are more unfamiliar faces,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeung also said that there was a need to boost sales to make customers happy on the final full day of the market, before it closes tomorrow morning.

 A Hong Kong resident who had been detained for illegal work in Myanmar returned to the SAR late Monday night.
 <br>
  <br>
  Accompanied by members of a government task force, the man arrived at the Hong Kong International Airport via a flight from Bangkok. He was subsequently taken to the airport police station.
  <br>
  <br>
  During a press briefing, Assistant Secretary for Security Paddy Yuen said the man is very happy to be back.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He was grateful to see us head to Thailand to follow up on his case, and very excited to be able to return to Hong Kong, and reunite with his family before the Lunar New Year," Yuen said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The official said he won’t disclose additional details of the case, including whether a ransom was paid, to avoid complicating the future course of action.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also thanked Chinese diplomats in Southeast Asia, as well as local authorities for assisting in the rescue operation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yuen added that work is still underway to bring the rest of the victims home.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We must also remember that there are still ten Hong Kong residents who have not been released," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The assistant security chief reminded Hongkongers to stay vigilant against job offers that promise high salaries without the need for professional skills, or require the person to transport goods between places.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The government office responsible for providing insolvency services has issued an apology after magnetic tapes containing information of about 76,000 people went missing.
 <br>
  <br>
  However, it stressed chances of a data leak is "extremely low".
  <br>
  <br>
  The Official Receiver's Office revealed on Monday that seven magnetic backup tapes were lost while being delivered from Immigration Tower to Queensway Government Offices on December 23 last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the office only received a report about the incident last Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The [Official Receiver's Office] expresses sincere apologies for the loss and for the delay in reporting the incident," a spokesperson for the office said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tapes were stored in a locked protective case and information on them had been encrypted by a system "used extensively in government and military applications", according to the office.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The [Official Receiver's Office] considers that the risk of leakage of personal data from the tapes is extremely low. Based on the current investigation, there is no evidence that the data contained on the tapes has been read or compromised," the spokesperson said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The tapes contained personal data of about 76,000 individuals, including creditors of insolvency cases and serving staff of the [Official Receiver's Office]."
  <br>
  <br>
  The office said it has made changes to existing procedures and is conducting a thorough investigation, including on the delay in reporting the incident to senior management.
  <br>
  <br>
  Appropriate disciplinary actions will be taken, the office added.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Director of Immigration on Monday said he is confident that Hong Kong’s border checkpoints have enough capacity to handle an influx of tourists during the Lunar New Year holiday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Border crossings won’t operate beyond the usual hours during the period.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a year-end press conference, Benson Kwok said he expects 7.3 million land border crossings during the eight-day holiday.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Our border capacity is enough to handle the large crowds of tourists. But of course we hope the travellers will arrive or depart Hong Kong out of the peak periods, so that they don’t waste too much time at the control points,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kwok also said there were a total of 298 million inbound and outbound trips last year, 40 percent up from 2023 and close to pre-pandemic levels.
  <br>
  <br>
  On 10 Hongkongers held prisoner in Southeast Asia and forced to take part in scams, Kwok said the department will continue to assist security officials in trying to get them released.
  <br>
  <br>
  “There are quite a lot of challenges but the Immigration Department is supporting the special team to provide assistance to the assistance seekers,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We sincerely hope that our special team can help them to come back to Hong Kong in the very very near future, and even to enjoy Chinese New Year with their family members.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, Kwok said children aged seven or above with an SAR passport and permanent Hong Kong identity card will soon be able to use e-channels at control points.
  <br>
  <br>
  The immigration chief said he expects around 200,000 children will benefit from the new measure.

<img alt="TWGH CROSS Centre’s clinical psychologist Christopher Sin, left, said a lack of understanding would cause more people to use the drug. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1789324_1_20250127171710.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A survey by a drug counselling centre under the Tung Wah Group of Hospitals found that 30 percent of respondents were unaware of the harmful effects of the "space oil drug."
 <br>
  <br>
  The centre polled around 1,600 citizens aged between 15 and 56 from September to December last year. About half of them were under the age of 15, and almost 80 percent of them were students.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also found that more than 70 percent of those surveyed mistakenly believed nicotine and synthetic cannabinoids were the main ingredient of the drug.
  <br>
  <br>
  The hospital group's CROSS Centre’s clinical psychologist Christopher Sin on Monday said a lack of understanding would lead to more young people using the drug.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If their perception of space oil is [that] the ingredients are nicotine or cannabinoids, then they will easily be in contact with this kind of harmful substance under peer influence or via internet advertisements," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Speaking of the long term, if they don't have a [good] understanding of the ingredients, this will increase the chances of [them] depending on this substance to manage their life hassles or other life issues," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sin pointed out that respondents might also want to try the drug out of curiosity.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the centre said more than 10 percent of its current 526 substance abuse cases had taken the space oil drug. Among them, 55 percent were minors, with the youngest being 12.
  <br>
  <br>
  The charity called for more promotion of the harmful effects through various social media platforms.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also urged parents and schools to take action if they think youngsters have been taking the substance while being aware of some of the tell-tale side effects, such as losing control of one's emotions, loss of balance and convulsive movements.

 As the Year of the Snake approaches, various floats and international performing groups are putting the finishing touches on their preparations for the annual Chinese New Year night parade.
 <br>
  <br>
  Organised by the Hong Kong Tourism Board and sponsored by Cathay Pacific, the parade will kick off at the Hong Kong Cultural Centre Piazza, winding its way through Canton, Haiphong and Nathan roads, before reaching the Sheraton Hong Kong Hotel and Towers.
  <br>
  <br>
  This year’s festivities, under the theme "Unfold a Year of Good Fortune", will feature nine floats showcasing unique elements from the SAR, alongside 46 performing groups from around the globe, to highlight the city's reputation as an events capital.

 Officials closed the Cheung Sha Wan Lunar New Year fair for several hours on Monday after some stalls were damaged by strong winds overnight.
 <br>
  <br>
  Goods were left scattered on the ground and scaffolding was damaged, with a similar scene at a fair in Tsz Wan Shan.
  <br>
  <br>
  A woman selling orchids at Cheung Sha Wan told RTHK she thinks she has lost tens of thousands of dollars due to the damage.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For the entire year, the two days before the Lunar New Year is the most important for business. This is really miserable for farmers," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Environment Secretary Tse Chin-wan inspected the scene in the morning.
  <br>
  <br>
  The fair reopened at around 3pm after damaged scaffolding was removed.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Radio Television Hong Kong (RTHK) is launching a new season of the series "The Nitty Gritty of Law" with the Law Society next month to explore different legal issues with experts in the field.
 <br>
  <br>
  RTHK assistant director Vincent Lee told a launch ceremony on Monday that the inaugural season of the programme, which was solely in audio form, had been well-received.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the coming season will also be aired on television and online platforms, while introducing a radio drama to promote legal knowledge.
  <br>
  <br>
  Roden Tong, the president of the Law Society, said he hopes audiences can learn more about the law through the programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  The programme, which has 16 episodes, will be aired on Sundays with the first episode launching on February 2.
  <br>
  <br>
  The episodes will first be aired from 12.15pm to 1pm on RTHK Radio 1, before being broadcast on RTHK TV 31 on 7pm. They are also available on RTHK's website and mobile app.
  <br>
  <br>
  Legal experts, such as former secretary for justice Elsie Leung and a number of ex-Law Society heads, will be invited to the show to discuss various legal topics, such as family law, criminal law, and intellectual property.

 Monday marks the 28th day of the 12th lunar month.
 <br>
  <br>
  According to Chinese tradition, it is a day designated for "spring cleaning", when families deep-clean their homes in the run up to the Lunar New Year and put up new "fai chuns" -- red banners bearing auspicious phrases.
  <br>
  <br>
  While the market is flooded with mass produced, digitally-printed "fai chuns", many people still prefer the more traditional, handwritten ones that are becoming quite rare these days.
  <br>
  <br>
  RTHK visited an elderly calligraphy master in North Point, and asked him why it's so important to preserve this traditional craft.

<img alt="Rosanna Law says the government hopes to review the positioning of performance venues by the end of this year. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1789282_1_20250127121148.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism Rosanna Law said the government would conduct a strategic review of the use of the city's performance venues.
 <br>
  <br>
  Law expected this would be completed by the end of the year.
  <br>
  <br>
  In an interview with Ta Kung Pao published on Monday, Law said Hong Kong would have more venues to stage more kinds of performances and sports events.
  <br>
  <br>
  These include the Kai Tak Sports Park, and the WestK Performing Arts Centre that is set to be completed next year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Airport Authority also recently announced that it would build the second phase of the AsiaWorld-Expo to expand the total exhibition space to 100,000 square metres.
  <br>
  <br>
  The project is set for completion in 2028.
  <br>
  <br>
  “This venue has a favourable location, [it’s] near the airport, and [it’s also] convenient for Zhuhai and Macau travellers to head to. I have high hopes [for the venue],” Law said.
  <br>
  <br>
  With more venues, she said the SAR would be able to stage more events.
  <br>
  <br>
  “If there is a better allocation, world-class venues can carry out more world-class performances.”
  <br>
  <br>
  In another interview with Wen Wei Po, the minister stressed the city has to focus on both quality and quantity for tourism development.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Kaylin Hsieh has become the third Hong Kong fencer in history to win a Grand Prix, after defeating world number six Nelli Differt in the women's epée final in Doha.
 <br>
  <br>
  Hsieh, 23, beat the Estonian 15-7 on Monday for her first victory against the 34-year-old in six attempts.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SAR fencer joins Olympic gold medallists Edgar Cheung and Vivian Kong in winning a Grand Prix for Hong Kong, China.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hsieh wrote on social media that she started the competition with a cold and struggled to find rhythm, but decided to try to fight through it to see how far she could go.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Sometimes life throws challenges at you when you least expect it and you just have to find a way to push through," she wrote, calling her triumph an unforgettable moment.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This gold medal is not just a milestone for me. It's a reminder of the power of resilience and mindset."
  <br>
  <br>
  Hsieh, currently ranked 28th in the world, last topped a podium in international competition in the under-17 World Championships in 2018.
  <br>
  <br>
  She snatched a bronze at the World Cup in Vancouver last November.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hsieh represented the SAR in her Olympic debut in Tokyo.
  <br>
  <br>
  She was an individual and team champion representing the University of Notre Dame in the US during the 2022 NCAA fencing tournament.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A Hospital Authority (HA) dietician told people to avoid festive fat traps and overeating during the Lunar New Year holiday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Registered dietitian Ivy Chua from the HA said people can order healthier dishes when they are having their reunion dinner at restaurants.
  <br>
  <br>
  “If you really want to eat out, try to control the portion and the food choices you are having. For example, you can choose some better quality protein, something like  steamed fish is a really lower fat protein source,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  People can get rid of chicken skin, and avoid eating sauces to have a healthier diet, she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chua also said people could select high-fibre food, like vegetables, so as to eat less meat.
  <br>
  <br>
  To avoid overeating before the main reunion dinner, Chua said people could have high-fibre snacks before the big meal.
  <br>
  <br>
  She also reminded citizens, especially diabetes patients and people who have high blood pressure and high blood lipids, not to have too many Chinese New Year cakes and deep-fried traditional snacks as they contain a lot of oil, salt and sugar.
  <br>
  <br>
  “There is a lot of food that is really high in calories, especially in fat and sugar. I'd recommend everyone to try limit their portion of the food, especially the traditional snacks, and actually they can find some healthier snacks to replace it,” Chua said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chua suggested that people can make healthier snacks at home such as rice crackers, low calorie jelly with fruits, or plain popcorn with a little bit salt.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's public hospitals are ready to handle an expected rise in flu cases during the Lunar New Year, Hospital Authority (HA) chief executive Tony Ko said on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a television programme, Ko said the authority has taken steps to prepare for the peak flu season.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have arranged additional manpower and asked colleagues to avoid taking many leaves during that period. We have also increased the number of hospital beds, so we are confident in our ability to handle an uptick in service demand," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ko, who will step down in July after serving for almost six years, said it is an appropriate time to leave and that he has no regrets.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have successfully overcome many challenges like the Covid pandemic. Looking at the Hospital Authority now, we've recovered our services, improved our systems, and built better cooperation with the mainland and other countries... I can see many things are on track. It's the right time to leave," he explained.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that the HA will continue to automate and streamline certain work processes so that clinical staff can spend more time with patients and better serve them.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hongkongers braved the chilly conditions to explore the 1.1-kilometre section of the East Coast boardwalk from Fortress Hill to North Point, which opened on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  North Point resident Adrienne Garvey told RTHK that her family is looking forward to using the promenade.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The kids play area here is fantastic… the kids are loving and exploring it, and I am looking forward to running along here, all the way down to Kennedy Town [in future]. I can have a nice long running route to train on," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hopefully we'll be here every week, if it's the kids with their scooters and running and playing in the park, I think this is a really nice place. It is under the shade as well, so in the summer it will be so good.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Her son Max also said he loves the play area.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The waterfront looks quite nice, and I think it's very fun because it has a playground. Also we like running down the bumps. It's the first day we are here, so we are just going to maybe go and see the whole bridge," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another resident, surnamed Kwok, said the trail is perfect for running.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I often run, and it is impossible to run along the harbour before. So I came this morning to take a look to prepare for future runs… It is very comfortable and faces the sea," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pet owner Carina Chan also told RTHK that the boardwalk is great for walking her dog.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We go to East Coast Park every day via Java Road. We had to cross the road each time, but now with the boardwalk... it is more convenient and safe," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The harbourfront walkway - built under the Island Eastern Corridor - spans 2.2 kilometres in total.
  <br>
  <br>
  Its eastern section, which will connect North Point to Quarry Bay, is set to open in phases in the second half of this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The walkway is part of a bigger, 13-kilometre harbourfront promenade project that will eventually connect Kennedy Town with Shau Kei Wan.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan has vowed to beef up efforts in promoting Hong Kong to the rest of the world, saying some of those attending the World Economic Forum in Davos have signalled their intention to set up shop in the SAR.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chan also said on Sunday that he has invited delegations to explore the "tremendous opportunities" offered by Hong Kong, the Greater Bay Area as well as the mainland, during the high-level conference in Switzerland.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Some fintech companies in Europe said they are planning to set up shop in Hong Kong, and use the city as a base for expanding business in Asia," he wrote on his weekly blog.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This year, we will continue to step up our efforts to promote Hong Kong, so that more friends can learn about, make good use of, and contribute to Hong Kong."
  <br>
  <br>
  The finance chief added that the SAR can help connect the mainland with developed economies and emerging markets in the Global South in areas like technology and green finance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan also pointed out that the economic situation in China and the United States, as well as Sino-US ties, were topics of concern among those attending the Davos forum.
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted that Vice Premier Ding Xuexiang had cited facts and data in explaining China's economy to let foreign investors have a more comprehensive understanding of the country's development while strengthening their confidence.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Sunday said the government will set up three more community living rooms this year to improve the quality of life for underprivileged families.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a Facebook post, Lee said two projects -- in Shau Kei Wan and Kowloon City -- have already received funding from the Community Care Fund and are expected to begin operations by mid-2025.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CE said some grassroots families told him that community living rooms have become another home for them, with shared facilities such as kitchens and bathrooms; and offering services like homework assistance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, Lee said the first batch of light public housing units in Yuen Long -- providing 2,150 units -- will be ready for move in, in the first quarter.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that the second phase of the project will be open for applications soon.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The administration is committed to fixing housing problems for grassroots families. We are taking concrete action to help these families find a place to live and feel secure," he wrote.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The head of the government's investment promotion agency on Sunday said her office will focus on bringing in non-local companies that can "create a larger financial impact" in Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  In the past year, InvestHK helped a record 539 non-local companies establish or expand in the SAR, with total investment reaching HK$67.7 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The companies we want to attract are from all industries... We want to put more focus on companies that would create more jobs, and to bring in more direct investments, and create a larger financial impact for Hong Kong," its director-general, Alpha Lau, said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A lot of these [companies] that we brought in... they are looking at the growth of the demographics and the wealth in the region, so they would want to invest more here."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lau said her department would boost promotional efforts in regions like Eastern Europe, Central Asia and Southeast Asia.
  <br>
  <br>
  The director-general added that she would act as a “salesperson” and clarify any misunderstandings that foreign firms might have about the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The concerns that some of them might have, whether because of geopolitics or other reasons -- they might be due to a misunderstanding or a lack of knowledge about Hong Kong. I think facts tell a thousand words," Lau said.

    Flu outbreak to worsen after LNY break: paediatrician

<div class="itemFullText">
 A University of Hong Kong (HKU) paediatrician on Sunday called on people to stay on the alert, saying the current influenza outbreak may worsen after the Lunar New Year holiday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a radio programme, Mike Kwan from HKU’s Department of Paediatrics and Adolescent Medicine said the flu season is expected to peak next month, and people should get vaccinated as soon as possible, if they haven’t already done so.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Temperatures will drop during the upcoming Lunar New Year [holiday], and there will be more social contact through New Year visits and gatherings," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Some residents will also travel abroad, but they should be aware that many countries across Asia, including Japan and Korea, are currently experiencing flu outbreaks, so everyone needs to be careful."
  <br>
  <br>
  Three severe flu cases involving children were reported last week, with two of them unvaccinated.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kwan said kids who’ve received the flu jab typically show milder symptoms, and require only one to two days of hospitalisation in more serious cases.
  <br>
  <br>
  The expert also urged members of the public to use reliable test kits and maintain good personal hygiene.

Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1789115_1_20250125154721.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Saturday condemned lawmakers in the United States again for proposing a bill to review sanctions against certain SAR officials, judges and prosecutors, calling it an attempt to intimidate those safeguarding national security.
 <br>
  <br>
  A government spokesperson said in a statement that safeguarding national security is a constitutional duty and an inherent right of sovereign states, while accusing US officials of hypocrisy and using double standards.
  <br>
  <br>
  The statement said that the National Security Law has helped restore social stability and improve the business environment after the “black-clad violence” of 2019.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the Economic Freedom of the World 2024 Annual Report, Hong Kong ranks as the world's freest economies among 165 economies. In the World Competitiveness Yearbook 2024, Hong Kong's ranking improved by two places to fifth globally," the spokesperson said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "However, those US politicians insist on turning a blind eye to all these facts, and even clamour for so-called 'sanctions' against the HKSAR personnel who dutifully safeguard national security.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The HKSAR Government strongly condemns their political grandstanding rife with ill intentions, which have been seen through by all."
  <br>
  <br>
  The spokesperson also said that authorities reject any so-called sanctions and vowed to continue its efforts to safeguard national security, and urged US lawmakers to respect international law and stop interfering in Hong Kong's internal affairs.
  <br>
  <br>
  The spokesman also affirmed that human rights in Hong Kong are constitutionally protected and that law enforcement actions are conducted based on evidence without regard to political beliefs.
  <br>
  <br>
  They added that the judiciary operates independently, ensuring fair trials and adherence to the rule of law.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The judicial system of the HKSAR has always been highly regarded by international communities. Any attempt by any country, organisation, or individual to interfere with the judicial proceedings in the HKSAR by means of political power is a reprehensible act undermining the rule of law of the HKSAR," the spokesperson said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Making any statement with the intent to interfere with or obstruct the course of justice, or engaging in conduct with the same intent, is very likely to constitute the offence of criminal contempt of court or the offence of perverting the course of justice."
  <br>
  <br>
  The statement added that the government remains committed to implementing the National Security Law and upholding the principle of "One Country, Two Systems".

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Saturday visited residents in Oi Man Estate ahead of the Lunar New Year.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lee greeted those who came out to see him at the housing estate in Ho Man Tin, and shook hands with members of the public.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm also here to have a look at the operation of shops. I bought these turnip cakes. I love them and I will share them with my wife. I heard from the shops that business has been good, meeting their expectations," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier in the day, Lee visited the community living room in Hung Hom, and had a meal with people there.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee was accompanied by the Secretary for Home and Youth Affairs, Alice Mak, who pointed out that care teams have an important role to play when it comes to assisting residents.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The chief executive visited the residents with a care team, and learnt about how they provide services to people in the community. We did a year-end clean-up and home repairs for the elderly," Mak said.
  <br>
  <br>
  She added government officials will continue to visit residents, including elderly people, grassroots families and ethnic minorities, at different districts before the Lunar New Year.
  <br>
  <br>
  An 88-year-old resident said she was happy that she was able to shake hands with the Chief Executive and that people have high expectations of him.

    'Police sparing no effort to fight violent crimes'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police commissioner Raymond Siu on Saturday said cracking down on triads and violent crimes are some of his top priorities.
 <br>
  <br>
  Siu made the comments following the Police College's passing-out parade, where reporters asked him about two men who were attacked by a group of knife-wielding men outside a Yuen Long industrial building in the early hours of Wednesday, leaving one dead and another injured.
  <br>
  <br>
  The commissioner said there were a total of 3,313 assault cases in the first eleven months of last year, down from the same period in the previous year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are focusing on these violent cases, and we will spare no effort. In addition to our intelligence collection to cracking down on their illegal activities, we will also use other means, such as cutting off their financial resources," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We also have many intelligence-led operations. In the past, our arrest rate for triad-related crimes was actually close to 40 percent. It is up to us to take the initiative to carry out operations to attack them."
  <br>
  <br>
  Siu also said that the police adopts a zero-tolerance policy towards any illegal or disciplinary violations and will handle such cases seriously.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was referring to the case where police arrested 12 people, including seven officers, on suspicion of money laundering, involving about HK$10.5 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will definitely deal with any colleague who violates laws and discipline. On the other hand, we have many colleagues. Colleagues who violate laws only account for a very small part of the entire police force," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Of course, we think even one case is too many but I hope everyone understands that we maintain public order and prevent and combat crime in the Hong Kong Police Force. Most of our colleagues work very hard, and our low crime rate today is also the result of our colleagues’ hard work."
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Siu said the police force is steadily increasing in size, with the number of applications rising by 46 percent in the current fiscal year, compared to the one before.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said various measures are being implemented, including a recruitment fast-track process at overseas universities.

    Remaining land sales to top HK$4bn: minister

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Development Secretary said on Saturday that she's confident that revenues from land sales in the next two months will top HK$4 billion, but the full year figure might still fall short of the government's original projection in last year's budget forecast.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a radio programme, Bernadette Linn noted that a land parcel in Tai Wai had attracted a significant number of bids on Friday. The government has several land sales scheduled between now and the end of the fiscal year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I believe that the final number will be higher than the number just mentioned, but it may not reach the original estimate of more than HK$30 billion," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think that at this time our real estate market hasn't fully recovered, so that's understandable. It takes time for the market to warm up."
  <br>
  <br>
  She noted that the last budget had projected average annual expenditure of about HK$90 billion on public works projects over the next four years.
  <br>
  <br>
  The development secretary said work is proceeding on these projects, including the Northern Metropolis project, which she believes can meet existing benchmarks.
  <br>
  <br>
  She also said some Northern Metropolis projects are already under construction, and others have entered the planning process, stressing that these works were huge in scale, and would take years to complete.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said the New Territories North New Town will be carried out in phases.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the past, people often heard about new development areas like the Kwu Tung North New Development Area, which is just a few hundred hectares. The entire San Tin Technopole is about 600 hectares. Thus, the development of over 1,000 hectares has to be carried out in phases," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In this case, we'll prioritize about 200 hectares within that area. It will include industrial parks, private housing, and part of a university town. We hope to finalize discussions here so we can start the statutory process early and begin construction in 2028."
  <br>
  <br>
  Linn added that the authorities will adjust the pace of some projects, to ensure that the government's cash flow is managed effectively, such as waterfront beautification and park facilities.

  Separately, she noted that the Kau Yi Chau Artifical Islands project has not been abandoned, but time constraints mean it's uncertain whether reclamation work can begin under the current administration.

 Transport Secretary Mable Chan said on Saturday that it took just 45 minutes to process spectators after a test event at the Kai Tak Sports Park.
 <br>
  <br>
  The largest drill to date involved some 63,000 people, and was held on Friday evening at three venues at the park.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on an RTHK radio programme, Chan said extra MTR train services had been laid on and ten extra bus routes were arranged to carry 7,300 passengers, which was higher than expected.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Two franchised bus operators arranged the ten special routes... We hope these routes can be used to carry passengers when large-scale events are organised in the future. So it would be similar to the arrangements at the Hong Kong Coliseum and the Hong Kong Stadium," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, Chan said Greater Bay Airlines had let passengers and the government down, after it cancelled more than 100 flights for February and March, blaming factors like delayed aircraft deliveries and inspection requirements. She said it's been asked to submit a report on the problems.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan also said she hoped it's better prepared to deal with increased traffic expected over the Lunar New Year and Easter holidays.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Secretary for Security, Chris Tang, said that a Hong Kong resident who was detained in Myanmar and forced to carry out illegal work will return to the SAR on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  A government task force has been in Thailand investigating reports that a number of Hongkongers had been lured to Southeast Asian countries and held against their will.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a radio programme, Tang said the 29-year-old man had been rescued and taken to Thailand, and was in good shape mentally and physically.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister said the man will return to the city, accompanied by members of the task force.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the government would do its utmost to rescue the remaining ten Hong Kong residents being detained in the region, noting that civil conflicts present challenges to the task force members.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In fact, I have been seeing the Myanmar consulate and also the Cambodian consulate in Hong Kong to discuss how to have the safe return of our Hong Kong people," Tang said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said all parties were committed to doing their utmost to ensure the safe return of the Hong Kong residents.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tang also thanked the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for its support and assistance, allowing the man to reunite with his family before the Lunar New Year.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government said the largest drill to date was successfully held at Kai Tak Sports Park on Friday evening, involving some 63,000 people.
 <br>
  <br>
  Most of the participants were government workers or people from community groups.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two-hour drills were held at three venues -- the main stadium, the Kai Tak Arena and the youth sports ground, as officials tested out arrangements with the first two having capacity crowds.
  <br>
  <br>
  At the 50,000-seater main stadium, bands from the disciplined forces put on a concert, as different scenarios, including simulated security issues, were tested.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials carried out evacuation drills as well as having spectators leave in a regular manner at the other two venues.
  <br>
  <br>
  A number of senior officials, including Chief Secretary for Administration Eric Chan, culture, sports and tourism minister Rosanna Law and civil service chief Ingrid Yeung were on hand to observe the proceedings.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said the park is scheduled to open sometime in March, but added reports saying that March 1 is the official opening day might be premature.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Because we have many stress tests in the future - we have two large-scale stress tests [next month], so up to now, depending on the results of the tests, I think we cannot confirm the opening date," he told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  As part of the tests, all participants left the venues at around the same time as they picked their own mode of transport.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities recorded crowd control and transport data for analysis.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan added the scheduling of events in future should ensure that a capacity crowd at the three venues would not leave the park at the same time.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he said authorities mapped out worst-case scenarios to train up the ability of different parties to react to emergencies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Several participants told RTHK they were happy with the experience, saying signs giving directions were good and the sound system was solid.

 Two men were charged on Friday with murdering a man in Yuen Long in the early hours of Wednesday, as well as wounding another.
 <br>
  <br>
  Police said the pair, 19 and 27, are due to appear in Fanling Court on Saturday. The 27-year-old suspect also faces a charge of possessing dangerous drugs.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two defendants were among six men arrested so far over the death of the 24-year-old man.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officers said two suspects, 23 and 26, were arrested in Tin Shui Wai on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The incident took place outside an industrial building on Wang Yip Street West, when two men were attacked by a group of knife-wielding men.
  <br>
  <br>
  One of them died and the other was conscious when he was taken to hospital.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Licensed billiard establishments that meet specific criteria can apply to let people as young as eight years old enter these premises, as a means of promoting the sport's development in Hong Kong, said the Leisure and Cultural Services Department (LCSD).
 <br>
  <br>
  Currently, only those aged 16 or above are allowed entry.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other relaxations include allowing young patrons to stay until 11pm, compared with 8pm right now, and they could enter as early as 7am.
  <br>
  <br>
  Those in school uniforms will also be permitted to enter.
  <br>
  <br>
  The department said licensed billiard establishments hoping to accept younger patrons can make applications from February 25.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vincent Law, chairman of the Billiard Sports Council of Hong Kong China (HKBSCC), said he hopes the department can clearly lay out the specific requirements that billiard halls need to take.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The details of the requirements are yet to be announced, but according to my understanding, you have to have certain security facilities implemented in the premises, for example, maybe CCTV. Also you need certain tools and facilities which are suitable for use by children," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "During some sessions, such as training sessions and tournaments, there needs to be some coach who is qualified to coach billiard sports."
  <br>
  <br>
  Law also said that he hopes to see all restrictions removed in the long run.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is only a first step because I think the ultimate objective is to completely remove all restrictions on billiard establishments because we are just like any other sports venue," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Why should there be a restriction on the age of the person who uses the facilities?"
  <br>
  <br>
  He added he hopes to see the LCSD promote the scheme to the around 50 currently licensed billiard halls, noting that establishment owners will have to assess the administrative work and costs before considering to apply.

    'Beetroot salad not ruled out in poisoning cases'

<img alt="Health officials say they can't rule out that a beetroot salad gave passengers on two Cathay flights food poisoning earlier this month. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1789003_1_20250124174253.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Health officials said on Friday that they could not rule out that beetroot salad contaminated with a bacterium served on board was responsible for the suspected food poisoning suffered by dozens of passengers of two Cathay Pacific flights arriving from Nepal this month.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) said its investigation found that 43 passengers, aged between 11 and 75, developed food poisoning symptoms such as vomiting, nausea, abdominal pain and diarrhoea, about 10 to 60 minutes after having meals on the CX640 flights from Kathmandul on January 8 and 9.
  <br>
  <br>
  None of the passengers had to be taken to hospital, the CHP said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Stool samples from two patients tested positive for Staphylococcus aureus. The overall clinical symptoms and incubation period of the affected persons were compatible with food poisoning caused by Staphylococcus aureus," the centre said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  It added that the beetroot salad was the only food served on board that was likely to have caused such poisoning, from a statistical standpoint.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, tests on samples taken from the aircraft showed the level of Staphylococcus aureus in the salad did not exceed food safety standards.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CHP said the food was supplied exclusively to Cathay for its flights from Kathmandu since the start of the month and the factory concerned was later asked to stop providing it. Inspections of the factory found the way the food was being handled might have increased the risk of contamination.
  <br>
  <br>
  In response, Cathay acknowledged the findings but stressed that no signs of contamination were found in the samples it checked in its own lab.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Cathay Pacific confirms that this salad is not served on any of our other flights. Aside from these two cases, there have not been any similar instances of customers experiencing symptoms of suspected food poisoning on any of our recent flights," it said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The airline apologised again to passengers affected and added that it has reinforced food-handling processes and staff training on hygiene.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Home prices fell 7.1 percent in 2024, official figures showed on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  It was the third year in a row of declining prices, which have dropped 27 percent since the start of 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eddie Kwok, executive director of CBRE Hong Kong’s valuation and advisory services, said price increases could be on the cards after Lunar New Year and the financial secretary's budget speech next month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kwok said major banks have lowered their prime rates since the US Federal Reserve's interest rate cut last September and since then prices have been stabilising.
  <br>
  <br>
  Martin Wong, head of research and consultancy for Greater China at Knight Frank, said prices could rebound by up to five percent this year, with most of the increase likely to come in the second half.
  <br>
  <br>
  Figures from the Rating and Valuation Department also showed that prices fell 0.7 percent in December from the month before, ending a two-month increase.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A worker died after falling to the ground at a construction site on Tsung Tau Ha Road in Fo Tan.
 <br>
  <br>
  Police said they received a report at around 1pm on Friday that a man fell from a height of between three and four metres.
  <br>
  <br>
  Emergency personnel were called to scene where the man was certified dead.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Labour Department said officers were sent to investigate the cause of the incident.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chiu Kin-keung, the vice chairman of the Hong Kong Construction Industry Employees General Union, said the deceased welding worker was on a spider lift platform before the fall.
  <br>
  <br>
  He believed that a fractured steel beam struck the platform, causing it and the worker to fall.
  <br>
  <br>
  The worker had his safety harness attached to the platform but that also broke, Chiu said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the Association for the Rights of Industrial Accident Victims said it would be providing support to the family of the man killed.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said the accident marked at least the 10th fatal fall since the beginning of last year.

 The Federation of Trade Unions (FTU) on Friday urged the government to step up efforts to promote Hong Kong’s tourist spots and nurture more talent in the sector.
 <br>
  <br>
  At a press conference, the party called for more religious and architectural tours to showcase the city's beauty beyond Victoria Harbour.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Apart from the traditional shopping theme that we are quite well-recognised in the international arena, we would also like international tourists to know about how Hong Kong is naturally beautiful," said FTU lawmaker Joephy Chan.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Apart from Victoria Harbour, of course, there are also different sea views that you can have in Hong Kong. We need to further elaborate on that on different social [media] platforms as well."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan suggested journeys to temples, mosques and landmarks such as Sun Yat Sen Memorial Park to promote religious diversity and peace education.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another FTU lawmaker, Dennis Leung, highlighted the need for more training for tour guides and the recruitment of retirees into the role.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Because we have some sites in New Territories where the younger generation do not understand the history, so we hope that the government can gather all the village inhabitants or some retired people to help to promote tourism, to act as a guide to help the visitors to know more about the culture in this visiting site," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The party also urged officials to improve accessibility to tourist spots by adding more bus routes.

<div class="itemFullText">
 DAB lawmakers on Friday said each district should have panda-themed events and decorations to encourage tourists to explore different places across Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  The party said it has submitted various suggestions to the government's Working Group on Developing Tourist Hotspots, which was established last year to come up with ways to revitalise the tourism industry.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lawmaker Vincent Cheng said Hong Kong should promote the concept of "panda is everywhere" on top of "tourism is everywhere".
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's definitely a good chance for businesses to have a showcase everywhere, in different districts," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A lot of visitors, they're not only visiting the places, they also would like to see panda decorations everywhere in Hong Kong. We can also dress them up. Like in Sham Shui Po, they can dress up like a Sham Shui Po special edition for the panda as well."
  <br>
  <br>
  Other suggestions the party made included a walking tour in Central and Western for tourists to visit temples and taste food and drink, including sugarcane juice and dim sum.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the legislators urged the authorities to set up a one-stop platform to enable event organisers to reach out to different government departments in a more simple way.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Friday said the city's financial system remains robust, despite intensified geopolitical risks causing greater volatility in regional and global markets.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chan made the remark during a discussion on "stemming financial fragmentation", at the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting in Davos.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also said Hong Kong "steadfastly" upholds the linked exchange rate system, or the currency peg, and that recent surveys showed global investors were optimistic about the SAR's business outlook.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan added that the city has undergone significant transformations in the stock markets, wealth management and digital asset sectors, as he also stressed that China's economy is steadily growing and achieving high-quality development.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, the finance minister continued to promote green finance projects, as well as "impact investments", or funds aimed at generating social or environmental effects.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan held talks on trade with some of his global counterparts, including the investment minister of Saudi Arabia, Khalid Al-Falih, and the finance chief of Egypt, Ahmed Kouchouk. Chan invited the ministers to visit the SAR as part of efforts to deepen ties with the Global South.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also met Jenny Johnson, CEO of investment firm Franklin Templeton, to discuss how to expand the company's business in the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan is due to return to Hong Kong on Saturday.

 A Hong Kong woman on holiday in Japan has died after being hit by a train.
 <br>
  <br>
  Japanese media reports said the woman, 61, was standing on tracks near Otaru, Hokkaido on Thursday and was taking photos of the sea when she was struck by the train.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kyodo News Agency cited police as saying the woman's husband was standing nearby at the time but was not injured.
  <br>
  <br>
  The accident caused the suspension of almost 20 train services, including some to the region's main airport, railway officials said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Chinese Consulate in Sapporo and the Immigration Department in Hong Kong both said they were ready to help the woman's family if assistance was required.

    'Travel agencies should be flexible in giving refund'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Consumer Council has called on travel agencies to be flexible in refunding passengers affected by the cancellation of flights at Greater Bay Airlines.
 <br>
  <br>
  The low-cost carrier earlier announced the cancellation of 128 flights in February and March, while stressing that Lunar New Year services won't be affected.
  <br>
  <br>
  The consumer watchdog had received six complaints as of Thursday night, involving about HK$14,000 in total.
  <br>
  <br>
  Its chief executive Gilly Wong told an RTHK radio programme on Friday that travel agencies should maintain close contact with the airline to offer refunds to passengers as soon as possible.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In principle, they (agencies) should only arrange a refund after receiving the money [from the airline]. But they can exercise discretion and compassion when handling individual cases," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong pointed out that some agencies had told passengers it could take months for them to get their money back, but said in some cases the refund should arrive earlier.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If they only stick to the rulebook, that leads to customer dissatisfaction and complaints. It's not an ideal approach in terms of their reputation."
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong also said Greater Bay Airlines should not impose surcharges for passengers opting for other destinations.
  <br>
  <br>
  She added that the airline should offer updates and reach out to consumers quickly.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The SAR government on Thursday said it condemns and strongly disapproves of a recent meeting between UK officials and national security suspects wanted by Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  British Foreign Secretary David Lammy and Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State Catherine West earlier met with four Hong Kong fugitives based in the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, the SAR government expressed its strong disapproval and condemnation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Endangering national security is a very serious crime. No country will watch with folded arms the acts and activities that endanger national security. Those persons who have fled overseas are suspected of continuing to commit offences under the Hong Kong National Security Law,” a government spokesperson said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The UK Government has ignored the malicious acts of those wanted persons, which showcases the hypocrisy with double standards."
  <br>
  <br>
  The spokesperson stressed that SAR law enforcement agencies will exhaust all means to pursue the fugitives, and called on the UK to stop interfering in Hong Kong matters which are purely China's internal affairs.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Thursday said they have arrested four men for their alleged involvement in a murder case in Yuen Long.
 <br>
  <br>
  A man died and another was hurt on Wednesday, after they were attacked by a group of knife-wielding men when they were leaving an industrial building on Wang Yip Street West.
  <br>
  <br>
  Acting Senior Superintendent Tang Yick-kay said two of the arrestees had tried to escape to Thailand.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The police learned that the two, aged 20 and 21, had flown to Bangkok on Wednesday. We quickly alerted the Thai authorities through our cooperation channels. The two men were subsequently denied entry at Bangkok airport and were sent back to Hong Kong on a flight,” he said, adding that the pair was arrested upon their arrival.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officers made one more arrest at the Hong Kong International Airport; while the fourth man was taken from a Tuen Mun flat, where suspected space oil drugs were also found.
  <br>
  <br>
  The four people arrested, aged 20 to 29, are said to have ties to a triad and are being held for questioning.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police said they are still tracking down on other suspects, and urged members of the public to come forward with information.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Senior Counsel Jose-Antonio Maurellet has been elected the new chairman of the Bar Association, succeeding the outgoing Victor Dawes.
 <br>
  <br>
  Senior Counsels Martin Hui and Eva Sit, meanwhile, were chosen as vice-chairmen.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters after the election on Thursday evening, Maurellet said the association will continue to defend the rule of law and judicial independence.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that the professional body will adhere to the highest standards of professional conduct, discipline and etiquette.
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted that while there are calls for Hong Kong to focus on developing the economy this year, he stressed the rule of law and economic development go hand in hand to ensure the long-term prosperity and stability of the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  Maurellet also expressed hope that more overseas non-permanent judges can be appointed to the city’s top court.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Obviously we would welcome the appointment of further such experienced jurists to our court. We believe that it strengthens Hong Kong as a jurisdiction and is also supported by members of the public,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Maurellet was appointed as Senior Counsel in 2016, and had served as vice chairman for the Bar Association for six years.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The opening of a new harbourfront walkway in North Point will create shared spaces for Hongkongers with stunning views of Victoria Harbour, officials said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The East Coast boardwalk - built under the Island Eastern Corridor - spans 2.2 kilometres in total.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 1.1-kilometre section from Fortress Hill to North Point will open to the public on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Acting Financial Secretary Michael Wong said the government hopes to open the eastern section by the end of this year, adding efforts are underway to make the harbour more accessible.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ivan Ho, chairman of the Harbourfront Commission, said there’s a shared space for pedestrians, joggers, cyclists and pet owners.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We have a shared path which allows people to cycle, walk dogs and jog, so basically we are encouraging people to use our boardwalk together in a harmonious way,” Ho said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We also created what we call a pocket space, which allow children to play around, allow some small-scale function or activity.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Movable bridges have also been installed to allow vessels access to the inner waters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho said construction has not been easy with height restrictions and machinery constraints, and officials have tried to minimise disturbance to nearby residents.

 Lunar New Year fairs kicked off at 15 sites across Hong Kong on Thursday, with many a panda-themed product among the array of goods, flowers and fast food on offer.
 <br>
  <br>
  Snakes were also spotted rearing their heads among the goodies, what with the Year of the Snake about to get underway.
  <br>
  <br>
  Students were running some of the stalls at Victoria Park – home to the city's biggest fair – hoping to put their newly acquired business management skills and sales techniques into practice.
  <br>
  <br>
  A flower-seller said she has been a regular at the fair for two decades and isn't worried that a sluggish economy and people heading elsewhere to spend will put a dent in her sales.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Lunar New Year is just once a year, for good fortune, people will buy and put them at home like they always do," the woman told RTHK, adding that she has a loyal customer base for her oranges.
  <br>
  <br>
  A woman shopping with her children was delighted with the atmosphere at the fair.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This year, I think there are more people than in previous years. Perhaps it's because during Covid, only flowers were sold at the fairs. Now with more dry goods, everyone's happier, the children are happier," she told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  Customs officers are also planning to attend the fairs, with flyers and souvenirs to be handed out to remind people the importance of respecting copyright law.
  <br>
  <br>
  Divisional Commander Ho Chun-wing said officers on patrol will take immediate action if they find anything suspicious.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong people do like goods with popular models. So we will put a lot of effort into targeting those goods with suspected counterfeiting trademarks and copyright," he told RTHK.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's privacy watchdog on Thursday said the number of data breach incidents in the city increased by 30 percent last year.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data received more than 200 data breach reports last year, in which 30 percent of them involved hacking and 25 percent involved the loss of documents or portable devices.
  <br>
  <br>
  Privacy Commissioner Ada Chung said the value of personal data has increased with the rapid development of digitalisation, and she expects the trend to continue.
  <br>
  <br>
  The office conducted a review of the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance and made suggestions which included the mandatory notification of data breaches, a complete review of the penalty levels outlined in the ordinance and also empowering the Privacy Commissioner to hand down administrative fines.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the level of penalty administered, Chung said her office would take Hong Kong's economic situation into account and make reference to similar legislation in other jurisdictions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the process of consultation, we have received feedback saying that, for example, small and medium enterprises, they are concerned about the effect of all these penalties on their business environment and their compliance costs," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I believe that the government and my office would take all these concerns into account in formulating the concrete details."

<div class="itemFullText">
 Cathay Pacific says it will give its staff bonuses worth at least a month's pay following positive financial results in the past year.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a letter to employees, CEO Ronald Lam said the final level will be announced alongside the company's annual financial postings in mid-March.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm pleased to share that we will be distributing at least four weeks of eligible pay this year," Lam said on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also told staff that the company successfully completed its rebuilding journey last year, allowing flights to return to 100 percent of pre-Covid levels this month.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our strong financial performance for two years in a row also made it possible for us to commit more than HK$100 billion investments into further elevating our customers' experience in the future," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lam vowed to work towards Cathay's vision of "becoming one of the world's greatest service brands".
  <br>
  <br>
  The company's four lines of business, namely Cathay Pacific, Cathay Cargo, Cathay Lifestyle and HK Express, have formulated robust plans to serve customers and deliver great profitability, Lam added.
