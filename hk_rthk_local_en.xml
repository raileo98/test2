<img alt="The Hong Kong Public Opinion Research Institute makes the announcement on social media. Photo courtesy of the HKPORI" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1791461_1_20250213143116.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A polling body has announced it will suspend all self-funded research activities and surveys indefinitely and focus on existing commissioned studies.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, the Hong Kong Public Opinion Research Institute (HKPORI) also said it will change its business model or shut down.
  <br>
  <br>
  Its president and CEO Robert Chung said he welcomes interested parties to take over the institute.
  <br>
  <br>
  "HKPORI has always been law-abiding, but in the current environment, it has to pause its promotion of scientific polling. The research team hopes there will be another opportunity to resume its work," the statement read.
  <br>
  <br>
  "HKPORI is actively exploring all possible options, (and) it will announce its final decision when the time is right."
  <br>
  <br>
  Former HKPORI deputy executive director Chung Kim-wah is wanted by the police for alleged national security violations, and Robert Chung was earlier questioned by officers in their investigation into whether he or the institute had provided assistance to an absconder.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong, China Ice Hockey Association has filed a complaint to the International Ice Hockey Federation regarding the altercation involving the Turkmenistan team at the Asian Winter Games in Harbin.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chairman Sherman Chan made the remarks upon returning to Hong Kong with the men's team on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  A brawl broke out after the SAR defeated Turkmenistan in a match on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Three SAR players were injured.
  <br>
  <br>
  Team captain Tony Leung hopes the altercation will not affect people's impression of the sport.
  <br>
  <br>
  He told reporters at the airport that he appreciated the team's restraint in the altercation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Clashes are inevitable in ice hockey. This incident is very rare, especially as it happened during a post-match handshake," he said,
  <br>
  <br>
  "At the same time, there are rarely fights in international competitions, or even during the match. Therefore, this is an exceptional case."
  <br>
  <br>
  He expressed his gratitude to Chief Executive John Lee and Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism Rosanna Law for visiting the injured players after the scuffle.
  <br>
  <br>
  Coach Carey Durant said the team dealt with the adversity very well.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the team's performance in Harbin would be used for what he called, "a measuring stick” to roll out development plans for the association, as well as the sport itself.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There was a lot of tears when we lost those games. And that's a good thing because that means our players expected to go all the way to try and win a gold medal," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are going to get there. I promise Hong Kong that we will get there one day. It’s just a process that we take and we take this very seriously in representing Hong Kong."
  <br>
  <br>
  The team wrapped up their journey at the Games by losing to top-seeded Kazakhstan in the quarter-finals.

    'Higher tram fares would help operator retain talent'

<img alt="Hong Kong Tramways is hoping to put fares up by as much as 30 cents. Photo: Shutterstock" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1791449_1_20250213121710.jpg&q=65">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An increase in tram fares would enable the operator to put wages up to find and keep hold of talent, a union chief said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong Tramways is hoping to get the go-ahead to increase adult fares from HK$3 to HK$3.30, child fares from HK$1.50 to HK$1.60 and fares for the over 65s from HK$1.30 to HK$1.50.
  <br>
  <br>
  The company says passenger figures are still about 15 percent down on 2018, before the protests and Covid pandemic.
  <br>
  <br>
  The chairman of the Hong Kong Tramway Workers Union, Yeh Yung-sheng, said fare increases would help the company attract new workers, some of whom would need to learn specialist skills.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The whole of the tram's chassis is made by hand. It's not built from parts that are bought from the market... So we need to pass on such techniques," he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You cannot just find any workers who can do such work, and it takes time for us to train such workers. [So] if the pay is not good enough, then they might feel that they do not want to learn such techniques."
  <br>
  <br>
  But speaking on the same RTHK programme, lawmaker Chan Hok-fung, who is a member of Legco's transport panel, said Hong Kong Tramways will lose even more passengers if fares go up.
  <br>
  <br>
  "At present, with the existing prices, trams do not have the so-called competitive advantage. And if you raise the fares further, the gap between the fares of trams and those of buses will be further narrowed, and then even more passenger traffic will be lost," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The advantage of trams in the past was not their speed, but their prices, because it was cost-effective, but if they do not even have that advantage, their original passengers will be lost."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said the company could instead take steps to boost passenger numbers, for example by introducing Pokémon or panda-themed trams.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong Tramways says the proposed fare increases would mainly be spent on renovating its fleet and expanding non-ticket revenue projects.

    Taxi union threatens strike over ride-hailing services

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A taxi drivers' union says members will go on strike for at least five days from March 5 unless the authorities take immediate action against illegal ride-hailing services.
 <br>
  <br>
  Wong Yu-ting, chairman of the Hong Kong Tele-call Taxi Association, told Commercial Radio that they have been left with no choice but to take action.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The government has stated that using private cars for the carriage of passengers for reward is illegal, ride-hailing services are illegal, and not having insurance is illegal, everything is illegal," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But they allow [ride-hailing service] platforms to exist, and indulge them."
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong said the industry has been discussing the issue with the government for 11 years.
  <br>
  <br>
  In an earlier response to news of a possible strike, the government said it wrote to the companies involved reminding them of legislation which bans drivers from taking passengers for money unless they have a permit.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Transport Department said a working group under the Transport Advisory Committee that is looking at regulating ride-hailing platforms has a meeting arranged with operators and the taxi industry on February 19.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials urged the taxi industry to stay calm, be rational and put the public interest first.

<img alt="Heads of state and business leaders pose for a photo at the conclusion of an artificial intelligence action summit in Paris on Tuesday. Professor William Wong says their agreement is the first step of collaboration towards the goal of developing an open and ethical AI.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A transparent and innovative environment is essential to the development of artificial development, according to a systems engineering professor, although the industry also needs to be properly regulated to prevent the technology from being misused.
 <br>
  <br>
  William Wong, the director of Chinese University's Centre for Innovation and Technology and a lawmaker, also described as a "surprise" the snub by the United States and the United Kingdom to an international AI declaration at the end of a summit in Paris.
  <br>
  <br>
  The document, endorsed by dozens of nations including China, India and hosts France, pledges an open, inclusive and ethical approach to AI development.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on
  <a href="https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/news-programmes/this-episode.htm?cmsid=77" target="_blank">
   <u>
    <b>
     RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme
    </b>
   </u>
  </a>
  , Wong said it is common for industry representatives to come together and discuss the path forward for AI.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have been doing that in all universities, not to mention nations, because we understand that artificial intelligence, when you want to apply it, it's high risk because you... leave everything to a machine," he explained.
  <br>
  <br>
  "What happens if it misbehaves?"
  <br>
  <br>
  He added the agreement is just the first step of collaboration towards the goal of developing open, transparent, trustworthy and ethical AI technologies.
  <br>
  <br>
  'What they have to do is to share more information, and then they would come to a consensus and write out guidelines. When you look at what is happening now, for example even in America, the UK, and France and China, their governments have also issued guidelines in the ethical part of AI."
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked if DeepSeek, the Chinese language model developed by a Hangzhou-based startup, could face stiff competition, Wong said that's not necessarily a bad thing.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You call it competition from the business side. But also you should look... (from the perspective of) the advancement of sciences as well," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You have to compare with each other; you compete with each other. And then it comes with more advanced technology. You should look at the positive side of it."

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong, China Ice Hockey Association on Wednesday said the men's team put in a great performance at the Asian Winter Games in Harbin.
 <br>
  <br>
  The team wrapped up their journey on Tuesday after losing to top-seeded Kazakhstan 24-0 in the quarter-finals.
  <br>
  <br>
  The association's chairman, Sherman Chan, said at least half of the Kazakhstan team are professional players, while many SAR players are either students or have full-time jobs.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said Hong Kong's performance wasn't affected by a post-match altercation with Turkmenistan opponents on Sunday that left three of the SAR players injured.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This game [against Kazakhstan] definitely showcased the team has been very disciplined as well as in terms of their quality, mental-wise, they are well prepared for any kind of challenge," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think obviously after the incident, a few of the players were upset. But... they mentally recovered very well and we all have this common goal to focus on the Games."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said he has high expectations for Hong Kong when it comes to the World Championships in Mexico in April.

 Three members of the same family have died in Yuen Long in what police say is a suspected murder-suicide case.
 <br>
  <br>
  A man, 93, and his son, 69, were found with multiple stab wounds inside a flat in Chun Hing New Village after police were called at around 8pm on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  A 19-year-old man, who was the grandson and son of the deceased, visited the flat before later falling to his death from Yuet Ping House at Long Ping Estate, officers said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The deceased inside the flat had a lot of injuries, and they also bled a lot, so it was difficult to conduct forensic inspections at the scene because it required a lot of cleaning work to determine the cause of death and even the number of injuries," Assistant District Commander Johnathan Kwan told the media.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The direction of our investigation includes the background of the three deceased, their family relationships, and whether they were involved in any disputes or property disputes."

    Team removed over Greater Bay Airlines cancellations

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Greater Bay Airlines on Wednesday said it had removed a team of commercial and planning managers, which oversaw the allocation of aircraft resources, due to the recent flight cancellations by the carrier.
 <br>
  <br>
  In the airline's report to the Civil Aviation Department, it said a lack of internal communication and insufficient customer service support exacerbated the carrier's scheduling failures.
  <br>
  <br>
  Around 5,500 passengers were believed to have been affected by the cancellation of 128 flights in February and March.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to details released on Wednesday, four of the cancellations were by a charterer which put on extra flights following the deadly plane crash in South Korea's Muan International Airport in December.
  <br>
  <br>
  The airline also assured the move had "no impact on the safety" of its operations.
  <br>
  <br>
  The report said the new team – comprising experienced personnel as part of a reform – had failed to observe the company's protocol for cancellation decision making, and also "took excessive time to make decisions" and "communicated the decision poorly".
  <br>
  <br>
  It noted the team did not consider the airline's customer service response capability, which did not have sufficient resources to handle "such a significant number of customer interactions at one time".
  <br>
  <br>
  "[The airline] remains committed to assuring a reliable service to our passengers. The new team concerned has been removed from the company," the report said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Also in the report, the airline put forward a number of measures such as strengthening internal procedures for flight scheduling, boosting communication, and ensuring fleet and manpower stability and reliability.
  <br>
  <br>
  Transport minister Mable Chan expressed hope Greater Bay Airlines had learned a lesson, adding it has to regularly report on its operations to the authorities.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[The Air Transport Licensing Authority] has asked the airline to submit regular reports on a monthly basis. If the airline is planning to cancel flights in future, it will have to provide a written report to the authority and list out the facts and information of the arrangements," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The airline initially cited a delay in new aircraft delivery and the need for plane inspections for the cancellation, but the report later revealed "a lack of internal communication and a lack of co-operation from customer service operations" as a contributing factor.
  <br>
  <br>
  "From the time when [the airline] shared information at the time of the incident, to now when there's been a detailed report outlining what happened, I believe this is a process," Chan said when asked if the carrier had given an inaccurate explanation at first.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister stressed the administration would consider an airline's operations and performance when making arrangements on flight allocations and air traffic rights.
  <br>
  <br>
  In response, the low-cost carrier again apologised to affected passengers and said it had put in place a number of measures to prevent similar incidents from happening again.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will maintain close contact with the Transport and Logistics Bureau regarding the company's operations, and continue to strive to provide safe and reliable services to our customers," the airline said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 National sporting events staged in Hong Kong later this year are expected to draw more than 100,000 spectators, the government said on Wednesday, as the SAR is set to co-host the National Games with Guangdong and Macau for the first time.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Games, the nation's highest-level multi-sports event, will be held from November 9 to 21.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong will host track cycling, fencing, rugby sevens, beach volleyball, golf, triathlon, men's handball and men's under-22 basketball. Bowling will also be held as a mass participation event.
  <br>
  <br>
  In addition to the National Games, the city will also host several events as part of the 12th National Games for Persons with Disabilities and the 9th National Special Olympic Games in December.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rosanna Law, the secretary for culture, sports and tourism, said officials are working on competition schedules with Guangdong and Macau counterparts.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Macau are discussing the ticketing plans and sales arrangements... The three places will adopt the same sales platform," she said in a written reply to the Legislative Council.
  <br>
  <br>
  There will be about 1,800 athletes taking part in the eight National Games events held in the SAR, with 700 others participating in the December competitions, Law said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is estimated that the events in Hong Kong will attract more than 100,000 spectators from Hong Kong, the mainland and other regions," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[The bureau] is, in collaboration with the relevant departments... conducting a detailed assessment on the traffic and transport arrangements to and from the venues having regard to the transport facilities and capacity of the venues, their past experiences in staging competitions, and the number of participating athletes and spectators for each event."

    E.coli may have spread in hospital washroom: expert

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A suspected E. coli outbreak at Princess Margaret Hospital that is thought to have claimed the life of a doctor and sickened two others could have spread in a washroom, a microbiologist said on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong University's Yuen Kwok-yung told RTHK that this is because the bacteria survive longer in humid conditions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Because they would use the same toilet in their department and that of course could be a place of transmission," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "After using the toilet it would be humid, therefore it is possible that the virus was spread there."
  <br>
  <br>
  Yuen added, however, that since the washroom in question would have been sanitised before samples were taken, the likelihood of finding E.coli there is slim.
  <br>
  <br>
  Three oncologists at the hospital are thought to have caught E. coli. While one died last Friday, the other two only had mild symptoms.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yuen said the deceased oncologist was young and was not known to have been suffering from chronic illnesses, so work was still ongoing to find out why the doctor may have succumbed to such an infection.

    'SAR working to make renminbi trading more convenient'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Christopher Hui, says the administration is working to make renminbi trading more convenient in the SAR.
 <br>
  <br>
  In last year’s Policy Address, the chief executive stated the government wants to promote the global use of renminbi and solidify the city's position as an offshore renminbi business hub.
  <br>
  <br>
  Currently, 24 securities listed on the Hong Kong stock exchange have adopted the dual-counter model, meaning they can be traded in either the Hong Kong dollar or renminbi.
  <br>
  <br>
  On RTHK's Overview Policy programme, Hui noted the next step is to make the model accessible to investors in the Greater Bay Area.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I feel that one very obvious trend after the pandemic is that, even though globalisation has been somewhat affected, regionalisation is very practical and is happening," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Trade between different countries in Asia has increased. When trade increases, there's really no need to use other currencies. I can use a currency that everyone is using."
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister also mentioned that the government is trying out different scenarios to expand the use of digital renminbi.
  <br>
  <br>
  "On one hand, of course, if mainland residents come to Hong Kong, how does our system here accommodate them? If they want to use the digital renminbi, they can do so," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "On the other hand, if I want to use the digital renminbi on the mainland, how do I do that? These are the two areas we are working on."
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister added Hong Kong needs to strengthen its role as a financial services hub, saying this is what makes the city appealing to investors.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A motorcyclist has been hospitalised in a traffic accident also involving a truck on Lung Cheung Road on Wednesday morning.
 <br>
  <br>
  Police received a report at 6:27am about a collision near Tai Po Road.
  <br>
  <br>
  The truck driver allegedly lost control and mounted a slope, causing the vehicle to flip to its side and fall onto the motorcyclist.
  <br>
  <br>
  The motorcyclist was eventually freed by firefighters and rushed to Queen Elizabeth Hospital with leg injuries.
  <br>
  <br>
  The truck driver has since been arrested on suspicion of dangerous driving causing grievous bodily harm.
  <br>
  <br>
  At least one eastbound lane of the major thoroughfare had to be sealed off, creating a tailback which stretched several kilometres to Kwai Chung at one point.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another accident in the opposite direction on Lung Cheung Road, near So Uk Estate, at around 8am saw Tsuen Wan-bound traffic pushed back all the way to Diamond Hill.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Health officials on Tuesday confirmed that an oncologist at Princess Margaret Hospital died last Friday of a suspected E. coli infection involving hospital staff.
 <br>
  <br>
  Two other oncologists showed symptoms such as fever, stomach pain and diarrhoea. They are in stable condition, and one of them has been discharged.
  <br>
  <br>
  One faeces sample tested positive for Shiga toxin-producing E. coli, while the other two samples, including from the deceased oncologist, came up negative for the bacteria.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Centre for Health Protection and microbiologists from the University of Hong Kong are searching for the infection’s origin.
  <br>
  <br>
  Albert Au, the head of the centre's communicable disease branch said food is one possible source of infection, but the three doctors did not eat the same food or visit the same restaurant.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, they ate in the same staff lounge.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Another possibility would be human-to-human transmission in an infectious environment,” Au said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We have collected over 40 environmental samples from the Department of Oncology office and toilets. We are waiting for the results to confirm whether there was a cross infection due to the environment,” he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  University of Hong Kong microbiologist Yuen Kwok-yung said it is rare to see an adult die from Shiga toxin-producing E. coli, and pointed out that the deceased doctor was healthy with no underlying illnesses.
  <br>
  <br>
  He called on other hospital staff who felt unwell not to take medicine without proper guidance, especially antibiotics, as it could worsen their condition.
  <br>
  <br>
  The hospital has sanitised possible areas of infection, and asked its staff to seek a doctor if they feel unwell.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Secretary for Health Lo Chung-mau expressed sadness over the oncologist’s death.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement released late on Tuesday, Lo said the doctor “was still taking care of patients in the ward right before the onset of symptoms”.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I am deeply moved by the doctor's professionalism, passion for work and care for patients,” Lo said, describing the young doctor as a role model for the healthcare profession.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The Centre for Health Protection…is conducting epidemiological and environmental investigations into the incident at full strength, and will submit a report and give an account to the public as early as possible," he added.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The eventful journey of the Hong Kong, China men's ice hockey team at the Harbin Asian Winter Games came to an end on Tuesday, after they were dumped out of the quarter-finals 24-0 by top-seeded Kazakhstan.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Kazakhs are four-time gold medallists in the competition and are so far unbeaten in this year's tournament after six games.
  <br>
  <br>
  The players from Hong Kong were outmatched early and often, trailing 8-0 after the first period.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Kazakhs continued their strong play in the second by putting seven in the net, followed by another nine in the last period.
  <br>
  <br>
  Four players scored a hat-trick against the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong goalies Cheung Chi-ho and David Lam did manage 56 saves between them.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SAR team made headlines after three of their players were injured in an altercation with Turkmenistan players following a group match on Sunday.

    Top golfers ready for LIV tournament in HK

<div class="itemFullText">
 LIV golf is returning to Hong Kong in March, after the SAR hosted the tournament for the first time last year in Fanling.
 <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong will be the third stop of the tournament, following Riyadh, Saudi Arabia and Adelaide, Australia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Patrick Reed, who won the Hong Kong Open last November, is among the players who are slated to take part.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to the press on Tuesday, Reed said he could not wait to return to the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I can't wait to come back. Coming back to the place where I got my 10th win, and also at the same time, to go out and shoot my first 59. It means a lot. I think the biggest thing is the spectators, the fans, the people at the golf course is just spectacular," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Also participating in the team matches, Reed said all his team members are motivated and are ready to give their best.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Everyone out here I feel like is motivated to go out and play well. We're playing for huge prize purses, but at the same time we're playing for bragging rights over not only the other teams, but all the other players," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another LIV player Max Lee, who won the tournament promotion game in Riyadh and previously won a BMW car at the 2023 Hong Kong Open, said the Fanling golf course suits his game.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Fanling golf course, it requires accuracy despite not being that far away, and there are different kinds of valleys. This is similar to where I usually practice. Also, the trees in Fanling are very tall, the wind directions varies. I am the kind of player that excels in hitting low golf shots, and my performance at the venue in the past few years have been satisfactory," he said.

    'Guidelines for doctors to execute advance directives'

<img alt="The Hong Kong Academy of Medicine says it will hold three seminars before the legislation takes effect in May next year. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1791181_1_20250211162308.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Academy of Medicine on Tuesday said it would introduce a set of guidelines in the first quarter of this year, for doctors to better carry out advance medical directives.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Advance Decision on Life-sustaining Treatment Ordinance was gazetted in November last year, allowing patients to refuse life-sustaining treatments under specific medical conditions when they become mentally incapable of making a decision.
  <br>
  <br>
  Its president Philip Li announced the academy would launch a set of practice guidelines, helping doctors better understand their roles in executing advance directives.
  <br>
  <br>
  The convenor of the academy's advance directives task force, Doris Tse, said most doctors are unfamiliar with the topic.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We'll offer some practical tips on how to discuss the advance care planning with patients and family members and also advise on how to assess the mental capacity," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Then, we will have some instructions on how to sign or complete advance directives and, of course, all these have to be supplemented with case scenarios."
  <br>
  <br>
  Tse added the guidelines help establish a consensus before patients become unable to make a decision, and it can avoid possible disputes.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said the academy would hold three seminars before the legislation officially takes effect in May next year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The academy said people can also save an electronic version of their advance directive on the eHealth system, so doctors at both public and private hospitals can access the documents.

    Scams fuelled rise in crime last year: police chief

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Scams made up nearly half of the 94,000 crimes recorded in Hong Kong over the past year, the police chief said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Delivering an annual roundup to lawmakers, Police Commissioner Raymond Siu said the total number of crimes recorded last year was a five percent rise over the figure for 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  The force logged more than 44,000 scam cases, up about 12 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 10,000 suspects in total were held over offences relating to scams and money laundering, Siu said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He conceded that it is not easy to solve such crimes, with the detection rate at 10.6 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Many of these deception cases happened online or they involved phone scams. A majority of fraudsters rang from somewhere outside Hong Kong. Once the victim became aware of the situation, we're talking about weeks or months after the commission of the crime, so by the time we received the report, it would be too late," Siu said.
  <br>
  <br>
  At the Legislative Council panel meeting, the police chief and a number of lawmakers brought up the problem of mainland students at universities in Hong Kong falling victim to scams.
  <br>
  <br>
  Siu said Hong Kong and mainland officials have discussed how to boost education on scams among students and parents.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said 80 percent of the mainland students falling prey to scams were in their first year in the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  "These students got a call from scammers before the school year started," Siu said. "After the school year started, the students might already be exposed to scam awareness information, so these students would become harder to be scammed."
  <br>
  <br>
  On other crime figures, the police chief said more than 2,000 mainland tourists were arrested last year, with almost half of them picked up over scams and money laundering offences.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a press conference following the meeting, Siu said the force recorded more than 300 cases last year where mainland students were reportedly scammed, involving more than HK$230 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  Looking ahead, the police chief said the force in the coming year would focus on safeguarding national security, fighting crime, especially scam-related ones, and making sure November's National Games will be held in an orderly, safe and secure manner.

    'Tax cuts needed to help individuals and businesses'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong should provide more tax concessions to individuals and businesses in the coming fiscal year, according to the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce (HKGCC).
 <br>
  <br>
  It made suggestions across nine categories about the Budget, which is set to be released later this month, including suggestions on expenditure control and attracting foreign investment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last December, officials said the deficit would be near HK$100 billion, more than double the original estimate of HK$48 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  The chamber’s chairwoman, Agnes Chan, said the public should not worry though, as the city's economy is gradually recovering from the pandemic.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The budget deficit at that time was caused by two major factors -- we have the employment subsidy, the e-consumption voucher. Both took the government [to] over a hundred billion [dollars in deficit]. So that contributed to that year's substantial budget deficit. Then the second year, 2023-24, and the border reopened in February, but we are recovering and the government had adopted a loose monetary policy," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This year, the financial secretary is already saying it's going to be a smaller deficit because we are in a fiscal consolidation year. The measures include raising taxes on the high income earners, and having the double-tier property tax," she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The HKGCC proposed a one-time exemption on salaries tax, personal assessment tax and corporate tax, with an upper limit of HK$3,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  For small and medium sized enterprises, or SMEs, it suggested the government provide a long-term fixed-rate mortgage.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said both measures could reduce the burden towards taxpayers and stabilise the operation costs of SMEs.
  <br>
  <br>
  In terms of managing expenditure, she said a review of the government's structure would be needed, such as merging organisations with overlapping duties to cut costs.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said an example would be the Office for Attracting Strategic Enterprises (Oases) and InvestHK, in which both offices aim to attract foreign investment.
  <br>
  <br>
  The chamber also said the government could consider setting up a digital services tax, in which foreign telecommunication companies providing entertainment or consumption services in the city would have to pay up to five percent in tax per year.
  <br>
  <br>
  As for foreign investment, it said a three-year tax exemption period could be granted to companies that relocate their headquarters back to Hong Kong.

    Govt stands by idea of windows in all subdivided flats

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A proposal that all subdivided flats must have a window for ventilation purposes to comply with new minimum standards has met with opposition, the government said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  A public consultation exercise on a planned regulatory regime for subdivided flats ended on Monday, with thousands of submissions received.
  <br>
  <br>
  Housing Secretary Winnie Ho told Commercial Radio that many of the submissions included concerns about the proposed window requirement, with some people suggesting that exhaust fans could be installed instead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho said such a compromise would not be ideal.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If there are no windows, would it feel like living in a cupboard?" she questioned.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Even though we received suggestions during the consultation period saying 'let's not have windows and just install exhaust fans instead', I think windows are important to many people."
  <br>
  <br>
  The government has suggested that windows that face an area enclosed on all four sides would not be good enough.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Hayson Chan, who chairs a concern group for subdivided flat owners, said such windows could be complimented with an exhaust fan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho said if the enclosed space is big enough or has good air quality, this restriction could be eased.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said other feedback on the plans includes calls for a proposed 12 to 24-month grace period for owners to get their flats up to scratch to be extended to 36 months.

    SAR opposes higher US tariffs: Eric Chan

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Acting Chief Executive Eric Chan on Tuesday spoke out against higher US tariffs on Chinese goods, including those from the SAR.
 <br>
  <br>
  US President Donald Trump earlier signed an executive order imposing an additional 10 percent tariff on all Chinese imports, and the Hong Kong government said last week it would file a complaint with the World Trade Organization (WTO).
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is absolutely inconsistent with WTO rules... and also they have totally disregarded that Hong Kong is a separate customs territory," Chan said ahead of the weekly Executive Council meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SAR has been calling on the US to take immediate action "to rectify its wrongdoing".
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan also described American policies as "constantly changing", causing inconvenience to people who wanted to send parcels to their relatives and friends in the US.
  <br>
  <br>
  Parcel services to the US resumed on Tuesday after Washington confirmed it would not impose additional duty on mail items containing goods from Hongkong Post.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hongkong Post had temporarily stopped accepting US-bound parcels, as the United States Postal Service last week suspended inbound parcels from mainland China and the SAR and then reversed the decision in less than a day.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Beijing's top official overseeing Hong Kong and Macau affairs has directed SAR officials to better integrate the city into the country's development in areas such as finance, the acting chief executive said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Xia Baolong, director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, earlier made an inspection trip to Shenzhen, during which he was briefed on plans to boost Hong Kong's economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Acting Chief Executive Eric Chan, who was there with the top mainland official, said it was a "very good occasion" to communicate and understand the central government's thoughts on the territory.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Director Xia is very, very concerned about Hong Kong. He highly recognised the work of the Hong Kong SAR government under the leadership of the chief executive," Chan told reporters ahead of the Executive Council meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He also directed that we should try our very best to integrate into the mainland's national policies, especially the Greater Bay Area initiative. This is very important to Hong Kong."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan also said authorities would work with their Guangdong counterparts to make good use of the Northern Metropolis and the Hetao Shenzhen-Hong Kong Science and Technology Innovation Co-operation Zone.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked if Xia had mentioned ways to tackle a budget deficit such as cutting or freezing civil servants' pay, Chan said there is a mechanism to adjust the salaries of public workers every year.
  <br>
  <br>
  A host of factors would be considered before the Executive Council decides whether to approve an adjustment proposal, he noted.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Acting Chief Executive Eric Chan on Tuesday said an opening ceremony would be held at the Kai Tak Sports Park on March 1, marking its official commencement.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking ahead of the weekly Executive Council meeting, Chan said the 90-minute ceremony would start at 6.30pm, featuring large-scale dance and sports performances by local and mainland performers.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said there would be four themes, showcasing Hong Kong's role in sports and cultural exchanges in different eras.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said the opening of the park would be an historic moment, and authorities would seize the opportunity to unleash the potential of the facility.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Kai Tak Sports Park, as Hong Kong's largest sports infrastructure ever, will bring new experiences [in terms of] sports, leisure, dining and shopping for Hong Kong people, as well as mainland and overseas tourists," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I have high expectations and confidence [in] the opening of the sports park. I believe more large-scale sports, cultural and recreational events will be held in Hong Kong, promoting the development of sports and other industries."
  <br>
  <br>
  He said more than a dozen of test events had been held at the sports park, and expressed confidence the facility would be ready for its opening in March.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office director Xia Baolong was briefed by Financial Secretary Paul Chan on his plan to boost the economy during his inspection trip to the tech zones in Hetao and Qianhai on Sunday, according to a government statement.
 <br>
  <br>
  The statement said Xia told the SAR to "continue to be bold in reform, dare to break new ground, and to innovate continuously".
  <br>
  <br>
  The top mainland official was accompanied by Acting Chief Executive Eric Chan and the financial secretary in his visit to the Hong Kong Park of the Hetao Shenzhen-Hong Kong Science and Technology Innovation Co-operation Zone.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xia listened to officials’ presentations on the latest development progress and the focus of work for the park.
  <br>
  <br>
  He later visited the Qianhai cooperation zone and hosted a four-hour discussion session, in which Paul Chan told Xia on what he will do to boost the economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xia and SAR officials also discussed how Hong Kong could accelerate reforms to foster progress, enhance cooperation with Guangdong and better integrate into the Greater Bay Area.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xia said he hopes the SAR government would thoroughly implement the spirit of the important speeches by President Xi Jinping in Macau and the third plenary session of the 20th Central Committee of the Communist Party.
  <br>
  <br>
  Paul Chan said the SAR government is determined to undertake reforms, dare to be innovative, and actively integrate into the national development and align with national development strategies.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also said Hong Kong will co-ordinate development and security, as well as maintain financial and economic security, while promoting the acceleration of economic progress amid a complex external environment.

    Hongkong Post to accept US-bound parcels again

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hongkong Post said it will resume parcel services to the United States from Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Authorities said they made the announcement after the US confirmed it would not impose additional duty on mail items containing goods from Hongkong Post.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last week, Hongkong Post stopped accepting US-bound parcels, as the United States Postal Service (USPS) suspended inbound parcels from mainland China and the SAR and then reversed the decision in less than a day.
  <br>
  <br>
  The suspension by the USPS followed President Donald Trump's order for an additional 10 percent levy on Chinese imports, alongside an elimination of a duty-free exemption for low value packages.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hongkong Post reminds members of the public that the United States government is constantly changing policies and may further change its policies at any time. There may also be backlogs for mail items destined to the United States and delay of delivery, which may cause inconvenience or even losses to the public," a statement read.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government also reiterated its strong disapproval of additional US duty imposed on Hong Kong products, and urged Washington "to take urgent actions to rectify its wrongdoing".

    'Flavoured tobacco ban will further hit bar business'

<img alt="The Long-term Tobacco Policy Concern Group said a ban on flavoured tobacco and shisha would drive customers away. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1791056_1_20250210185326.jpg&q=60">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A smoking policy concern group on Monday said a government proposal banning flavoured cigarettes and shisha products would greatly affect the business of local bars.
 <br>
  <br>
  This came a day after health minister Lo Chung-mau said the government aims to table an amendment to the anti-smoking law at Legco in April, which will include a ban on e-cigarettes and flavoured tobacco, among other measures.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Long-term Tobacco Policy Concern Group said according to its survey of 514 bar customers in Lan Kwai Fong and Knutsford Terrace last month, four out of five said they would go to bars less often if the government pushes ahead with the ban, while 70 percent said they will consider visiting bars on the mainland instead.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Licensed Bar and Club Association of HK echoed that view, saying "extreme" tobacco-control measures would deal a further blow to the nighttime economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  In response, the Health Bureau said shisha is only allowed in 10 percent of the city's bars, so it won't have a strong impact.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bureau also said the government will consider offering a grace period to bars and patrons before the new law takes effect.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A football legend's no-show at an exhibition match and the sudden closure of a local gym chain have mostly contributed to the rise of complaints filed to Hong Kong's consumer watchdog over the past year.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Consumer Council on Monday said it received 40,839 complaints in total last year, up 20 percent from 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  Excluding complaints regarding mainland online shopping platforms, the figure stood at 37,590 in 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The increase was mainly due to two disputes during the year which raised widespread public concern and affected many consumers, including [Lionel] Messi's controversial non-appearance at an exhibition match in February, as well as the abrupt closure of the Physical Fitness chain in September," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Complaints arising from the two incidents involved about HK$210 million, the watchdog said.
  <br>
  <br>
  There were 1,476 complaints relating to Messi and another 5,619 about the fitness chain.
  <br>
  <br>
  The council said "food and entertainment services" remained the category that received the most complaints for the third straight year, with 5,810 cases involving over HK$15.2 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  Food and entertainment-related complaints "still accounted for the lion's share" overall even after excluding certain incidents like Messi's no-show and Physical Fitness' closure, the body added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Overall, the watchdog noted the SAR was affected by a number of factors such as the global economic downturn, the boom in the digital economy, the trend of northbound travel, and the resumption of the multi-entry visa scheme for Shenzhen residents.
  <br>
  <br>
  "While new traders entered the market, industries were faced with unprecedented opportunities and challenges, and some businesses made the difficult decision to close down, resulting in a surge in related consumer complaints," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The council urged businesses to "promptly improve the quality of services and goods" to be more competitive and appealing, to stimulate people's desire to spend.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The chef de mission of the Hong Kong, China delegation to the Harbin Asian Winter Games, Kenneth Fok, on Monday said the international governing body for ice hockey has suspended four Turkmenistan players involved in an altercation with SAR players.
 <br>
  <br>
  Three Hong Kong players were injured in a post-match scuffle after defeating Turkmenistan 5-1 in a match on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fok said the Sports Federation and Olympic Committee of Hong Kong, China (SF&OC) welcomed "the quick and fair response" from the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF).
  <br>
  <br>
  "We were notified on Monday afternoon that the IIHF has suspended with immediate effect the four Turkmen athletes, who had intentionally assaulted the Hong Kong team," he said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fok said the Turkmenistan players wouldn't be able to play in their final game of the tournament, a matchup for ninth place against Kuwait in Monday evening.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also confirmed that the three SAR players only suffered light injuries and would be ready to play in the quarter-finals on Monday night.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I want to emphasise that our Team Hong Kong China's players had always stayed respectful and friendly when competing, even when facing disrespectful and threatening actions," Fok said in a video released to the press before the suspension announcement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our players definitely did not retaliate or do anything reckless. This is worthy of our praise and recognition."

    HKU introduces new blood-cancer treatment

<div class="itemFullText">
 The University of Hong Kong Faculty of Medicine has unveiled a new oral formulation of arsenic trioxide for the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukaemia, otherwise known as APL.
 <br>
  <br>
  APL is a blood cancer that occurs suddenly with a high fatality rate, leading to bone marrow dysfunction and increased risk of infections and bleeding.
  <br>
  <br>
  The new treatment, called Oral-ATO, obviates the need for chemotherapy and bone marrow transplant, which decreases the relapse rate.
  <br>
  <br>
  Clinical Associate Professor at HKU, and the study's lead investigator, Dr Harinder Gill, said that with all abnormal cells gone, around one percent of patients under this treatment experience a relapse.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So most of these patients are essentially cured with this oral formulation," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Moreover, patients who take this new treatment do not need to be hospitalised and can just go to an out-patient clinic to collect medications after the initial diagnosis, allowing them to retain a normal life.
  <br>
  <br>
  The production cost for this new oral formula is also much lower than traditional treatments, hence it is currently free and available at all hospitals in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But since this is an uncommon form of acute leukaemia, we would have this treatment centralised at Queen Mary Hospital and the University of Hong Kong where these patients would receive meticulous initial supportive care to reduce the early death rate," Dr Gill added.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Lawmaker Vincent Cheng on Monday called for the government to develop more facilities around Hong Kong's hiking trails as a way to attract more tourists.
 <br>
  <br>
  This came after a charity chaired by Cheng polled more than 380 people from late January to early February. Around half of the respondents agreed there was a lack of water fountains, and almost one-third were concerned about the safety of trails.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cheng said the government could provide more comprehensive information on different trails.
  <br>
  <br>
  "One of our suggestions is we do have more professionals to evaluate all trails in Hong Kong, classify them into different difficulties, so we can provide more beginner-friendly trails as well," he said at a press briefing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cheng added that as well as increasing the number of water fountains and toilets, the administration should set up stations for hikers to get replenishments, taking reference from Japan's mountain houses and Nepal's tea houses.
  <br>
  <br>
  In terms of promoting trails globally, Cheng said Hong Kong could participate in international travel exhibitions and invite celebrities such as actor Chow Yun-fat or snooker star Ronnie O'Sullivan to become ambassadors.
  <br>
  <br>
  When asked how to strike a balance between tourism and environmental protection, Cheng said a clear classification of trails will be needed.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have so many trails in Hong Kong. Different people have different needs. If we target one or two trails for tourism, we can promote that trail more. Some of the trails, maybe they are for locals, then we can meet local needs," he said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Sunday's fight involving ice hockey players from Turkmenistan and Hong Kong, China may have escalated due to the physical nature of the sport.
 <br>
  <br>
  That's according to Education University physical education lecturer Lobo Louie.
  <br>
  <br>
  "During the ice hockey game, it is quite violent. So in terms of our philosophy and sports development, there is a debate for games that have physical contact. If you play table tennis, you are separated [from your opponent] by the table. But for [contact] games like rugby, boxing, and ice hockey, how do we handle the emotions of athletes, that should be part of the game," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Louie added the incident would serve as a lesson for athletes to learn how to control their stress levels during and after competitions.
  <br>
  <br>
  He made it clear that contact sports often have stricter rules to protect athletes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The athletes have to stand out for a couple of minutes, or may be they are suspended for a few games or are even [given] a more serious penalty," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Louie hoped the incident would not affect the performance of the Hong Kong, China team in later matches at the Asian Winter Games in Harbin, and urged more promotion of professional sports ethics among athletes.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Monday paid a visit to ice hockey players who were injured during a post-game fight between players from Hong Kong, China and Turkmenistan at the Winter Asian Games in Harbin.
 <br>
  <br>
  SAR sports officials are demanding action from relevant authorities and have condemned the "deliberate attack and injury" by Turkmenistan athletes after Sunday's game.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee, who's in Harbin, went to the athletes' village to meet three Hong Kong players hurt in the brawl.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the trio were fine and should be able to play in Monday night's quarter-final clash against Kyrgyzstan.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CE praised the players for staying calm and showing restraint during the incident, saying they showed professionalism and displayed sportsmanship.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I encourage them to maintain the best mental condition and play with a professional attitude, not to be affected by any incident," Lee wrote on social media.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I also expressed the support of Hong Kong people for the ice hockey team, and encourage the team members to keep it up and focus on the upcoming games."
  <br>
  <br>
  The chief executive also called on the Sports Federation and Olympic Committee of Hong Kong, China, and the Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau to follow up on the matter, and ensure the safety of the SAR's athletes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee was flanked by sports minister Rosanna Law and Chief Executive's Office director Carol Yip as he met the ice hockey team.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Commerce chief Algernon Yau has expressed hope for Radio Television Hong Kong (RTHK) to be flexible and innovative, saying the broadcaster would continue to work with counterparts across the border and in Belt and Road countries to showcase the SAR.
 <br>
  <br>
  The secretary for commerce and economic development on Monday said RTHK would also promote and broadcast this November's National Games, during a Lunar New Year event organised by the broadcaster.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I look forward to seeing RTHK strengthen cooperation and exchanges with broadcasters on the mainland and in Belt and Road countries, to demonstrate Hong Kong as a global metropolis where the East meets the West with vibrancy and diversity, to continue to tell the story of Hong Kong," Yau said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Director of Broadcasting Angelina Kwan said the broadcaster would promote the city's advantages and characteristics to the rest of the world in the coming year, while jointly introducing a number of programmes with the government.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another focus for RTHK would be on the use of technology such as artificial intelligence, which Kwan said could break barriers on production.

 The Sports Federation and Olympic Committee of Hong Kong, China (SF&OC) is demanding action from relevant authorities after two SAR ice hockey players were injured by their Turkmen counterparts at the Asian Winter Games on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The two players are in a stable condition after getting checks by the team doctor and a local hospital.
  <br>
  <br>
  The altercation came at the end of the men's Group C match between Hong Kong, China and Turkmenistan, which the SAR came away 5-1 winners.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to Xinhua news agency, scuffles broke out when the two sides were shaking hands.
  <br>
  <br>
  Videos circulating on social media showed multiple SAR players on the ice as they were attacked by their opponents. At least one of them, Alvin Sham, looked to be in pain as he clutched his head with both arms.
  <br>
  <br>
  Referees and team officials then quickly intervened and broke up the fight.
  <br>
  <br>
  The match report stated three Turkmen players were assessed "game misconduct" penalties.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, the SF&OC strongly condemned what it called the "deliberate attack and injury" by Turkmen athletes.
  <br>
  <br>
  After reviewing video footage, Kenneth Fok, the Chef de Mission of Team Hong Kong, got in touch with relevant authorities and demanded disciplinary action be taken to ensure the personal safety of athletes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong won all three of its group matches and will fight for a quarter-final slot with Kyrgyzstan on Monday night.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Health chief Lo Chung-mau said the government aims to table anti-smoking legislation at the Legislative Council in April.
 <br>
  <br>
  Authorities want to further reduce the number of smokers in the SAR and cut down on tobacco products, by banning e-cigarettes and flavoured tobacco.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a TVB programme, the secretary for health said the measures would be implemented in phases, while also stressing the need to crack down on cigarette smuggling.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The first will be introducing duty-paid labels, and the second would be heavier fines towards illicit cigarettes. After this, we will move onto other issues," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Another problem we are concerned about is e-cigarettes. Hong Kong has implemented an import ban in April 2022. Theoretically, no one should be able to buy them. Those who are still having e-cigarettes either have a lot in hand or bought them through illegal channels."
  <br>
  <br>
  On the proposed ban on flavoured tobacco, which Lo said is used by 40 percent of smokers, the health minister said the government will first seek to outlaw non-mint flavoured tobacco.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lo said in future, anyone entering Hong Kong can bring with them 19 flavoured cigarette sticks for personal use without paying tax, and up to 20 packs with tax.
  <br>
  <br>
  He made it clear smoking led to strong economic losses. "A lot of examples and data tell us when our health is affected by smoking, the economic loss is huge. An HKU study says the economic loss in Hong Kong per year, including medical expenses and loss in manpower due to smoking, reaches more than HK$8 billion."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lo also said the government's anti-tobacco policies hope to protect public health without hindering economic development.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong runners made great strides in the annual Hong Kong Marathon on Sunday morning despite the chilly weather, while the event was also marred by a number of disqualifications.
 <br>
  <br>
  SAR runner Christy Yiu claimed victory in the women's half-marathon, crossing the finish line at Victoria Park in 1 hour, 15 minutes and 9 seconds.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said her performance was within expectations, crediting the weather conditions for making the race smoother than she had anticipated.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think the weather was really good. The humidity was only about 40 percent. The temperature was about 10 to 12 degrees, so it was nice and cool. When I got on the course, I found that it wasn't that windy (even though) it was windy at night," Yiu said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was pretty good. I didn't need to use my raincoat. The track changed a bit, but was still good for running. There were fewer places with strong winds."
  <br>
  <br>
  In the men's half-marathon, Vincent Lam from Hong Kong, who originally came in third, was awarded the title after the top two finishers – He Yingbing and Sun Xiaoyang of China – were disqualified.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I was faster by a minute when compared to my results from last year. I am also satisfied with myself. I have laid a very good foundation in the past year. I always had good communication with my coach. The weather was very good. Although the Observatory said it was a bit cold, it was not that hard to run," Lam said.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the 10km race for women, Candy Tsang from Hong Kong defended her title with a time of 35 minutes and 16 seconds.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the men's event, SAR triathlete Wong Tsz-to became runner-up after Lan Jiehuai of China, who had finished second, was disqualified. China's Liu Aiyan won the race.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dennis Ng, executive director of Hong Kong, China Association of Athletics Affiliates, said after the event that three male runners were disqualified.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Especially for the prize winners, we will verify their identities after the race. Officials found that the bibs they were wearing did not belong to that runner, so after we reported to the referees as well as other key officials, the organisers confirmed that the results were disqualified," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kenya dominated the podium in the men's marathon, with Bethwell Kipkemboi taking gold in 2 hours, 11 minutes and 13 seconds, while compatriots Kennedy Kipyeko and Seroi Anderson came second and third.
  <br>
  <br>
  Belarusian runner Volha Mazuronak won the women's marathon in 2 hours and 27 minutes, followed by Ethiopia's Emebet Niguse and Tadelech Bekele.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among the runners on Sunday was Hong Kong movie icon Chow Yun-fat, who completed the half-marathon in about 2 hours and 24 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chow said the atmosphere was fantastic, and he aims for even better results next year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I hope I can finish under 2 hours when I turn 80!" he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  About 74,000 runners signed up this year, including more than 15,000 international athletes from 101 countries and regions.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Local designers and creators could reach new horizons by taking advantage of the city's connectivity with the mainland and the rest of the world, Financial Secretary Paul Chan said on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The finance chief also noted that a number of designers in Hong Kong have become industry leaders amid the rise of the "goods economy" – a market centred on products tied to the universe of anime, comics and games.
  <br>
  <br>
  In his weekly blog post, Chan said several designer toys made by Hong Kong creators have been hugely popular in the region, with the cultural products bringing in value worth hundreds of millions of dollars.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong's designers and creators have a broad vision, and they understand the culture and the needs of the mainland, the Asian and even the international markets," he wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Taking advantage of Hong Kong's connectivity to the huge markets on the mainland and the world, as long as they create IP products that are unique, personalised and resonate with the public, they will have a chance to reach new horizons."
  <br>
  <br>
  The cultural and creative industries are crucial to the SAR's social and economic development and are an important component of "Brand Hong Kong", Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added branding the city is not only about offering products and services, but also providing unique experiences that demonstrate diversity and promote cultural exchanges.

    'Special corridor to help lure talent to HK'

 Hong Kong's sole delegate to the nation's top legislature, Starry Lee, on Sunday said she is planning to propose ways to attract highly-skilled professionals to the SAR and expand a visa scheme during the annual plenary meetings in Beijing next month.
 <br>
  <br>
  One of the focuses is to further promote Hong Kong as an international hub for high-calibre talent and help them with accommodation, Lee said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We would like to suggest to have a special corridor, just like the stock market connect. If similar arrangements can be established for property usage or property-related expenditure, I think it can facilitate Hong Kong to serve and attract more talent," the National People's Congress Standing Committee member said after a radio programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Of course, our attraction should not focus on the mainland. We should attract talent globally."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee will be one of the SAR delegates attending the National People's Congress and Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference meetings, also known as the Two Sessions, in the capital in March.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another idea she wants to raise in Beijing is the expansion of the multi-entry visa scheme for Shenzhen residents, to cover more cities in the Greater Bay Area with Guangzhou being the priority.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee also spoke about the challenges facing Hong Kong amid the current geopolitical situation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Now the situation is complex and complicated. The Hong Kong government should work closely with the central government on the one hand," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "On the other hand, we should maintain our international contact with different parts of the world, so as to continue to bring more talent, resources and technology through Hong Kong to our country."

 Customs officers said they have arrested a man in Prince Edward on suspicion of drug trafficking after they seized about 1.5 kilogrammes of suspected methamphetamine with a street value of about HK$800,000.
 <br>
  <br>
  Officers said on Saturday that they arrested a 76-year-old man, after searching his premises the day before and finding a batch of suspected methamphetamine, along with drug packaging paraphernalia.
  <br>
  <br>
  He has been charged with one count of trafficking in a dangerous drug, and will appear at West Kowloon Magistrates' Court on Monday.

 With the recent flurry of tariffs and policy announcements by US President Donald Trump, there's been increasing discourse in Hong Kong over economic responses and adaptation, including in the upcoming budget.
 <br>
  <br>
  Executive councillor Chan Kin-por on Saturday urged the public to see the reasoning behind the government's need to prune spending and pare its fiscal deficit.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a Commercial Radio programme, Chan, who is also an insurance sector lawmaker, said that when Financial Secretary Paul Chan hands down his budget on February 26, he has to show that he's in control of government expenditure.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The financial secretary is under great pressure this time around. If he fails to control expenditure, it may affect Hong Kong’s credit rating. The situation is grim. I hope Hong Kong people can understand that there's no choice but to cut spending,” Chan Kin-por said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the government can consider cutting staff-related expenditures, while spending on welfare, such as Comprehensive Social Security Assistance and benefits for the elderly, can remain at this stage.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked about how geopolitics and tariffs would affect Hong Kong's economy, Chan Kin-por said there would be a negative impact, but he believes there will be appropriate response measures from both the central and SAR governments.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on the same programme, the chairman of the Hong Kong Shippers' Council, Willy Lin, said he supports the SAR government's decision to file a complaint to World Trade Organization over Washington imposing an additional 10 percent tariff on Hong Kong products.

 Roughly 1.4 million tourists came to Hong Kong during the eight-day mainland Spring Festival golden week, including 1.2 million visitors from the mainland, according to the executive director of the Travel Industry Council.
 <br>
  <br>
  Fanny Yeung told an RTHK programme on Saturday that of the total, about 79,000 people visited in tour groups - 83 percent of which stayed overnight.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeung was optimistic with the fact that 15 percent of those from tour groups had stayed two or three nights in the SAR - an uptick from last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Although the number of inbound tourists dropped, they stayed here for longer and we are happy to see this phenomenon,” Yeung said.
  <br>
  <br>
  But she said the city needs more tour guides who can speak foreign languages other than Chinese and English.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeung said some travel agencies were unable to host group tours from countries like Thailand, as they could not find guides who speak Thai.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on the same programme, tourism sector lawmaker Perry Yiu said the hotel occupancy rate reached about 90 percent during the golden week, and room rates dropped about 10 percent compared to last year.

    'Remains to be seen when flu season will peak'

<div class="itemFullText">
 It remains uncertain when the flu season is likely to peak, according to the Director of Health.
 <br>
  <br>
  Dr Ronald Lam told reporters on Saturday after a Commercial Radio programme that the H1 influenza A virus is now the dominant strain - as detected in over 90 percent of the specimen.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The flu season has (arrived) since January this year, and we are seeing the rise in flu activity, and also right now the flu activity remains at a high level. But we cannot confirm how and when the flu activity will reach its peak," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The schools are going to resume classes after the holidays, so there's still possibility that there will be further transmission of flu in the community."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lam revealed that there were 137 death cases among adults, and over 75 percent of them were not vaccinated.
  <br>
  <br>
  Apart from appealing to the public to get their flu jabs, he also called on those planning to travel abroad to reschedule their trips if they feel unwell.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They have to learn more about the situation about the destinations, like whether or not the place they're going to is experiencing a big flu season," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And also for those who have chronic illness... diabetes, hypertension, kidney diseases and so forth, they should seek medical consultation first to get timely advice regarding what they should be aware of and what medications they should bring along with them."
  <br>
  <br>
  While some members of the public undergo self-testing for flu using rapid antigen kits, Lam noted they should check if the kits are listed by the government.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also urged the public to only take flu medication after consulting a physician, as they often comes with side effects.

    'Small AI chip firms can benefit from DeepSeek tide'

<img alt="Analysts say DeepSeek will boost the global proliferation of smaller AI chip firms. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790790_1_20250208102758.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The global recognition of Chinese AI star, DeepSeek, is expected to serve as a catalyst for small AI chip companies to massively scale up around the world.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Hangzhou-based startup rattled Silicon Valley last month with the launch of its low-cost, but powerful AI model, which wiped out around half a trillion US dollars in chip leader Nvidia's market cap because it was built without using cutting edge chips, due to American export restrictions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on RTHK's Trending China programme, Esther Wong, founder of 3C AGI Partners, noted that DeepSeek's breakthrough came as the global AI cycle transitioned from "training" to "inferencing".
  <br>
  <br>
  Inference refers to the act of applying AI to make predictions or decisions based on the processing of new information and data in real time, instead of training the AI model to learn patterns, relationships or features.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's equivalent to Generative AI, more focused on AI's real applications where AI can serve users differently in a tailored way," Wong explained.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[So if] inferencing is going to be used by some seven billion people in the world. You can imagine the explosion of demand is going to be so much that in the words of Jensen Huang, the inferencing demand is literally one billion times bigger than the training demand."
  <br>
  <br>
  "[But] If we do not change how AI is being manufactured now, the world will run out of power very, very soon," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong, who previously worked as managing director at Chinese AI leader SenseTime, noted the new opportunities following DeepSeek's rise as the firm's open-source model would help other small AI chip firms to challenge the current market landscape that is dominated by big players such as Nvidia, with investors eyeing alternatives to their chips.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The moment DeepSeek emerged, it can actually help the proliferation of all those basic chips, i.e. chips apart from Nvidia, that are also very good for inferencing purposes. And that applies for both domestic chips in China or chips produced by startups in the West," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The veteran banker and investor also stressed that despite the narratives that AI breakthroughs could be achieved with smaller computing power and lower investments, demand for such power as well as funds would only increase.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The inferencing demand is one billion times bigger than the training demand, and by making inferencing so cheap and accessible [due to DeepSeek's model being open-sourced], we actually need a lot more computing powers so that more people can afford inferencing," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are seeing that the Large Language Models [LLMs] are quickly being commoditised, so it's difficult to make money out of it because the marginal cost of producing intelligence is close to zero. But that is very good for the application layers where a lot of usage can be proliferated as they can be commercialised."

 The SAR government on Friday said it would file a complaint to the World Trade Organisation over the United States' decision to impose an additional 10 percent tariffs on Hong Kong products.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, a government spokesperson said the US measure was “grossly inconsistent” with WTO rules.
  <br>
  <br>
  The spokesperson added that Washington had ignored that the city is a separate customs territory as stated in Article 116 of the Basic Law, and recognised by the WTO.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The HKSAR Government will formally launch procedures in accordance with the WTO Dispute Settlement Mechanism against the US' unreasonable measures to defend our legitimate rights."
  <br>
  <br>
  The spokesperson also said the SAR supports the rules-based multilateral trading system.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SAR government urged the US to rectify its measures immediately.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Forecasters on Friday said that runners taking part in Sunday's Hong Kong Marathon could face the coldest day this winter.
 <br>
  <br>
  Some 74,000 runners are expected to take part in the race, with more than 15,000 of them coming from more than a hundred countries and regions.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Observatory said the temperature could dip to as low as nine degrees Celsius in the urban areas on Sunday, and even lower in the New Territories.
  <br>
  <br>
  Senior scientific officer, Hon Kai-kwong, said as strong winds were expected, runners could feel colder than what the mercury indicates, otherwise known as the wind chill effect.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Because northern winds for the day should be relatively strong, we expect the wind chill effect to be rather significant - especially in open areas and on high grounds," he told an RTHK programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  For his part, the Hospital Authority's chief manager, Dr Larry Lee, said because of the weather, runners shouldn't over exert themselves.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Before the start of the race, [runners] should keep their heads and hands warm, and they should stay hydrated," he said on the same programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And because of the strain on their bodies, from an event like this, runners should make sure that they spend enough time warming up. If they find they can't go on, runners should rest."
  <br>
  <br>
  Top local runner Virginia Lo said the cold weather should help athletes achieve good times.
  <br>
  <br>
  She called on participants to wear raincoats and running sleeves to keep warm.
  <br>
  <br>
  Former world marathon champion Rose Chelimo is among the world's finest joining the competition and she'll be making her Hong Kong debut this weekend.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 35-year-old Kenyan-born Bahraini won gold at the World Championships in London eight years ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I've been preparing for long, since last year. It needs a lot of discipline and dedication from yourself, not following your coach or anybody," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ethiopia-born runner Gashau Ayale, who represents Israel, will also be making his Hong Kong debut, and thinks the local course is a challenging one.

    'HK businesses won't be hugely affected by US tariffs'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Chinese General Chamber of Commerce on Friday said Hong Kong's businesses would not be hugely affected by the additional tariffs imposed by the United States.
 <br>
  <br>
  The US announced an extra 10 percent duties on Chinese imports that also covers goods from the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  The chamber's chairman Jonathan Choi said the issue is in the spotlight, but he is not worried about the impact on Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The total percentage of trade between Hong Kong and the US is not very big. Therefore, actually it's not very much affected, but the way they do it is quite unfair to us," he spoke to reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Choi said Hong Kong businesses are flexible and have started to explore new markets, such as in Asean and Middle East countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added the government is facing a deficit, and he hopes the financial secretary's budget - due to be announced later this month - could introduce measures to increase revenue and minimise spending.
  <br>
  <br>
  Choi said unprecedented global changes created more challenges to Hong Kong's economy, but support measures by the central government acted as a "guiding light" for the business community.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the Chinese Manufacturers’ Association said it expects growth in the SAR’s merchandise trade exports to slow down because of the additional tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Its president, Wingco Lo, said he agreed with the SAR government's decision to file a complaint at the World Trade Organisation over the US move.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lo expressed confidence regarding Hong Kong’s economy this year, saying he expects GDP growth of between 2.5 and 3 percent.

    No need to up criminal record checks on teachers: govt

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong authorities don't need to carry out annual criminal record checks on teachers despite a rise in cases of misconduct, Education Secretary Christine Choi said on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lawmakers were told there were 304 professional misconduct cases involving teachers last year, three times the number in 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  Seventy-one teachers were struck off last year, 38 got reprimand letters and 149 received written warnings.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some of the more serious cases involved child abuse, theft, and teachers having inappropriate relationships or improper physical contact with students.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Education Bureau currently checks the criminal records of all registered teachers every three years.
  <br>
  <br>
  But several legislators on the Legco education panel said they were worried this is insufficient, and checks should be made every year.
  <br>
  <br>
  In response, Choi said the rise in misconduct cases last year was actually a result of the bureau acting upon issues flagged up by criminal record checks.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said the administration has a zero-tolerance approach regarding teachers who don't meet ethical or moral standards, but more frequent checks aren't necessary.
  <br>
  <br>
  “If a teacher commits a crime while employed, we get the record immediately, so there's no need to wait three years. The checks conducted every three years are for those not currently working in schools who commit crimes that might not be reported,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the idea of requiring teachers to apply to renew their licence every 10 years, Choi said the bureau is always open-minded about ways to uphold professionalism.

    MTR to get minimum HK$1m fine for East Rail disruption

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The MTR Corporation will be fined at least HK$1 million over disruption to East Rail Line services that lasted for more than seven hours on Wednesday, the government says.
 <br>
  <br>
  The money will be spent on rebates for passengers.
  <br>
  <br>
  An engineer's train broke down near Tai Wo Station and remained on the tracks during the morning rush hour and up until lunchtime. Officials said intervals between trains were as long as 24 minutes at some stations during the disruption.
  <br>
  <br>
  “According to the preliminary information submitted by the MTR, this incident triggered the service performance rebate mechanism. This means the MTR will need to set aside at least HK$1 million as rebates for passengers,” Deputy Secretary for Transport and Logistics Kirk Yip told lawmakers on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yip said the government has asked for a report into the incident within a month and wants to know what caused the train to break down and what improvement measures MTR officials come up with in case of similar issues in future.
  <br>
  <br>
  The MTR's Managing Director for Hong Kong Transport Services, Jeny Yeung, told legislators the company will learn from the incident and will look at how repairs can be carried out quicker if such a situation happens again.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Special measures brought in before Christmas to deal with increased demand for A&E services will remain in place for now given the number of people turning up for treatment, the Hospital Authority said on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Staff levels, bed capacity and laboratory testing services for flu and other viruses have been stepped up during the winter period.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chief Manager Dr Larry Lee told RTHK that medical wards are operating at above 100 percent capacity and paediatric wards have also seen an increase in patients.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The number of patients has risen significantly. There are around 5,500 patients at accident and emergency units per day and around 1,100 patients are admitted to the general wards each day," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It seems that this pressure will continue, mainly because of the cold weather, and because of the public coming back from overseas travel and students returning to school."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee said that in the past two weeks, 158 people were put in intensive care units or died due to influenza A, adding that this was a similar number to last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said nine children suffered serious complications from their flu infections, and urged parents to get their children vaccinated.
  <br>
  <br>
  The observatory has warned that temperatures could drop to nine degrees Celsius in urban areas on Sunday which it says could be a record low this winter.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The SAR’s speed skater Sidney Chu said his team is fully ready for the Asian Winter Games which will kick off in Harbin on Friday night.
 <br>
  <br>
  The city is sending more than 70 athletes to participate in the Games this year, the largest number ever.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 25-year-old speed skater was the flag bearer for the Hong Kong, China team at the Beijing Winter Olympics in 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chu said he will participate in eight races in speed skating and short-track speed skating this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We arrived and trained in Harbin five days ahead of the start of competition. That gives us enough time to get used to the temperature and the ice surface at the venue," he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Although the ice is harder than what we are used to, we have adjusted our techniques, and the way we move and our equipment. I hope we can perform well."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chu and his teammates will also participate in the men's 5,000m relay and the mixed team 2,000m short-track speed skating relay.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is the first time for SAR athletes to participate in relay races of short-track speed skating at large-scale competitions. This is a critical moment for us. I'm happy to see my team's growth and development," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The athlete said he won the support of mainland audiences at the 2022 Games, and he hopes that he will not disappoint his supporters in Harbin.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hongkong Post says it will continue to turn away postal items containing goods to the United States, even as the US Postal Service ditched its earlier suspension of inbound parcels from mainland China and the SAR.
 <br>
  <br>
  The announcement comes two days after Hongkong Post was told by its US counterpart not to dispatch packages containing goods, "unless a 'formal entry' has been completely and accurately filed with the United States Customs and Border Protection in accordance with the United States law".
  <br>
  <br>
  A government spokesman said in a statement early on Friday morning that Hongkong Post is now communicating with USPS to clarify certain matters, including the imposition of additional duty.
  <br>
  <br>
  The spokesman reiterated the government's strong disapproval to charge additional duty for Hong Kong products, and urged Washington to rectify its wrongdoing to "avoid causing confusion and inconvenience to the public owing to its constantly changing policies".

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ocean Park has apologised for its "lack of sensitivity" and taken down a panda-themed watch, after the product sparked a public outcry over the use of alligator skin.
 <br>
  <br>
  The park had teamed up with a local tourbillon brand to introduce a watch, which featured the six giant pandas. The strap of the watch was said to be made with alligator leather.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Thursday, the park expressed deep regret over the lack of sensitivity of the team in promoting a product that "does not meet the core values of conservation".
  <br>
  <br>
  "The product has not been purchased by any consumers, and has been immediately removed from the shelves. We are discussing with our authorised partners on procuring other materials to make the watch straps," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ocean Park vowed to review its design, production and procurement guidelines while strengthening staff training to ensure its operations are consistent with the core values of conservation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Posts on social media and the store's website about the watch have been removed.
  <br>
  <br>
  The park had previously called on the public to refrain from purchasing and using crocodile products.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also named a crocodile as an animal ambassador for visitors to learn about preserving local biodiversity.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The deputy head of a local chamber for small to medium-sized firms on Thursday said companies from mainland China and Hong Kong focused on e-commerce may still have profit margins, despite higher US tariffs.
 <br>
  <br>
  US authorities began charging an extra 10 percent levy on top of existing tariffs, and cancelled a tax exemption for parcels with a retail value of US$800 or less.
  <br>
  <br>
  A vice president of the Hong Kong General Chamber of Small and Medium Business, Stanley Lee, said while the tariff rise might have come abruptly, some products can still be competitive in the US market.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For example, in traditional retail, it costs US$20 to buy an item. It's US$15 for them to buy on [American] online platforms, but it's US$10 on [Chinese] e-platforms before the rise," he explained to RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So even with [25 to 35 percent extra tariffs], it's still cheaper to buy [Chinese products] than the traditional way."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee, who also heads the chamber's e-commerce policy committee, said his own firm was relatively unaffected by the new US policies, as his products are stored in warehouses on American soil and they clear customs regularly.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said he expects some mainland e-commerce firms to do the same if they no longer find the parcel-mailing strategy profitable.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee added that companies mostly expected the trade spat to intensify, and have therefore turned to different markets in search for potential customers.

<div class="itemFullText">
 An eight-vehicle pile-up on the West Kowloon Corridor in Cheung Sha Wan on Thursday afternoon has left at least three people injured.
 <br>
  <br>
  Police received reports at around 5pm of the collision involving six private cars, a taxi and a small truck heading west towards Mei Foo.
  <br>
  <br>
  Online footage from the scene showed the taxi wedged between some of the vehicles, suffering severe damage to the rear, while at least one of the private cars had a shattered windshield.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officers said drivers of three of the vehicles were sent to hospital. One was taken to Queen Elizabeth Hospital while the other two were rushed to Caritas Medical Centre.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Transport Department said some lanes of the West Kowloon Corridor near Hing Wah Street were closed due to the incident, and advised drivers to consider alternative options.

<div class="itemFullText">
 CEO of the West Kowloon Cultural District Authority (WKCDA) Betty Fung on Thursday said the arts hub's operating deficit for the current fiscal year is expected to be HK$1 billion, similar to that of the previous year.
 <br>
  <br>
  At a press event, Fung said the number of visitors to the district last year was lower than expected, and revenue from ticket sales and museum merchandise fell 20 percent year-on-year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The hub's catering businesses also brought in lower revenues than expected, she said, adding that the authority will continuing operating on loans for the time being.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fung pledged that the WKCDA will continue to strictly manage its expenditure, while rolling out more exhibitions to attract visitors.
  <br>
  <br>
  Those planned for this year include an exhibition of more than 60 works of Spanish artist Pablo Picasso at the M+ museum between March and July, and a special exhibition featuring Chinese cuisine and related artworks at the Hong Kong Palace Museum between March and June.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Palace Museum will also hold the city's largest exhibition of ancient Egyptian treasures for decades, with some 250 objects loaned from several influential museums.
  <br>
  <br>
  The cash-scrapped authority aims to submit a development application to the Town Planning Board in the coming weeks for building housing blocks on a plot in the area spanning 20,000 square metres.
