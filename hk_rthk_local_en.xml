    Govt won't rely on land sales for revenue: FS

<img alt="Paul Chan said the government hopes that different sources of revenue, besides land sales, can become more important." src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1793467_1_20250227134032.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan said on Thursday that the government no longer wants to rely heavily on land sales as a main source of revenue.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chan made the comment when lawmaker Chow Man-kwong asked him whether officials can come up with measures to boost the market so that it isn't "overly cold".
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a Legco Finance Committee meeting discussing the new budget, Chan said officials hope that homes will be more affordable for the people.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the past, land sales were one of the main sources of government revenue that supported other kinds of development. This led to a surge in property prices because of a lack of supply," the minister said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We no longer want to see the SAR over-rely on land sales revenue. We need to develop the economy so that salaries and profits taxes and other forms of revenue are more important."
  <br>
  <br>
  New People's Party lawmaker Dominic Lee asked whether the Lantau Tomorrow project, also known as the Kau Yi Chau artificial islands, is "dead", being as there is no mention of it in the budget.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said officials are prioritising the Northern Metropolis project, while stressing that ongoing studies relating to the artificial islands will continue.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We want to focus on the Northern Metropolis, putting in every effort to speed up that project. Lantau Tomorrow is ranked behind the metropolis for sure," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Business and Professionals Alliance lawmaker Jeffrey Lam, meanwhile, said businesspeople he has spoken to think the proposed HK$200 airport departure tax is too expensive, saying flight tickets to some nearby cities only cost that much.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lam was also among several councillors who questioned whether a land departure tax for private cars is necessary, arguing that it would go against the desire for Hong Kong to integrate further with other Greater Bay Area cities.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said the HK$80 increase in the airport departure tax is only minor.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also said transport officials have received various feedback on the land departure tax, and the government does not have a finalised plan at this moment.

    HKU and CUHK to get 60 more medical training places

<img alt="CUHK says it will announce details for the “second degree entry track” in due course. Photo courtesy of CUHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1793464_1_20250227125822.jpg&q=65">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Education Bureau said that medical schools at Chinese University (CUHK) and the University of Hong Kong (HKU) would have 60 more training places in the next academic year.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a paper submitted to the Legislative Council, the bureau said 50 places would be reserved for CUHK and HKU to introduce a new entry track for bachelor’s degree holders who want to pursue medicine as their second degree.
  <br>
  <br>
  It added the remaining 10 places would be allocated to the universities’ existing medicine programmes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The document also stated the number of first-year undergraduates for the eight publicly-funded universities would remain at 15,000 for each year in the 2025-28 triennium.
  <br>
  <br>
  In response to questions from RTHK, CUHK said it would announce details for the “second degree entry track” in due course.
  <br>
  <br>
  Financial Secretary Paul Chan announced in his budget address on Wednesday that the number of medical training places would increase to 650 in total in the 2025-26 academic year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Medical sector lawmaker David Lam said the increase was in line with his expectations, noting it was part of the bureau's ongoing plan to raise medical student intake.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lam said while there was a need for more doctors in view of an ageing population, medical schools cannot increase the number of training places drastically in the short run.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We need to step up the teaching facilities in the universities and maintain a good number of teaching staff. Students also have to learn the clinical skills at the bedside on patients, which means we need enough hospitals to teach our students, and we need enough doctors, clinicians to mentor our students," he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "All these takes time to prepare. That's why the increase has to be gradual."

    FS shoots down levy for all outbound travellers

    <![CDATA[<div>
<img alt="A caller to a radio show suggested a levy on travellers leaving the city via land boundary control points. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1793462_2_20250227135507.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Thursday said a proposed levy on private cars departing Hong Kong is aimed at clawing back government spending on cross-boundary facilities, while dismissing the idea of a fee for all outbound travellers over the potential impact on the public.
 <br>
  <br>
  During a radio phone-in programme, Chan fielded questions from callers on a wide range of cost-cutting measures detailed in his budget, including tweaks to the HK$2 transport subsidy scheme for the over 60s and the phasing-out of a HK$2,500 student grant.
  <br>
  <br>
  A caller surnamed Wong said he was confused about the plan to charge private car drivers HK$200 to cross the border, a move the government says should raise about HK$1 billion a year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "What kind of private cars will be levied? If you’re talking about cross-boundary vehicles with closed road permits, usually they have companies set up on the mainland and travel for business purposes," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If you wish to boost revenue, why not tax travellers who leave the city via land border control points?"
  <br>
  <br>
  In response, Chan said quite a lot of money has been spent on cross-boundary facilities, including the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Can we recover some of those costs? That is one of our considerations. Currently we're still in the research stage, and everyone can give their views so the Transport and Logistics Bureau and the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau will consider them," he replied.
  <br>
  <br>
  As for a departure tax for all travellers at land crossings, Chan said such a move would have quite a large impact on the general public, and this should be "avoided as much as possible".
  <br>
  <br>
  Another caller was upset with the scrapping of the HK$2,500 student grant, which has been given out annually to the parents of children in kindergartens and primary or secondary schools since 2019.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Didn't the government tell people to have more children? You cancelled this subsidy, but at the same time provide half a month of extra payment to recipients of social security and Old Age Allowance … What are the middle class like us supposed to do?” asked a woman surnamed Chan.
  <br>
  <br>
  The financial chief acknowledged her concerns, but stressed that public resources should go to those most in need.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Right now, this HK$2,500 does not require any means test and everyone is eligible … so we think if we were to cut down on expenditure, it has to come from these areas," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, proposed tweaks to the HK$2 transport scheme for the over 60s also drew a lot of feedback.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Why cap the number of trips at 240 per month, instead of raising the concessionary fare to HK$3 or HK$4?" asked a man surnamed Leung.
  <br>
  <br>
  In response, the FS said he wanted to keep the cheapest discounted fares at HK$2 because the scheme is widely recognised by society and encourages the elderly to go out more often.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But by capping the number of trips at 240 [per month], we can limit the future expenditure growth. In the short term, we can even save money when the adjustments are implemented in 2027 or 2028," he said.

 Abraham Ancer is gearing up to defend his LIV Golf Hong Kong title this March, eager to relive the unforgettable moments from last year’s tournament.
 <br>
  <br>
  Ancer secured his first individual victory on the LIV Golf tour in a dramatic playoff against Australia’s Cameron Smith and England’s Paul Casey at the Hong Kong Golf Club.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Mexican golfer said that playing in Fanling is not only enjoyable but steeped in rich history.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's really fun and you have to be extremely accurate, not necessarily hitting it very far, but it's like playing chess, you really have to pick your battles and know when to attack and when to hold back," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I like that kind of golf where you have to think about what you're going to do off the tee, so [Hong Kong] will always be a super special place for me."
  <br>
  <br>
  Bryson DeChambeau, the 2024 US Open champion, is also eager to return to Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  As captain of Crushers GC, he aims to lead his team in defending their title from last season, and deliver an exciting performance for the fans in the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong loves their golf, and they thrive around golf. It was cool to see that last year, how much they embraced all of us and really wanted us to be there and just loved every second of it," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It’s going to be a lot of fun going back there, being the US Open champion, hopefully [we will be] showing some fireworks and winning. I want to win this year."
  <br>
  <br>
  The tournament at the Hong Kong Golf Club will be the third event of the League's 2025 season taking place from March 7 to 9.

 An Executive Councillor on Thursday said most of Hong Kong's senior citizens will not be affected by changes to the city's fare concessionary scheme for the over 60s.
 <br>
  <br>
  As announced in Wednesday's budget, instead of a flat fare of HK$2, eligible commuters will have to pay 20 percent of any standard fare exceeding HK$10.
  <br>
  <br>
  The scheme will also be capped at 240 trips per month, which works out at an average of roughly eight per day.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lam Ching-choi, who formerly chaired the Elderly Commission, was speaking to RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Only a small percentage of them, they might travel quite a lot because actually, we set the limit quite liberally, I don't think it will affect most individuals who are just trying to visit their grandchildren, or going to work" he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "On average, I believe 99 percent of individuals won't exceed the limit", he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Wednesday said this fine-tuned proposal preserves the government's policy intent while striking a balance between enhancing the sustainability of the scheme and minimising the impacts to beneficiaries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Government sources said the new arrangements are expected to come into force in September 2026.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The sailing industry on Thursday said they welcomed Financial Secretary Paul Chan’s plan to build a new waterfront landmark in Hung Hom, with a yacht club mooted there.
 <br>
  <br>
  Delivering his budget speech the day before, Chan said the MTR Corporation has been asked to conduct a study to develop an area south of Hung Hom Station, as well as nearby pier sites.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is definitely good news to promote yachting and yachting tourism in Hong Kong," the Commodore of the Royal Hong Kong Yacht Club Adrian Pang told
  <a href="https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/news-programmes/this-episode.htm?cmsid=77" target="_blank">
   RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme
  </a>
  .
  <br>
  <br>
  Pang said that currently, Hong Kong lacks berths and moorings for boats that want to visit the SAR, adding that authorities can do more to provide land for yachting.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also pointed out the city’s geography means there is a lot of potential in developing the sailing industry.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If you look at Hong Kong, we are unique in a sense that if you look at the Greater Bay Area, we have the most beautiful coastline, we have all the ecoparks."
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities want the Hung Hom landmark to also include "iconic commercial and residential developments, retail, dining and entertainment facilities".
  <br>
  <br>
  "I welcome the government to do more studies and hopefully we can develop more sites," Pang added.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Several public universities on Wednesday said they understood the public finance challenges faced by the government, and are fully prepared for a funding cut.
 <br>
  <br>
  This follows Financial Secretary Paul Chan's announcement in his budget speech that publicly-financed universities will see funding slashed by two percent. The reduction will be compounded over three years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said the move will result in savings of HK$2.8 billion between 2025-28.
  <br>
  <br>
  The University Grants Committee also revealed in a subsequent statement that universities need to return HK$4 billion from their General and Development Reserve Fund to the government in a one-off special arrangement.
  <br>
  <br>
  In response to the development, Chinese University said it understood the need for all sectors to work together during tough times, adding that it will carefully study the potential impact on its operations, and minimise disruption to teaching and research.
  <br>
  <br>
  The sentiment was shared by City University, which said in a statement that it will actively explore diverse income sources and seek additional research funding.
  <br>
  <br>
  Polytechnic University also echoed the views, saying it will find ways to optimise its fiscal resources by controlling its expenditure and increasing revenue.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the University of Hong Kong said it'll work through tough times as part of the society, but hoped the administration will review university funding policies when the economy gradually recovers.

<img alt="The vacancy rate for Hong Kong's prime office space reached a historic high of 17 percent in January, according to property consultancy Colliers.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government’s move to pause the sale of commercial land in the upcoming fiscal year has drawn mixed views from analysts – some say it will ease a supply glut of office space while others felt it will have limited impact to the market.
 <br>
  <br>
  The vacancy rate of Grade-A offices reached a record 17 percent in January, according to commercial real estate agency Colliers.
  <br>
  <br>
  That translates to 14 million square feet of empty floor space, while another 5.5 million square feet will be rolled out this year and 2026.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kathy Lee, head of research and retail consultancy at Colliers, said rental value of prime office space plunged 40 percent over the past three years.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think the government is very wise to stop selling any commercial land, [so as] to let the market to have some time to digest and absorb the existing available stocks," she told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee added the decision to halt the sale of commercial land was not out of the blue, citing the example of the Queensway Plaza redevelopment which was put on ice amid a market downturn.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Hannah Jeong, head of valuation and advisory services at CBRE, warned the current supply glut will take as long as 10 years to be fully absorbed.
  <br>
  <br>
  On a separate note, the government also extended the $100 concessionary stamp duty to all properties priced at HK$4 million or below, up from HK$3 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee from Colliers welcomed the adjustment, saying it will ease the burden for homebuyers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The interest rates remain at a high level, so a lot of homebuyers might still find it difficult to meet their mortgage duties. I think this will help boost demand for smaller-sized units," she explained.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, JLL Hong Kong chairman Joseph Tsang was less optimistic.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Budget doesn't focus much on the property market. And this measure has no stimulating effect on the housing market but will instead affect government revenue," he said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With the high inventory of residential properties, housing prices are likely to continue falling."

    Views on HK$2 transport scheme tweaks mostly positive

<img alt="Ho Lok-sang says the government has good intentions in trying to cut costs, but that the cap won't offer a major boost to the public coffers. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1793286_1_20250226145154.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An economics professor on Wednesday said he supports proposed changes to the HK$2 transport subsidy scheme but questioned whether capping the number of journeys would offer a significant boost to the public coffers.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 240 monthly maximum number of trips mentioned by Financial Secretary Paul Chan in his budget works out at around eight per day on average in future.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho Lok-sang, adjunct professor of Lingnan University’s Department of Economics, said the government has good intentions in trying to cut costs.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he also said very few over 60s make that many journeys, so the move won't save much for the government.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I don't think capping the number of trips for the elderly makes sense. It's not going to make much effect on the revenue anyway because there are relatively few people who will travel so many times,” he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I think there's really no point in making that kind of provision, because it makes people feel bad and it also tarnishes the government's image in terms of caring for the benefit of the well-being of the elderly.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho added that a small number of people could be affected by the cap, such as those who need to make a lot of transfers.
  <br>
  <br>
  New People's Party chairwoman Regina Ip, for her part, said she welcomes the changes to the fare scheme, which include offering an 80 percent discount for journeys that cost regular passengers more than HK$10, rather than the current HK$2 flat rate subsidised trip.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think the government measures introduced to make it sustainable are fairly moderate," said Ip, who's also convenor of the Executive Council.
  <br>
  <br>
  "(There is) no impact on the qualifying age of those benefiting from this concession, but it would help to solve the problem of paying very little fare for very long journeys."
  <br>
  <br>
  DAB party vice-chairman Holden Chow also supports the changes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We believe the scheme unveiled by the (financial secretary) today is acceptable. It strikes a balance between the [need for] financial sustainability, but at the same time, will look after the needs of the elderly," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The people who live further away from the city centre, including people in Tuen Mun or Tung Chung, they may actually be affected. I think going forward, we will try to explore with the government and see whether there's anything we could do to alleviate the pain of these people."

 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Wednesday said he hopes the public understand that everyone has to play their part when it comes to the city's "belt-tightening", given the tough financial situation.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chan said his budget puts forward a "reinforced version" of the fiscal consolidation programme, which includes a cumulative reduction of government recurrent expenditure by seven percent from now through 2027-28.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to the press, he said the government is moving in the right direction to achieve a fiscal balance.
  <br>
  <br>
  "On the one hand, we try our best to diversify and grow our economy, but at the same time it is a belt-tightening budget, so everybody in the community would need to contribute to this effort," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are trying to do the best we can in minimising the impact on our people, but at the same time, unavoidably, everyone has to chip in a little bit."
  <br>
  <br>
  The finance chief said the government has no plans at present to introduce any new taxes, such as a goods and services tax.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have to pay regard to the following considerations. One is the competitiveness of Hong Kong, in terms of attracting investment and talent. Secondly, if we are to increase revenue, we try to minimise the impact on the average citizen," Chan said.

    University funding cuts 'acceptable': lawmaker

<img alt="Universities will have to return HK$4 billion from their reserves to the government. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1793324_1_20250226165659.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lawmaker and Lingnan University's associate vice president Lau Chi-pang on Wednesday said he believed universities could cope with the proposed funding cuts which he described as "mild and acceptable".
 <br>
  <br>
  In his budget speech, Financial Secretary Paul Chan said he would set aside HK$68.1 billion for government-funded universities over the next three years, which reflect a two percent reduction each year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government said the funding cut could save around HK$2.8 billion for the 2025-28 triennium.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lau told RTHK that universities had been preparing for the reduction and could absorb it without scaling down teaching or administrative staff.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is acceptable in a way that we do have reserves for research, development, and other expenses. So this two percent, if it's only a triennium cut, I would say that the university community can absorb that," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, he noted the city's universities were expanding and competing globally, which requires substantial funding.
  <br>
  <br>
  Universities will also have to return HK$4 billion from their General and Development Reserve Fund to the government on a one-off basis, the University Grants Committee said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lau said while this is not good news, institutions were developing income sources including self-funded postgraduate programmes to help balance the funding cuts.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Of course, we don't welcome any cut because universities are expanding our scope and we are competing with other world-class universities in the ranking, and we are helping our country to build up an even stronger higher education community," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the scrapping of the HK$2,500 student grant from the 2025-26 academic year, Lau believed the impact on low-income pupils would be minimal.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That HK$2,500 was given to students when most students were having these online classes and they require a lot more assistance, but now we are back to a normal situation. So I don't think this is a kind of financial aid that we need to continue," he said.

    'Public sector pay freeze is the best choice'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Executive Council convenor Regina Ip on Wednesday said she supported the government's decision to freeze public servants' pay.
 <br>
  <br>
  This includes civil servants, executive authorities, members of the judiciary, legislators and district councillors.
  <br>
  <br>
  She noted it would be up to the chief executive to decide whether or not to cut the salary of fellow Exco members, or even donate their salary.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think freezing public servants' pay, including our pay, legislators' pay, is the best option forward in the present circumstances," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Cut backs will have ripple effects on the private sector and it will affect the labour sector as well."
  <br>
  <br>
  Financial Secretary Paul Chan announced in his budget that two percent of the civil service would be cut annually between the 2026/27 and 2027/28 financial years, but Ip believes the move will not affect government efficiency.
  <br>
  <br>
  Felix Yip, associate director of the centre for human resources strategy and development at Baptist University, said slashing 10,000 civil service posts by April 2027 is reasonable, given advances in AI.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I guess those jobs may be coming from those administrative positions... We are not talking about effectiveness, but talking about efficiency. They can gain a lot from the application of AI," Yip said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So in that regard, to a certain extent, the cost can be minimal."

    Dose of sweeteners in budget despite belt-tightening

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Efforts to contain government spending didn't stop Financial Secretary Paul Chan from sprinkling some sweeteners into the budget announced on Wednesday, but his offerings were slimmed down this time around.
 <br>
  <br>
  The familiar 100 percent reduction in salaries tax or tax under personal assessment will be provided once again, but this time with a cap of HK$1,500. That's half last year's HK$3,000 ceiling, which itself was half the previous year's HK$6,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  There's also a reduction in profits tax for the current financial year but the cap is being halved as well, also to HK$1,500.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said more than 2.1 million taxpayers and over 165,000 businesses will benefit from these two relief measures which will take a HK$3.1 billion bite out of government revenue.
  <br>
  <br>
  Homeowners, meanwhile, will get a rates concession of up to HK$500 for the first quarter of 2025/26, as will owners of non-domestic properties. Last time, it was HK$1,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  An extra dose of cash for social security recipients has also survived the budget constraints and is unchanged from last year, with an additional half-month payment of regular allowances, including Comprehensive Social Security Assistance payments, Old Age Allowance, Disability Allowance and Working Family Allowance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan also had some good news for people planning to buy property.
  <br>
  <br>
  "To ease the burden on buyers of residential and non‑residential properties at lower values, I announce that the maximum value of properties chargeable to a stamp duty of HK$100 will be raised from HK$3 million to HK$4 million with immediate effect," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  This year's budget sweeteners amount to HK$8.3 billion in total, down from HK$11.5 billion last year.

    Airport departure tax, govt fees to go up

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan proposed in his budget blueprint on Wednesday an increase in air passenger departure tax and certain government fees and charges to help generate revenue, amid a budget deficit.
 <br>
  <br>
  The departure tax for air passengers will go up from HK$120 to HK$200 from the third quarter of the 2025-26 financial year, with Chan saying "the impact on air passengers is expected to be minimal".
  <br>
  <br>
  This will generate HK$1.6 billion in revenue to the government each year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The finance chief also said transport officials will review the tolls of tunnels and major expressways in the city, and explore charging private vehicles travelling via land boundary control points.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The government has cancelled the tolls of some major tunnels and strategic routes three years ago and the tolls of some government tunnels have not been adjusted for over 30 years," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Private vehicles departing the land borders may be subject to a levy, which Chan expects to generate HK$1 billion each year, assuming a fee of HK$200 per car.
  <br>
  <br>
  In addition, the Transport and Logistics Bureau will review annual licence fees for electric vehicles, parking metre charges and fixed penalties for traffic offences.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan also said there'll be a HK$600 application fee for various talent and capital investor admission schemes with immediate effect.
  <br>
  <br>
  The visa fees will be raised to HK$600 or HK$1,300 "based on the duration of limit of stay", and expected to generate HK$620 million each year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For some time in the past, some government fees and charges have not been adjusted in accordance with the established mechanisms. As a result, these fees and charges are not pegged to their costs and fail to reflect the 'user pays' principle," he said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan said containing government spending would be a top priority for the administration in the coming years as he outlined plans for job cuts, pay freezes and reducing expenditure.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chan said he had instructed all bureaux and departments to review their resource allocation and work priorities, and provide public services in a more cost-effective manner by consolidating internal resources, streamlining procedures and leveraging technology.
  <br>
  <br>
  These moves would lay a "sustainable fiscal foundation for future development", he said, with the government facing a deficit of HK$87.2 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  The finance chief said that in the coming financial year, the government would implement pay freezes for civil servants, executive authorities, members of the judiciary as well as those serving in the legislative and district councils.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among the cost cutting measures, Chan proposed the rate of reduction of recurrent government expenditure would be increased from the original one percent to two percent in the 2025‑26 financial year.
  <br>
  <br>
  This arrangement would be extended for two more years to the 2027‑28 financial year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Taking into account the one percent cut unveiled for the current financial year, the cumulative rate of reduction would be seven percent in total.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said this would deliver a saving in recurrent government expenditure of around HK$62 billion in the coming financial years up to 2028.
  <br>
  <br>
  The financial secretary also said the civil service would be reduced by two percent annually between the 2026-27 and 2027-28 financial years, resulting in about 10,000 jobs cut by April 1, 2027.
  <br>
  <br>
  The cuts in spending will also affect the education sector.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said the government would provide HK$68.1 billion to University Grants Committee-funded universities in the coming three years.
  <br>
  <br>
  This funding has reflected a two percent reduction target each year, which was in line with the magnitude of government's recurrent expenditure cut.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government will not sell any commercial sites in the coming year due to a sluggish commercial property market.
 <br>
  <br>
  "In view of the high vacancy rates of offices in recent years and the relatively ample supply in the next few years, the government will not roll out any commercial site for sale in the coming year to allow the market to absorb the existing supply," Financial Secretary Paul Chan said in his budget speech on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  As for residential sites, Chan said the 2025-26 land sale list comprises eight plots.
  <br>
  <br>
  Along with other property projects, it's expected to generate about 13,700 units.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The government will closely monitor market situation and development, and roll out sites in a paced and orderly manner," Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that the government will prepare land for the production of 80,000 private units in the next five years, with about 65 percent of the plots coming from the Northern Metropolis and Tung Chung New Town Extension.
  <br>
  <br>
  On public housing supply, Chan said the government has identified enough land to meet the supply target of 308,000 flats over the next 10 years.

    FS confirms new limits on HK$2 trips

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Wednesday confirmed that changes are planned to the city's subsidised public transport fares for the over 60s, dubbing the new arrangement "HK$2 flat rate cum 80 percent discount".
 <br>
  <br>
  Journeys will still cost HK$2 in many cases, but for standard fares which exceed HK$10, only a discount of 80 percent will be provided.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another change means the number of subsidised trips per month will be capped at 240, which works out at an average of roughly eight per day.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This fine-tuned proposal preserves our policy intent while striking a balance between enhancing the sustainability of the scheme and minimising the impacts to the beneficiaries," Chan said in his budget address.
  <br>
  <br>
  Government sources said the new arrangements are expected to come into force in September 2026.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the city's Public Transport Fare Subsidy Scheme – which covers people of all ages – is also being made less generous.
  <br>
  <br>
  Instead of people getting back a third of their monthly travel expenses above HK$400, from June the subsidy will only kick in from HK$500. The subsidy cap will remain at HK$400 per month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said the changes to the two schemes will save the taxpayer HK$6.2 billion in the coming five years.

    Govt to regulate basketball betting

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government said it will explore regulating basketball betting activities and invite the Hong Kong Jockey Club to submit a proposal on the matter.
 <br>
  <br>
  Financial Secretary Paul Chan said in his budget speech on Wednesday that there have been public concerns about illegal basketball betting in the city in recent years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said according to the latest Jockey Club assessment, turnover of illegal basketball betting reached HK$70 billion to HK$90 billion last year, and he stressed the need to combat illegal betting activities in an effective manner.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong Jockey Club said in a statement that it would submit a detailed proposal to the government, adding it is eager to collaborate on this important policy initiative.
  <br>
  <br>
  The club said the move is essential for addressing the surge in illegal basketball betting, which has contributed to social issues such as loan sharking and underage gambling.
  <br>
  <br>
  It added that regulating basketball betting would not only combat illegal betting activities, but also enhance the club's ability to make charitable contributions and generate tax revenues.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sports sector lawmaker Kenneth Fok welcomed the move, noting that this approach would not only tackle illegal gambling, but also channel related revenues back to the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  The proposal is projected to generate an additional HK$1.5 billion to HK$2 billion in gambling tax revenue annually for Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I would urge the government on one hand to discuss and also legalise the basketball gambling activities, but on the other hand increase its effort into educating the public through different institutions to make the public aware of the dangers of over gambling or gambling addiction," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[The] NBA also would have more activities in this region, not just in Hong Kong but in our neighbouring Macau. They are planning a lot of new activities which will bring in more fans. This is also maybe a result of such attention on basketball."
  <br>
  <br>
  Fok hopes the Jockey Club can launch related betting projects before the start of the next NBA season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Professor Patrick Lau from the department of sport, physical education and health at Baptist University said that while regulating basketball betting might provide a temporary solution to curbing illegal activities, the long-term consequences could be harmful.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For the long term, the underground betting is still there. The controversial discussion about gambling in sports, ethically I see it's a problem. When we look at the research studies, the findings tell us that whenever those people spend HK$1 on gambling, the government at the end needs to spend HK$4 to treat [addicted] gamblers. So for the long term, we will suffer," he said.

    HK$300m earmarked for enhanced EV charging network

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government will increase its support for electric vehicles (EVs) by launching a HK$300 million subsidy scheme in the middle of the year for a citywide charging network.
 <br>
  <br>
  Paul Chan said it is expected the scheme would provide impetus for the industry to install 3,000 fast chargers for EVs across Hong Kong by 2030.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan noted the need for more charging stations given there are more than 100,000 EVs in Hong Kong, about eight times compared with five years ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  The financial secretary also announced new initiatives to enhance waste reduction at source.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the government would allocate additional funding of HK$180 million for increasing the number of residential food waste smart recycling bins and food waste collection facilities across the city, as well as expanding the city's recycling network and increasing waste recovery.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Tourism Board (HKTB) will get HK$1.2 billion from the government in the coming year to fund its efforts to attract visitors to the city and pursue the concept of "tourism is everywhere".
 <br>
  <br>
  Panda tourism, horse-racing tourism and eco-tourism will be among the products to be promoted, Financial Secretary Paul Chan announced his budget address on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The HKTB will collaborate with more international brands to tell the good stories of Hong Kong's tourism," Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[The board] will continue to support the staging of more meetings, incentive travels, conventions and exhibitions in Hong Kong, which are expected to bring about 183,000 additional visitor arrivals and spending of about HK$1.4 billion."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said he has earmarked money to be spent on encouraging cruise ships to make more calls to Hong Kong and use the city as their home port.
  <br>
  <br>
  The financial chief noted that officials are making an effort to attract more people to take in the sights along Victoria Harbour, adding that new refreshment stalls are planned in various locations "to enrich visitor experience".
  <br>
  <br>
  The government has also asked MTR bosses to look into whether the waterfront and former pier sites south of Hung Hom Station can be used for commercial and residential developments, including a yacht club, Chan said.

 Artificial intelligence will be at the heart of the government's efforts to turn the city into an Innovation and Technology (I&T) and science centre for Asia, according to the financial secretary.
 <br>
  <br>
  As he delivered the budget for 2025-26, Paul Chan pledged the government would support Hong Kong's R&D efforts as well as the industrial application of AI.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said the government would set aside HK$1 billion for the establishment of the Hong Kong AI Research and Development Institute.
  <br>
  <br>
  The finance chief also said the city would enter the Low Earth Orbit satellite sector, calling it the "new trend in global satellite development".
  <br>
  <br>
  The Commerce and Economic Development Bureau and the Office of the Communications Authority would explore a set of streamlined procedures for vetting licence applications for operating Low Earth Orbit satellites, with the relevant work to be completed by this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Additionally, the government would draw up a medium- to long‑term development plan for new industrialisation in Hong Kong, with a HK$10 billion I&T Industry‑Oriented Fund to channel more capital to invest in emerging and future industries of strategic importance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said the government would invite relevant organisations show their interest in the plans and will to seek funding approval from Legco in the middle of this year.

    Paul Chan delivers 2025-26 budget

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Wednesday delivered his 2025-26 budget to the Legislative Council.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chan started the speech for his financial blueprint – which aims to tackle an estimated HK$100 billion deficit – by saying that Hong Kong needs to reform, innovate and relentlessly improve.
  <br>
  <br>
  He pointed out that though counter-cyclical measures launched in the past few years to counter the pandemic have stabilised the economy and eased people’s burden, it has resulted in a fiscal deficit.
  <br>
  <br>
  “In this budget, I propose a reinforced version of the fiscal consolidation programme, including a cumulative reduction of government recurrent expenditure by seven percent from now through 2027-28," he told lawmakers at Legco.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Strictly containing public expenditure is a must, but we should proceed in a steady and prudent manner, and be careful to find a balance among the various impacts that may arise in the process.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The finance minister also said the “approach represents our all-out effort to minimise the impact on public services and people's livelihood”, adding that "it gives us a clear pathway towards the goal of restoring fiscal balance”.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the SAR's economic growth, Chan said authorities forecast that Hong Kong's gross domestic product will continue to grow moderately this year, rising two to three percent in real terms.
  <br>
  <br>
  The economy grew by 2.5 percent in 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also forecast that the economy will grow, on average, by 2.9 percent a year in real terms from 2026 to 2029, with underlying inflation expected to be at an average of 2.5 percent a year.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 With the government facing a budget shortfall of almost HK$100 billion, all eyes will be on how the financial secretary plans to cut spending and increase revenue when he delivers his budget speech on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Paul Chan is expected to address civil service pay and announce possible reductions in expenditure in some areas.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some people see freezing or even reducing civil service pay as a way to help rein in the deficit and achieve fiscal stability.
  <br>
  <br>
  But others argued that such a move could have a knock-on effect for the wider workforce, as many private firms refer to government salaries in making their own wage decisions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lawmaker Ronick Chan, representing the finance constituency, has said freezing or cutting civil service pay would affect millions of workers in the city, and may cause changes in people's consumption patterns, leading to a vicious cycle.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials may also try to save money by cutting spending in other areas, with the financial secretary having cited healthcare and education earlier.
  <br>
  <br>
  Health minister Lo Chung-mau has said putting public resources to good use is everyone's responsibility. "Nobody should be wasteful... It should be everyone in Hong Kong, and all government departments... We hope our patients make good use of healthcare resources and don't waste medicine. Like they take extra and just keep them at home, or even throw them away."
  <br>
  <br>
  The chairman of the Hospital Authority, Henry Fan, said the authority will fully cooperate with government policies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Paul Chan stressed the government will propose an enhanced fiscal-consolidation strategy to control public expenditure stringently, while using other public resources to speed up the city's development.
  <br>
  <br>
  On ways to boost revenue, he has highlighted the user-pays principle, meaning those who can afford to should pay more and at the same time minimising the impact to the average people.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Taxation Institute said the government could consider raising the standard salaries tax rate for high-income earners from 16 percent to 17 percent, to help boost the public coffers.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the financial secretary has also said the administration will have to tread carefully when considering tax reforms, and many factors have to be taken into consideration.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A man on Tuesday was sentenced to 14 months in prison for trafficking in a dangerous drug last year.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 24-year-old man was arrested in November as he was leaving Hong Kong from the Lok Ma Chau Spur Line Control Point.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officers seized about 0.3 grammes of cocaine under the insole of his sneaker.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was sentenced at the Fanling Magistrates' Courts in contravention of the Dangerous Drugs Ordinance.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Customs and Excise Department welcomed the deterrent sentence, saying it duly reflected the gravity of the offence.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under the law, the maximum penalty for dangerous drug trafficking upon conviction is a fine of HK$5 million and life imprisonment.

    Three arrested 'for claiming to sell Kai Tak tickets'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police have arrested three people for allegedly claiming they had spare tickets on sale for the opening ceremony of the Kai Tak Sports Park on Saturday, with tickets reportedly being offered at marked up prices.
 <br>
  <br>
  A total of 8,500 tickets for the opening ceremony on March 1 were available at HK$10 each and were snapped up within around half an hour of being available on February 21.
  <br>
  <br>
  As many as 33,600 spectators are expected to attend the star-studded event.
  <br>
  <br>
  Those who successfully made a purchase online via a real-name registration system will first receive electronic vouchers to exchange for the real tickets at a later date.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a press conference on Tuesday, police officers accused the trio of jacking up the prices and intending to sell the tickets online at a range between HK$100 and HK$2,000 each.
  <br>
  <br>
  Preliminary investigations showed two of the suspects did not hold the vouchers and the force has yet to ascertain whether the coupon held by the remaining person was authentic.
  <br>
  <br>
  The force added it has not ruled out making further arrests.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sports commissioner George Tsoi said successful buyers can only get the actual tickets from Thursday, two days before the opening ceremony.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When the exchange takes place, we will check the voucher holder's identity. If the identity does not match, no tickets will be issued, and the person will not be able to enter the venue," he said.

 The Cross-Harbour Tunnel was forced to shut partially for more than an hour on Tuesday after a piece of concrete fell from the ceiling and hit a vehicle.
 <br>
  <br>
  Police said they received a report shortly after 1pm of a car travelling through the tunnel being hit by a concrete slab that measured about 50cm by 50cm.
  <br>
  <br>
  No one was hurt in the incident.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong Island-bound fast lane was closed for emergency repair works, leading to congestion. It was reopened to traffic at 2.48pm.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong Disneyland on Tuesday said it enjoyed its strongest ever business performance in the last fiscal year, with a record net profit of more than HK$830 million and highest ever attendance figure of 7.7 million.
 <br>
  <br>
  The theme park said its revenue grew by more than 50 percent year-on-year to HK$8.8 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Managing director Michael Moriarty said the park will be celebrating its 20th anniversary from June onwards.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Hong Kong Disneyland's 20th anniversary is going to be one of the top mega events for the town to rally around. We're working with other partners as well who are just as excited,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I think with our combined effort, this can be a major draw for Hong Kong arrivals, giving reasons for people to come back, not to just to Hong Kong Disneyland, but to Hong Kong.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Moriarty said the celebrations will include the park's largest ever parade called “Friendtastic!”, and a special edition of the night show “Momentous”.
  <br>
  <br>
  The park will also expand its Marvel-themed section and create a Pixar entertainment experience, with construction work to begin this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The theme park also announced a pay rise of 3.6 to 5 percent for eligible cast members, backdated to the beginning of this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said eligible full-time staff will also be awarded discretionary bonuses equivalent to 1.8 to 2.4 months' worth of their base salary.

    Drug warehouse raid finds HK$430m of cocaine

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police arrested two men following a raid on a drug warehouse, where officers seized approximately 520 kilogrammes of suspected cocaine, valued at over HK$430 million.
 <br>
  <br>
  Officers intercepted the men at a residential building in Tseung Kwan O on Sunday, discovering two kilos of cocaine in one man's bag, along with an additional 518 kilos in their unit.
  <br>
  <br>
  Senior Inspector Tong Wai-kwok, from the Narcotics Bureau, said the cocaine was suspected to have been smuggled into the city from South America via shipping freight.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The drug trafficking group simultaneously rented a unit in Kwai Chung, where they used legitimate logistics companies to transport drugs arriving in Hong Kong to the Kwai Chung unit for processing," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There, over 1,500 boxes of frozen goods were inspected, and some cocaine concealed within was extracted, repackaged, and disguised as regular cargo. The drugs were then transferred to a private residential unit for storage and distribution."
  <br>
  <br>
  Tong said the group frequently changed locations through different logistics and transport companies to evade detection.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chief Superintendent Ng Kwok-Cheung said the two men, aged 22 and 23, were unemployed and likely committed these crimes to make money quickly.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two men were arrested for drug trafficking, and the case will be brought to the Kwun Tong Magistrates' Courts on Wednesday.

    'Child car seats wouldn't work on public transport'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A new law requiring child car seats or other extra restraints to be fitted in private vehicles carrying children would be too difficult to implement on public transport, the government said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  From November, child restraining devices must be used in private cars for children under eight, unless they are at least 1.35 metres tall.
  <br>
  <br>
  A chief engineer at the Transport Department, Eddy Wu, said half of traffic accidents affecting under eights involve private cars.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that it would be difficult for public transport operators to install restraining devices to suit all child passengers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Children of different ages require different kinds of restraints. For example, older children only need a booster seat, while infants need a baby car seat," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If public transport operators also had to offer suitable devices for children of different ages, or offer a certain quantity, it might create obstacles for their daily operations."
  <br>
  <br>
  Wu also explained why children at least 1.35 metres tall will not need extra restraints. He said this is because their feet will touch the floor and an adult seatbelt would not cut into their necks.

    Improve HK's vocational training system: FTU

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Unionists on Tuesday said the government should allocate more resources to improve Hong Kong’s vocational training system to cultivate more locally skilled talent.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong Federation of Trade Unions (FTU) surveyed 120 vocational training students between October and December last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Over 70 percent of respondents said they were able to land a job within three months of graduation, and more than 90 percent agreed career education in junior secondary years should be strengthened.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alice Tang, the general secretary of the FTU’s occupational retraining centre, said it is important to encourage young people to think about different career paths while they are still at school.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We believe education is a crucial point. If we cannot start from adolescence, or the student’s level, we cannot [emphasise] the importance of vocational training. The education is not only for students, it is also for their parents and teachers,” Tang said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The union suggested the government increase social recognition towards applied learning subjects in the HKDSE public examination, by raising the highest attainable level from four to five.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said this would draw more connections between students' learning experiences and their career development, therefore encouraging more to consider a path outside of traditional academics.
  <br>
  <br>
  The FTU also called for an improvement in the social status of skilled labour, while providing more opportunities for people to advance in their careers, as a way to solve the labour shortage problem.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Our strategy is to enhance professional career education, and the main theme is to enhance [students'] working skill level, so that they can reach local and overseas needs. If we can cooperate with all of society, we can reach our goal,” Tang said.

    Self-parking cars good for new drivers: motoring group

<div class="itemFullText">
 A motoring group has welcomed a change in the law which will allow drivers to use technology to get their cars to park themselves.
 <br>
  <br>
  From March 1, it will be legal for motorists to use smartphones or other devices to enable remote control parking.
  <br>
  <br>
  Honorary life president of the Hong Kong, China Automobile Association, Ringo Lee, told RTHK on Tuesday that the technology will be especially useful when parking in tight spots.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think it's absolutely safe for those who aren't familiar with driving, or even novice drivers. Because the vehicle itself makes use of a lot of technology... laser or infrared cameras, etc... to park. It's not parking arbitrarily," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee said insurance companies should expand third-party insurance to cover drivers in the event an incident is caused by a faulty car system.

  Other transport-related rule changes from March 1 include allowing dashboard monitors in vehicles to show non-driving related content once the handbrake is on, and more types of electric vehicles will be allowed to use expressways without the need for a permit.

    Drinks recycling plan to cut costs: Tse Chin-wan

<div class="itemFullText">
 Environment minister Tse Chin-wan on Tuesday said he believes a market-led approach in recycling plastic containers and beverage cartons will reduce overall operational costs.
 <br>
  <br>
  The government plans to introduce legal amendments to require drinks companies to collect plastic bottles and cartons for recycling.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bottles and cartons would come with a minimum 10-cent rebate.
  <br>
  <br>
  There will be four phases to the plan, and the initial recycling targets will be set at 30 percent for plastic containers and 10 percent for cartons.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a radio programme, Tse said companies will be penalised for missing targets.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This means requiring beverage importers or manufacturers to make their own arrangements, while the government only sets a target for how much they need to collect, as well as setting a minimum rebate amount," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So, we believe that a market-driven model will reduce overall operating costs and give companies more flexibility in managing their operations."
  <br>
  <br>
  Under the plans, companies can either handle recycling themselves or hire scheme operators.
  <br>
  <br>
  Simon Wong, president of the Federation of Restaurants and Related Trades, told the same programme that it could be difficult for small and medium-sized companies to implement the scheme.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Plastic bottles and drink cartons will need a special label for recycling to help people get their 10-cent refund when recycling. But it might not be easy for some importers because adding these special labels to their products isn't simple and requires changes to their production process," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The administration hopes to recover up to 75 percent of plastic containers and 50 percent of drink cartons within eight years.

<img alt="The event was scheduled to take place between March 26-30. Photo courtesy of Digital Art Fair." src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1793060_1_20250225111142.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government has urged event organisers to make sure they have sufficient funding before selling tickets, after this year's Digital Art Fair was cancelled just weeks in advance.
 <br>
  <br>
  Organisers said the cancellation, announced on Monday, is down to reasons beyond its control.
  <br>
  <br>
  The event was supposed to be held between March 26-30 as part of "Arts March", which also includes Art Basel and Art Central.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement responding to media questions regarding the cancellation, a spokesperson for the Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau said organisers of the Digital Art Fair had applied for money from the Mega Arts and Cultural Events Fund, but failed to provide adequate information for authorities to assess the event's artistic merits, attractiveness to tourists, and economic benefits.
  <br>
  <br>
  The spokesperson noted that tickets for the event were already on sale when the authorities received and rejected the funding application, adding that sufficient funds should be ensured before tickets are sold for an event to avoid similar situations from occurring in the future.
  <br>
  <br>
  Organisers said full refunds will be automatically provided to ticket-holders. General tickets were sold for about HK$320, with VIP tickets going for around HK$960.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Digital Art Fair deeply regrets any disappointment this decision may cause to all stakeholders," a statement said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The fair was founded in 2021 and aims to show cutting-edge technology in the digital fine art sphere.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Officials said they are investigating suspicions that some street cleaners have been creating fake work for themselves by putting up posters on lampposts just so they can be seen removing them.
 <br>
  <br>
  An online video purportedly showed workers posting bills on lampposts on Nam Cheong Street in Sham Shui Po, and then filming themselves removing them, as potential proof of their work.
  <br>
  <br>
  A Food and Environmental Hygiene Department spokesman said on Monday that a preliminary investigation found that four workers from an outsourced street cleansing service contractor were involved, and they have been suspended pending further inquiry.
  <br>
  <br>
  The department emphasised its commitment to ensuring contractor accountability and has requested a report from the contractor.
  <br>
  <br>
  It added that if the investigation confirms the allegations, the contractor could face penalties, including service fee deductions and potential impact on future procurement opportunities.
  <br>
  <br>
  The case may also be referred to the police for suspected falsification of records.
  <br>
  <br>
  The spokesman clarified that workers are responsible for removing unauthorised posters, but are not given a removal target.
  <br>
  <br>
  The department will continue monitoring the contractor to ensure compliance.

    'Education spending cuts should be strategic'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's education sector could face funding cuts as Financial Secretary Paul Chan prepares to deliver his budget speech on Wednesday amid a projected HK$100 billion deficit.
 <br>
  <br>
  Victor Kwok, deputy research director at Our Hong Kong Foundation, said the education budget has ballooned from about HK$70 billion a decade ago to around HK$110 billion now.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kwok thinks the government should avoid blanket budget cuts that could harm daily operations and teaching quality.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Now you risk sacrificing some of the things that people have always been doing on a daily basis, because they will be scrambling to find resources and replacements for things that they have always been doing... education quality may be going down as a result of that cut," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The finance minister previously said universities had relatively large amounts of reserves, calling on everyone to play a part in tackling the budget shortfall.
  <br>
  <br>
  While universities have substantial reserves totalling almost HK$140 billion, Kwok cautioned against relying on these funds to offset budget cuts.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Ultimately, [a] reserve is a fixed amount and the spending is ongoing. You have to spend every year. So if you're saying, 'oh, they have HK$100 billion in reserves, so let's give them less, and they can spend their reserves first', but one day their reserves will dry up," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Instead, Kwok said officials could consider reducing spending on research and encourage universities to develop more sustainable funding models.
  <br>
  <br>
  "How do you encourage the university sector in Hong Kong to become more linked to the industry, such that it has more diversified funding resources, and not just solely depending on the government for funding... so that's one area that we can look at," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  For primary and secondary schools, Kwok thinks the government should support merging smaller schools to improve teaching quality and make sure resources are well spent.

    Automotive sector welcomes govt's child car seat rule

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An automotive sector representative on Tuesday welcomed the rule mandating children under eight to be in a safety seat or strapped in with some other restraining device, saying it provides much needed protection for children travelling in private cars.
 <br>
  <br>
  Peter Goh, the CEO of the Hong Kong, China Automobile Association says there is currently no mandatory requirement for youngsters under the age of three to be restrained in any way in a car.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This amendment actually makes it compulsory for all children up to the age of eight to use a [child car seat or restraint of some kind]," he told
  <a href="https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/news-programmes/this-episode.htm?cmsid=77" target="_blank">
   RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme
  </a>
  .
  <br>
  <br>
  "Now the rule is actually trying to make it better for child safety to ensure that all children are adequately protected while travelling in vehicles," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Goh added that the government is trying to refine the rules and to bring Hong Kong more in line with international regulations.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, Goh pointed out that the rule will not apply to children travelling on public transport.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Unfortunately, public transport – buses and taxis – is generally exempted from this mandatory rule because of practical and logistic challenges."
  <br>
  <br>
  People caught flouting the regulation once it comes into effect in November will risk a fine of HK$230, while "serious cases" could lead to court action and penalties as high as HK$2,000.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Trade Development Council (HKTDC) on Monday said a new index it has introduced to gauge how well the city fares in environmental, social and governance (ESG) has identified several strengths.
 <br>
  <br>
  The council said it used the index in a survey of more than 1,200 vendors and buyers during several of its trade fairs and business events last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Overall, Hong Kong received a total of 64.3 points on the index, a figure well above the neutral point of 50.
  <br>
  <br>
  Irina Fan, HKTDC's director of research, said the findings suggest Hong Kong excels in areas such as availability and diversity in green and sustainable products or services, talent training and market connection with international trade partners.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fan said the survey showed that ESG considerations are increasingly regarded as integral elements in business decision-making processes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Buyers also indicated a willingness to pay a premium of at least 10% for ESG products, while vendors reported additional profit margins from engaging with ESG businesses, Fan said.

 Drivers are urged to steer clear of certain roads in Central and Wan Chai because of an upcoming triathlon test event.
 <br>
  <br>
  A total of around 110 athletes from Hong Kong, Macau and the mainland will compete in the men's individual, women's individual and mixed relay events at the Central Harbourfront and Victoria Harbour this weekend, as a part of a test event for the National Games in November.
  <br>
  <br>
  The women's and men's individual races are set for 8am and 10:30am on Saturday respectively, while the mixed relay is scheduled for 2pm on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials said from 10am on Wednesday to 6pm on Sunday, the section of Expo Drive between Legislative Council Road and Expo Drive Central will be temporarily closed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Intermittent road closures will be implemented in the Central Harbourfront and Wan Chai North areas from 5am to 8am on Friday, affecting roads such as Lung Wo Road, Yiu Sing Street and Expo Drive.
  <br>
  <br>
  Further road closures will take place from 2am to 2pm on Saturday and from 8am to 6pm on Sunday in the same areas.
  <br>
  <br>
  Athletes will begin with a swim, followed by cycling before finishing with a run.
  <br>
  <br>
  All races will start at the Wan Chai Temporary Promenade. The cycling route will pass Golden Bauhinia Square, while the running course will loop around the Central Harbourfront Promenade, finishing at the Central Harbourfront Event Space.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Monday explained why it wants to take a gradual approach to getting drinks companies to collect plastic bottles and cartons for recycling, after a lawmaker suggested its initial target isn't ambitious enough.
 <br>
  <br>
  Under the plans, the bottles and cartons would come with a minimum HK$0.10 rebate and the administration hopes that within eight years, up to 75 percent of the packaging would be recovered.
  <br>
  <br>
  But there will be four phases to the plan and the initial target is for 30 percent of plastic containers and 10 percent of cartons to be collected, a goal described as "relatively conservative" by lawmaker Chan Yuet-ming.
  <br>
  <br>
  Environment Secretary Tse Chin-wan said a gradual approach would help drive the programme to success.
  <br>
  <br>
  "At present in the market, we're talking about a one-percent recovery only. [In the first year], we already require them to increase the [recovery] volume by 10 times," Tse told lawmakers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Compared to overseas markets, Hong Kong really has a very wide diversity of sales outlets. It is rather difficult for recovery rate targets to be raised more than 10 percent. We believe that a phased implementation and a phased increase of the recovery target is more appropriate."
  <br>
  <br>
  The environment chief said the 10-cent rebate is "attractive enough" as an incentive, after several lawmakers raised questions over how sufficient the amount would be in motivating public participation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The rebate is at least 10 cents... The scheme operators can always have the discretion to offer a larger rebate," Tse said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The recovery target is mandatory and this will put pressure on the operators or the suppliers to recover and collect the amount that would hit the target. Otherwise, the penalty would be on them."
  <br>
  <br>
  The government intends to introduce legal amendments in the second quarter of this year to establish a framework for Producer Responsibility Schemes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The proposal for drink suppliers covers containers and cartons with volumes between 100 millilitres and two litres.

    Child car seat rule to come into force in November

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Children under eight travelling in private cars will need to be in a safety seat or strapped in with some other child restraining device (CRD) from November 1, transport officials said on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The only exception to the new rule will be for those children who are at least 1.35 metres tall.
  <br>
  <br>
  As well as child car seats, drivers can also secure their young passengers with seat belt adjusters, wearable safety restraint vests or foldable boosters.
  <br>
  <br>
  People caught flouting the regulation will risk a fine of HK$230, while "serious cases" could lead to court action and penalties as high as HK$2,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Transport Department noted that drivers who break the rule might be able to avoid punishment in emergency situations, for example if they didn't have time to put the child in a restraining device because they needed to drive them to hospital urgently.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The new requirement aims to enhance protection for children and passenger safety. CRDs provide effective protection for child passengers in traffic accidents and they can substantially reduce the risks of being killed or seriously injured," a department spokesperson said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials noted that children not covered by the new regulation will still need to be strapped in, either with a restraining device or with a normal adult seat belt.

    HKBU says its school would shake up medical training

<div class="itemFullText">
 Baptist University says the medical school it is hoping to create would be innovative and creative and not just a replica of the two Hong Kong already has.
 <br>
  <br>
  The university is one of three institutions to answer the government's call for a third medical school in the city, with the University of Science and Technology and Polytechnic University also expressing an interest.
  <br>
  <br>
  Proposals have to be submitted to the government by the middle of next month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Professor Lee Sum-ping, who chairs Baptist University's preparatory committee on the medical school plan, said the existing medical training system needs a shake-up.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Hong Kong needs a third medical school and I believe the new medical school has to be a new one with new features that is innovative, creative, wise and would hold promises for the future. It cannot be another of the old replications,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The university said its four-year programme would be for those who have already completed their first degree, with around 60 students to be enrolled annually.
  <br>
  <br>
  It added that experts would be engaged to help make the curriculum innovative, and there would be an “East-meets-West” approach.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We would pursue a traditional Western medicine curriculum, enriching and supplementing that with Chinese medicine, where students will understand the basic principles, broaden their visual field and perspective, so students can be more encompassing, more humanistic in their approach to their patients after they graduate,” Lee said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under the proposal, students could opt to complete their clinical placement elsewhere in the Greater Bay Area, which the university said would give students unlimited learning opportunities due to the large number of patients available.
  <br>
  <br>
  “In the Greater Bay Area, you actually see a patient, you learn so much more than looking at a slide or reading a book or clicking on the internet. You feel the patient, their consistency and pulsation,” Lee said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The university said it would be able to admit its first batch of students in September 2026 if the government granted permission for the school by the third quarter of this year.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Airport Authority said January marked a significant milestone for flights taking off and landing at Chek Lap Kok, with the numbers reaching a post-pandemic high.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, the authority reported a 17 percent increase in flight movements, totalling 33,660 last month. Additionally, the airport handled 5.28 million passengers in the first month of the year, reflecting robust annual growth of 27.8 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The authority added that on January 25, the airport processed over 193,000 passengers, achieving another post-pandemic peak and signalling a complete recovery to pre-pandemic levels.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials said they saw double-digit growth compared to the month before in the number of Hong Kong residents, visitors and transit passengers using the airport.
  <br>
  <br>
  The most significant increases were observed in passenger volumes from Southeast Asia, the mainland and Japan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, cargo volume also continued to rise last month, increasing by 4.1 percent year-on-year to 394,000 tonnes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among the main trading regions, cargo volumes from the Middle East, Europe and Australasia showed the most notable increases.
  <br>
  <br>
  “HKIA [Hong Kong International Airport] serves as a prime double gateway connecting the mainland to the world. AAHK [Airport Authority Hong Kong] is increasing the total number of city terminals in the GBA to 30 by March this year," said Chapman Fong, deputy director of corporate development at the authority.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is part of our effort to continuously enhance HKIA’s intermodal connectivity, including high-speed ferry, coach and limousine services. By facilitating passengers’ journey between the GBA and overseas destinations through HKIA’s extensive aviation network, Hong Kong’s international aviation hub status will be strengthened.”

    Sunbeam Theatre's last hurrah

<div class="itemFullText">
 One of Hong Kong’s most historic theatres, Sunbeam Theatre, will close its doors next month after hosting fans for over five decades.
 <br>
  <br>
  Founded in 1972, the Cantonese opera theatre in North Point is set to be transformed into a church after the curtain falls on March 3.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sunbeam recently presented its final showings of “Trump on Show” – a satirical three-hour production about Donald Trump and China.
  <br>
  <br>
  The show is part of the theatre's final mission to make Cantonese opera more appealing to the younger generation.
  <br>
  <br>
  RTHK was earlier granted backstage access, and joined Sunbeam’s chairman Edward Li, as well as award-winning opera performer Loong Koon-tin for a trip down memory lane.

    Kai Tak a favourite for latest light public housing

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Kai Tak appeared to be a top choice as people put in applications on Monday for homes in the second phase of Hong Kong's light public housing scheme.
 <br>
  <br>
  Four projects in Kai Tak, Kwun Tong, Tuen Mun and Sheung Shui will provide more than 5,000 units, with monthly rents of between HK$860 and HK$3,270.
  <br>
  <br>
  Successful tenants will be able to move in from the fourth quarter of this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  One of those putting in an application, Chaves, told RTHK that Kai Tak would be a convenient location for her.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I've been waiting for the traditional public housing for almost 11 years. I'm paying rent every month, and my savings are just going. [I currently live in] a subdivided unit and there are four units in all. But the rent is quite a bit, I pay HK$5,000 a month," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm retired. I'm 73. I thought I'd apply for this because of Kai Tak. I do a lot of church work, so Kai Tak is easy for me to access the church in Tsim Sha Tsui."
  <br>
  <br>
  A man surnamed Choi was also hoping to get a unit in Kai Tak.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I live in Kam Sheung Road (in Yuen Long) now and it's inconvenient," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  An applicant surnamed Ng also said the Olympic Avenue project adjacent to Kai Tak MTR station was his choice.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I chose Kai Tak. It's more convenient, cleaner and more airy. I live in transitional housing in Chai Wan but the rent is just too expensive. It's around HK$3,000 a month," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government aims to build a total of about 30,000 light public flats by 2028 as a short-term measure for those waiting for traditional public units.
  <br>
  <br>
  Successful applicants under the first light public housing phase will be able to move into the temporary new homes in Yuen Long and Ngau Tau Kok in March and June respectively.

    'HK$2 transport scheme should stay with limitations'
   </title>

<img alt="The HK$2 scheme was originally introduced in 2012 for anyone aged 65 or above. It was expanded in 2022 to also cover those between 60 and 64. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1792879_1_20250224084830.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan is widely expected to unveil measures to trim public expenditure when he delivers his latest budget on Wednesday, with one of them being a possible adjustment to the HK$2 transport fares for people over 60.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chan, who said his budget would present a plan to control spending and increase revenue, has already said the scheme is not financially viable in the long run and that expenses are snowballing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Members of the public who spoke to RTHK say they do not want to lose the scheme – which was introduced in 2012 and expanded in 2022 – but said they understood that things need to be adjusted when times are tight.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jim is among the 2.4 million or so beneficiaries of the scheme, who has been paying concessionary fares since turning 60 last May.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Of course, I don't want the scheme to go away. It saves me a great deal a month every single month on transport. But I understand the dilemma and the fiscal deficit.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I'm willing to compromise somehow in order to keep the scheme the way it is. There could be some compromise in terms of putting a limit on how much of an allowance you actually get."
  <br>
  <br>
  Seventy-five year-old David also felt the welfare initiative should be adjusted to go with the times.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The whole idea was for retired people to go out. But now, a lot of people are not retired at 65. A lot of people are working full time and are taking advantage of this," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “At this moment, the Hong Kong government is in a lot of deficit. They're not rich as they used to be. So when you don't have the money, you should consider cutting your expense."
  <br>
  <br>
  The government reimbursed HK$4 billion to public transport operators in the previous financial year. That figure could shoot up to HK$6 billion this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  But even as the expenditure balloons, unionist lawmaker Bill Tang said the scheme needs to stay.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We think the HK$2 scheme is very, very positive for elderly or disabled [people's] welfare. it's beneficial to release their workforce, not only to employment, but also help to take care of their relatives, more support to the family,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tang suggested an incremental bus fare system so that passengers who hop off after only a few stops pay a fraction of the full fare. He said that would lessen the government's burden in terms of the reimbursement amount.
  <br>
  <br>
  The DAB also opposed any changes to the scheme, saying its expenditure is a drop in the bucket compared with the estimated deficit of HK$100 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Business and Professionals Alliance (BPA) proposed raising the concessionary fare to HK$3 or HK$4, to align with inflation.
  <br>
  <br>
  BPA lawmaker Priscilla Leung also suggested setting a cap on the transport subsidy each beneficiary can get.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We do not agree to cancel a particular sector who are enjoying the scheme right now, including the age span from 60 to 64. We just need to set up a very clear scheme, for example, they may only use two times per day. So they will use it out of necessity,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fellow lawmaker Gary Zhang, meanwhile, is calling for a cautious approach.
  <br>
  <br>
  He urged authorities to hold off drastic changes until analysing data such as people's travel patterns.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Team Hong Kong, China put up a strong fight but fell short against Jiangsu, as they missed out on gold at a men's handball tournament at Kai Tak Arena.
 <br>
  <br>
  The two-day tournament, featuring Guangdong, Jiangsu, Macau, and Hong Kong, wrapped up on Sunday. It also served as a test event for the National Games in November, when the city will host handball and seven other competition events.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite raucous support from the home crowd, the SAR found themselves on the back foot against the onslaught of Jiangsu players.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both sides traded goals early on, but the visitors took a 15-9 lead at the half.
  <br>
  <br>
  After the break, Team Hong Kong, China ramped up their offensive play, closing the gap to just three at one point. However, their rally fizzled out as Jiangsu came away 28-20 winners.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong racing royalty Romantic Warrior has come up just short in the world's most lucrative race, galloping to second in an epic finish against Japan's Forever Young in the US$20 million Saudi Cup in Riyadh.
 <br>
  <br>
  Romantic Warrior – the highest-earning racehorse of all time – turned up at the Saudi capital for the race in the early hours of Sunday, Hong Kong time, hoping to add to the US$23 million already in the bank.
  <br>
  <br>
  The seven-year-old horse led the pack until the final 50 metres of the race, when the Japanese dirt star rallied to surge ahead in a nail-biting finish.
  <br>
  <br>
  This marked the first loss for Romantic Warrior since the Turnbull Stakes at Flemington in 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  Still, the Hong Kong-trained horse collected US$3.5 million for finishing second.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He was gallant in defeat. We had a great pitch in behind and he got a little bit of kickback, so I thought I'll get him into clear air and he made ground just beautifully. He went through his paces really nicely all the way to the line and I can safely say I wasn't stopping. I did not alter my stride pace at all," said superstar jockey James McDonald.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Of course, I'm gutted he got beaten ... but he went down on his sword that's for sure and made one hell of a race out of it."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trainer Danny Shum, for his part, called the performance "a good run", noting Romantic Warrior was only beaten by a head.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We all did our best. I hope to win every time, but racing is racing. As long as he tries his best and it's a really good race – I think most of the people enjoyed the race," said Shum.
  <br>
  <br>
  The champion galloper is set to next tackle the 1,800-metre Group One Dubai Turf in April.

 Hong Kong Children's Hospital will strive to resume services for its ear, nose and throat, or ENT, department by the second half of this year, according to the head of the Hospital Authority.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Kai Tak institution earlier suspended operations of the ENT department due to a manpower shortage. More than 500 patients were redirected to other public hospitals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a radio programme on Sunday, the authority's chief executive Tony Ko said that staff resignations were stabilising.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Usually there are only around 10 staff members from each hospital department, and less at the Children's Hospital. So when several staff members [from the ENT department] resigned within a short period of time at Children's Hospital ... operations had to be suspended," he explained.
  <br>
  <br>
  "However, the overall resignation numbers are stabilising, and staff numbers are slowly recovering."
  <br>
  <br>
  Ko also pledged to boost ENT services in different ways. These include encouraging medical staff outside the speciality to take care of less complicated cases, and allowing non-locally trained doctors to assist in cases.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, he said the authority is prepared for a budget cut in view of the government's fiscal deficit.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For example, through drugs and medical equipment procurement, we have been purchasing from more places such as the mainland. This helped us reduce our costs. In terms of efficiency, our colleagues are able to work more smoothly and see more patients with the help of technology," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are seeing initial results."
  <br>
  <br>
  Ko said the authority is also seeking to implement within six months dozens of recommendations set out by a committee tasked to systemically review public hospital operations and facilities.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among the suggestions are enhancing top-level oversight for quality and safety incidents, and introducing a reward-and-penalty staff assessment system.
  <br>
  <br>
  When asked whether such measures would affect morale, Ko said the ultimate aim of the review is to help both staff and patients.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan has said Wednesday's budget will detail the government's fiscal consolidation strategies, while revealing the colour of choice for his upcoming blueprint.
 <br>
  <br>
  On his official blog, the finance chief said on Sunday the administration would strictly control its spending, increase revenue appropriately, and make use of public resources and market forces to further boost development.
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted the aqua-coloured cover of the budget reflected the unlimited opportunities presented in future developments.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There is infinite vitality in a beautiful lake. Despite the occasional storms, we have firm confidence and positive expectations for the future given the solid backing of the country and the joint efforts of all sectors in Hong Kong," Chan wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  The finance minister also expressed gratitude to those who gave their suggestions during the budget consultation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan will announce his latest budget on February 26, amid an estimated deficit of HK$100 billion for the financial year ending March 31.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Officials said the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Marathon on Sunday morning proceeded smoothly, but a review will still go ahead for to identify areas of improvement for the upcoming National Games later this year.
 <br>
  <br>
  The cross-boundary race which began and ended in Shenzhen while passing through Hong Kong also served as a test event for the 15th National Games marathon later this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thirty-eight athletes from various provinces and cities participated, including three male and three female runners from Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zhao Chaochuan, from Yunnan, won the men's race in two hours, 17 minutes and 15 seconds.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SAR's Wan Cheuk-hei was the first man from the SAR to cross the line, clocking a time of of two hours and 33 minutes for eighth overall. He described the whole experience as special.
  <br>
  <br>
  "No matter if we were running against the wind or there were many slopes, it was still a very special route. We are fortunate to be running it for the first time. We don't know for sure if this will be the exact path for the Games, but I thought the arrangements were ideal," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the women's side, Guangzhou's Chen Liqin clinched gold in two hours, 44 minutes and 44 seconds. The SAR's Leanne Szeto, at some two minutes behind, also finished on the podium with a bronze.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There have been marathon events for three consecutive weeks, with this race being the third one, so my feet are starting to get tired. I also feel a bit mentally fatigued from running. I was a little dizzy earlier, but overall it went smoothly. I didn't push myself too hard," Szeto said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeung Tak-keung, head of the SAR's National Games Coordination Office, said the test event ran smoothly and gave Hong Kong marshals valuable experience.
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted that officials would conduct a review into all aspects of the race ahead of the Games this November.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will consult with the athletes, coaches and other experts to see which aspects of the race needs to be optimised or adjusted. However, we can see that the track's width, curves and incline on the Hong Kong course is suitable for the event. Nonetheless, this will need further review later on," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Around half of the cross-boundary marathon took place on Hong Kong's roads. Starting at the Shenzhen Bay Sports Centre, runners entered the SAR via the Shenzhen Bay Port, before traversing the Shenzhen Bay Bridge and Kong Sham Western Highway viaduct, and returning via the same route.

    'All views on regulating ride-hailing welcomed'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 All ideas on how officials can regulate online ride-hailing platforms in Hong Kong are welcomed, says the head of a government advisory body spearheading an industry review.
 <br>
  <br>
  Stephen Cheung, who chairs the Transport Advisory Committee, also stressed the importance of finding common ground between the taxi trade and ride-hailing operators.
  <br>
  <br>
  The body and transport officials had heard the views of more than 20 representatives from the taxi trade -- as well as five ride-hailing operators -- in separate meetings last week.
  <br>
  <br>
  The committee pledged to put forward a proposal on regulating car-sharing platforms to the administration within this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I have committed to the stakeholders that [whenever] they have opinions, not only they can express their view to us during the meetings, they can [also] submit their opinion in written form any time they want," Cheung said after appearing on a radio programme on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Even if they meet me on the streets, in whatever occasion they meet me, they can tell me what they think. This is an ongoing consultation process."
  <br>
  <br>
  As to potential adjustments to the HK$2 transport fare concessionary scheme for residents aged 60 or above, Cheung said he's open to all suggestions to "reduce the wastage" amid a budget deficit.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he threw his weight behind the scheme's objective.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Any policy that encourages people to use our public transportation, to move across town, I think is a good policy," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to sources, officials are considering to cap the number of trips at eight per day for users, who will also receive an 80 percent discount on fares exceeding HK$10 -- more than the flat fare of HK$2 they're now paying on all trips.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Athletes participating in a handball test event for the National Games on Saturday said they were happy with the atmosphere and facilities at the Kai Tak Sports Park.
 <br>
  <br>
  The men's handball test event is underway at the Kai Tak Arena over Saturday and Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The competing teams are Guangdong, Jiangsu, Macau and Hong Kong, China.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang Quan, a handballer from the Jiangsu team, said the arena is comparable to those in Europe.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think this venue is very professional. Since I have played in Europe before, I find that the lighting and flooring here are very similar to those in Europe - basically the same level," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong men's handball team captain Freddie Tse said the venue arrangements were first-class, rating them 9 out of 10.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm very excited and amazed. It's my first time at Hong Kong's home court, and it's rare to hear our own language. You can see that the spectators are our family and friends. Even the people around us – it feels so familiar," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Huang Peijie from the Guangdong handball team, meanwhile, said the atmosphere was excellent and players were eager to compete.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some spectators told RTHK they were there to support the SAR team and looked forward to watching the actual Games in person.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I play handball myself, that's why I follow this sport closely. I hope more people will get to know this sport. I want to see the Hong Kong team's techniques and learn a move or two," said a spectator.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the match between Jiangsu and Guangdong, Jiangsu led by four points at half-time and managed to secure a spot in the final with a 29-23 victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong team, meanwhile, also made the final after beating Macau 33-19.
  <br>
  <br>
  The final between Jiangsu and Hong Kong will be staged at the Kai Tak Arena on Sunday afternoon.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The SAR's deputies to the National People's Congress from the DAB party said on Saturday that they will propose expanding the multi-entry visa scheme to include more cities in the Greater Bay Area, or even first-tier cities, at the Two Sessions meeting in Beijing early next month.
 <br>
  <br>
  It was among the more than 40 suggestions the party plans to table to the meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  The scheme was recently restored to cover Shenzhen residents.
  <br>
  <br>
  The party pointed out that expanding the coverage could help boost tourism development.
  <br>
  <br>
  Starry Lee, the SAR's sole delegate to the nation's top legislature noted that it is crucial for Hong Kong to open up to new markets, and the commercial sector, in particular, should get ready to do so.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Because they are more flexible in facing all these challenges and they are in a more capable position to open up new markets. Therefore I hope that different chambers and trade associations can join hands together to open up more new markets," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In return, if we have more new markets, we can also bring more talent, investment and technology to our country."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee said she will also propose that the central government set up a "housing purchase fund" to help talents from the mainland to settle in the SAR.

 Lawmakers have mixed reactions towards the rumoured changes on the HK$2 fare concessionary scheme for the elderly.
 <br>
  <br>
  According to sources, officials are mulling to impose a cap of eight trips per day for citizens aged 60 or above.
  <br>
  <br>
  It's thought while the fare stays at HK$2 for public transport rides costing HK$10 or less, the government would provide an 80 percent discount when the standard fare is above HK$10.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bill Tang welcomed the rumoured amendment, and believes it could help solve the bottomless subsidy pit.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think it would affect two types of people, for those who have to pay more - One is those who go to work everyday. I think they can afford the fare increment from HK$2 to HK$3 or HK$4," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The other is those who have to travel across multiple districts to take care of their grandchildren."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Federation of Trade Unions lawmaker hopes the government could review the threshold of HK$10 should transportation fares continue to rise.
  <br>
  <br>
  Roundtable legislator Michael Tien said he would also welcome the rumoured changes, adding that it would be better than increasing the HK$2 fare itself.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The benefit of that is that it sets a mechanism, so that it automatically adjusts itself for the next 100, 200 years, rather than arguing about when they have to change that again," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Changing it into a percentage would be the best thing."
  <br>
  <br>
  Tik Chi-yuen from Third Side, on the other hand, believed that the rumoured amendment would not have a significant impact in reducing government expenses.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Based on our observations, very few elderly take eight trips per day," he told reporters after a Commercial Radio programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If only a few people take more than eight journeys, economically, the measure has no impact. But this will cause unease among the public and it's unnecessary."

<div class="itemFullText">
 Shenzhen Bay Port will suspend its clearance services on Sunday for the cross-boundary marathon test event of the National Games.
 <br>
  <br>
  The port will be closed from 2am to 11am, with no passengers or vehicles allowed during this period.
  <br>
  <br>
  The closure also affects the Shenzhen Bay Bridge, Kong Sham Western Highway and Ha Tsuen Interchange.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cross-boundary coach services, franchised buses, minibuses and taxis via the port will also be suspended during the time frame.
  <br>
  <br>
  Travellers are advised to use alternative control points, including Lok Ma Chau, Heung Yuen Wai, and Man Kam To.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Transport Department recommended using the East Rail Line or taking KMB routes B1 and B9 to reach these checkpoints.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Passengers [should] use public transport services as much as possible and avoid driving to cross boundary ports during the test event period to avoid traffic congestion and unnecessary delays," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong section of the marathon is about 21 kilometres in total.
  <br>
  <br>
  The athletes will run for two kilometres in Shenzhen before entering Hong Kong through the Shenzhen Bay Port.
  <br>
  <br>
  They will run along the Hong Kong-Shenzhen Western Corridor towards the south until they get to the turning point.
  <br>
  <br>
  The women’s race begins at 7am while the men’s race starts half an hour later.

    Ticket scalping for Kai Tak opening being combated

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Cultural and tourism minister Rosanna Law on Saturday said officials are working with police to combat ticket scalping for the Kai Tak Sports Park opening next month.
 <br>
  <br>
  Despite a real-name registration system, some people have been reselling tickets online for the star-studded event at prices far beyond HK$10.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a radio programme, Law called on members of the public to stay vigilant against scams.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If you try to buy tickets above face value or buy from scalpers, you will only encourage more scalping activities," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Since we have broadcasts on four TV channels, there's no need to scramble for these tickets that come from unknown sources and could even be fake."
  <br>
  <br>
  People will have to exchange their electronic vouchers for physical tickets at the Kai Tak Arena on February 27, 28 or the event day.
  <br>
  <br>
  The cultural minister said officials will keep pursuing additional guests for the ceremony on March 1, which features athletes, singers and performers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Law also said she's confident about crowd management on the show day, noting that 80 percent of spectators were able to leave on the first MTR train after two major Kai Tak drills.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the tourism chief expects next week's budget speech to reveal this year's visitor forecast, which she thinks will exceed last year's numbers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Last year, visitor arrivals reached 45 million. With more spectacular mega events this year like the giant pandas and the Kai Tak Sports Park opening, I expect visitor numbers to rise further. But we've mentioned that we're not just pursuing quantity but also quality," she said.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The sensation caused by the mainland blockbuster Ne Zha 2 is very much a "lightning in a bottle-style success" which may not be easy to replicate, according to a local film critic.
 <br>
  <br>
  The animated film, based on the mythological character from Chinese folklore, hits the big screens in Hong Kong on Saturday, after smashing box office records on the mainland and abroad.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think what director Yang Yu has done is taking an ancient property, something that every Chinese is intensely familiar with, to fiddle around with it for modern audiences," said Elizabeth Kerr, a Hong Kong-based film critic.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on
  <a href="https://www.rthk.hk/radio/radio3/programme/trendingchina" target="_blank">
   <u>
    RTHK's Trending China programme
   </u>
  </a>
  , she felt the film was a breath of fresh air as the same mythological legends are featured again and again.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The best part about the Ne Zha film is that they're not 'A Journey to the West', they're not 'Monkey King', which I understand that it is beloved ... [But] there's so much more that you can choose from," she explained.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is a kind of strange territory for overseas viewers, for people who know nothing about any of the culture on this side of the world, it's going to be fresh to them."
  <br>
  <br>
  The sequel to the 2019 hit Ne Zha smashed box office records on the mainland just two weeks after its release.
  <br>
  <br>
  The film went on to dethrone Disney's "Inside Out 2" as the highest-grossing animated movie of all time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kerr believes the sequel's more sophisticated and refined visual effects attributed to its success.
  <br>
  <br>
  But she struck a cautious tone over the film's release in the US market, saying it may not replicate the kind of success seen for Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, the Oscar-winning martial arts epic in 2000.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Partially because Crouching Tiger had a wider release. It also had considerable movie stars in it, and a powerhouse distributor pushing it," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  But she insisted Ne Zha 2's value should not be solely judged by its box office revenue.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Ne Zha 2 is one of those things that is very much lightning in a bottle. People will try and repeat it. But you can't force it because how it happened was organic - no one will ever be able to tell you why this worked for this year, at this time, in this country, why it succeeded, no one can."
  <br>
  <br>
  She also hoped Ne Zha's success will encourage mainland filmmakers to experiment with different varieties of scripts, and be willing to "roll the dice" more.

    Impact of Paul Y's liquidation 'manageable': govt

<img alt="The High Court has appointed a provisional liquidator to handle Paul Y's debts and formulate a restructuring plan. Internet photo" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1792682_1_20250221212806.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A long-standing construction firm, Paul Y. Engineering Group, on Friday had its provisional liquidation application approved by the court.
 <br>
  <br>
  The High Court has now appointed a provisional liquidator for Paul Y's five subsidiaries to handle debts and formulate a restructuring plan.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government said while the 78-year-old company is undertaking a number of public works projects, the impact of the formerly-listed firm's situation should be manageable.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, the government said the company is currently working on 13 public works projects -- all but one of them were undertaken by way of joint venture with other construction companies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Paul Y is also responsible for a number of projects for other public organisations.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As the majority of the contracts are undertaken by joint ventures, regardless of whether Paul Y is liquidated eventually, the other participants of the joint venture contracts must complete the remaining works in accordance with the contract requirements," authorities said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some public sector owners, the government noted, have already replaced the main contractor of projects, for which the indebted firm was the sole undertaker.
  <br>
  <br>
  A spokesperson added that the administration has been paying close attention and taking measures to lower the impact on relevant projects and subcontractors, while helping affected workers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Paul Y had built numerous public and private housing projects, as well as landmark buildings such as The Center and the Hong Kong Club Building in Central.
