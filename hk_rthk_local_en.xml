<div class="itemFullText">
 Windsurfer Ma Kwan-ching on Monday overcame Britain's two-time Olympic bronze medallist Emma Wilson to win the iQFOiL women's category at the Hong Kong Windsurfing Open Championships, as fellow Olympian Cheng Ching-yin claimed the top spot in the men's races to cap off the five-day event.
 <br>
  <br>
  It was a welcome return to form for the Hong Kong pair, who made their Olympic debut in Paris in July.
  <br>
  <br>
  A dramatic ending to the women's event saw Ma, 26, secure a come-from-behind victory after edging Wilson in the 16th and final race of the competition.
  <br>
  <br>
  The pair finished the event tied with a final score of 18.
  <br>
  <br>
  An overall champion is determined based on the results of the day's final race, with Ma's heroics in the final round helping her seal the victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  Britain's Alice Read and India's Ishwariya Ganesh ranked second and third respectively.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the men's division, Cheng Ching-yin won 10 out of 16 matches to claim his second title since 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another Hong Kong athlete, Au Ling-yeung, edged out Korea's Kim Chan-yi by three points to take second place.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong team will be heading to the iQFOiL Asian Windsurfing Championships from November 19 to 25.

    'Step up training on use of cage lifts in emergencies'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A concern group for industrial accident victims on Monday stressed it is crucial to step up workers' training on the use of cage lifts in emergency situation.
 <br>
  <br>
  Siu Sin-man from the Association for the Rights of Industrial Accident Victims made the comment on an RTHK radio programme. This came as a worker lost his life after he was crushed by a cage lift at The Pavilia Farm construction site in Tai Wai on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Even experienced operators use different kinds of machines at different construction sites. When they're working at a new construction site, or when they have to use a new model of the equipment, they should receive training from scratch," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Apart from training workers in how to operate the equipment, I believe it's more important that they know how to stop the machine in emergencies."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee Kwong-sing, chairman of the Hong Kong Institute of Safety Practitioner's Education and Training Committee, said on the same programme it is rare for interlocking device at cage lifts to malfunction.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When we are carrying out safety checks at construction sites, we found out that for convenience, a lot of workers would jam up the safety lock. I've even seen some workers tamper with the control box, causing the safety installation to become useless."
  <br>
  <br>
  The incident was the third fatal industrial accident in five days.
  <br>
  <br>
  A man succumbed to his injuries after he fell from height at a construction site at the airport last Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 37-year-old victim is believed to be from the mainland.
  <br>
  <br>
  Siu pointed out that the industry has to strengthen communication with workers from the mainland, even if they have relevant experience before coming to Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's a totally different culture in Hong Kong - whether it's the mode of communication or jargon - they are very different. Training has to be stepped up in advance and ensure that mainland workers understand the instructions and are clear about the working procedures."

<div class="itemFullText">
 The observatory says it will issue the Standby Signal No 1 later on Monday or early on Tuesday as Tropical Cyclone Toraji moves closer to Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  The storm is expected to come within 800 kilometres of the SAR this evening or in the early hours of tomorrow as it heads towards western Guangdong.
  <br>
  <br>
  Forecasters are not ruling out a higher typhoon signal, depending on how Toraji develops, and said the city will see squally showers on Wednesday and Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong had a signal 3 on October 26 and another one on November 9 and 10.
  <br>
  <br>
  Toraji made landfall in the northern Philippines on Monday morning. The country's national weather agency said there were no immediate reports of casualties or damage.

    EOC not doing enough in discrimination cases: Unison
   </title>

<img alt="Hong Kong Unison's executive director, John Tse, said anti-discrimination laws had been passed in 1995, but people were still being denied service because of their disabilities.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A group advocating racial equality said on Monday that an incident in which a woman was denied service in a restaurant last week because of her wheelchair showed that Hongkongers needed more education on the issue, and accused the Equal Opportunities Commission (EOC) of not doing enough to help victims of such incidents.
 <br>
  <br>
  The wheelchair incident involving Paralympics double gold medallist Ho Yuen-kei has turned the spotlight on the SAR's treatment of the disabled.
  <br>
  <br>
  John Tse, the executive director of Hong Kong Unison, said anti-discrimination laws had been passed in 1995, but these problems kept cropping up.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Thirty years later we still have this kind of discrimination happening in Hong Kong and it's totally unacceptable," Tse told RTHK's
  <a href="https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/news-programmes/this-episode.htm?cmsid=77" target="_blank">
   Hong Kong Today
  </a>
  programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mr Tse said the EOC had to do more to promote and educate Hong Kongers and keep them informed of any action that it took after such incidents.
  <br>
  <br>
  Although the catering sector drew fire after last week's incident, Tse said these problems weren't limited to restaurants.
  <br>
  <br>
  He cited a separate incident earlier this year in which two visually disabled people were forced to leave a flight in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "No action was ever taken. The two people complained to the EOC. What did they do? Well, nothing much, they just dismissed it," he said.

    HK eyeing free trade agreement with Peru: TDC

<img alt="Chankay, located about 80km north of Lima, used to be a remote fishing village and is frequented by locals for short getaways. Photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1778456_2_20241111051342.jpg&q=45">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong government is looking to finalise a free trade agreement with Peru, as Chief Executive John Lee heads to the South American nation to attend the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation economic leaders’ meeting this week.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Trade Development Council (TDC) also hopes a brand new port near the Peruvian capital of Lima will provide fresh impetus for cargo trade between the two regions.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to the Commerce and Economic Development Bureau, Peru is Hong Kong’s fifth largest trading partner in Latin America, with over HK$5 billion worth of merchandise trade last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  While Latin American nations are rich in natural resources, they rely heavily on imports for some daily necessities such as clothing and household appliances.
  <br>
  <br>
  Economist Alice Tsang, who leads the global research team at TDC, expects more Hong Kong businesses to tap into the Peruvian market once a free trade agreement is signed.
  <br>
  <br>
  “From what we see in Peru, there is room to further boost spending among general consumers. After the Covid pandemic, there is demand for high-end products,” she said in an interview with RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tsang added that Peruvian department stores have been sourcing products in Hong Kong, mainland China and southeast Asia. Some develop their in-house brands whose products are manufactured by SAR companies.
  <br>
  <br>
  “A free trade agreement can facilitate these exchanges by spelling out the legal framework and government regulations. I believe more Hong Kong companies will be willing to tap into this emerging market,” she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to a 2022 document published by the Trade and Industry Department, the proposed free trade agreement seeks to eliminate or reduce tariffs, facilitate customs procedures, as well as improve market access for both sides.
  <br>
  <br>
  China, on the other hand, is already Peru’s largest trading partner globally, with bilateral trade reaching some US$37 billion last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  With a massive Pacific coastline, Peru’s strategic importance in cargo trade was recognised by China Ocean Shipping Company, or COSCO, a state-owned enterprise headquartered in Shanghai.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a major undertaking, the firm in 2021 began the construction of Chankay port, located around 80km north of Lima.
  <br>
  <br>
  Once a remote fishing village, Chankay has been transformed into a natural deep-water port and could serve as a crucial gateway for shipments in and out of Latin America.
  <br>
  <br>
  The port began its soft launch this month, and a massive container ship was docked there during a visit by RTHK on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tsang explained that once the port becomes operational, the shipment time between Shanghai and Peru can be slashed by one week. The time savings also translate to a one-third reduction in operational expenses.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The cooperation between China and Peru is mutually beneficial. Many consumer goods in Peru arrive from China and Asia. Following the construction of Chankay port, a container ship will be able to reach Peru from Shanghai in 28 days, down from the current 35 days,” she explained.
  <br>
  <br>
  “That reduces costs by more than 30 percent, because less fuel is used and the insurance would be cheaper due to less time spent at sea.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The economist believes the project may not be necessarily linked to the trade tensions between China and the United States. She explained that after Covid, nations around the world realised the need to diversify supply chains to reduce risks and minimise disruptions.

    Make future shoebox homes bigger: SoCo

<img alt="SoCo calls on the government to add 5.5 square metres for each additional resident into the basic housing unit requirements. Photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1778412_1_20241110162312.jpg&q=50">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A community group has suggested that future housing units replacing subdivided homes should be larger than the minimum size proposed by the government.
 <br>
  <br>
  In his Policy Address in October, Chief Executive John Lee outlined plans to eradicate substandard subdivided units and introduce “basic housing units”. The government said each unit must be no less than 8 square metres, or 86 square feet, and have an individual toilet and at least one window.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sze Lai-shan, deputy director of the Society for Community Organisation (SoCo), said on Sunday officials should consider adding 5.5 square metres for each additional resident into the basic housing unit requirements, to ensure a suitable environment for families.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If no one cares how many members are in 8 square metres, then it could be three or four people in 8 square metres. That would be too small and too inhumane for them," Sze said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With reference with the standard of public housing, if they are overcrowded, the living space for each person is 5.5 to 7 square metres, they would need to be rehoused to better places by the government."
  <br>
  <br>
  SoCo also suggested the government put together a timetable for legislation.
  <br>
  <br>
  And while officials have made it clear that those affected by the phasing out of substandard subdivided units would be rehoused, some residents remained jittery.
  <br>
  <br>
  A tenant surnamed Wong, whose unit is regarded as substandard and will be regulated under the new legislation, said he is unsure what will happen next.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I only hope for the government to be able to make plans on rehousing arrangements for us. I am happy as long as the rent is not higher than what I am paying now, which is HK$2,890," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  A cage home tenant, surnamed Fong, who lives in a flat that features 35 bedspaces, called on the government to build more public housing.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I am now paying a monthly rent of HK$2,700. The Policy Address did not mention cage homes.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The government should speed up rehousing us, and build more public housing for us lower-class people," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  SoCo also said the government could provide rent or relocation subsidy for residents.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Justice Secretary Paul Lam on Sunday said the government's plan to launch a community mediation pilot scheme will resolve conflicts between neighbours, saving both time and money.
 <br>
  <br>
  The idea was unveiled in the Policy Address to promote a culture of mediation through the training of community workers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a TVB programme, Lam said the pilot scheme can help settle disputes in people's daily lives, such as noise and water leaks.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In court, there's only one winner, it's like a life-or-death situation, which sometimes isn't the best solution. Both sides might have some valid points, and it's rarely a case of one side being entirely right and the other entirely wrong," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Mediation saves time while court proceedings are a lengthy process, with significant psychological pressures."
  <br>
  <br>
  As part of efforts to promote mediation to resolve conflicts, the justice chief said last week the government will incorporate mediation clauses in all future government contracts, saying it would save time and reduce costs for all parties involved.

    'Low-altitude economy has huge potential in HK'

<img alt="Elizabeth Quat, left, says many mainland cities have been developing low-altitude economies for a long time, so Hong Kong can't fall behind. Photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1778392_1_20241110122321.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 DAB lawmaker Elizabeth Quat said Hong Kong can't afford to fall behind the rest of the world in developing a low-altitude economy, adding that the market could exceed HK$1 trillion.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on an RTHK programme, Quat, who's also the founding president of the Greater Bay Area Low-Altitude Economy Alliance, said she has met with a government working group on the matter, and the authorities plan to accept applications of pilot projects by the end of this year and unveil them next year.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said that many mainland cities have been developing low-altitude economies for a long time.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Some food-delivery agencies want to roll this out in Hong Kong, but of course, we have to try it first. They're in discussions with the authorities about where they can test it out. There are also delivery agencies that want to see if they can deliver from one point to another," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Some companies are very creative, making drones that can inspect buildings, repair and maintain walls, or even wash windows. In fact, drones can even help with firefighting, rescue work and disaster relief."
  <br>
  <br>
  She added that low-altitude services like medicine delivery would be a huge benefit especially for the elderly and those living in outlying islands and village homes.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the possibility of services outside of Hong Kong, Quat suggested that the government first consider cooperating with Guangdong and Macau to offer helicopter rides for passengers.
  <br>
  <br>
  But she said cross-border food delivery won't be feasible because of food-safety concerns.
  <br>
  <br>
  In regards to general safety concerns, Quat said she thinks drones could be safer than driving.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There are many traffic accidents on the road, and if you are stuck in a traffic jam, you can only move forward, but not backwards. However, if you look at the sky, it's really infinite. You can have many different altitudes," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The sky is so big that we can divide it into different heights such as 100 metres, 200 metres and 300 metres to fly different things. There could be different altitudes set for people, cargo, helicopters and rescue. These problems can all be solved technically."

<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Sunday said market sentiment has improved due to declining interest rates and measures to stabilise the economy, despite slower economic growth in the third quarter.
 <br>
  <br>
  In his weekly blog, Chan noted increased transactions in both the stock and property markets.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We expect that Hong Kong's economy will continue to maintain momentum for the rest of this year, with the full-year economic growth projected to be close to the lower end of the original forecast range," he wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  The economy grew by 1.8 percent in the three months ending September on a year-on-year basis, compared with a 2.7 percent increase in the first quarter and a 3.3 percent growth in the April-to-June period. Officials are forecasting full-year growth of between 2.5 percent and 3.5 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan also said the government will sign agreements with 17 more strategic enterprises – from the mainland, the US and Europe – on Monday to establish or expand their businesses here.
  <br>
  <br>
  These companies are involved in fields such as AI, big data and new energy, and 90 percent of them plan to set up headquarters in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  Together with the first two batches of nearly 50 strategic enterprises, Chan said they will bring HK$42 billion in investment to Hong Kong and create more than 17,000 jobs.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Observatory issued the Standby Signal No. 1 at 10.20am on Sunday, replacing the Strong Wind Signal No. 3 as a storm moved away from Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  At 10am, Severe Typhoon Yinxing was estimated to be around 400 kilometres south-southwest of the SAR and is projected to move slowly towards the seas south of Hainan Island.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Observatory said local winds have weakened gradually, and that the Standby Signal No. 1 would be cancelled when Yinxing no longer poses a threat to the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  Still, the government advised the public to stay away from the shoreline and not to engage in water sports.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Observatory said it'll be mainly cloudy with a few showers at first on Sunday, followed by sunny periods in the next couple of days before the weather becomes unsettled in the middle of the week.

 The Observatory said it would replace the Strong Wind Signal No. 3 with a Standby Signal No. 1 at 10.20am on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a statement just before 9am, the Observatory said Severe Typhoon Yinxing had continued to weaken in the past two hours, and was gradually moving away from the coast of Guangdong.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Observatory issued the Strong Wind Signal No 3 at 3.40pm on Saturday, prompting some classes and special programmes to be suspended.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Social Welfare Department advised the public not to take children or family members to centres providing after school care programmes or elderly services centres on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, the Education Bureau said early on Sunday that kindergarten morning classes and full-day sessions were suspended, along with schools for the physically or intellectually disabled.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, afternoon kindergarten classes will be held as normal.

<img alt="A countdown ceremony was also held in Guangzhou. Screenshot from southcn.com" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1778314_2_20241109221114.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 It's 365 days until the 15th National Games, and Hong Kong kicked off a countdown ceremony to celebrate, on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong will co-host the Games for the first time next year – from November 9 to 21  –  along with Guangdong and Macau.  It will also be the first time the countrywide competition will have multiple host regions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eight of the 34 competitive events will take place in the HKSAR, including fencing, track cycling, rugby sevens, golf, triathlon, beach volleyball, men's handball, and men's under-22 basketball.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at the countdown ceremony at government headquarters, Chief Executive John Lee said that the government is working hard to prepare for the Games and will carry out several trial runs, starting this month.
  <br>
  <br>
  He's hopeful that the multi-host cities approach can boost cooperation within the Greater Bay Area.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Greater Bay development plays a key strategic role in the country’s new development framework. By hosting the Games together, Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macau are deepening their collaboration in areas like culture, sports, economy, and society, promoting high-quality development across the Greater Bay Area. It’s particularly meaningful for the three places to work together towards building a top-notch Bay Area in the world," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  In addition to the National Games, Hong Kong will also host four competitive events for the National Games for Persons with Disabilities and the National Special Olympic Games in December next year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee noted the government will use various channels to educate people about the events and build excitement, including banners, exhibitions, as well as activities in communities and schools.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that the authorities plan to open up more volunteer positions for the Games, saying so far 30,000 people from Hong Kong have signed up, far beyond the original target of 10,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  Next year's National Games will mark Hong Kong's eighth time participating in the countrywide competition, where the SAR has already won 47 medals, including 11 gold.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Saturday evening, a countdown ceremony was also held at the Haixinsha Asian Games Park in Guangzhou, where Lee and Macau Chief Executive Ho Iat-seng gave video speeches.
  <br>
  <br>
  The mayor of Guangzhou, Sun Zhiyang, said the city will treat the one-year countdown mark as a fresh starting point and promised to stick to a green, shared, open, and connected approach to organising the Games, while making sure the event is safe, simple and still amazing.
  <br>
  <br>
  The governor of Guangdong, Wang Weizhong, said the one-year mark shows that preparations for the Games are in the final stages and that everything is going smoothly.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will keep our promises and give our best in preparations, including building quality venues and essential facilities, coordinating, running trial runs, and providing excellent services, security, and promotion, as well as improving city infrastructure," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The director of the State General Administration of Sports Gao Zhidan for his part said organising work are now at a critical stage and urged Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Macau to step up their coordination and teamwork.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The observatory said the Strong Wind Signal No 3 will remain in force at least until Sunday 10am, but it expects the chance of issuing a higher warning signal to be rather low.
 <br>
  <br>
  It issued the Strong Wind Signal No 3 at 3.40pm on Saturday, as Super Typhoon Yinxing gradually edges closer to Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Unless Yinxing adopts a more northerly track closer to the Pearl River Estuary, the chance of issuing higher tropical cyclone warning signals will be rather low," the observatory said.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said that the Strong Wind Signal No 3 will remain in force at least until Sunday 10am, and depending on the degree of weakening of local winds, the observatory will then consider lowering it to the Standby Signal No 1.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Education Bureau announced that kindergartens, and schools for children with physical and intellectual disabilities are suspended on Saturday.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A worker on Saturday died in an industrial accident at a construction site near Tai Wai MTR Station.
 <br>
  <br>
  Police said they received a call about the incident around 1:30 pm.
  <br>
  <br>
  Initial investigation found that the man was crushed by a cage lift while trying to move items.
  <br>
  <br>
  The worker fell unconscious and was taken to Prince of Wales Hospital, where he was pronounced dead.
  <br>
  <br>
  A representative of a concern group said it's believed that the deceased worker was grabbing materials out of the cage lift, when the lift suddenly moved and crushed him.
  <br>
  <br>
  Siu Sin-man of the Association for the Rights of Industrial Accident Victims said there have been similar incidents in the past, but isn’t sure if this accident was due to human error or a mechanical malfunction.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I know that after the last similar accident, many construction sites improved worker protection by adding extra safety design features to the cage lifts, making operational faults less likely. But I'm not sure if this particular cage lift at this site has any issues."
  <br>
  <br>
  Contractor Hip Seng Construction was in charge of The Pavilia Farm construction site where the accident took place. Its spokesman said the company was deeply saddened by the accident, and expressed its deepest condolences to the family of the deceased.
  <br>
  <br>
  The company will work with the sub-contractor to assist his family, and cooperate with the government to look into the cause of the accident.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Labour Department said it has deployed staff to the scene and is investigating.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the Hong Kong Institute of Safety Practitioner urged construction sites to inspect their lifts' steel cables at least once per week and to install a safety device that can prevent lifts from falling even if the cables break.
  <br>
  <br>
  The institute added that such lifts should never be used to carry workers and should be locked down once the doors are open.

 Organisers have said that Hong Kong's one-year countdown carnival for the National Games has been cancelled, in the wake of the Observatory issuing Strong Wind Signal No. 3 Saturday afternoon.
 <br>
  <br>
  The event was supposed to take place at Central Promenade from 2:30pm to 5:30pm.
  <br>
  <br>

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Secretary Eric Chan on Saturday said the authorities will continue to work with all sectors to enhance patriotic education in the city.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a photo exhibition marking the 75th anniversary of the outbreak of the "Uprising of the Two Airlines", Chan said the move was crucial to the development of the aviation industry in China.
  <br>
  <br>
  The uprising occurred on November 9, 1949, when 12 aircraft from two Nationalist-controlled airlines took off from Kai Tak Airport in Hong Kong, deviated from their scheduled flight paths, and instead went to join the new Communist government in Beijing.
  <br>
  <br>
  After touching down, they were all given a hero’s welcome. Zhou Enlai, the newly appointed premier, hosted a banquet in their honor.
  <br>
  <br>
  The incident would become a watershed moment in Chinese history, and later deemed by Chairman Mao Zedong and Premier Zhou as "the starting point of China's civil aviation of the people with unlimited potential".
  <br>
  <br>
  "Through photo exhibitions and a microfilm, this event promotes major events to the development of the country's civil aviation industry. It's of great significance, telling the story of Hong Kong's unique contribution to this development", Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan added that the SAR government had been using different events and methods to promote patriotism and enhance people's sense of national identity.
  <br>
  <br>
  He went on to say that the Museum of History will set up a permanent exhibition about the history of the "Uprising of the Two Airlines", and the government will be in touch with mainland authorities on relevant materials to display.
  <br>
  <br>
  Air China's director Cui Xiaofeng reaffirmed the airline's commitment to the One Country, Two Systems principle, and said it will continue to support Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have made contributions in promoting Hong Kong's economic prosperity, social harmony and stability," he told the same event.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[We will] support and consolidate Hong Kong's status as an international aviation hub in the future, strengthening Hong Kong's role as a super-connector and a super value-adder."

    Northern Metropolis up for tender starting next year

<img alt="" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1778285_1_20241109124354.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Secretary for Development revealed that the government is aiming to put at least one sizeable land parcel from the Northern Metropolis up for tender next year.
 <br>
  <br>
  In last month's Policy Address, Chief Executive John Lee revealed his administration has earmarked three land parcels of 10 to 20 hectares each as pilot sites, in a bid to speed up land development.
  <br>
  <br>
  The three sites are located in San Tin Technopole, Hung Shui Kiu and Fanling North.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bernadette Linn told a Commercial Radio programme on Saturday that the government will conduct a survey to assess the market's interest at the end of this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "By then, we will have a list of questions for the developers. We will also tell them the exact location of these three land plots, the infrastructure and facilities that we expect for each land," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That's because we have to let them know exactly which location we are referring to and what the government requires."
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Linn also noted that former Chief Executive CY Leung has raised concerns towards the government's plan to keep increasing land supply, saying that it would cause a heavier financial burden.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government plans to roll out 7,000 hectares of ready-to-use land up by 2048 - three thousand of which will be available in the next decade.
  <br>
  <br>
  The development secretary, however, brushed off his concern. She believes that Leung, who's now a vice-chairman of the nation's top political advisory body, just wants the government to be prudent.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I hope the public can see how determined we are in terms of land production. But we're also emphasising that we will be prudent, and I realise the word 'prudent' is what we have in common."
  <br>
  <br>
  She went on to say that some people are worried that the authorities might be reckless in rolling out ready-to-use land by ignoring the vacancy rate and housing prices at a time when the economy is not in its best shape.

    'Xia urges HK business sector to find new markets'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Beijing's top official on Hong Kong affairs emphasised the important role of the business sector in boosting the city's economy and improving people's livelihood, according to Hong Kong Productivity Council chairman Sunny Tan.
 <br>
  <br>
  The director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, Xia Baolong, met representatives of the Hong Kong business sector in Shenzhen on Friday, with Chief Executive John Lee also in attendance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a radio programme on Saturday, Tan, who was at the closed-door meeting, said Xia urged the business sector to take the initiative to discover new business opportunities and new markets.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We do need to have a determination to make change. It's not about just the government, but in all our sectors... We all need to look at the external environment, look into the development progress of China and see what we got to do from our side," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For example, put in more investment into innovation technology. How do we maneuver the new dynamics of the external environment on our supply chain management? All this is very important and we have to make that change."
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Executive Councillor Jeffrey Lam told the same radio programme that lower interest rates would benefit the city, especially small and medium enterprises (SMEs).
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier this week, the US Federal Reserve cut interest rates by 0.25 percentage points, which led to major banks in the SAR also cutting their Hong Kong dollar best lending rates.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think we're going to see maybe more activity in the property market. As for the SMEs, the rate cut will reduce their spending on interest," Lam said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It will help their business and also their cash flow. I hope by seeing more interest reduction, maybe more to come, our business activity will get better."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lam added that he expects there would not be many changes in terms of US policies towards China, after Donald Trump won the US presidential election against Kamala Harris.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce plans to visit the US next year to meet with business representatives and potentially secure new business opportunities.

    Observatory to issue T3 signal at 3.40pm

<div class="itemFullText">
 The observatory said on Saturday it will issue the Strong Wind Signal No 3 at 3.40pm, as Super Typhoon Yinxing edges closer to Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  It said local winds are expected to strengthen later in the day, with winds on high ground occasionally reaching gale force.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Observatory said Yinxing will skirt more than 300 kilometres to the south of Hong Kong on Sunday morning, so a tropical cyclone warning signal is expected to remain in force until then.
  <br>
  <br>
  The cross-harbour swim was originally scheduled for Sunday, but the organiser decided to call off the race.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Due to the potential for inclement weather brought by Tropical Storm Yinxing and to ensure the safety of all swimmers, under careful consideration, the organisers have made the difficult decision to cancel the New World Harbour Race 2024," it wrote on social media.
  <br>
  <br>
  It added that all qualified swimmers will receive a full refund.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The top Beijing official on Hong Kong affairs has urged the local business community to see the SAR as their home, while consolidating the city's traditional advantages, during a closed-door exchange in Shenzhen, according to Xinhua News Agency.
 <br>
  <br>
  Xia Baolong, director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office (HKMAO), on Friday also told business magnates and entrepreneurs that they are the "main force" in promoting economic development.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[Business leaders] must stand firm in treating Hong Kong as their home and utilising Hong Kong to prosper, consolidate and enhance Hong Kong's traditional advantages," Xia was quoted as saying by the report.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong's business community and entrepreneurs are the main force in promoting economic development. They have made outstanding contributions to maintaining Hong Kong's prosperity and stability, and assisting in the country's modernisation."
  <br>
  <br>
  The report also said Xia told those at the exchange to support the SAR government in implementing its long-term development plans, and tell the good Hong Kong story and safeguard the city's international image, among other things.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chief Executive John Lee, who was in attendance with his principal officials, said his administration will unite and lead all sectors of Hong Kong to implement reforms and "break new ground" in the city's development, according to Xinhua.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chairman of the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, Jonathan Choi, who was among 29 business leaders at the meeting, said discussions focused on their role in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As Hong Kong's economy relies on entrepreneurs, [Xia] hopes that entrepreneurs will go all out and follow the central government's strategy," Choi said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pui Kwan-kay, president of the Hong Kong Chinese Importers' and Exporters’ Association, said the Beijing official noted that the city had gone through trials and tribulations.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[Xia said] the current situation in Hong Kong has been stable, and we should take advantage of this period of transitioning from stability to prosperity to do our best," Pui said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other business leaders and property tycoons included Richard Li, who chairs Pacific Century Group; Peter Lee, co-chairman and managing director of Henderson Land; and Raymond Kwok, chairman and managing director of Sun Hung Kai Properties.
  <br>
  <br>
  They attended a full-day symposium and joined a dinner, with HKMAO executive deputy director Zhou Ji and the head of Beijing's liaison office in Hong Kong, Zheng Yanxiong, who also took part in the meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  During a trip to Hong Kong in February, Xia also focused on the city's economic developments. Last month, the senior Beijing official separately met executives of Jardine Matheson and HSBC in Beijing.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A local bartender on Friday reigned supreme in a Greater Bay Area mixology competition, which showcased the best flairtenders from Macau and Guangdong province.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong International Mixology Showdown 2024, organised by the SAR's Bartenders Association, hosted its inaugural GBA region competition in conjunction with this year's International Wine and Spirits Fair held at the convention centre in Wan Chai.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thirty-six competitors from the two SARs, as well as Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Nansha, Jiangmen and Zhuhai, impressed the judges at the bar table with their flair and finesse.
  <br>
  <br>
  Champion Kenneth Tsang, from the Hong Kong Jockey Club, said he was ecstatic to win on home soil.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think this is a great opportunity to see other competitors from other [regions] because you can learn a lot during the competition because you can see every technique, skill and other things that you can't see in Hong Kong," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think we can join more competitions [in the future] to make friends with each other, communicate with other bars or restaurants to build [each other] up."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Bartenders Association's Ken Chau said the purpose of the event is to promote the exchange of bartending culture among the different regions, adding that more competitions can help elevate the SAR's status as a regional trading hub for wine and spirits.
  <br>
  <br>
  And even though the government has relaxed duties on liquor, Chau said many bars have suffered significantly due to different consumption habits in Hong Kong. He hopes that this will change soon.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The spirits tax doesn't help a lot of sales to be honest, but it does help start a new path, especially Chinese Baijius because Chinese Baijius will be the next big trend in Hong Kong," he added.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 About 2,500 people on Friday attended a job fair, where about 70 companies are looking for top talent in Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  The fair – the second recruitment event that the Hong Kong Top Talent Services Association has held this year – is offering over 1,500 jobs.
  <br>
  <br>
  The association’s founder Shang Hailong pointed out that this edition of the fair is “totally different” in terms of its reach.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Today, this job fair is totally different. We cooperated with the Hong Kong Talent Engage Office, we cooperated with Oases (Office for Attracting Strategic Enterprises)…Different committees joined this job fair, that’s a big difference.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Shang added that more than 4,000 people had signed up for the event.
  <br>
  <br>
  Property giant Sun Hung Kai Properties was one of the companies offering jobs at the fair.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bonnie Soo, assistant manager of human resources, revealed that the group is targetting candidates from the mainland.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The businesses of Sun Hung Kai Properties are not just in Hong Kong – we have a lot of property projects on the mainland. We recruit people from the mainland to understand more about the customers there – what they need and what they want."
  <br>
  <br>
  One jobseeker from the mainland, Scarlett Chen, said she hopes to find a better job at the fair.
  <br>
  <br>
  “On the mainland, for example for the IT industry, there is an age limit. And in recent years, the economic situation wasn’t good, [so] there are no promotion prospects or wage increases.”

 Hong Kong will participate in organising the cross-border events of the National Games, including marathon and road cycling competitions, organisers said on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  To be held next year from November 9 to 21, it will be the first time for the National Games to be co-hosted by Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macau.
  <br>
  <br>
  The event’s coordination office head Yeung Tak-keung told a countdown press conference that apart from hosting eight competitions, the SAR will also help organise the athletics marathon hosted by Shenzhen, and road cycling hosted by Zhuhai.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gao Chao, the publicity department director for the General Administration of Sport of China, said Guangzhou and Shenzhen have finished planning for the games’ opening and closing ceremonies, and that authorities are planning out the route for the torch relay.
  <br>
  <br>
  Guangdong sports bureau director Cui Jian, meanwhile, said renovation and construction of venues in the province will be completed in March of next year.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Observatory issued the Standby Signal No. 1 at 12.40pm today as Tropical Cyclone Yinxing edges closer to the coast of southern China.
 <br>
  <br>
  It said the T1 signal is expected to remain in place until at least noon on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Depending on the distance between Yinxing and the Pearl River Estuary, intensity of Yinxing and the local wind conditions, the Observatory will then assess the need for issuance of the Strong Wind Signal No. 3," the forecaster said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A tropical cyclone warning signal is expected to remain in force at least until Sunday morning."
  <br>
  <br>
  It added that under the combined effect of Yinxing and the northeast monsoon, it will be windier over the coast of Guangdong and on high ground over the weekend.
  <br>
  <br>
  Seas will be rough with swells and there will be showers, the observatory said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Justice Paul Lam on Friday said incorporating mediation clauses in all future government contracts would not only save time, but also reduce costs for all parties involved.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters on the final day of Hong Kong Legal Week, Lam stressed the government's intention to promote mediation as a means of resolving conflicts amicably.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The government is willing to take the lead in the hope that we can cultivate the culture in the society as a whole. So that when the people encounter disputes, the first thing that they would consider is not to go to court, but instead to try to resolve this view by mediation, by a means which in our belief is more economical, more time-saving, and resulting in a more harmonious result,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The justice chief added he wants the government to be an example for the private sector to follow as well.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, Lam said he had initial discussions during his first meeting with the Hong Kong International Legal Talents Training Expert Committee, composed of three advisory boards, with 17 legal experts and scholars from prominent international, mainland, and local legal organisations and universities.
  <br>
  <br>
  He expressed his hope to leverage this platform for greater capacity-building efforts and to emphasise more practical applications when developing training programmes and strategies.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Paralympics double gold medallist Ho Yuen-kei on Friday said she hopes to raise public awareness of people with special needs, after a Thai restaurant refused to admit her because of her wheelchair.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on an RTHK programme, the boccia player said she was refused entry to a Causeway Bay restaurant, with the staff saying her wheelchair could block other diners.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho said attitudes towards the disabled had improved over the past decade, but more needs to be done.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Can there be more training for staff to improve awareness? Not just for wheelchair users, but restaurants may also think of how to help those who are visually impaired," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We understand that there may be difficulties - especially for small shops in Hong Kong - but we can work together. For example, some small restaurants have ramps for people with disabilities or wheelchair users."
  <br>
  <br>
  Simon Wong, head of the Federation of Restaurants and Related Trades, said the incident was not common, but it showed that some restaurants may not be familiar with the city's anti-discrimination legislation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Most restaurants have training for their staff, but some small-scale ones may have overlooked [this] during the training process. We hope the catering sector and the government could do more promotion," he told the same programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho said the Thai restaurant’s manager apologised to her and she accepted the apology.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong on Thursday hosted the inaugural Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Greater Bay Area Lawyers Exchange Reception.
 <br>
  <br>
  More than 150 people from the legal sectors of the mainland, Macau and Hong Kong, including Director-General of the Department of Justice of Guangdong Chen Xudong, attended the reception.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at the event, Deputy Secretary for Justice Horace Cheung said that the establishment of a platform to enable the industry to better participate in the development of the bay area is an important measure in the Department of Justice’s Action Plan on the Construction of Rule of Law in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Greater Bay Area.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that the platform aims to consolidate the professional strengths of the legal services to give full play to the unique strengths of lawyers in the GBA.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cheung also said that the platform, along with the Hong Kong International Legal Talents Training Academy – which will be launched shortly – will enable Hong Kong to fully harness the institutional strengths of the "One Country, Two Systems" framework.

 The Hong Kong Observatory on Thursday said it will issue the Standby Signal No 1 between noon and 3pm on Friday, as Tropical Cyclone Yinxing edges closer to Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  Forecasters said the weather system will enter the SAR's 800-kilometre warning radius at around midnight on Friday, adding in a Facebook post that two more potential storms are forming over the Pacific Ocean.
  <br>
  <br>
  The observatory said Yinxing’s circulation is relatively small, so it has to observe changes in intensity, local wind conditions, and how close it is from Hong Kong before it decides to issue a higher warning signal.
  <br>
  <br>
  It added there will be a few showers over the coast of Guangdong during the weekend under the combined effects of Yinxing and the northeast monsoon.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A concern group has set an ambitious target of eliminating school bullying in Hong Kong over the next decade.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Council of Early Childhood Education and Services said according to its survey of 500 primary students, parents and teachers in July, one in three pupils have been bullied at school.
  <br>
  <br>
  The group called for society-wide effort to fight the problem.
  <br>
  <br>
  “In the next decade, we want to reduce the number of bullying to zero. So this is quite a challenge for Hong Kong and we call upon everybody, Legco members, our bureau chiefs, our influencers, our mass media, to help us,” Sansan Ching, the council’s director, told a conference on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The group has launched an "anti-bullying month" during which a series of activities will be held to raise awareness, including a casual wear day, a drawing competition and family workshops.
  <br>
  <br>
  And a petition signed jointly by parents, teachers, lawyers and medical professionals submitted to the government at the end of the conference called for a legal framework to protect pupils as well as more training for teachers to identify and intervene in cases.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to guidelines issued by the Education Bureau, school are required to intervene and follow up on bullying incidents as soon as possible.
  <br>
  <br>
  Psychiatrist Doris Chan said bullying can lead to long-term psychological impact on victims, and a more positive school environment is needed.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Most of them have lower self-esteem, and they feel they are worthless. And some of them suffer from mood problems. And a minority have some other diseases, such as post-traumatic stress disorder," she said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Thursday said they arrested 14 men on suspicion of illegal road racing.
 <br>
  <br>
  Officers said the races allegedly took place over the past two months on main roads, including Route Twisk, Tuen Mun Road, and Tolo Highway.
  <br>
  <br>
  They arrested people aged between 20 and 33 years old, with some claiming to be teachers, nurses and professional drivers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police made the arrests between Monday and Friday last week, seizing 14 private vehicles.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a press briefing, chief inspector Ng Hing-cheong criticised people who engaged in illegal street racing, saying it will endanger other drivers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Some of the vehicles involved raced back and forth at high speeds on the narrow and winding section of Route Twisk. They reached a speed of up to 135 kilometres per hour in a section with a speed limit of 50 kilometres per hour. They often crossed the double white lines to chase each other," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ng added that the operation against illegal street racing is still underway.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong’s premier wine and spirits fair, which aims to establish the SAR as the regional trading hub for alcoholic drinks, opened on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Boasting more than 600 exhibitors from around the world, the three-day International Wine and Spirits Fair will feature exhibitions, seminars, tastings and a mixology showdown at Wan Chai’s convention centre.
  <br>
  <br>
  And with the government recently relaxing duties for drinks with an alcoholic strength of 30 percent or more, exhibitors are hoping this development will bolster their global sales.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I’m certain Hong Kong is the best city and the best way for Chinese liquor to go abroad,” Keith Lau, a representative of a mainland spirits trading company said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Maotai, Xi Jiu, or other brands, they have set up local companies in order to supply overseas [demand], so it is quite important that we have the right policy for the brands to go abroad.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Fellow exhibitor Julia Klimczak, who’s selling Scottish whisky, said she is expecting an increase in sales during this year's fair. Klimczak said she believes Hong Kong offers an ideal setting for promotion and networking.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There's a lot of international contacts and I'm very excited about the networking possibilities here in Hong Kong. It's incredible, and I believe we have people from all over the world."
  <br>
  <br>
  Teddy Tse, who works at a local wine and spirits distribution company also said he is expecting better sales this year, but said he hopes authorities could further relax duties.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The starting point at HK$100 is better because over 85 percent of the products is below HK$200, the import cost. Last year was good, so I think this year will be better because of the fruits of the Wine and Dine Festival."
  <br>
  <br>
  The government last month cut the duty on liquor with an alcohol content of over 30 percent and with an import price of more than HK$200 to 10 percent from 100 percent for the portion above HK$200.
  <br>
  <br>
  Also at the fair was Pieter Hermans, a local buyer. He said the fair is a lot smaller than it used to be.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Let's hope that due to the new spirit tariffs and all these types of things, Hong Kong will get on the map a little bit more and that the internal trade is starting to move again. I guess it's just the general economy that's also suffering a little bit at the moment," he said.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Organisers of the cross-harbour swim scheduled for Sunday said the race will be cancelled in the event of a tropical cyclone warning signal.
 <br>
  <br>
  They said the annual swim will be called off if the Standby Signal No 1 or above, or the red or black rainstorm warning, is in force at 6am that day.
  <br>
  <br>
  It will also be cancelled if there's a red tide at the harbour, or any other condition that deems the race unsuitable to take place.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Observatory said it will issue the Standby Signal No 1 between noon and 3pm on Friday as Super Typhoon Yinxing enters within 800 kilometres of Hong Kong, and according to its current forecast track, the storm will be within 400 kilometres of the SAR from Saturday until Sunday morning.
  <br>
  <br>
  Organisers of the cross-harbour swim called on all participants to pay attention to the latest situation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If the race is cancelled, an official announcement will be made shortly on [our] official website and on [our] social media channels," they said.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 4,000 swimmers have signed up for the event due to take place on Sunday morning. They'll make their way from Wan Chai to Tsim Sha Tsui.

<img alt="Labour groups are saying that the need for mechanics and technicians will increase with the three-runway system set to open in late November.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The transport sector on Thursday urged authorities to finalise details of a plan to bring in outside workers, especially for the aviation industry, as soon as possible.
 <br>
  <br>
  Officials have revealed plans to bring in 10,000 skilled technicians over the next three years, but have not specified which job categories or professions will be included.
  <br>
  <br>
  It comes after Chief Executive John Lee in his Policy Address projected Hong Kong will have a shortage of about 60,000 skilled technicians across different sectors.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vivien Lau, the chief executive officer of the Hong Kong Business Aviation Centre said her industry is expecting more than 6,000 vacancies in the next five years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lau said the need for mechanics and technicians will increase with the three-runway system set to open later this month.
  <br>
  <br>
  "What we are tackling now is the technical side, the technician and mechanics. Because even though these categories were covered in the previous [labour importation] scheme, but we still think that there's a challenge in recruiting those technical staff because of their qualification, the level of experience that we are requiring, and also sometimes the language is also our key consideration," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Transport sector lawmaker Frankie Yick for his part said the government should place more focus on bringing in workers from Southeast Asia.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Particularly for the aviation industry, if they need to communicate with the pilot, with other people in the airport, and they normally speak in English. So [recruiting workers] from countries like the Philippines, Malaysia, I think that will be helpful,” he said.

    'Trump re-election casts shadow over HK economy'

<div class="itemFullText">
 An economist on Thursday said Donald Trump's return to the White House will add uncertainty to the local economy even as confidence among small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) improved in the fourth quarter.
 <br>
  <br>
  According to research conducted by the Productivity Council and Standard Chartered Bank, the Standard Chartered Hong Kong SME Leading Business Index rose 3.2 points to 45.7 points for the October-to-December period from the previous three months.
  <br>
  <br>
  Figures below 50 indicate a negative outlook, and those above 50 a positive one.
  <br>
  <br>
  A reading of 52.8 in the second quarter of 2023 was the highest in the past decade.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a press briefing, Kelvin Lau, a senior economist from Standard Chartered Bank, said local businesses are expected to be cautious moving forward over concerns that Trump may raise tariffs on Chinese goods, which could have an impact on Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If Trump starts talking about much more milder tariff hikes to begin with, we think that it could actually be not as bad of a news for a lot of the SMEs who have been expecting the worst," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So I think overall, we are looking at more subdued SME index performance, more cautiousness, prolonged cautiousness, but nothing more substantially worse than where we are now."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lau also said Hong Kong's economy is on track towards recovery, but the pace is slower than what the market expects.

 City University has made it into the top 10 in the latest rankings of Asian tertiary institutions, jumping seven spots from a year ago.
 <br>
  <br>
  The University of Hong Kong remained second in the latest QS rankings, which is compiled by a higher education analytics firm based in Britain.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chinese University and the University of Science and Technology both moved up four spots, to rank sixth and 11th respectively.
  <br>
  <br>
  Polytechnic University moved up slightly to 17th, while Baptist University slipped to 71st.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Breaking into the top 10 in the QS Asia university rankings 2025 highlights our steady progress in academic research and our pursuit of innovation and excellence," said the president of City University, Freddy Boey.
  <br>
  <br>
  The University of Hong Kong, for its part, said the rankings highlight its world leading status in academia and innovation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[We are] committed to shaping the future through transformative education, cutting-edge research, and a pronounced emphasis on AI-readiness," it said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Polytechnic University head Teng Jin-guang, meanwhile, said the university was pleased with the result, describing it as impressive and encouraging.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Peking University retained the top spot in Asia, while the National University of Singapore was ranked third, the same as the year before.

    'Specific licences needed for bamboo scaffolding work'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A concern group for industrial accident victims on Wednesday urged authorities to issue specific licences to contractors that carry out scaffolding-related work.
 <br>
  <br>
  Siu Sin-man of the Association for the Rights of Industrial Accident Victims made the comment after a worker fell to his death on Tuesday while dismantling bamboo scaffolding from a To Kwa Wan building.
  <br>
  <br>
  Currently, bamboo scaffolding workers must be accredited by the Occupational Safety and Health Council – and their licences have to be renewed.
  <br>
  <br>
  But contractors do not have similar requirements. They only need to be registered under the Buildings Ordinance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Siu said having a more specific licensing system for contractors could enhance regulations.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Scaffolding is a high-risk industry. If we only use business registration, [there’s not enough] regulation for this kind of work. So people can easily open a company to do this high-risk [job],” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Siu added that she is unsure whether the worker who died was wearing proper safety equipment when the incident occurred.
  <br>
  <br>
  The worker’s relatives held a mourning ceremony earlier in the day.
  <br>
  <br>
  His wife said her husband operated a company with several partners, and that he spent more than 20 years in the field and was always very careful.

    Police nab 275 over 'staged traffic accidents'

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Wednesday said they arrested 275 people who allegedly staged traffic accidents to obtain financial assistance from the government.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Social Welfare Department, which arranges financial assistance for traffic accident victims, requires these people to provide documents certified by a registered medical practitioner.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officers said the suspects were involved in 121 traffic accidents from February last year to April this year, and had obtained about HK$14 million in financial assistance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chief Inspector Tse Yu-ngai said a majority of them belonged to different syndicates and some even staged accidents involving public transport.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Eleven out of 14 victims in one accident were from the same syndicate... They got on the double-decker bus at different stations. When the bus travelled to Tung Chung, the mastermind arranged a private car to collide with the bus, staging a traffic accident," Tse said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that some debtors were being forced by creditors to participate in these staged accidents in order to pay off their debts.
  <br>
  <br>
  The suspects, aged between 18 and 64, were arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to defraud and fraud.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Department of Justice on Wednesday said it has issued a policy statement to incorporate mediation clauses in government contracts.
 <br>
  <br>
  Officials said the statement sets out the government's stance on promoting the use of mediation to resolve disputes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a Legal Week event, Secretary for Justice Paul Lam encouraged people to seek mediation when disputes arise, before resorting to arbitration or litigation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The government will incorporate mediation clauses in all future government contracts, and departure from that policy will need to be justified by exceptional circumstances, for example the existence of an inconsistent statutory provision," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Through this policy, we do not only aim at ensuring that contractual disputes involving the government may be resolved in a flexible, economical and time-saving manner.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We also hope that with the government taking the lead, the policy will also encourage the private sectors to follow suit."

<div class="itemFullText">
 Two Shanghai-based firms that are taking part in a national expo said they plan on expanding their reach into Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  TMiRob Technology and Faraconix are among the firms that have signed cooperation agreements at the China International Import Expo.
  <br>
  <br>
  TMiRob produces AI-powered robots that can be sent into isolation wards to conduct simple medical procedures, such as checking the temperature and radiation levels of cancer patients.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With the effort of letting our robots running inside Hong Kong hospitals, hopefully we can combine with more technologies in the world," the firm's founder, Pan Jing, told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  Faraconix – which produces semiconductors for smartphones and computers – plans to expand into Hong Kong this month and invest more than HK$100 million in the coming three years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Its founder, Chi Law, is from Hong Kong and started the firm in Shanghai four years ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The purpose of coming to Hong Kong is to bring some communication products for use in the future, such as what's known as millimetre wave, or [products] in the 6G era, as well as satellite communication chips," he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  Law said despite the global competition in chip making, he expressed confidence that his company can come up with chips and tech that are better than those in the US in two to three years.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Many people in Hong Kong were keeping a close watch on the unfolding results of the hotly contested US elections on Wednesday, with opinions here as divided as those in the United States.
 <br>
  <br>
  Dozens of people attended a watch party organised by the American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  One of them, Chris Growney, who works in the financial services sector, thinks a win for Republican candidate Donald Trump would also be a victory for American businesses.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The businesses that are in the States would be treated with better tax efficiency, have better opportunities to create new jobs,” he said. “And ideally, if there are potentially higher tariffs on imports then that could potentially help American businesses."
  <br>
  <br>
  But Diana Parusheva-Lowery, who works in the same sector, believes a Trump victory could mean more restrictions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If there are more tariffs, if there are more investment restrictions, this is going to affect trade flow, investment flow and ultimately capital flow," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But equally, if Kamala Harris wins, she also has her policies towards China, which will also have an effect to which might be similar, might be different."
  <br>
  <br>
  There were also a number of people who still don’t have a preference either for Trump or Democratic candidate Kamala Harris, including businessman Mark Wise.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The US and Chinese economies are intertwined... One candidate is a bit more protectionist in their approach, and another is more in line with traditional, open and free trade between the countries. That could a material difference in the economic situation for both countries, depending on the outcome," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But I'd say that having an election that takes longer than a day is going to be something that no one wants."
  <br>
  <br>
  Eden Woon, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong, said the result will determine the future development of Sino-US ties, which will also have a direct impact on the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It is very important for Hong Kong because Hong Kong has a very close trade relationship with the United States. Historically, it has a very good connection with the United States' civil society and here many people, many businesses have an interest in the United States. So we are also watching to see what happens in this election,” Woon told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other watch parties were being held elsewhere in the territory, including at a pub in Central.
  <br>
  <br>
  Raj, a British shipping worker in Hong Kong, said he's not surprised to see Trump leading early but believed the Democrats will take over eventually.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Republicans always take an early lead... Typically whenever you watch an election like this it always looks like the Republicans are winning, but it's going to be very close, so I think at the end, we're going to see the Democrats coming forward," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I want to follow the results of this election because I think it has an impact geopolitically all over the world.”
  <br>
  <br>
  For James Lockett, chairman of Democrats Abroad and organiser of the event, the early results came as a surprise.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Compared to 2020, by this time, Joe Biden had a big lead because of early voting,” he noted. "My main concern is gun control, it's very important, and also women's rights are very important. Diversity in the workplace is very important to me."
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, a group of university students was paying attention to the elections on the University of Hong Kong campus on Wednesday morning.
  <br>
  <br>
  Peter Lee, an HKU undergraduate, told RTHK that he was at the event to get to know what others thought about the race.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think in here you can [listen] to different voices and you will listen to different people with different opinion or predictions," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think it will be better for me to come here to interact with people rather than just staying at home, just thinking by myself, because election somehow you can predict it, but maybe the real outcome is different from your predictions."
  <br>
  <br>
  Another student, Zhang Yiqiu, said she backs Harris because of her support for women's reproductive rights.
  <br>
  <br>
  She also described the winner-take-all electoral system in the US as "absurd".
  <br>
  <br>
  "To me, it's not fair if someone gets more votes but still they are the losing party... From quite an idealistic point of view, it will be good to eradicate that and just by counting votes only based on the number."
  <br>
  <br>
  Zhang Jiarui, a master's student, said a Trump win would be a bad sign to China's exports.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Trump said they will bring manufacturing industry back to the United States which implies that they will implement some tariffs to China's exports."

    'Rainbow wall' at Choi Hung Estate must go: govt

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Housing director Rosanna Law said an iconic rainbow wall of Choi Hung Estate will have to be demolished, but officials will seriously look at restoring the spot after redevelopment.
 <br>
  <br>
  Officials plan on moving the first batch of affected tenants to an estate in Kowloon City as early as four years from now, as an estimated 15 years will be needed to complete the phased renewal of the estate.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to RTHK, Law said the "rainbow" block of Tan Fung House and the sports courts next to it, which is above a multi-storey car park, would have to go.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If we say we retain the rainbow wall and the car park, not only will we have fewer flats in the redeveloped estate, but I think it would be rather difficult in terms of having enough space, to improve the traffic conditions nearby," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But we understand how the public loves this photo spot. Our team of architects will seriously think about ways of restoring this 'rainbow' at the new Choi Hung Estate."
  <br>
  <br>
  Law said authorities made the redevelopment announcement early, so that tenants can be psychologically prepared about having to move out and take part in the process.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said if they don't want to move to Kowloon City and stay nearby, officials will try to accommodate if there are suitable flats available.
  <br>
  <br>
  Law stressed that the second and third phase of the redevelopment - due to begin around 2035 - are still in a conceptual stage.
  <br>
  <br>
  She explained the new blocks were meant to be up to 50-storeys high and officials cannot conduct works such as exploring the ground's foundation until after tenants have moved out.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chief Executive John Lee also announced in his Policy Address last month plans to regulate sub-divided flats while requiring landlords to turn them into "basic housing units".
  <br>
  <br>
  Law said it is illegal for landlords to break existing rental contracts early and force out tenants in the name of renovating the flats and she said tenants can report this to the authorities.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In fact, the government has yet to set the standards [for basic housing units]. We haven't completed our public consultation and enact new laws. Do landlords have to rush to [renovate]?" the director of housing said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I appeal to the landlords, even if you're eager to make sure your flats comply with the new standards, you really should wait a little bit until we have promulgated the new standards. Otherwise you may waste your money."
  <br>
  <br>
  Law said around 40 percent of tenants currently living in the potentially affected sub-divided flats, or around 40,000 households, should be ineligible to apply for public housing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities, she said, will not conduct large-scale law enforcement in future unless officials are confident they can find re-settlements for affected residents.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Labour Department (LD) said it was investigating a fatal industrial incident in Kowloon City in which a worker fell to his death while dismantling scaffolding at a building.
 <br>
  <br>
  The incident happened on Tuesday afternoon, when the man fell onto the canopy on the first floor while dismantling a bamboo scaffold at the external wall of the building on Ma Tau Kok Road.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was declared dead in hospital.
  <br>
  <br>
  The department said it issued suspension notices to the contractors involved and stopped all scaffolding work.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The contractors cannot resume the work until the LD is satisfied that measures to abate the relevant risks have been taken," it wrote in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The department added that it will try to find out what caused the incident and who might be responsible, and take legal actions if there is any violation of work safety legislation.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong Construction Industry Employees General Union expressed regret over the tragedy.
  <br>
  <br>
  It urged employers to provide workers with safety equipment such as full-body safety harness and lifelines to prevent similar cases.

    'Oct saw most non-mainland visitors to HK this year'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Tourism minister Kevin Yeung said on Tuesday that Hong Kong recorded nearly a million arrivals of non-mainland visitors last month, the most so far this year for a single month.
 <br>
  <br>
  He said total visitor arrivals in October topped 4 million, with non-mainland tourists exceeding 950,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  For the first 10 months of the year, tourist arrivals reached 36.6 million, a 37 percent jump from the same period last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a Legco panel meeting, lawmakers discussed the idea of promoting horse-racing tourism, which was included by Chief Executive John Lee in his Policy Address.
  <br>
  <br>
  Third Side councillor Tik Chi-yuen expressed concerns that the move could encourage gambling, especially among the younger generation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeung said the aim is not to encourage people to gamble.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our target is the tourists... Horse-racing is an attractive event in their eyes," the secretary for culture, sports and tourism said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He described the SAR as the only place in the region that can host world-class, distinguished races.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the Kai Tak Sports Park which is set to come into use in the first quarter of 2025, Election Committee councillor Chan Siu-hung asked whether officials can ensure that shops and facilities near the park will enjoy a high usage rate during days when mega events are not being held.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan noted the nearby cruise terminal could go very quiet at times.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeung said you can't compare the two. He said the sports park is a public facility, and individuals and groups can book and use the facilities there on non-game days.

 District councillors have urged officials to think of ways to keep alive the heritage and collective memory of Choi Hung Estate, which is set to be redeveloped in three phases over about two decades.

  The first phase of the facelift for the rainbow-themed housing complex, built in the 1960s and famous for its colourful exterior wall and photogenic basketball court, involves three blocks and two vacant school sites.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a Wong Tai Sin district council meeting on Tuesday to discuss the redevelopment plan, councillor Godfrey Ngai said the exterior wall and the basketball court should be preserved.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We propose setting up a Choi Hung museum in the new [Choi Hung] estate, which would include the estate's existing iconic signage, retro vending machines and nostalgic items... This would help preserve the unique features and collective memory of Choi Hung Estate,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another councillor, Deannie Yew, said she is worried about the wall effect, after Secretary for Housing Winnie Ho revealed earlier that the blocks at the future estate will be over 50-storey high.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If each building is going to be 50 storeys high, it would be like a 'giant' in the district because many buildings in the area aren't that tall. In such a densely populated area, wouldn't this potentially create the wall effect?" she questioned.
  <br>
  <br>
  In response, chief architect Tim Li from the Housing Department said a study has already taken the wall effect into consideration, and 50-storey designs are not new.
  <br>
  <br>
  Li added that each redevelopment cycle of Choi Hung Estate would take about seven years, which includes moving residents out, tearing down old buildings and building new foundations.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A senior Beijing official overseeing Hong Kong affairs on Tuesday said the territory’s economic development has been recognised internationally and that the SAR has unlimited opportunities.
 <br>
  <br>
  Zhou Ji, executive deputy director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, also hailed Chief Executive John Lee’s leadership in supporting the economy, seeking development opportunities and improving people’s livelihoods.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong's economy has continued to expand. Its external economic and trade relations have also continued to improve. And the capital market is full of vitality," Zhou told the China International Import Expo in Shanghai.
  <br>
  <br>
  “These achievements have also been fully recognised and highly praised by the international community.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Citing recent data on the city’s economy and competitiveness, Zhou added that Hong Kong is full of business opportunities and development potential.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also said Beijing would continue to work with different departments to roll out measures beneficial to the SAR, while supporting cooperation between the city and Shanghai.
  <br>
  <br>
  At the same event, Chief Executive John Lee said Hong Kong could become a financing platform for mainland enterprises. He said there are more than 2,000 mainland firms in the city with more than 1,400 listed on the city’s bourse.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Among them were nearly 200 Shanghai companies that had a market value of more than HK$2 trillion. This fully demonstrates that Hong Kong can become an investment and financing platform serving the development of Shanghai and mainland enterprises," Lee said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We welcome more Shanghai and mainland enterprises to use Hong Kong to go global and achieve mutual development."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee led a delegation that included Financial Secretary Paul Chan and commerce minister Algernon Yau to attend the seventh edition of the expo, where he toured the Hong Kong exhibition area and reported to Premier Li Qiang on the city's development.
  <br>
  <br>
  The finance chief, for his part, said Hong Kong is a prime treasury centre with a free flow of capital.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan added that the SAR could facilitate the allocation of funds for mainland firms that set up their headquarters in Hong Kong, while providing tax concessions.

<div class="itemFullText">
 RTHK has learnt that Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office director Xia Baolong will hold a seminar on Hong Kong’s development in Shenzhen on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Sources have suggested Chief Executive John Lee, the director of Beijing’s liaison office Zheng Yanxiong, representatives of Hong Kong’s chambers of commerce and some international firms will participate in the seminar.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last month, Xia met HSBC group chairman Mark Tucker, and expressed the hope that the bank could actively participate in the nation’s high-quality development, and contribute to Hong Kong’s prosperity and development.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xia also met Jardine Matheson’s executive chairman Ben Keswick last week and said he hopes the group could help boost the international community’s understanding of Hong Kong.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Tickets for the upcoming Hong Kong Rugby Sevens – the first to be held at the Kai Tak Stadium – went on sale on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The tournament, scheduled for March 28 to 30, will be among the first major sporting events held at the 50,000-seat stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  Organisers said three-day passes for the tournament – which took place at the Hong Kong Stadium for decades – are priced at HK$1,950 for adults, and HK$950 for children 12 and under.
  <br>
  <br>
  A small amount of single-day tickets are also available via online ticket-seller, Klook, priced at up to HK$1,200.
  <br>
  <br>
  Event organisers Hong Kong China Rugby said prices are frozen at 2019 levels and that a HK$750 pass will grant priority access to the new South Stand and cover a free flow of drinks.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[We hope] the opportunity to be at one of the first events at the stadium, as well as the increased stadium capacity of the venue, will draw thousands of new fans to experience Hong Kong’s biggest party in the city’s biggest stadium," organisers said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tickets for last year’s sevens were sold out for the first time since the end of the pandemic.

    Labour group hopes for 5.5 percent pay rise next year

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Federation of Hong Kong and Kowloon Labour Unions on Tuesday urged bosses to give their workers a raise of 5.5 percent next year.
 <br>
  <br>
  The group noted its recent survey of more than 1,100 workers showed that more than six out of ten interviewees got an average pay rise of 4.5 percent this year, while most of the rest saw their salaries frozen.
  <br>
  <br>
  Over half of all respondents said they were unhappy with the salary adjustment, and over 70 percent think their pay should be adjusted based on inflation, the group said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The federation’s chairman Lam Chun-sing said the group had scaled back its expectations compared to last year after looking at factors such as inflation, the business situation and economic growth.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We suggest a salary increase of 5.5 percent, which is a little bit lower than last year because last year we suggested an increase of six percent,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Because last year the inflation was much higher than this year and also this year some of the sectors also face some challenges because of the economic situation.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Lam noted while the transportation sector saw bigger salary increases, some employees in industries like construction and catering faced a salary freeze.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think this is because of the economic situation... Also for the construction industry, some private construction projects are also delayed.”

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Deputy Financial Secretary Michael Wong on Tuesday said the airport’s three-runway system, which opens on November 28, will strengthen Hong Kong’s status as an aviation hub.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at the Super Terminal Expo, Wong said the Hong Kong International Airport would be able to handle 120 million passengers and 10 million tonnes of cargo annually after the launch of the third runway, more than double the current figures.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the airport currently connects the SAR with nearly 200 global destinations, and that he expects airlines to make use of the new runway to introduce new routes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It will make Hong Kong an even stronger aviation hub and allow us to serve the region and beyond even better. And for you as key stakeholders in the world's aviation and logistics communities, this means Hong Kong will provide you with a lot of business and profit opportunities," Wong said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[The authorities] will proactively engage new and existing aviation partners, and markets in Belt and Road countries, including those in the Middle East and Asean."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Airport Authority said it successfully conducted safety checks at the airport in the past few months.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Airport Authority continues to take forward the preparatory work for the commissioning of the three-runway system, including an aircraft crash and rescue exercise on the Centre Runway in the early hours of October 15," it wrote in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  It added that the airport’s expanded Terminal 2 will be put into service in phases from the end of 2025.

    Kowloon City court ramps up security

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Security at Kowloon City court on Tuesday was ramped up a day after a man was arrested for allegedly attempting to attack a magistrate who had earlier convicted him.
 <br>
  <br>
  The judiciary said it will “progressively implement enhanced security measures”, such as bag screenings and deploying extra manpower.
  <br>
  <br>
  An RTHK reporter at the Kowloon City Magistrates' Courts saw security personnel asking people to open their bags for inspections outside courtrooms. People were asked to empty their water bottles and sharp objects were not allowed in.
  <br>
  <br>
  “If these items are discovered, we will call the police,” a notice displayed at the screening area read.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a courtroom mainly hearing criminal cases, roughly three security guards were present and about four police officers were in the dock.
  <br>
  <br>
  On floors without courtrooms, security checks were not required.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sources suggest Edward Wong was the magistrate who was allegedly targeted as court proceedings were underway on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The court diary on the judiciary’s website showed Wong was not presiding over any cases on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Unlike West Kowloon Magistrates’ Courts, where national security cases are heard, there are no walk-through metal detectors and people are not asked to empty their pockets at the Kowloon City courthouse.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, police have laid a holding charge against a man, 32, suspected of involvement in Monday's attack.
  <br>
  <br>
  The case will be mentioned at Kowloon City Magistracy on Wednesday morning.

    New prostate cancer therapy could save lives

<img alt="Doctor Kenneth Wong (right) said around one in two patients who receive the new treatment will see their tumour shrink or eliminated altogether.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 There may be fresh hope for prostate cancer patients who develop resistance to traditional forms of therapies, as oncologists say a new third-line treatment is showing promising results so far.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong Society of Uro-Oncology said the targeted radiotherapy treatment -- lutetium-177-PSMA-617 -- can boost cancer survival rates and improve patients' quality of life.
  <br>
  <br>
  Half of the patients also reported a reduction in tumour size, while others had cancer cells completely eradicated.
  <br>
  <br>
  The treatment is used when the patient no longer reacts to both hormonal therapy and chemotherapy, and presents symptoms such as difficulty in urinating, blood in urine, and even spinal cord pain.
  <br>
  <br>
  Clinical oncologist Kenneth Wong said the treatment is also associated with less side effects.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There are certainly some side effects associated with the use of this drug, including dry mouth, fatigue, nausea, anaemia and so on," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  But that was still better than traditional chemotherapy, Wong stressed, in which patients had to deal with suppressed bone marrow function and an increased risk of infection.
  <br>
  <br>
  The theranostic medicine is administered intravenously every six weeks, for up to six sessions. It locates cancer cells in the body and delivers targeted radiation to kill those cells.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong said patients are required to drink large amounts of water to purge the remnants of the drug which are not absorbed by the tumour.
  <br>
  <br>
  They should also avoid close contact with people for up to two weeks, especially children and pregnant women.
  <br>
  <br>
  Each injection costs HK$150,000 and public hospital patients have to pay out of their own pockets. Charity group St James' Settlement currently provides a subsidy of up to HK$30,000 for each treatment programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prostate cancer was the third most common cancer among men in Hong Kong in 2021. More than half of the patients were only diagnosed at an advanced stage.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Fanling Magistrates' Court on Monday sentenced a 23-year-old mainland student to three months in jail for using fake academic credentials to apply for a master's degree programme at a Hong Kong university.
 <br>
  <br>
  Police said the man had passed an online interview for the Health and Physical Education programme at Education University, and received a conditional offer.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was then asked to submit his qualifications, including an English proficiency test.

  Upon verification the institution realised the actual score attained by the applicant did not match his claim, and reported the case to police.
  <br>
  <br>
  The man pleaded guilty to a count of attempting to obtain services by deception.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police warned people against using bogus academic qualifications, saying it will adopt a zero-tolerance approach to maintain the reputation of Hong Kong's higher education.

 Education officials on Monday said the results of this year’s Territory-wide System Assessment (TSA), which tests students on the subjects of Chinese, English and maths, remained “generally steady”.
 <br>
  <br>
  Primary three students’ scores were all slightly down this year in all the subjects, with an 80.9 percent, 78.7 percent, and 85.3 percent proficiency in Chinese, English and maths respectively.
  <br>
  <br>
  Secondary three pupils did better in Chinese and maths this year, but their English proficiency was down from last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As compared to that of last year, the performance of the primary three and secondary three students participating in the assessment of the three major subjects of Chinese Language, English Language and mathematics this year remains generally steady," the Education Bureau said.
  <br>
  <br>
  It added that it will use different ways to help enhance learning and teaching effectiveness.

 A pharmacist on Monday said regulations on short-acting anaesthetics were not strong enough to deter their recreational use.
 <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong has this year recorded at least three deaths caused by the suspected usage of “space oil”, according to the Toxicology Reference Laboratory of the Hong Kong Poison Control Centre.
  <br>
  <br>
  Often inhaled through vapes, “space oil” usually contains etomidate, a regulated sedative that is prescribed by a doctor. The anaesthetic is classified as a Part 1 poison.
  <br>
  <br>
  The president of the Society of Hospital Pharmacists of Hong Kong So Yiu-wah said the long-term use of etomidate could be deadly.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The drug will suppress the cortisol level inside our body. Once the cortisol is lowered, then our blood potassium will also be lowered, making muscles, especially the legs, seem very weak," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Because the potassium level is low, the heartbeat may become irregular. If those people already have some heart disease, it may be even fatal."
  <br>
  <br>
  He also said penalties for the illegal use of the drug are not stringent enough.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The penalty is high not enough, because for those people who violate the [regulation], the maximum penalty is a HK$100,000 [fine] and being kept in jail for two years,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government is seeking to list the sedative as a dangerous drug in the first half of 2025, according to security minister Chris Tang, who also said taking “space oil” would be equivalent to taking drugs.
  <br>
  <br>
  If etomidate is listed as a dangerous drug, those illegally possessing or consuming “space oil” containing the substance would face a maximum of seven years in prison and a fine of HK$1 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  And those trafficking or illegally importing the drug would be liable to a maximum penalty of life imprisonment and a fine of HK$5 million.

<img alt="Detectives investigate the case at Kowloon City Magistrates’ Courts. Photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1777499_1_20241104152536.jpg&q=40">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Monday arrested a man who allegedly attempted to attack a magistrate with a knife inside Kowloon City Magistrates’ Courts.
 <br>
  <br>
  The case took place shortly after 10am, when the court was in session.
  <br>
  <br>
  As proceedings were under way, the 32-year-old suspect allegedly emerged from the public gallery and charged towards the magistrate, while pulling out a knife from his bag.
  <br>
  <br>
  A police officer intervened quickly and the man never got to the magistrate.
  <br>
  <br>
  The man then tried to flee the scene but was subdued outside the courtroom. Three officers suffered minor injuries in the process.
  <br>
  <br>
  The suspect was later arrested on suspicion of attempted wounding.
  <br>
  <br>
  Superintendent Gar Kam-lam told reporters at a briefing that the man was carrying four knives of 27 to 46cm long, as well as flammable liquids and lighters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gar also confirmed the suspect was convicted of indecent assault in 2020, and was awaiting appeal.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He brought along documents and papers which suggested he was upset with the ruling," Gar said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sources suggest Edward Wong was the presiding magistrate for that case. The same magistrate was at the court this morning.
  <br>
  <br>
  There are currently no security checks at most of the city's Magistrates' Courts.
  <br>
  <br>
  The judiciary said it will "progressively implement enhanced security measures" from Tuesday, including screenings and extra manpower.
  <br>
  <br>
  It will also liaise with police on strengthening patrols and ensure the safety of judges, judicial officers, court staff and users.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Department of Justice strongly condemned the case, saying any threat to judicial officers’ personal safety cannot be tolerated.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Bar Association, for its part, also condemned the case "in the strongest possible terms".
  <br>
  <br>
  It said any threat or violent act made with the intent to frighten or pressure judicial officers, or retaliate against their decisions is a serious assault on judicial independence.
