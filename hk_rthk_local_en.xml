<div class="itemFullText">
 Record-breaking blockbuster "Ne Zha 2" is set for general release in Hong Kong on Saturday, as it dethroned Disney's "Inside Out 2" and became the highest grossing animated film of all time -- based on domestic ticketing data.
 <br>
  <br>
  It premiered in the city on Tuesday night, after it garnered significant attention in the SAR over the past month, which saw the animated movie break records for the number of distributors and daily screenings for a mainland film in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are honoured to bring this world-class phenomenon-level animation to Hong Kong and Macao, allowing viewers to experience the charm of Ne Zha in the theatres", said a representative of Emperor Motion Pictures, which is a co-distributor of the film.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, some local fans went to Shenzhen to see the animation, ahead of its SAR release.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I've seen online comments about the animated film, saying it is a good and touching movie with an excellent storyline that's enlightening for viewers," said a Hongkonger who viewed the movie across the border.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I specifically watched the first movie in Hong Kong and came today to watch its sequel here in Shenzhen, as it hasn't been screened in Hong Kong. I want to see what makes this animation so successful in attracting many adults and to learn about the latest development of Chinese animation."
  <br>
  <br>
  A sequel to the 2019 hit "Ne Zha 1", "Ne Zha 2" has already packed out cinemas in China, where it claimed the title of the nation's biggest box-office hit since its release last month.
  <br>
  <br>
  State media, citing ticketing platform, Maoyan, said on Tuesday the fantasy epic had raked in over 12.32 billion yuan (about US$1.72 billion), which surpassed "Inside Out 2" that took US$1.7 billion following its release last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Ne Zha 2" tells the tale of a rebellious young deity who uses his powers to battle formidable foes after his village is destroyed.
  <br>
  <br>
  The film was released overseas this month, sparking hopes that it would garner similar acclaim abroad.
  <br>
  <br>
  The original "Ne Zha" became what was then China's highest-grossing animated film, after it was released in 2019.

    More community pharmacies to be set up: Lo Chung-mau

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Health Lo Chung-mau said on Wednesday the government plans to establish up to five community pharmacies in each district, so patients can more easily get their medicine.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on RTHK’s Overview Policy programme, Lo said through the Hospital Authority’s centralised procurement, patients and private doctors can get cheaper medicine for chronic and episodic illnesses at community pharmacies.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said community pharmacies will also help to reduce drug wastage as patients need not take home several months’ worth of medication.
  <br>
  <br>
  “With community pharmacies, citizens will not need to get months of medication at one time. They can get one month of medication after visiting the doctor,” Lo said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “They also don't need to have a monthly follow-up appointment to get the same medicine. Instead, they can go to a community pharmacy to fill a prescription,” he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The health minister also expressed the hope that citizens would consult their own family doctors first for minor illnesses or chronic diseases. He added residents can select a general practitioner in their neighbourhood from a list of eligible doctors provided at District Health Centres (DHC).
  <br>
  <br>
  Currently, there are seven DHCs in the city, located in Kwai Tsing, Sham Shui Po, Southern District, Tsuen Wan, Tuen Mun, Wong Tai Sin and Yuen Long.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lo also said the government has subsidised family doctors in the community to provide screening services for diabetes and hypertension for eligible citizens.

    'Expanding Talent List a step in the right direction'

<img alt="An HR expert says Hong Kong firms need to offer attractive pay to lure Islamic finance professionals to the SAR. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1792212_1_20250219084656.jpg&q=45">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A human resources expert on Wednesday said the latest government move to expand Hong Kong's Talent List is the right one, and will help plug holes in the SAR's workforce.
 <br>
  <br>
  On Tuesday, officials announced that aircraft maintenance engineers, accountants and financial professionals with Islamic market experience will be among nine professions added to the list from March 1.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Obviously, Hong Kong has a very serious shortage of these talents," Roy Ying, the co-chair of the advocacy and policy research committee at the Hong Kong Institute of Human Resource Management, told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted that aircraft engineering and maintenance firms such as Haeco has had to go overseas to recruit engineers all the time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ying also said the government has been proactive in addressing the needs of employers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I also think that the government is actively listening to the industries because these new jobs, they don't just land on the Talent List. It's a collaboration between the government and the industries.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Obviously the government sees a serious shortage and that's why these [jobs] are added to the Talent List."
  <br>
  <br>
  On bringing in more Islamic finance professionals to the SAR, he said Hong Kong firms not only have to offer attractive pay in order to compete with market leaders Malaysia and Saudi Arabia, but the territory also has to be become more Muslim friendly.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In terms of halal restaurants, we only have about 132 in Hong Kong... and most organisations don't have prayer rooms, so we have to make our city a little more embracing to attract these people," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We don't just want them to come, we want them to also bring their families... we have to get people who want to call Hong Kong home."

    HK's population grows by 6,400

<img alt="Hong Kong's population stood at 7.534 million at the end of 2024, representing an increase of 0.1 percent year on year. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1792151_2_20250218225030.jpg&q=70">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's population expanded for the third consecutive year, albeit at a slower pace, to 7.534 million last year, an uptick of 6,400.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 0.1 percent growth paled in comparison to the 0.7 percent increase in 2023, and one percent in 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the 36,700 births last year were outstripped by 51,400 deaths.
  <br>
  <br>
  That was offset by a net positive movement of 21,000 SAR residents, which included 40,000 arrivals through one-way permits. Around 18,900 people migrated elsewhere.
  <br>
  <br>
  A government spokesperson said that various talent attraction measures and labour importation schemes helped boost the city's population growth.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Professor Paul Yip from the University of Hong Kong's Department of Social Work and Social Administration struck a cautious tone.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said that the natural decrease of over 14,000 people remained a concern, alongside the city's ageing population.
  <br>
  <br>
  "What we can see is that the ageing situation remains a very important issue and it will get worse in the coming years," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yip does not expect the trend to reverse any time soon, despite a 10 percent jump in the birth rate last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In 2024, that was the dragon year. It is a year that tends to have a higher birth rate than before. But I think when we look at the historical figures, all the years after the dragon years, I think the birth rates reduced accordingly," he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  The population expert urged the government to focus on improving people’s health and wellbeing, while encouraging enterprises to adopt technology to make work less labour intensive.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Snooker legends Judd Trump and Ronnie O'Sullivan said they are very excited to play in their first tournament in Hong Kong since becoming SAR residents.
 <br>
  <br>
  The World Snooker Grand Prix 2025 will be held in the Kai Tak Arena on March 8 and 9.
  <br>
  <br>
  World number one Trump is set to face Gary Wilson of England, while O'Sullivan will take on Si Jiahui from China.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both Trump and O'Sullivan obtained their Hong Kong residency through the Quality Migrant Admission Scheme last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For me, it is more motivating to come back here because I feel like now that I'm here, and I feel like the people in Hong Kong can really get behind me and have someone to really support," Trump said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think when you have somebody that is trying to represent Hong Kong, which I am now. I think the people can kind of see that. I hope that comes off in the way that I'm able to carry myself and give everybody full respect. I hope to make Hong Kong proud and be the first winner of this tournament."
  <br>
  <br>
  O'Sullivan, a seven-time World champion, said he is ready and looks forward to play in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vincent Law, chairman of the Billiard Sports Council of Hong Kong China, said efforts are underway to make sure the event is being held successfully at the brand new venue.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We also hope the spectators will understand if something don't go right on the first day, we guarantee that we will try to our best to fix problems to make sure the tournament will run smoothly."
  <br>
  <br>
  Exhibition matches will also take place during the two-day event.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong's top player, Marco Fu, will face off the legendary "Whirlwind" Jimmy White on March 8.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SAR's Ng On-yee, meanwhile, takes on world number 1 Mink Nutcharut from Thailand the following day.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's unemployment rate remained at 3.1 percent in the November-January period, unchanged from the previous three-month figure.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Census and Statistics Department said 3,716,600 were in work in the latest period, a fall of 2,300 from October-December.
  <br>
  <br>
  The labour force, meanwhile, decreased by around 5,700 to 3,826,700.
  <br>
  <br>
  Around 110,100 people were looking for a job, down about 3,500 from the previous three-month period.
  <br>
  <br>
  The underemployment rate also remained unchanged in the three months from November, at 1.1 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Secretary for Labour and Welfare Chris Sun said Hong Kong's jobless rate remains low.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added in a statement that "the labour market should remain largely stable in the near term, though uncertainties in the global economy would continue to pose challenges to some businesses."

    Lawmakers back annual minimum wage reviews

<img alt="Hong Kong's statutory minimum wage will increase from HK$40 to HK$42.1 per hour. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1792143_1_20250218174210.jpg&q=60">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lawmakers welcomed the shift from biennial to annual minimum wage reviews, saying this would enhance the quality of life of grassroots workers.
 <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong's statutory minimum wage will increase from HK$40 to HK$42.1 an hour, following a 5.25 percent recommendation from the Minimum Wage Commission.
  <br>
  <br>
  This new rate is set to take effect on May 1, pending lawmakers' approval, and will be reviewed annually instead of biennially.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lam Chun-sing, chairman of the Legislative Council's manpower panel, said reviewing wages annually allows minimum wage workers to better pace their earnings with inflation each year.
  <br>
  <br>
  He told RTHK that the government's freeze on minimum wage levels during the pandemic led to four years without salary increases for grassroots workers despite inflation, severely affecting their ability to maintain their purchasing power and living standards.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lam hopes future adjustments to the minimum wage would give greater weight to economic growth, so that workers could benefit more substantially from gains in the economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We hope that later ... after three or five years we can review the formula to see whether we can increase the proportion of the calculation of growth of the GDP so that if there's a large increase in GDP, then we can also have a large increase in minimum wage levels so that the grassroots worker can share the fruits of economic development," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, lawmaker Kwok Wai-keung, of the Federation of Trade Unions, said they would continue to communicate with the government to see whether a review could be conducted within five to 10 years after this reform was completed.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added the increase was unlikely to have a major impact on the labour market, as only about 20,000 of the 3.6 million workers in the SAR earn the minimum wage.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The number of grassroots workers is small and their roles are concentrated in cleaning and security. We have heard that many companies in these industries already pay wages above the minimum wage, meaning that this adjustment will not affect those already earning more than the minimum," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Thus, we believe it will not have a major impact on the economy or competitiveness."

<div class="itemFullText">
 Aircraft maintenance engineers, accountants and financial professionals with Islamic market experience will be among nine professions added to Hong Kong's Talent List from March 1.
 <br>
  <br>
  The government also wants new blood with a background in commodities trading, as well as systems architects, patent professionals, ship surveyors, professionals in green shipping, and legal knowledge engineers in the legal and dispute resolution sector.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a closed-door media briefing on Tuesday, the Labour and Welfare Bureau said that by expanding the number of jobs on the list to 60, the government is hoping to find talented people who can add significant value to the economy in areas where there are staff shortages and where it is not practical to train up locals.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the other hand, it said requests from industries to add further roles to the list, including pilots and language therapists, have been rejected because there are sufficient training opportunities for local people to take up such jobs.
  <br>
  <br>
  People in professions on the list get a smoother immigration process when applying to work in Hong Kong through various talent schemes, officials say.
  <br>
  <br>
  The last expansion of the Talent List was in May 2023, when the number of professions rose from 13 to 51.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bureau said between May 2023 and the end of last year it received 1,123 applications for work visas involving jobs on the list.

    Rise in cigarette smuggling in 2024: customs
   </title>

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Cigarette smuggling accounted for around 68 percent of the total number of cases the Customs and Excise Department worked on last year, according to customs officers.
 <br>
  <br>
  The department handled more than 31,000 cases in 2024, which was a 63 percent increase from 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said cigarette smuggling increased 80 percent last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Customs commissioner Chan Tsz-tat on Tuesday said the numbers were due to the increased tobacco tax over the past two years.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The duty rates of cigarettes has increased from HK$1.9 to HK$3.3 per stick over the past two years. Inevitably, this would add the incentive to smugglers as well as incoming passengers to bring in excessive duty-free cigarettes," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added the department had cracked 40 large-scale cigarette smuggling cases in 2024, similar to 2023, but the number of cigarettes seized dropped 33 percent to around 600 million sticks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said the drop was due to syndicates decreasing the number of cigarettes being smuggled out at any one time and using differenct smuggling methods in order to reduce losses if smuggled products were seized.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, customs officers seized 6.3 tonnes of drugs and arrested 366 people last year in connection with these seizures.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among them, 19 cases involved the import of space oil drugs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Customs said it has stepped up its actions following the classification of etomidate, the key ingredient of the space oil drug, as a dangerous drug last Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have strengthened our enforcement covering the whole supply chain, including import and export, distribution and retail, and to crack down on their supply," Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The department has also enhanced intelligence analysis and risk management so as to ensure precise cargo and passenger selections. Etomidate has been added to the database of our Raman spectrometers to enhance detection on the front line," he added.

    Ngong Ping 360 sees record revenue in 2024

<div class="itemFullText">
 Ngong Ping 360 on Tuesday said it will work on attracting more long-haul tourists, as its visitor numbers last year surpassed pre-pandemic levels.
 <br>
  <br>
  The company said it received record-breaking cable car revenue of over HK$413 million last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said the facility welcomed more than 1.5 million guests in 2024, showing a 10 percent growth when compared with pre-pandemic levels.
  <br>
  <br>
  About 40 percent of the visitors were from short-haul markets, followed by mainland tourists, local people, and visitors from long-haul markets.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to the press, managing director James Tung said the company will do its best to attract more visitors, especially those from long-haul markets.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We are actually talking to some online travel agencies, trying to target those free and independent travellers - FIT - who may not necessarily follow a tour itinerary pattern, but they can get access to our tickets very easily,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “So we are even targeting potentially backpackers from the US, from Australia, from Europe as well.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Last month, the Airport Authority unveiled the Airport City development blueprint, aiming to create a new landmark for Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tung said the cable car facility has an advantage of being close to Chek Lap Kok.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We’ve been talking to different operators, different stakeholders who are involved in the project, to see what we can do moving forward… how we can actually get the tickets to the hands of the travellers,“ he said.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong is set to raise the statutory minimum wage from the current HK$40 to HK$42.1 per hour.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a statement issued on Tuesday, the government said the Executive Council has adopted the recommendation of the Minimum Wage Commission (MWC) on raising the minimum wage level by 5.25 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said it will publish the Minimum Wage Ordinance (Amendment of Schedule 3) Notice 2025 in the Gazette on Friday, and table it in the Legislative Council on February 26.
  <br>
  <br>
  If Legco gives it the green light, the new minimum wage rate will take effect on May 1.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The recommendation … is in line with the policy objectives … to maintain an appropriate balance between forestalling excessively low wages and minimising the loss of low-paid jobs, while giving due regard to sustaining Hong Kong's economic growth and competitiveness,” labour and welfare secretary Chris Sun said.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday said the opening of Kai Tak Sports Park will mark a significant milestone in Hong Kong's sporting and cultural landscape.
 <br>
  <br>
  An opening ceremony will begin at 6.30pm on March 1, with a joint broadcast at 9.30pm across four free TV channels, rather than being shown live.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked about the broadcast arrangements, Lee said he believes the production company has tried its best.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have to make sure that members of the public will be able to view the event for free through the TV channels so that we can share the happiness with everyone," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The production company will seek partners to help deal with all the challenges that they are going to face. In this regard I believe the production company has been working very hard. They're going to find the best solution within such a short period of time."
  <br>
  <br>
  The park's opening is part of what is being billed as Hong Kong's "Super March", alongside Art Basel, ComplexCon, and the World Grand Prix snooker tournament.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee said the mega events scheduled for the first half of this year are expected to attract 840,000 tourists and generate HK$3.3 billion in spending.

    Taxi strike wouldn't solve anything, says John Lee

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday urged the taxi industry to avoid "drastic action" such as strikes, warning such moves would harm the public interest and could be hijacked by people with bad motives.
 <br>
  <br>
  His comments came after the Hong Kong Tele-call Taxi Association threatened a five-day strike from March 5 unless officials take immediate action against illegal ride-hailing services.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters before the weekly Executive Council meeting, Lee said strikes would not be good for society.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Any drastic action is not going to solve the problem. Drastic action may also hurt the interests of normal citizens in the course of their daily going about of their lives. It is not going to receive public support," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CE noted that many taxi drivers have said they wouldn't support strike action.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Transport Advisory Committee will meet representatives from both the taxi industry and ride-hailing platforms on Wednesday to discuss the issue.

 Chief Executive John Lee said on Tuesday that he's all for his ministers reaching out to the community and explaining their work, including to the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office.
 <br>
  <br>
  The head of the office, Xia Baolong, made a three-day visit to the Greater Bay Area earlier this month and met with some of the SAR's ministers, when Lee was in Harbin attending the Asian Winter Games.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking before the weekly Executive Council meeting, the CE said Xia is a busy leader, and that he and the top mainland official maintain good communication.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I also support my ministers in doing their work in their own right... I support them in explaining issues to different people and reporting their work to the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, especially in explaining their specific portfolio to Director Xia personally.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This precisely reflects my demands for different ministers to do their own part, taking charge of their responsibilities in resolving problems.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And at the same time, there's synergy among the team, united as one, complementing one another in handling problems."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee said he wanted to once again thank Xia for pointing the way forward for Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office said Xia exchanged views with a number of SAR government officials on how Hong Kong will speed up reform and better integrate into the Greater Bay Area's development. During his trip, he visited the Hetao Innovation and Technology Cooperation Zone, as well as Qianhai and Yantian.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government says it strongly condemns unfounded malicious attacks online, after a court issued an order to confiscate the alleged crime proceeds of self-exiled national security suspect, Ted Hui.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Court of First Instance issued the confiscation order on Monday upon application by the Department of Justice.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement overnight, a government spokesman accused Hui of committing numerous crimes, including conspiring with foreign politicians in 2020 to forge documents and deceive the court, in order to jump bail and abscond overseas.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Before and after Hui Chi-fung absconded from Hong Kong, he transferred nearly $2.5 million Hong Kong dollars in personal assets as gifts to his mother and wife," the spokesman said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government spokesman said such a gift made within six years from the date of prosecution may be regarded as the defendant's property, and confiscated under the law.
  <br>
  <br>
  The statement said it was common practice to confiscate crime proceeds, and denied that private property could be 'confiscated at any time' or 'arbitrarily', as such orders must comply with strict conditions.
  <br>
  <br>
  These include that the court must be satisfied the absconded defendant could have been convicted of the offence and whether they benefited from the offence.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Housing Bureau on Monday announced a new phase of light public flats, and people can begin moving in from the fourth quarter of this year.
 <br>
  <br>
  The second phase covers four projects in Kai Tak, Kwun Tong, Tuen Mun and Sheung Shui, generating 5,060 units with monthly rents between HK$860 and HK$3,270.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eligible people can submit their applications from February 24.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to the press, housing minister Winnie Ho said she expects the projects to receive an overwhelming response, especially the one in Kai Tak adjacent to the MTR station
  <br>
  <br>
  "Light public housing projects can effectively help residents in need. The locations of the second phase projects are very appealing," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have about 5,000 units this time, and together with the 4,400 units announced in the first phase, we have introduced almost 10,000 flats. That is one-third of the total number."
  <br>
  <br>
  DAB lawmaker Vincent Cheng, who's the deputy chairman of the Legco housing panel, said while the projects would help reduce the waiting time for public housing, the focus should still be on building more public flats.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Light public housing is not for the long term. Some of the residents also have to move again after they [are allocated with] a public housing flat," he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hopefully, even though the waiting time will be shortened, we hope that the government can keep providing more public housing in the future."
  <br>
  <br>
  The government aims to build a total of about 30,000 light public flats by 2028 under the scheme aimed at filling the short-term gap of public housing supply.
  <br>
  <br>
  Regarding the projects announced in the first phase last year, Ho said people would start moving into the units in Yuen Long and Ngau Tau Kok from March and June respectively.

 Hong Kong universities have seen a surge in non-local students, after the government doubled the enrolment ceiling for them to 40 percent.
 <br>
  <br>
  So, how are these students adjusting to life here? And what efforts are being made to help them feel at home?
  <br>
  <br>
  RTHK spoke to the warden and some students at St. John's College -- University of Hong Kong’s oldest residential hall -- to find out more.

    Baby's heart thrives after cross-boundary transplant

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Health authorities said the heart of a baby who received a successful cross-boundary organ donation is functioning well, with little post-operative bleeding.
 <br>
  <br>
  Eight month-old Whitney underwent a heart transplant on Sunday and is now in intensive care.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have at least a dozen of these monitoring lines attached to Whitney. We have minute-by-minute monitoring for at least a dozen of these parameters, and this is coupled with another list of interval monitoring like echocardiograms to look at the heart function, and radiographers to look at the chest conditions," said Dr Nicholson Yam, the head surgeon of the operation from the Hong Kong Children's Hospital.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have a team of dedicated nurses to look at the surgical wound condition, the bleeding conditions from the tubes that we place after surgery, and this will continue at least for the coming weeks."
  <br>
  <br>
  Yam said this was the baby's third open-heart surgery, presenting challenges such as removing the previously implanted biventricular assist device and minimising ischemia time -- the period during which tissue, such as a heart, is deprived of blood supply.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A lot of work has been done before to make sure the logistics [are] as smooth as possible, all the transportation, all the cross-boundary action, and then the transport to the Children's Hospital is as fast as possible, as smooth as possible," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As for Whitney's surgery, the main challenge was it was the third time the chest was opened, so she had two previous chest openings for heart surgery. We have expected quite a bit of scarring tissue inside the chest and that will make the heart removal procedure technically more challenging."
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Simon Tang, director of cluster services at the Hospital Authority, said close communication with mainland authorities -- specifically strengthened collaboration with the centre for the China Organ Transplant Response System -- was essential for ensuring a smooth cross-boundary organ transplant.
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted the first successful cross-boundary organ donation was in 2022 with a then four-month-old baby girl.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We established the communication channels and we also established the essential pathway. So in case if we have suitable grafts in mainland China, but there is no suitable recipients in mainland China, then this graft, we will see if it can be matched to a potential recipient in Hong Kong," Tang said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The key step is we need good preparations and so in these two years we have already set up various guidelines and protocols, so that we can ensure ... things can go smooth."
  <br>
  <br>
  Mr Cheung, Whitney's father, expressed his gratitude to the medical team, relevant departments and the donor's family for saving his daughter's life, calling the procedure a miracle.

    'Improve transparency for bring your own cup schemes'

<img alt="The council found that tea shops tend to provide more information about BYOC schemes than other types of beverage stores. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1791983_1_20250217171151.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Consumer Council has urged beverage shops to enhance their training for staff on bring-your-own-cup (BYOC) policies, adding there was a lack of transparency about such schemes.
 <br>
  <br>
  Additionally, it also saw cases where paper cups were used to make drinks even when customers brought their own cups, which failed to reduce waste.
  <br>
  <br>
  The consumer watchdog on Monday said it had sent staff undercover to conduct BYOC trials at 20 beverage shops.
  <br>
  <br>
  BYOC refers to schemes by drink shops, ranging from coffee shops to hand-shaken beverage shops, which encourage customers to bring their own cups instead of using plastic or paper ones in order to save waste.
  <br>
  <br>
  Often, this is accompanied by incentives such as a five dollar discount.
  <br>
  <br>
  Consumer Council CEO Gilly Wong said one problem was shops' inability to properly provide relevant information.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If you just simply say small, tall, may be standard, normal or similar words to describe the size of your drinks, but unfortunately you haven't provided exact size... then it's very hard for people to follow," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  She added that often customers do not know such a scheme exists since it is not consistently displayed, appearing in small letters at the bottom of the poster.
  <br>
  <br>
  Moreover, problems also arise when staff are not be properly trained, leading to misunderstandings.
  <br>
  <br>
  "From our findings, there are a couple of times that the shop staff didn't know such offer [existed] and said they didn't have the offer, or missed the discount."
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong suggested that merchants look into the details of their workflow to ensure the minimisation of waste and to better display their schemes.

    Many nappy creams contain allergens: Consumer Council
   </title>

<img alt="" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1791959_1_20250217125904.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Consumer Council on Monday said around 75 percent of nappy cream samples it tested contained fragrances or chemicals that can cause irritation or allergic reactions.
 <br>
  <br>
  The watchdog tested 16 nappy creams priced from HK$52 to HK$218.
  <br>
  <br>
  Most of them claimed to be suitable for use on infants, with three types also suitable for adults or the elderly who need to wear adult diapers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Seven samples contained fragrances.
  <br>
  <br>
  Most of them had one or two types of fragrant substances, but Weleda baby's sample had six types.
  <br>
  <br>
  Essential oils or plant extracts were found in four samples, including the aromatic compound terpenes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The European medicines regulatory body has warned that terpenes can cause adverse neurologic effects such as twitches in babies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two samples, a diaper rash cream from Baby Sebamed, and QV baby’s nappy cream, contain preservatives restricted in the United States and France.
  <br>
  <br>
  The council said those ingredients may worsen diaper rashes or cause allergenic reactions like dermatitis.
  <br>
  <br>
  “If nappy creams contain ingredients of concern, they are more likely to irritate the skin, pose allergy risks or may even cause adverse neurologic effects,” said chairman of the council’s committee on research and testing Chung Chi-yung.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Infants, having thinner skin and a higher body surface area-to-body weight ratio, are particularly susceptible to allergic reactions,” he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The council urged manufacturers to improve their labelling by listing all ingredients clearly, including their concentrations.
  <br>
  <br>
  They should also pay attention to the latest international regulations to improve product formulations.
  <br>
  <br>
  The watchdog also hoped local regulatory bodies would establish regulations on the safety and labelling of nappy creams.

    Over 5,000 people flock to Ocean Park for panda twins

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 More than 5,000 people flocked to Ocean Park for the panda twins' debut, its chairman revealed on Monday, saying the figures fell within expectations.
 <br>
  <br>
  Paulo Pong said that dozens of people arrived at the park gates at 6am, four hours before the start of public viewings.
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted entry to facility was smooth as several drills had been conducted earlier.
  <br>
  <br>
  The turnout marked a daily record high at the Giant Panda Adventure exhibition zone, Pong said, with a majority of them being locals.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This included annual pass holders, who are devoted fans of pandas. There were also visitors from around the world and the mainland, including Chengdu. Many people from foreign countries, like Southeast Asia, or even Europe and America, came to see the pandas," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Some of the tourists actually didn't know about the twins when they arrived at Ocean Park, but when they heard they could visit the cubs, they also queued to meet them."
  <br>
  <br>
  Public viewing of the twins, whom Ying Ying gave birth to last August, is for five hours daily – from 10am to 3pm.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Pong said visiting hours could be extended.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When they're more adapted to meeting the public, or even when they can be in the same exhibition zone with Ying Ying, then we can gradually extend the duration."
  <br>
  <br>
  He said Ocean Park received hundreds of applications for the HK$1,500 VIP session to meet the cubs for 30 minutes before the park opens each day.
  <br>
  <br>
  The first session will be held on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pong emphasised that income generated from the special tour would be used for its conservation fund after deducting expenses.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Health authorities said on Monday that thanks to a cross-border organ donation, an eight-month-old girl underwent a successful heart transplant on Sunday night.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, Secretary for Health, Lo Chung-mau, noted that it was the second such case of cross-boundary organ donation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "After a then four-month-old baby girl, Tsz-hei, successfully received a heart donation from the mainland in December 2022 to extend her life, Hong Kong and the mainland established a close communication channel and procedures for cross-boundary organ transplant co-operation based on that successful experience," said Professor Lo.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said more than 100 personnel from 18 mainland authorities worked together and raced against time to ensure the safe and smooth transportation of the organ across multiple locations.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Health Bureau and the Hospital Authority said the heart transplant was successfully completed for baby, Whitney, at the Hong Kong Children's Hospital.
  <br>
  <br>
  Consultant in-charge of the Cardiothoracic Surgery of HKCH, Dr Nicholson Yam - who was in charge of the transplant - said the operation lasted approximately 6.5 hours. The statement said Whitney was now under close monitoring in the Intensive Care Unit and the following 24 hours would be a critical period.
  <br>
  <br>
  Whitney's parents expressed their gratitude to the medical teams and to the different regional authorities in finding a suitable heart, as well as thanking the donor's family for their difficult and selfless decision, giving Whitney the chance for a new life.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Director of Cluster Services of the HA, Dr Simon Tang, said all efforts had been made through different networks to identify a suitable heart for Whitney amid the difficulties involved.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Since there was no suitable recipient in the mainland, the mainland decided to send the donor heart to Hong Kong for transplanting to Whitney upon confirmation by experts from the two places that the heart was suitable for Whitney's transplantation," Dr Tang added.

 Over 50,000 civil servants and members of the public took part in a stress test at the Kai Tak Sports Park on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The aim was to assess the park's readiness ahead of its official opening at the beginning of next month.
  <br>
  <br>
  The exercise also looked into the performance of the Easy Leave platform. It uses artificial intelligence to analyse real-time data on crowd density and the time needed for people to follow an exit route.

    Make good use of Hetao to boost biotech sector: DAB

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 DAB lawmakers on Sunday said Hong Kong should make good use of the Hetao Shenzhen-Hong Kong Science and Technology Innovation Co-operation Zone to boost the country’s biotech development.
 <br>
  <br>
  The suggestion is among dozens of others the party is planning to propose during the annual sessions of the nation's legislature and top political advisory body in Beijing next month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Starry Lee, Hong Kong’s sole member of the National People’s Congress Standing Committee, said for one, authorities should allow blood samples taken from the mainland to be processed in Hetao.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I understand that [Hong Kong] Red Cross receive blood donation from the general public because we cannot have the samples from [mainland] China. We [also] have to export the blood samples to overseas countries to manufacture blood-related products for medical use,” she explained.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Our suggestion is to make use of Hetao for a trial so that all these samples can move to Hong Kong for further development and innovation.”
  <br>
  <br>
  She added that her party hopes to see more cross-border exchanges in areas like medicine and healthcare equipment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the party quoted some private enterprises as saying they would like more support from the central government to help them ride out the economic downturn.
  <br>
  <br>
  “For example, you know, all the enterprises who are operating on the mainland have to pay the social security payment. And because of the tight economic environment, some say some sort of flexibility should be incorporated during this special period,” Lee said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The party also said drivers under the Northbound Travel for Hong Kong Vehicles scheme should be allowed to return to the SAR via more borders besides the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Customs officers have arrested a 28-year-old woman on suspicion of carrying the space oil drug in a vape stick.
 <br>
  <br>
  The woman was taken into custody at the Hong Kong-Macau Ferry Terminal in Sheung Wan after she arrived from Macau on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The arrestee, who claimed to be unemployed, has been released on bail.
  <br>
  <br>
  This marks the department’s first arrest since etomidate - a key ingredient of space oil drug - was included in the Dangerous Drug Ordinance last Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trafficking or illegal import of such a substance is punishable by a maximum penalty of life imprisonment and a fine of HK$5 million

    'Funding infrastructure with bonds is common practice'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan said on Sunday that issuing government bonds to fund the mega Northern Metropolis project is one way to ensure its development won’t be affected by Hong Kong’s economic situation.
 <br>
  <br>
  Writing on his weekly blog, Chan said bonds are commonly used around the world to finance infrastructure projects, adding that international investors have traditionally been very receptive to the SAR’s debt securities.
  <br>
  <br>
  These investors, the minister said, include central banks, sovereignty funds, global organisations and banks.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong has the conditions and ability to issue more bonds, and use market forces flexibly for implementing strategic infrastructure [projects]," Chan wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  The finance chief cited research from international groups and local universities as saying that the SAR's debt level remains comparatively low, and bond issuance would be a smart solution.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan went on to say that in some developed economies, government debt is actually higher than its total GDP.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also said as Hong Kong's debt is just over nine percent of its total GDP, there is room to lift this percentage.

    Govt mulls longer grace period for basic housing units

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Housing Winnie Ho said on Sunday that the government is considering extending a grace period for landlords to convert subdivided flats, after new laws are introduced to regulate the compact homes.
 <br>
  <br>
  Officials had initially proposed a transitional period of up to two years for the registration of such flats, known as "basic housing units", which will need to meet a number of requirements such as a minimum size.
  <br>
  <br>
  Citing public views received during a consultation exercise which concluded earlier, Ho said some respondents expressed the need for more time to make the changes.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said extending the grace period to three years could be an option.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Time-wise, it is helpful to the market - so tenants can move out and renovation work can take place and people have better options on where to live," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "All these will help the situation. So I think a three-year grace period is something that can be considered."
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho added that the government is analysing the public’s views and will make adjustments to the legal proposals accordingly.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, the housing chief said officials will soon put in place a pilot scheme at two public housing estates by installing sensors at the doors of flats occupied by elderly residents, in order to better ensure their safety.
  <br>
  <br>
  The scheme comes after a recent spate of cases involving elderly people who died alone in their homes for some time before being discovered.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said dozens of households at Sheung Lok Estate in Ho Man Tin and Wan Hon Estate in Kwun Tong have signed up for the trial.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The sensor records movements. The elderly person can decide who to send such information - it's not to the estate's management, it can be his or her son, daughter or other family members. It's up to the tenant," Ho said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister stressed the sensors don't have cameras and won't detect what's inside the flat.

    Crowds flock to Ocean Park to meet panda cubs

<img alt="Hundreds of people waited in line to meet the panda twins. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1791839_2_20250216115418.jpg&q=70">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ocean Park's panda twin cubs made their highly-anticipated public debut on Sunday in front of hundreds of delighted locals and tourists.
 <br>
  <br>
  Many visitors arrived extra early to make sure they could meet the baby pandas as soon as possible.
  <br>
  <br>
  A local panda enthusiast, surnamed Chan, told RTHK that he arrived at Ocean Park two hours before it opened - and he's also taking part in a contest to pick a name for the pair.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I arrived here at 8am. I want to see them as soon as I can. I will join the [naming] contest, but I am still thinking [about what names to propose]. The theme will probably be related to Hong Kong,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tourists were equally thrilled to meet the locally-born cubs.
  <br>
  <br>
  One Indonesian student who’s currently studying in Shenzhen said he doesn’t get to see pandas in his home country.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We don’t really have access to pandas [in Indonesia]. So looking at pandas, especially the cubs, is quite special to us,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ocean Park says visitors are allowed to stay for up to five minutes inside the venue to give more people a chance to view the panda babies.
  <br>
  <br>
  While some said they wish they could spend more time with the cubs, Christa from San Francisco said the arrangement is reasonable.
  <br>
  <br>
  “They [panda cubs] are just doing their own thing, just hanging out. They don’t need to do anything special, they’re just special the way they are,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I think if you can take what you can get so others could enjoy them too I think it’s better to have more people enjoy them and want to conserve and protect them. So I think it’s better to have more people see them.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Public viewings of the panda cubs are from 10am to 3pm daily, and the facility is expected to welcome up to 5,000 visitors each day.
  <br>
  <br>
  People can also choose to pay HK$1,500 each for a special, 30-minute visit before the park opens each day.
  <br>
  <br>
  A woman sunamed Ho said she may sign up for the session so that she can spend more time with the twins.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I saw the pandas climbing up and down. I like both of them. I think seeing the cubs grow up is like seeing my grandchildren. I am interested in the HK$1,500 session, at least I'll have half an hour to see the cubs. I think it's worth it because I feel happy after seeing them," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, another woman surnamed Leung said the VIP slot is just too costly.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I will not consider [registering] at all. It is not necessary. I still have to see the pandas with another 50 people even after paying HK$1,500," she said.

    Real-name ticketing deters scalpers: Consumer Council

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Consumer Council has called on the government to implement real-name registration for tickets to prevent scalping.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a TV program on Saturday, the council’s chief executive Gilly Wong said real-name ticketing can deter scalpers and allow people who are truly interested in attending to buy tickets.
  <br>
  <br>
  “When more mega events are taking place, there will be more ticket scalping. Recently, it was reported in the news that a ticket had been marked-up to an astronomical price of more than HK$100,000,” Wong said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We hope the market can be regulated and stabilized. We believe that real-name ticketing is a good way to achieve that,” she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The council received over 40,000 complaints last year, a 20 percent increase from 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong said over 7,000 complaints were related to Lionel Messi’s no-show at an exhibition match last February, as well as the abrupt closure of the Physical Fitness chain in September.
  <br>
  <br>
  She urged organisers to provide clearer clauses for future events, and to inform consumers earlier if they are any changes.

    Govt working with privacy watchdog on data interchange

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A data interchange system among departments has not been set up due to privacy and technical issues, according Secretary for Labour and Welfare Chris Sun, but the government is in touch with the Privacy Commissioner to overcome challenges.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lawmakers had called on the authorities to provide more assistance to hidden elders, after a 78-year-old man was found dead inside his Tuen Mun flat earlier this week.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters after an event on Saturday, Sun said the government should make use of data from departments like the Hospital Authority and the Social Welfare Department.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said authorities are currently in touch with the Privacy Commissioner to discuss ways allowing data interchange, while complying with the Personal Data Ordinance.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We hope we can intervene before any incident occurs. We can identify some high-risk cases and contact them to provide services. We hope to avoid tragedies as much as possible," Sun said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Chief Executive's Policy Address last year mentioned that officials would make use of identification tools designed by universities for detection of high-risk cases.

 People are invited to suggest names for Ocean Park's panda twin cubs as they turn six months old on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at the greeting ceremony for the panda babies, Chief Executive John Lee said people can submit their ideas, based on the twins' appearance and personality, from noon on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the government will announce their names in the first half of this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee added that Sunday will be a big day, as the cubs will finally meet the public.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's the first time that pandas have been born in the SAR, and there's a sense of elation among Hong Kong people. The pair only weighed about 120 grammes each when they were born, and they've shown extraordinary resilience," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "After six months, their weight has increased to over ten kilogrammes each. They were a bit shaky at first, but now, they've become experts at tree climbing."
  <br>
  <br>
  Ocean Park said people can suggest a Chinese name for each of the cubs, along with an explainer of the meaning of the Chinese names.
  <br>
  <br>
  The submission deadline is March 7, and the judging panel will comprise representatives from the park, the SAR government, and the China Conservation and Research Centre for the Giant Panda.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ocean Park's chairman Paulo Pong said with the support of the whole community, the SAR has successfully promoted the concept of "panda is everywhere".
  <br>
  <br>
  "With promotions through social media, on transportation and various creative activities across Hong Kong involving panda-themed products, we connected Hong Kong and global panda lovers. This further promotes Hong Kong's tourism and culture," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He pointed out that the park will use top-tier animal care, veterinary and scientific research to help with the breeding of giant pandas.

    Public urged to be alert to new SMS scam messages

 Police said efforts to educate the elderly have led to a significant drop in the number of so-called “Guess Who” phone scams – in which fraudsters pose as an old friend or relative of the victim.
 <br>
  <br>
  The number of “Guess Who” phone scams, which mainly targets victims aged 65 or above, were down by 48 percent last year, police commissioner Raymond Siu said on Saturday after attending a Commercial Radio program.
  <br>
  <br>
  “That’s why last year, we particularly focused our effort to deliver these anti-scam messages to the elderly,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Siu said police are working with The Office of the Communications Authority (OFCA) to combat other types of telephone scams.
  <br>
  <br>
  This comes following reports of suspected scam text messages carrying the hashtag prefix, to trick victims into thinking that they were sent by the authority.
  <br>
  <br>
  In December 2023, the authority launched a short message service (SMS) sender registration scheme, in which companies and organizations participating send text messages under their registered IDs with the prefix “#”.
  <br>
  <br>
  “In order to tackle other telephone scams, we need to find out the reasons as well as the victimised group, so as to work with all stakeholders, in particular the telecommunications industry and also the OFCA,” Siu said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We set up a specific working group back in September 2022. We continue to hold regular meetings with them, in order to come up with different measures to tackle this sort of telephone scam,” he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Siu reminded residents to remain alert to potential scam messages, especially those with hyperlinks.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The construction industry should look into limiting the use of bamboo scaffolding if the situation calls for it, according to Siu Sin-man from the Association for the Rights of Industrial Accident Victims.
 <br>
  <br>
  A scaffolding collapse at a Kai Tak construction site last month injured 11 workers, sparking discussions about replacing bamboo altogether with metal scaffolding.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a radio programme on Saturday, Siu said the industry should explore the possibility to limit the use of bamboo and find the most suitable material for each construction site.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Bamboo is very special material and it's widely used in Hong Kong, but in other places, they don't use bamboo. That means there may be some shortcomings of this material," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think we need to do more research on why some Hong Kong construction companies like to use metal material instead of bamboo."
  <br>
  <br>
  The chairman of the Hong Kong Construction Industry Employees General Union, Chau Sze-kit, told the same programme that it is impossible to completely scrap the use of bamboo scaffold immediately.
  <br>
  <br>
  He suggested the industry should instead look into ways of implementing safety mechanisms when using either bamboo or metal scaffold.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee has told his Macau counterpart the two SARs are "as close as brothers" with solid economic and trade relations.
 <br>
  <br>
  He also said, during the exchange with Macau Chief Executive Sam Hou-fai on Friday, that the two cities could enjoy the fruits of economic development by taking part in the development of the Greater Bay Area.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Lee said that the two cities are as close as brothers, with frequent people-to-people and cultural exchanges, alongside solid economic and trade relations. He noted that the One Country, Two Systems principle is a good policy for maintaining the long-term prosperity and stability of Hong Kong and Macau," a government statement read.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He also noted that Hong Kong and Macau, both of which are core cities of the [Greater Bay Area], can achieve complementarity and participate in and promote the development of the [Greater Bay Area] together, benefiting the people of both cities with the fruits of economic development."
  <br>
  <br>
  It was Sam's first visit to Hong Kong since becoming Macau's leader.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a separate social media post, the chief executive expressed hope the two cities would cooperate further under the leadership of Sam to carry out the four expectations laid out by President Xi Jinping in Macau.
  <br>
  <br>
  In December last year, Xi directed Macau to diversify its economy, improve governance, build a high-level platform to enhance China's international connections, and safeguard social harmony and stability.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A senior Beijing official on Friday called on mainland enterprises to take part in the Northern Metropolis project as part of efforts to fully back the Hong Kong government.
 <br>
  <br>
  Zheng Yanxiong, director of the central government's liaison office, told a reception that state-owned companies should also support the SAR in integrating into the country's development.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I hope state-owned enterprises will make good use of Hong Kong's unique advantages of having the backing of the motherland and being connected to the rest of the world," Zheng said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Mainland companies should continue to boost their investment in Hong Kong, and constantly improve their business strategies. They should also proactively take part in the Northern Metropolis development, fully support Hong Kong in consolidating its status as a financial, shipping, and trade centre, and in building an international innovation and technology centre."
  <br>
  <br>
  Zheng also urged companies to take root in Hong Kong and contribute to society.
  <br>
  <br>
  At the same event, Chief Executive John Lee described contributions to the Northern Metropolis development as "an investment with good returns" as he called on mainland firms to support the project.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hetao Shenzhen-Hong Kong Science and Technology Innovation Co-operation Zone, located within the metropolis area, is an important platform for collaboration in the Greater Bay Area, Lee added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The government will be innovative and use creative thinking to combine market forces, to promote the development of the Northern Metropolis, including that of the co-operation zone, so as to allow the first batch of industries to enter the region as soon as possible," he said.

    Govt backs CUHK Medical Centre loan extension bid

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government has backed a request by CUHK Medical Centre to extend a loan repayment period, saying it doesn't want to end up having to take back the hospital's site due to a default.
 <br>
  <br>
  In 2023, legislators agreed to a two-year extension to repayments of a HK$4 billion government loan, in view of financial difficulties brought on by the pandemic.
  <br>
  <br>
  The medical centre is now seeking another extension, of three years, saying it expects to make losses in the current financial year as well as in the next one, and its cash balance is insufficient to cover the repayments at present.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a Legco panel meeting on Friday, some lawmakers expressed concern that by 2028, the Chinese University would still be struggling to pay off the loan.
  <br>
  <br>
  "What will the hospital do to tackle such a big funding gap? I'm sure no one wants the hospital to come back to Legco for another repayment extension after three years," said DAB lawmaker Chan Wing-kwong, with the party's Starry Lee echoing his concerns.
  <br>
  <br>
  The chairman of the university's council, John Chai, told legislators that the medical centre will cut costs and find ways to boost revenue, for example by introducing more in-patient beds.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There are a pocket of measures, including strengthening the business model through governance, through better management of the operations, looking into means of increasing avenues of revenue, looking into resource efficiency," Chai said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Health Secretary Lo Chung-mau said if Legco doesn't approve the new extension before the middle of next month, CUHK will have to start repaying a first instalment of over HK$550 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If the medical centre fails to repay the loan, it is clearly stipulated in the contract that there will be an additional interest rate of three percent per annum," Lo said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If it still fails to repay the loan in the worst case scenario, the government will take back the medical centre, including the site and all the buildings or structures. We don't want to see this situation."
  <br>
  <br>
  The extension request will be submitted to Legco's Finance Committee for further discussion.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Organisers of a pop-culture festival in the city on Friday said they were offering a refund to people who bought faulty priority tickets this week for the event next month.
 <br>
  <br>
  The mishap had to do with the popular K-pop girl group, NJZ, formerly known as New Jeans, who will be performing on March 23, the last day of the three-day festival.
  <br>
  <br>
  But fans were left disappointed when the tickets they bought through Cityline had the wrong date printed.
  <br>
  <br>
  ComplexCon Hong Kong said it was now refunding ticket holders who filed complaints with the Consumer Council, or made formal enquiries with ComplexCon or Cityline on or before Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "To apply for the refund, please send the valid ticket and the confirmation email from Cityline, using the e-mail account you used to purchase the tickets, to ticketing_support_0210@complexconhk.com by 5pm Hong Kong time on [Sunday]," it said in a statement posted on its website.
  <br>
  <br>
  Organisers said the refund would not include handling fees charged by Cityline, and they were working with the platform on more details as to when the payment would go through.
  <br>
  <br>
  ComplexCon Hong Kong said it reserves the right to have the final say if there are any objections and disputes over the refund arrangements.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier, the Consumer Council said it had received more than 50 complaints over the matter, involving some HK$220,000.

    'More schools should join free HPV jabs scheme'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lawmakers are calling for more secondary schools to get involved in the government's HPV vaccine catch-up programme, saying the current participation rate was not ideal.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Department of Health has purchased 180,000 HPV jabs for 52,000 female students to take two doses for free.
  <br>
  <br>
  But only 3,700 students were inoculated as 34 percent of schools have refused or have yet to sign up to the scheme that was rolled out last year, blaming manpower problems or scheduling issues.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dr David Lam from the medical sector said two doses of the HPV vaccine could offer lifelong protection.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The 9-valent HPV vaccine that we have right now can cover most of the viruses causing cervical cancer. It can prevent the infection caused by these viruses," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This means it has very wide coverage. Apart from this, it's also very safe. Medical evidence has shown that its effectiveness can reach 90 percent or more."
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted that side effects, such as headaches and nausea, are mild.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elizabeth Quat from the DAB urged the government to step up promotion of the vaccine, saying that many parents were unaware of the free programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  It costs at least HK$3,000 for two HPV jabs in the private sector, she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The number of cervical cancer cases in Hong Kong has surged by almost 30 percent in the past decade.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2022, the disease was the ninth deadliest cancer in the SAR.

    Tragedy prompts calls for database of at-risk families

<div class="itemFullText">
 The government should set up a database of at-risk elderly people, a lawmaker said on Friday, a day after a man in his 70s was found dead with his son unharmed beside him.
 <br>
  <br>
  Police were alerted on Thursday when security personnel detected a foul odour coming from a flat at Butterfly Estate in Tuen Mun.
  <br>
  <br>
  The force said officers discovered the body of the 78-year-old man.
  <br>
  <br>
  His 44-year-old son, who is reportedly mentally challenged, was next to the elder.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Friday, lawmaker Bill Tang said authorities should consolidate the data they have about the city's senior citizens, noting that government units like the Social Welfare Department and the Hospital Authority hold the majority of information about these individuals.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The government can and has to integrate such database and form a high-risk elderly and family database, and facilitate the different kinds of social service organisations and community organisations... to care [for] and reach such kind of high-risk families," Tang told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  One way to check up on such households would be to install sensors on devices around the flat, Tang said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the sensor would be triggered and send an alert if the home's gate, for example, has not been touched for 48 hours.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fellow legislator Stanley Li said the tragedy highlighted the need to shore up support for carers, adding the administration should offer more training for people to become caretakers.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Social Welfare Department expressed concern about the incident, saying it has arranged for social workers to contact the family and provide assistance.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is understood the family involved was not a case under the department.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's exhibition activities fully returned to pre-pandemic levels last year, with the number of visitors to the Convention and Exhibition Centre topping eight million, up 35 percent year-on-year, according to the centre's operator.
 <br>
  <br>
  Monica Lee-Müller, managing director at Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre (Management) Limited, said the centre hosted 812 events in 2024, including 100 international exhibitions and conferences.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said it will host more large-scale finance and technology-related events this year to assist with the SAR's fintech development.
  <br>
  <br>
  This includes Consensus Hong Kong 2025 on February 18-20, when more than 8,000 bitcoin, blockchain and Web3 professionals are expected to gather and discuss industry trends, before another conference in August specifically featuring bitcoins.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, the hospitality sector veteran said the centre has been rolling out more measures, such as setting up Muslim-friendly facilities, to cater to the demands of diverse international visitors, especially those from the Middle East and Asean members.
  <br>
  <br>
  One of the highlights of last year, she said, was the beauty event Cosmopack Asia 2024, when 74 percent of over 60,000 participants were from overseas, and the number of Middle East exhibitors rose 40 percent year-on-year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The number of visitors for consumption-related events also rose to a new record over the past 12 months, with sales during Pet Show 2025 last week exceeding HK$100 million, the highest among such events.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee-Müller said the centre will innovate and host a new event, International Food Tasting Festival 2025, in April to further boost consumption, adding that over 600 exhibitors have already signed up.

    Tougher jail terms introduced for space oil offences
   </title>

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong on Friday added four substances to its list of dangerous drugs, a move which significantly increases the maximum punishments for people caught consuming, possessing, trafficking or manufacturing space oil.
 <br>
  <br>
  Users and those found with the space oil drug now risk prison terms of up to seven years and a fine as high as HK$1 million, while manufacturers or traffickers of any of the substances involved – etomidate, metomidate, propoxate and isopropoxate – can be jailed for life and hit with HK$5 million in fines.
  <br>
  <br>
  Previously, the maximum prison term for space oil, under prescription drug regulations, was two years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Commissioner for Narcotics Kesson Lee said the tougher penalties will be a bigger deterrent.
  <br>
  <br>
  "By listing the substances as dangerous drugs, we give greater powers to law enforcement agencies," Lee said on an RTHK programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Officers can seize the proceeds of drug traffickers after applying to the courts. And if the traffickers had used young people for trafficking, we can also demand the court to pass heavier sentences."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Community Drug Advisory Council said the increased penalties are helpful, but they won't completely stop people from supplying or using space oil.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There will still be people taking risks for drug trafficking, and some will continue taking the drug," the council's executive director, David Ng, said on the same programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  "After all, space oil has been popular among young people for over two years in Hong Kong. Right now, we can say the drug has taken root here. Information on how to buy and consume it is all over many circles among youngsters."
  <br>
  <br>
  Ng called for different levels of intervention with young people, including new measures targeting those who smoke e-cigarettes, as these can be used to take the drug.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hope remains for the Hong Kong, China men's curling team, which is aiming to win the city's first ever medal at the Asian Winter Games, even after losing to South Korea in the semifinals on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The SAR squad of Jason Chang, Martin Yan, Cheng Ching-nam, Chung Cheuk-hei and Ma Chi-lap were outmatched early in Harbin.
  <br>
  <br>
  Unable to catch up, they lost 2-13 against the South Koreans.
  <br>
  <br>
  The result sent them into a bronze medal match on Friday morning against the national team, which lost 6-7 to the Philippines in the other semifinal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier, the SAR men's team beat Kazakhstan in the playoffs to win their spot in the final four.
  <br>
  <br>
  This is the first time that Hong Kong has sent a curling team to the Games, and the men's team has now become the sole hope for the SAR to secure a spot on the podium.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Panda lovers wishing to catch a glimpse of Ocean Park's new twin cubs can opt for a VIP session each day, with registration for the private visit opening on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The pair, the first pandas to be born in Hong Kong, will make their public debut on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ocean Park chairman Paulo Pong said the public could meet the twins from 10am to 3pm every day, with the facility expected to welcome up to 5,000 visitors daily.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said people could also choose to pay HK$1,500 each for a special, 30-minute visit before the park opens each day. The first visit will be on February 18.
  <br>
  <br>
  Each session will start at around 9.30am and can accommodate up to 40 people, Pong said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Ticket holders can get early admission and have a dedicated session to meet the pandas. Each visitor will have to pay 1,500 dollars. After deducting costs, the revenue will be used for the park's giant panda conservation work," Pong told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For the sake of animal welfare, there will not be any activities for people to interact with or hold the giant pandas."
  <br>
  <br>
  The pair of panda cubs might not appear at the same time to meet the public because they are still young, Pong added.

    Shenzhen Bay Port to close for cross-border marathon

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Shenzhen Bay Port will be closed from 2am to 11am on February 23rd for a cross-border marathon event.
 <br>
  <br>
  At most 100 runners, six from Hong Kong, will take part in the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Marathon, which doubles as a test event for the 15th National Games.
  <br>
  <br>
  The event later this month features a men's race and a women's race.
  <br>
  <br>
  The women’s race begins at 7am while the men’s race starts half an hour later.
  <br>
  <br>
  The athletes will run for two kilometres in Shenzhen before entering Hong Kong through the Shenzhen Bay Port.
  <br>
  <br>
  They will run along the Hong Kong-Shenzhen Western Corridor towards the south until they get to the turning point.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong section is about 21 kilometres in total.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ken Wong, the Transport Department's principal transport officer, urged passengers to use the MTR East Rail Line to travel to Shenzhen via Lo Wu and Lok Ma Chau on the day.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also urged motorists to steer clear of  border points while the race is on.
  <br>
  <br>
  “According to operating records on a typical Sunday, there will be about 26,000 passengers, two-bound, using Shenzhen Bay Port... and according to our records, there will be about 2,000 cross-boundary private cars using Shenzhen Bay Port on a typical Sunday,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  There will be no spectators for this event.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Because the Hong Kong session for this race will be mostly either on the highway or in the restricted area near the cross boundary control points, so for this time there will not be any public viewing area for the general spectators,” Yeung Tak-keung, the head of the National Games Coordination Office said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The race will be broadcast live on RTHK’s website.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeung added that customs clearance arrangements for the athletes will be similar to the cross-border cycling test event in November last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The athletes have to submit their information to the organising party. Once verified, there will be a facial recognition and the ID and passports will have to be vetted beforehand,” he said
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that  runners have to go through another round of inspection on the race day.

<img alt="The Hong Kong Public Opinion Research Institute makes the announcement on social media. Photo courtesy of the HKPORI" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1791461_1_20250213143116.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A polling body has announced it will suspend all self-funded research activities and surveys indefinitely and focus on existing commissioned studies.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, the Hong Kong Public Opinion Research Institute (HKPORI) also said it will change its business model or shut down.
  <br>
  <br>
  Its president and CEO Robert Chung said he welcomes interested parties to take over the institute.
  <br>
  <br>
  "HKPORI has always been law-abiding, but in the current environment, it has to pause its promotion of scientific polling. The research team hopes there will be another opportunity to resume its work," the statement read.
  <br>
  <br>
  "HKPORI is actively exploring all possible options, (and) it will announce its final decision when the time is right."
  <br>
  <br>
  Former HKPORI deputy executive director Chung Kim-wah is wanted by the police for alleged national security violations, and Robert Chung was earlier questioned by officers in their investigation into whether he or the institute had provided assistance to an absconder.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong, China Ice Hockey Association has filed a complaint to the International Ice Hockey Federation regarding the altercation involving the Turkmenistan team at the Asian Winter Games in Harbin.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chairman Sherman Chan made the remarks upon returning to Hong Kong with the men's team on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  A brawl broke out after the SAR defeated Turkmenistan in a match on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Three SAR players were injured.
  <br>
  <br>
  Team captain Tony Leung hopes the altercation will not affect people's impression of the sport.
  <br>
  <br>
  He told reporters at the airport that he appreciated the team's restraint in the altercation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Clashes are inevitable in ice hockey. This incident is very rare, especially as it happened during a post-match handshake," he said,
  <br>
  <br>
  "At the same time, there are rarely fights in international competitions, or even during the match. Therefore, this is an exceptional case."
  <br>
  <br>
  He expressed his gratitude to Chief Executive John Lee and Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism Rosanna Law for visiting the injured players after the scuffle.
  <br>
  <br>
  Coach Carey Durant said the team dealt with the adversity very well.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the team's performance in Harbin would be used for what he called, "a measuring stick” to roll out development plans for the association, as well as the sport itself.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There were a lot of tears when we lost those games. And that's a good thing because that means our players expected to go all the way to try and win a gold medal," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are going to get there. I promise Hong Kong that we will get there one day. It’s just a process that we take and we take this very seriously in representing Hong Kong."
  <br>
  <br>
  The team wrapped up their journey at the Games by losing to top-seeded Kazakhstan in the quarter-finals.

 An increase in tram fares would enable the operator to put wages up to find and keep hold of talent, a union chief said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong Tramways is hoping to get the go-ahead to increase adult fares from HK$3 to HK$3.30, child fares from HK$1.50 to HK$1.60 and fares for the over 65s from HK$1.30 to HK$1.50.
  <br>
  <br>
  The company says passenger figures are still about 15 percent down on 2018, before the protests and Covid pandemic.
  <br>
  <br>
  The chairman of the Hong Kong Tramway Workers Union, Yeh Yung-sheng, said fare increases would help the company attract new workers, some of whom would need to learn specialist skills.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The whole of the tram's chassis is made by hand. It's not built from parts that are bought from the market... So we need to pass on such techniques," he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You cannot just find any workers who can do such work, and it takes time for us to train such workers. [So] if the pay is not good enough, then they might feel that they do not want to learn such techniques."
  <br>
  <br>
  But speaking on the same RTHK programme, lawmaker Chan Hok-fung, who is a member of Legco's transport panel, said Hong Kong Tramways will lose even more passengers if fares go up.
  <br>
  <br>
  "At present, with the existing prices, trams do not have the so-called competitive advantage. And if you raise the fares further, the gap between the fares of trams and those of buses will be further narrowed, and then even more passenger traffic will be lost," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The advantage of trams in the past was not their speed, but their prices, because it was cost-effective, but if they do not even have that advantage, their original passengers will be lost."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said the company could instead take steps to boost passenger numbers, for example by introducing Pokémon or panda-themed trams.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong Tramways says the proposed fare increases would mainly be spent on renovating its fleet and expanding non-ticket revenue projects.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A taxi drivers' union says members will go on strike for at least five days from March 5 unless the authorities take immediate action against illegal ride-hailing services.
 <br>
  <br>
  Wong Yu-ting, chairman of the Hong Kong Tele-call Taxi Association, told Commercial Radio that they have been left with no choice but to take action.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The government has stated that using private cars for the carriage of passengers for reward is illegal, ride-hailing services are illegal, and not having insurance is illegal, everything is illegal," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But they allow [ride-hailing service] platforms to exist, and indulge them."
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong said the industry has been discussing the issue with the government for 11 years.
  <br>
  <br>
  In an earlier response to news of a possible strike, the government said it wrote to the companies involved reminding them of legislation which bans drivers from taking passengers for money unless they have a permit.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Transport Department said a working group under the Transport Advisory Committee that is looking at regulating ride-hailing platforms has a meeting arranged with operators and the taxi industry on February 19.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials urged the taxi industry to stay calm, be rational and put the public interest first.

Professor William Wong says their agreement is the first step of collaboration towards the goal of developing an open and ethical AI.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A transparent and innovative environment is essential to the development of artificial development, according to a systems engineering professor, although the industry also needs to be properly regulated to prevent the technology from being misused.
 <br>
  <br>
  William Wong, the director of Chinese University's Centre for Innovation and Technology and a lawmaker, also described as a "surprise" the snub by the United States and the United Kingdom to an international AI declaration at the end of a summit in Paris.
  <br>
  <br>
  The document, endorsed by dozens of nations including China, India and hosts France, pledges an open, inclusive and ethical approach to AI development.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on
  <a href="https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/news-programmes/this-episode.htm?cmsid=77" target="_blank">
   <u>
    <b>
     RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme
    </b>
   </u>
  </a>
  , Wong said it is common for industry representatives to come together and discuss the path forward for AI.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have been doing that in all universities, not to mention nations, because we understand that artificial intelligence, when you want to apply it, it's high risk because you... leave everything to a machine," he explained.
  <br>
  <br>
  "What happens if it misbehaves?"
  <br>
  <br>
  He added the agreement is just the first step of collaboration towards the goal of developing open, transparent, trustworthy and ethical AI technologies.
  <br>
  <br>
  'What they have to do is to share more information, and then they would come to a consensus and write out guidelines. When you look at what is happening now, for example even in America, the UK, and France and China, their governments have also issued guidelines in the ethical part of AI."
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked if DeepSeek, the Chinese language model developed by a Hangzhou-based startup, could face stiff competition, Wong said that's not necessarily a bad thing.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You call it competition from the business side. But also you should look... (from the perspective of) the advancement of sciences as well," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You have to compare with each other; you compete with each other. And then it comes with more advanced technology. You should look at the positive side of it."

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong, China Ice Hockey Association on Wednesday said the men's team put in a great performance at the Asian Winter Games in Harbin.
 <br>
  <br>
  The team wrapped up their journey on Tuesday after losing to top-seeded Kazakhstan 24-0 in the quarter-finals.
  <br>
  <br>
  The association's chairman, Sherman Chan, said at least half of the Kazakhstan team are professional players, while many SAR players are either students or have full-time jobs.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said Hong Kong's performance wasn't affected by a post-match altercation with Turkmenistan opponents on Sunday that left three of the SAR players injured.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This game [against Kazakhstan] definitely showcased the team has been very disciplined as well as in terms of their quality, mental-wise, they are well prepared for any kind of challenge," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think obviously after the incident, a few of the players were upset. But... they mentally recovered very well and we all have this common goal to focus on the Games."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said he has high expectations for Hong Kong when it comes to the World Championships in Mexico in April.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Three members of the same family have died in Yuen Long in what police say is a suspected murder-suicide case.
 <br>
  <br>
  A man, 93, and his son, 69, were found with multiple stab wounds inside a flat in Chun Hing New Village after police were called at around 8pm on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  A 19-year-old man, who was the grandson and son of the deceased, visited the flat before later falling to his death from Yuet Ping House at Long Ping Estate, officers said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The deceased inside the flat had a lot of injuries, and they also bled a lot, so it was difficult to conduct forensic inspections at the scene because it required a lot of cleaning work to determine the cause of death and even the number of injuries," Assistant District Commander Johnathan Kwan told the media.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The direction of our investigation includes the background of the three deceased, their family relationships, and whether they were involved in any disputes or property disputes."

    Team removed over Greater Bay Airlines cancellations

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Greater Bay Airlines on Wednesday said it had removed a team of commercial and planning managers, which oversaw the allocation of aircraft resources, due to the recent flight cancellations by the carrier.
 <br>
  <br>
  In the airline's report to the Civil Aviation Department, it said a lack of internal communication and insufficient customer service support exacerbated the carrier's scheduling failures.
  <br>
  <br>
  Around 5,500 passengers were believed to have been affected by the cancellation of 128 flights in February and March.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to details released on Wednesday, four of the cancellations were by a charterer which put on extra flights following the deadly plane crash in South Korea's Muan International Airport in December.
  <br>
  <br>
  The airline also assured the move had "no impact on the safety" of its operations.
  <br>
  <br>
  The report said the new team – comprising experienced personnel as part of a reform – had failed to observe the company's protocol for cancellation decision making, and also "took excessive time to make decisions" and "communicated the decision poorly".
  <br>
  <br>
  It noted the team did not consider the airline's customer service response capability, which did not have sufficient resources to handle "such a significant number of customer interactions at one time".
  <br>
  <br>
  "[The airline] remains committed to assuring a reliable service to our passengers. The new team concerned has been removed from the company," the report said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Also in the report, the airline put forward a number of measures such as strengthening internal procedures for flight scheduling, boosting communication, and ensuring fleet and manpower stability and reliability.
  <br>
  <br>
  Transport minister Mable Chan expressed hope Greater Bay Airlines had learned a lesson, adding it has to regularly report on its operations to the authorities.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[The Air Transport Licensing Authority] has asked the airline to submit regular reports on a monthly basis. If the airline is planning to cancel flights in future, it will have to provide a written report to the authority and list out the facts and information of the arrangements," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The airline initially cited a delay in new aircraft delivery and the need for plane inspections for the cancellation, but the report later revealed "a lack of internal communication and a lack of co-operation from customer service operations" as a contributing factor.
  <br>
  <br>
  "From the time when [the airline] shared information at the time of the incident, to now when there's been a detailed report outlining what happened, I believe this is a process," Chan said when asked if the carrier had given an inaccurate explanation at first.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister stressed the administration would consider an airline's operations and performance when making arrangements on flight allocations and air traffic rights.
  <br>
  <br>
  In response, the low-cost carrier again apologised to affected passengers and said it had put in place a number of measures to prevent similar incidents from happening again.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will maintain close contact with the Transport and Logistics Bureau regarding the company's operations, and continue to strive to provide safe and reliable services to our customers," the airline said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 National sporting events staged in Hong Kong later this year are expected to draw more than 100,000 spectators, the government said on Wednesday, as the SAR is set to co-host the National Games with Guangdong and Macau for the first time.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Games, the nation's highest-level multi-sports event, will be held from November 9 to 21.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong will host track cycling, fencing, rugby sevens, beach volleyball, golf, triathlon, men's handball and men's under-22 basketball. Bowling will also be held as a mass participation event.
  <br>
  <br>
  In addition to the National Games, the city will also host several events as part of the 12th National Games for Persons with Disabilities and the 9th National Special Olympic Games in December.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rosanna Law, the secretary for culture, sports and tourism, said officials are working on competition schedules with Guangdong and Macau counterparts.
  <br>

  "Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Macau are discussing the ticketing plans and sales arrangements... The three places will adopt the same sales platform," she said in a written reply to the Legislative Council.
  <br>
  <br>
  There will be about 1,800 athletes taking part in the eight National Games events held in the SAR, with 700 others participating in the December competitions, Law said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is estimated that the events in Hong Kong will attract more than 100,000 spectators from Hong Kong, the mainland and other regions," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[The bureau] is, in collaboration with the relevant departments... conducting a detailed assessment on the traffic and transport arrangements to and from the venues having regard to the transport facilities and capacity of the venues, their past experiences in staging competitions, and the number of participating athletes and spectators for each event."

 A suspected E. coli outbreak at Princess Margaret Hospital that is thought to have claimed the life of a doctor and sickened two others could have spread in a washroom, a microbiologist said on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong University's Yuen Kwok-yung told RTHK that this is because the bacteria survive longer in humid conditions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Because they would use the same toilet in their department and that of course could be a place of transmission," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "After using the toilet it would be humid, therefore it is possible that the virus was spread there."
  <br>
  <br>
  Yuen added, however, that since the washroom in question would have been sanitised before samples were taken, the likelihood of finding E.coli there is slim.
  <br>
  <br>
  Three oncologists at the hospital are thought to have caught E. coli. While one died last Friday, the other two only had mild symptoms.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yuen said the deceased oncologist was young and was not known to have been suffering from chronic illnesses, so work was still ongoing to find out why the doctor may have succumbed to such an infection.

    'SAR working to make renminbi trading more convenient'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Christopher Hui, says the administration is working to make renminbi trading more convenient in the SAR.
 <br>
  <br>
  In last year’s Policy Address, the chief executive stated the government wants to promote the global use of renminbi and solidify the city's position as an offshore renminbi business hub.
  <br>
  <br>
  Currently, 24 securities listed on the Hong Kong stock exchange have adopted the dual-counter model, meaning they can be traded in either the Hong Kong dollar or renminbi.
  <br>
  <br>
  On RTHK's Overview Policy programme, Hui noted the next step is to make the model accessible to investors in the Greater Bay Area.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I feel that one very obvious trend after the pandemic is that, even though globalisation has been somewhat affected, regionalisation is very practical and is happening," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Trade between different countries in Asia has increased. When trade increases, there's really no need to use other currencies. I can use a currency that everyone is using."
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister also mentioned that the government is trying out different scenarios to expand the use of digital renminbi.
  <br>
  <br>
  "On one hand, of course, if mainland residents come to Hong Kong, how does our system here accommodate them? If they want to use the digital renminbi, they can do so," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "On the other hand, if I want to use the digital renminbi on the mainland, how do I do that? These are the two areas we are working on."
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister added Hong Kong needs to strengthen its role as a financial services hub, saying this is what makes the city appealing to investors.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A motorcyclist has been hospitalised in a traffic accident also involving a truck on Lung Cheung Road on Wednesday morning.
 <br>
  <br>
  Police received a report at 6:27am about a collision near Tai Po Road.
  <br>
  <br>
  The truck driver allegedly lost control and mounted a slope, causing the vehicle to flip to its side and fall onto the motorcyclist.
  <br>
  <br>
  The motorcyclist was eventually freed by firefighters and rushed to Queen Elizabeth Hospital with leg injuries.
  <br>
  <br>
  The truck driver has since been arrested on suspicion of dangerous driving causing grievous bodily harm.
  <br>
  <br>
  At least one eastbound lane of the major thoroughfare had to be sealed off, creating a tailback which stretched several kilometres to Kwai Chung at one point.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another accident in the opposite direction on Lung Cheung Road, near So Uk Estate, at around 8am saw Tsuen Wan-bound traffic pushed back all the way to Diamond Hill.
