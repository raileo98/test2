<div class="itemFullText">
 The 31st edition of the Apec Economic Leaders’ Week has wrapped up with host nation Peru saying it has furthered three objectives, including fostering inclusive and sustainable economic growth.
 <br>
  <br>
  The leaders also issued a joint declaration, calling for a concerted effort in tackling issues such as climate change.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to local and international press at the end of the week-long Apec meeting, Peruvian President Dina Boluarte said she was honoured to have hosted the leaders of the bloc’s 20 other economies.
  <br>
  <br>
  She also praised the professional work of her colleagues for the past year, saying it has reaped immense rewards.
  <br>
  <br>
  Those included the signing of a free trade agreement with Hong Kong, and updating the existing one with China, its biggest trading partner.
  <br>
  <br>
  Boluarte also reiterated three thematic priorities - trade and investment for inclusive and interconnected growth; innovation and digitalisation to promote transition to a formal economy; and sustainable growth for resilient development.
  <br>
  <br>
  Just before making her concluding remarks, the Peruvian leader and her counterparts got together one final time for the family photo, a longstanding tradition for the Apec summit.
  <br>
  <br>
  The session offers a chance for the host nation to showcase their traditional attire, but Peru decided to use the occasion to promote their textile products made of alpaca fibre.
  <br>
  <br>
  Each leader was given a vicuna wool scarf from a local luxury brand. The price tag? US$1,415.
  <br>
  <br>
  A few hours after the summit concluded, the customary Leaders’ Declaration was released.
  <br>
  <br>
  The goals were similar to those in past years, including tackling climate change, reforming the World Trade Organisation, and achieving food and energy security.

 The Hong Kong Observatory says it will issue a T1 between 6am and 9am on Monday as Tropical Cyclone Man-yi moves towards the territory.
 <br>
  <br>
  The storm is forecast to come within 800 kilometres of the city around midnight tonight, but is expected to weaken.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, windy conditions are likely by Tuesday, the observatory said, warning that some low-lying areas may see flooding.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There will be a spring tide in the next couple of days. The sea level will be particularly high during the high tide overnight. Under the combined effect of the northeast monsoon and Man-yi, the sea level will generally be about a further 0.3 metres above the spring tide at night on Monday and Tuesday. Minor flooding may occur in individual low-lying areas. Members of the public please take appropriate precautions," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The observatory added that depending on the storm's intensity and distance from the city, it may issue a higher warning signal on Monday night or early Tuesday.

    'Carer hotline should have emergency response team'

<img alt="SoCo urges the government to set up a team offering emergency services under its 24-hour hotline for carers. Photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1779566_1_20241117152725.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A hotline offering assistance to caregivers is failing to address the urgent needs of some callers and a special team is needed to provide emergency support, a community group says.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 182 183 hotline launched last year is staffed 24 hours a day and the government says it offers strong support to callers with a range of enquiries, including those who want counselling or details of community services.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the Society for Community Organisation (SoCo) on Sunday said a joint study with Lingnan University's Asia-Pacific Institute of Ageing Studies (APIAS) has shed light on the difficult situation many carers find themselves in.
  <br>
  <br>
  A survey carried out between March and June this year found that on average, those being looked after suffered from two chronic illnesses – as did the carers themselves.
  <br>
  <br>
  Professor Dickson Chan, the director of APIAS, said the hotline isn't enough to address the needs of some carers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They [hotline staff] may give them another phone number and ask them to call another organisation. This means that actually they cannot receive concrete and immediate support through the hotline," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our proposal is maybe the government can consider setting up a special team and the special team is attached to the hotline. So when the older people are in urgent need... the hotline can maybe pass the needs to a special team and after a brief assessment, the team can offer immediate support services for the older people."
  <br>
  <br>
  SoCo meanwhile called for the government to relax eligibility requirements so more people can get financial support under the Scheme on Living Allowance for Carers of Elderly Persons from Low-income Families.

    Electricians, plumbers on new workers priority list

<img alt="Chris Sun said there will be job restrictions linked to visas for imported workers. File photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1779560_1_20241117141556.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Plumbers, electricians and specialised construction workers will be among those first invited to Hong Kong under the SAR's next scheme to bring in employees from elsewhere, the government said on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Officials say Hong Kong faces a shortfall of around 180,000 workers by 2028, but plans are already afoot to bring in 30,000 skilled technicians over three years under a new scheme starting in 2025.
  <br>
  <br>
  Labour Secretary Chris Sun told TVB that the administration will first focus on finding new blood for sectors facing the worst manpower crunches.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said their visas will tie them to the occupation they are in when they first move to the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There will surely be special arrangements for these visas, meaning that before they become Hongkongers, they will be required to stay in the job where we had a shortage. This is very clear," the minister said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But after seven years when they obtain permanent residency, you can't have so many requirements. We surely cannot lock workers down to a particular job forever."
  <br>
  <br>
  The labour chief said he believes the workers concerned will mostly choose to stay in their profession after becoming a permanent resident.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also stressed that the government remains committed to encouraging locals into work, adding that subsidies for those re-joining the workforce will remain in place.

    Thousands join 10km races on airport's third runway

<div class="itemFullText">
 Some 12,000 people on Sunday took part in special races on the airport's third runway to celebrate its opening later this month.
 <br>
  <br>
  The other two runways at Chek Lap Kok remained in use as the 10-kilometre events took place, with Hong Kong long-distance runner Virginia Lo among those on the tarmac as planes went up and down nearby.
  <br>
  <br>
  The elite athlete sponsored by the Sports Institute was the first to the finish line among local runners and she said the time was her personal best.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's quite extraordinary. Because when I was running, there was really an aeroplane next to me. Of course it wasn't very close, but when you run, when you see a plane nearby you feel very excited," Lo said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I don't think the weather affected the race much. Luckily the sun wasn't shining, this is good for runners. Also when we started, the rain had stopped. So I find the weather quite acceptable."
  <br>
  <br>
  World-renowned actor Chow Yun-fat also took part in one of the races, and he was happy with the experience.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's very....very special. You can see planes on both sides, taking off and landing, taking off and landing," he told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I was concerned I couldn't run. If it was raining heavily, I wouldn't have taken part. But when I arrived, it stopped. And when we were actually running, the wind was quite good."

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan said on Sunday that a cross-border investment programme linking Shanghai, Shenzhen and Hong Kong has boosted the SAR's attractiveness in global markets.
 <br>
  <br>
  Writing on his weekly blog, Chan said the number of eligible stocks now stands at more than 3,300 – up from about 800 when Stock Connect was launched 10 years ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said daily transactions by mainland investors buying local stocks average about HK$38 billion, or almost 17 percent of total turnover.
  <br>
  <br>
  For overseas investors buying and selling mainland stocks through Hong Kong, the average daily amount is 123 billion renminbi, or 6.7 percent of turnover.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the local stock market has a total market value of HK$35 trillion, which is a 40 percent increase from 10 years ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Chan said the government is fostering links with the Global South and aims to attract high quality companies to list in the city and roll out cross-border investment products.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said this will allow Hong Kong to better make use of its function as a testing ground for the internationalisation of the renminbi.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that the third Global Financial Leaders' Investment Summit to be held this week will involve a few hundred senior members of staff from international financial institutions, and will allow participants to get an accurate understanding of the mainland's economic development and the financial opportunities it offers.

 Authorities were searching for a man who fell into the sea in waters south of Lamma on Sunday morning after his fishing boat was involved in a collision with an oil tanker.
 <br>
  <br>
  Police said the crash took place after 5am and initial enquiries showed the man in his 80s, who owns the boat, fell into the sea with six crew members.

  <br>
  The boat sank but all the crew members were rescued.
  <br>
  <br>
  They suffered scratches to their limbs and were conscious when taken to Queen Mary Hospital.

 Chief Executive John Lee says Hong Kong's new free trade agreement with Peru will take effect in about six months or so, as he urged SAR businesses to “understand and appreciate” the pact and join the government’s efforts to explore opportunities in emerging markets.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to the media at the conclusion of his trip to Lima, Lee said that as well as attending the Apec summit, the Hong Kong delegation achieved three key results, the first of which was demonstrating the city’s commitment to promoting regional economic and trade cooperation.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Second, we explored new growth areas for Hong Kong and explored market opportunities in South America,” he continued, citing the pact with Peru.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the agreement will open new doors for businesses, adding that he is confident Hong Kong people can get around the language barrier.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Hong Kong people have been doing business with different parts of the world, including the Middle East, including countries such as Korea and Japan. So obviously, language is an issue, but it's not a barrier,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I believe in the businessmen’s versatility and adaptability.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee said the government will lead promotional efforts so that the city’s businesses can better understand the Peruvian market.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another way to fast-track exchanges between the two sides, Lee said, is to establish chambers of commerce and he has already made this pitch to Peruvian officials.
  <br>
  <br>
  The third and final achievement in Lima, the chief executive went on to say, was enhancing relations with members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean).
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted that he held bilateral meetings with leaders of Malaysia, Vietnam and Singapore, and said there are plans to increase direct flights between Hong Kong and several Asean destinations.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CE had two informal exchanges in Lima with Xi Jinping and Lee expressed gratitude to the president for his "care and guidance"
  <br>
  <br>
  “President Xi has always been caring about Hong Kong. I have reported to him Hong Kong's situation regarding the economy and development. He is well-versed of our development and has given me encouragement,” Lee said.

    Kai Tak hosts rugby match as dummy run for new venue

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Kai Tak Sports Park on Saturday hosted an international rugby match in gloomy weather as another trial event to test the site's smaller outdoor venue, with more signage and faster security checks.
 <br>
  <br>
  The match between Hong Kong and Brazil kicked off at around 4 pm at the Kai Tak Youth Sports Ground.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was the second test event at the 5,000-seat venue, which hosted a local football league game last month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Around 2,500 people turned up to the sports ground in the end, according to the government, fewer than the previous estimate of 3,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  The rugby match, which ended in pouring rain, saw the SAR team claim a 38-17 victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials including sports minister Kevin Yeung and security chief Chris Tang were spotted at the stadium, with the latter saying authorities have made improvements since the previous trial event.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have doubled the number of security screening counters, and set up fast lanes for those who did not bring any bags," Tang told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeung said after the match that the event went more smoothly than the first trial, and that the government would continue to put the sports ground to the test.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will continue to hold a series of trial events and drills until the venue's official opening in the first quarter of next year... Next Saturday, we will conduct a stress test with 5,000 people," Yeung said, adding that more details would be unveiled in the coming week.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chris Brooke, chairman of Hong Kong, China Rugby, hailed the test run's success.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's been a great opportunity for our team to come to operate an event here, in advance of the Hong Kong Sevens next March. As we build up towards the Sevens, it's been a great experience and a very good opportunity for our rugby community to come to the venue to experience the Kai Tak Sports Park, and to see what a great venue it is," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Spectators must purchase their tickets online prior to the event, and they were not allowed to bring in long umbrellas or any food and drink.
  <br>
  <br>
  But a spectator surnamed Mak said the rule was too strict.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A drawback is that we are not allowed to bring our water bottles into the venue. I wish they could be more lenient and let us bring our own water," she told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  For rugby-lover Derek, the cloudy weather posed a bit of a problem.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's quite convenient to get from the MTR station to the venue, but it's troublesome to have to carry an umbrella on rainy days," he said. "I would suggest adding some covers for walkways... My feet were completely soaked."
  <br>
  <br>
  The sports park's indoor stadium is to host a basketball match on December 7, while the first trial run at the main stadium is scheduled for January next year.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee had his most hectic day yet in his week-long visit of Peru, signing a free trade agreement with the nation and meeting with the leaders of Malaysia, Vietnam and Singapore on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) summit.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lee also attended an informal dialogue on Friday, Lima time, briefing regional leaders on the SAR’s strengths as well as its role in China’s Belt and Road initiative and Apec development.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong leader then met Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim for the first time since July last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  He thanked Anwar for supporting the SAR’s plan to establish an Economic and Trade Office in Kuala Lumpur, the fourth in the region known as the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or Asean.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee also congratulated Malaysia for taking the chairmanship of Asean next year, and hoped the nation will continue to support Hong Kong's early accession to the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, or Rcep.
  <br>
  <br>
  After attending another Apec dialogue where he exchanged views Chilean President Gabriel Boric, Lee had two more bilateral meeting with Vietnamese President Luong Cuong and Singaporean Prime Minister Lawrence Wong.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both countries are key trading partners of Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SAR leader’s day culminated in the signing of the FTA between Hong Kong and Peru, and he got to relax by watching cultural performances at an Apec gala dinner.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Saturday, Lima time, Lee will attend the Apec Economic Leaders' meeting retreat and meet with Peruvian business sector representatives.

    '20 used fake DSE certs to apply for Macau university'

<div class="itemFullText">
 Education minister Christine Choi on Saturday said the authorities have stepped up screening after 20 people used forged DSE certificates to apply for the Macau University of Science and Technology.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a radio programme, she said the university suspected that the documents were bogus and had contacted the Hong Kong Examinations and Assessment Authority (HKEAA).
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is outrageous. There were 20 fake DSE certificates. For anyone who has doubts about the DSE results, we can help. The HKEAA keeps a record of the DSE results and can help verify them," Choi said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister said the authorities have reported the cases to the police.
  <br>
  <br>
  Choi added that some people had used fake academic qualifications to gain admission to universities in Hong Kong, but she said applications are now being checked more closely.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, she said a task group on setting up the SAR's third medical school will hold its second meeting later this month.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Based on the expected requirements, the universities which are interested can make changes to their proposals and examine their own qualifications... So this is not a race to see who hands in their proposals fastest," she said.

    HK port will outshine its neighbours: minister

 Transport Secretary Lam Sai-hung said on Saturday that he's confident that the shipping industry will prefer Hong Kong's bunkering facilities to those of nearby cities.
 <br>
  <br>
  He was speaking a day after the authorities unveiled plans to develop the SAR into a high-quality green maritime fuel bunkering centre.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government on Friday announced an action plan on green maritime fuel bunkering, including an aim to switch 55 percent of diesel-fuelled vessels to green maritime fuels by 2026.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on an RTHK radio programme, Lam said the demand for green maritime fuel will gradually increase in line with the target of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, and he expects Hong Kong to outperform.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In terms of traditional fuels, Hong Kong ranked seventh among global fuel bunkering ports. The other two in the GBA were not within the top ten, so we have an advantage," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Green maritime fuel bunkering is like adding a new type of fuel to a gas station, and green maritime fuel will be more widely used as vessels have to reduce their carbon footprint... This will boost business at our port."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lam said the government will look into using 11 hectares of land in Tsing Yi to store green methanol.
  <br>
  <br>
  The director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, Xia Baolong, met Hong Kong government officials together with SAR representatives of the business sector in Shenzhen last week.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister said Xia had urged Hong Kong to develop its ports in land, air and sea, and the authorities would consider tax reduction measures to attract more maritime service enterprises to expand their business in the city, strengthening the SAR's status as an international maritime hub.

 The free-trade agreement between Hong Kong and Peru will put the SAR in the global spotlight and fast-track regional trade, according to the city’s delegate to a key working group of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, or Apec.
 <br>
  <br>
  Peruvian exporters and shippers also welcomed the pact and expressed interest in expanding their businesses in Hong Kong, citing the city’s strategic location in Asia and connections with the mainland.
  <br>
  <br>
  Marjorie Yang, a Hong Kong, China, representative on the Apec Business Advisory Council, said one of the biggest features of a free-trade agreement is lowering, or abolishing, tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  But that wasn’t the case here.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Right now, this trade agreement eliminates tariffs on the Peruvian side, but Hong Kong doesn't have any tariffs to eliminate. So Peruvian business have always been welcome to come and do business in Hong Kong,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yang, who's also the head of Esquel Group, one of the world's biggest textile and apparel manufacturers, explained what the Hong Kong-Peruvian FTA is really about.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Bilateral agreements are always good because if you can't get (something) like CPTPP (Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership) going, you can get bilateral agreements and gradually push.”
  <br>
  <br>
  “So this agreement … the terms are such that if there are better terms reached in other bilaterals, we would also benefit.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Edgar Vasquez, a former minister of foreign trade and tourism in Peru, stressed that free trade deals have many facets.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The main focus of the free trade agreement is to have the possibility to cooperate with each other in many other aspects with regards to goods, because we have sanitary and phytosanitary measures, technical barriers to trade, intellectual property,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Now representing the Peruvian Association of Exporters, Vasquez believes the agreement boosts exposure of Hong Kong in Peru and vice versa.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I’m sure that with the free trade agreement, as with our experience with the United States, our exports exploded. With China also, our exports increased a lot. We signed with Thailand, with Australia, our exports are growing.”
  <br>
  <br>
  For Liverita, a Peruvian freight forwarder and consultancy firm, Hong Kong was already on its radar years ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  It set up an office in the SAR in 2020 and followed up with another outlet in Shanghai later that year.
  <br>
  <br>
  General manager Carolina Hurtado said she was extremely grateful for the assistance from InvestHK, the SAR government arm tasked to lure direct foreign Investment.
  <br>
  <br>
  “[That’s] because you really don't have an idea of how many ports or how many locals or chamber of commerce I have visited and asked for information. I mean, what do I need? What info, what documents, what is the process, how much I need to invest?” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We are pretty (good) friends right now with them (InvestHK).”
  <br>
  <br>
  Hurtado added that Hong Kong’s advanced infrastructure and robust financial sector makes it an ideal destination for investors.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I know that the financial companies in Hong Kong are pretty big, more than 100 banks, right? In Peru we don't have more than 20. They don't have a lot of bank investors or bank information for international products.”
  <br>
  <br>
  “But I know Hong Kong (has) got that.”

    HK-Peru FTA to boost more than 150 sectors

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong has signed a free trade agreement with Peru, concluding two years of negotiations with the South American nation.
 <br>
  <br>
  While Chief Executive John Lee and Peruvian President Dina Boluarte looked on, Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development Algernon Yau and his Peruvian counterpart, Ursula Desliu Leon, inked the much-anticipated deal.
  <br>
  <br>
  The FTA will take effect after both sides have completed their respective internal procedures.
  <br>
  <br>
  This represents Hong Kong’s ninth free-trade agreement, and the 21st economy that the SAR has struck a pact with.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to the SAR government, over 150 services sectors will benefit from commitments made by Peru.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some examples include professional, transport, financial, recreational and cultural services.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee had earlier pledged to provide a transparent and favourable platform for Hong Kong investors wishing to set up shop in Peru.
  <br>
  <br>
  Peru is Hong Kong’s fifth largest trading partner in Latin America with bilateral trade reaching HK$5.2 billion last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Peruvian exports to Hong Kong accounted for only one third of that total, and producers here are keen to bump up shipments of popular products such as fruits and vegetables, as well as fish meal.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The government announced on Friday that it has revised its full-year economic growth forecast to 2.5 percent, compared with the previous estimated range of 2.5 to 3.5 percent.
 <br>
  <br>
  Real GDP in the third quarter grew by 1.8 percent year-on-year, slower than the 3.2 percent growth in the previous quarter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Government economist Adolph Leung said at a press conference that economic growth has been hindered by challenges in the external environment.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Increased global economic uncertainties and escalation of trade conflicts would affect the performance of our goods exports," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Leung expressed confidence that the economy will pick up steam, thanks to measures announced by the central and SAR governments to boost market sentiment.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For the outlook, while the external environment has turned more challenging recently, the Hong Kong economy is expected to maintain its growth momentum for the remainder of the year," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked about US President-elect Donald Trump's plan to slap up to 60 percent of tariffs on goods imported from China, Leung said that will have a "detrimental impact".
  <br>
  <br>
  "It will affect China's exports to the US and also Hong Kong's exports of mainland origin to the US. And I think more than that is that coming along with this kind of trade and economic policy in the US, it will also affect the interest rates outlook."

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Authorities on Friday announced an action plan on green maritime fuel bunkering, which aims to reduce carbon emissions from the cargo industry and expand the use of green maritime fuels among government fleets and ships registered in the city.
 <br>
  <br>
  The government wants to switch 55 percent of the diesel-fuelled vessels to green maritime fuels by 2026, and cut carbon emissions at the Kwai Tsing Container Terminals by 30 percent in 2030 compared with 2021.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a press conference, transport minister Lam Sai-hung said Hong Kong is currently ranked seventh as a global bunkering hub, offering strategic advantages for international ships.
  <br>
  <br>
  "At the present moment, we do not have any forecast on the economic benefits. But one of the side benefits of attracting ships to use our bunkering services is that... there will be opportunities for them to use our cargo handling," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There are also opportunities for them to use the Hong Kong maritime services. So this would be added values for Hong Kong to ensure that we maintain [our role] as the international maritime centre."
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked about difficulties in transitioning to green fuels, Director of Marine Wong Sai-fat said existing engines are tailor-made for specific fuel types and can't easily switch to alternatives like LNG or methanol.
  <br>
  <br>
  "By large, the government vessels are using the diesel engine and the petrol engine. For the use of the petrol engine, it's using the petroleum, and that is not easy or straightforward that you can use other alternative fuel to replace the petrol engine," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Wong added that diesel engines are more adaptable and can mix with biofuel, which is already being used in several government vessels.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government also said it will provide training to nurture talent in the field of green maritime fuel, with 50 people expected to be trained by 2026.

    Legco passes motion of thanks for Policy Address

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lawmakers on Friday passed a motion of thanks for Chief Executive John Lee's Policy Address this year.
 <br>
  <br>
  In the third and final day of the discussion at Legco, retail sector lawmaker Peter Shiu brought up the need to transform the local economy as mentioned by the CE.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shiu said his sector – amid recent struggles – faces similar challenges.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Now there's a shift in the consumption pattern of these mainland visitors. E-commerce is all the rage these days, and local residents are glad to head north for dining and shopping," Shiu, who also chairs the Liberal Party, said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That's why I said, let's recognise the new situation, let's use technology so that our goods are sold not just locally... let's use the online platform and promote our products elsewhere."
  <br>
  <br>
  Shiu also called on entrepreneurs to take a major part in the development of the Northern Metropolis, saying they should be confident about the country and the SAR and that the project would produce great returns.
  <br>
  <br>
  Election Committee sector lawmaker Doreen Kong, for her part, noted that some tenants living in sub-divided units (SDUs) said rents are rising as the government plans to regulate these homes and turn them into "basic housing units".
  <br>
  <br>
  The official leading a task force on the matter, Deputy Financial Secretary Michael Wong, said the government has confidence tackling the issue now because there are more flats in the pipeline to accommodate SDU tenants.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will stick to this people-centric and orderly approach," Wong said in the chamber.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If we can continue to boost the quantity and speed in building public housing, more SDU residents can move into public flats and demand for SDUs will gradually fall."
  <br>
  <br>
  He said officials will give a report on the matter to the legislature at the start of next month, which will be followed by a two-month public consultation exercise.

 Runners and organisers of the Hong Kong Oxfam Trailwalker on Friday braced for a rainy start and a mischievous troop of monkeys.
 <br>
  <br>
  An online video showed that dozens of monkeys were raiding a supply station set up along the route, ransacking for food and delving into a torn blue-and-white striped nylon bag.
  <br>
  <br>
  Michael Wong, Oxfam Hong Kong’s director of fundraising and communications, said it is hard to prevent the animals from enjoying what he called a "once-a-year, all-you-can-eat buffet" at the checkpoint.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong said volunteers could only replenish food and supplies at the station.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Oxfam Trailwalker is one of the city's largest fundraising events.
  <br>
  <br>
  Participants are given 48 hours to complete the 100-kilometre run, kicking off at Pak Tam Chung in Sai Kung and finishing at Harrow International School Hong Kong in Tuen Mun.
  <br>
  <br>
  There is also a shorter 40-kilometre race.

    'Some fan heaters not energy efficient'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Consumer Council said on Friday bladeless fans with heating functions may not be as energy efficient as some other products on the market.
 <br>
  <br>
  The watchdog found 11 models it tested took longer to heat up the room than traditional fan heaters it tested previously.
  <br>
  <br>
  The models were also found to have different airflow rates.
  <br>
  <br>
  While the average is 16.1 cubic metres per minute, three of them had an airflow rate of 10 cubic metres or less per minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When you are talking about the airflow rate for different bladeless fans, we found it quite diverse. The energy efficiency, as well, is also quite diverse. Don't assume the fact that this kind of fans are very similar in terms of energy consumption. In actual fact, there are more energy-saving ones for you to select," said the council's chief executive Gilly Wong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The more you use energy-efficient appliances, the more you save for your expenses, but furthermore, you help to save the environment as well."
  <br>
  <br>
  The watchdog said by contrast, reverse-cycle air conditioners, which offers both heating and cooling in one system, may be more energy efficient.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Wong said it's ultimately up to consumers to choose what they want to use.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There are pros and cons. If you are talking about the reverse-cycle air conditioner, its heating capacity is much better and energy efficiency is much better," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But when you are talking about the installation, the cost by itself obviously is higher, and also the mobility of it is not there because it's fixed."
  <br>
  <br>
  The council said the Electrical and Mechanical Services Department could consider including different types of electric fans in the Voluntary Energy Efficiency Labelling Scheme, so consumers can compare products.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong authorities on Friday kicked off their first cybersecurity drill in a bid to enhance their defence capabilities.
 <br>
  <br>
  The three-day event involves a number of government departments and public bodies handling cyberattacks carried out by some members of the IT industry.
  <br>
  <br>
  Innovation and technology minister Sun Dong said cybersecurity is a cornerstone of the digital economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Maintaining online security is an important part of promoting high-quality economic development and building smart cities. This long-term task is always ongoing, and never finished," Sun said in a speech marking the event.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I sincerely hope that participating teams, as well as observing departments and organisations, will seize this opportunity to test yourself and improve."
  <br>
  <br>
  Sun added that eight mainland cybersecurity firms with experience with such drills offered technical support and suggestions for this exercise.
  <br>
  <br>
  The drill was organised by the Digital Policy Office and co-hosted by various departments, such as the police cybersecurity and tech crimes unit.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials did not reveal which government systems are involved in the drill.

    Scent boosters 'unnecessary add-ons for laundry'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Laundry scent boosters did not help with cleaning at all, the consumer watchdog said on Friday, as it found "varying types and concentrations" of fragrance allergens in all 12 samples it tested.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Except for one model with only one type of fragrance allergen, the remaining 11 models had three to eight types of fragrance allergens. The test also revealed that models with two-coloured scented granules generally had more types of fragrance allergens," the Consumer Council said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The council also said a third of the scent boosters contained a musk compound, galaxolide, which is not readily biodegradable and highly toxic to aquatic organisms, potentially posing a threat to marine ecosystems in the long run.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 12 in-wash scent boosters tested were priced ranged from HK$38 to HK$179 per bottle.
  <br>
  <br>
  Half of the models claim to help with softening fabrics.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The council considers these in-wash scent boosters as unnecessary add-ons for laundry as the contained fragrances have no effect on cleaning, while the cost per wash could reach a maximum of HK$21 based on the recommended usage," the watchdog said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As such, consumers should consider the long-term need for these products, especially if they or their family members are prone to skin or respiratory allergies. Should consumers choose to use these products, they should exercise caution when using, and at the same time keep them out of young children's reach to avoid accidental ingestion."

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong, Macau and mainland travellers will be able to cross the border at two checkpoints without showing their travel documents starting next Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The National Immigration Administration said on Friday the trial scheme is meant for making things more convenient for travellers, as well as raising border clearance efficiency.
  <br>
  <br>
  The trial will take place at self-service gates at the Shenzhen Bay checkpoint between Hong Kong and Shenzhen and the Gongbei crossing between Macau and Zhuhai.
  <br>
  <br>
  The scheme covers people aged 14 and above.
  <br>
  <br>
  It applies to mainland residents who travel frequently for private but not business reasons.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also applies to non-ethnic Chinese who have a mainland travel card.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[Residents] who agree to the border inspection agency collecting facial information, fingerprints and other information for verification can choose to use the 'document-free' channel at border inspection, without showing physical travel documents," the authorities said in an announcement.
  <br>
  <br>
  They said all travellers should still bring along their travel documents, in case officials need to check them after they cross the border.
  <br>
  <br>
  The authorities said the scheme would gradually expand to cover other border crossings, as well as children aged under 14.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong's sole delegate to the National People's Congress Standing Committee, Starry Lee of the DAB, said her party welcomes the trial scheme, saying it's something they have been calling for.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Overall speaking, this is a very important trial arrangement, a major step. It's a response to many Hong Kong people's demands for crossing the border even more conveniently," she told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Her partymate and the convenor of the SAR's delegates to the National People's Congress, Brave Chan, said the move will boost the economies on all sides as travelling becomes more convenient.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Consumer Council on Friday called for greater acceptance by the catering trade of customers' own containers when they order takeaways.
 <br>
  <br>
  It said proactive and flexible cooperation by eateries "is of crucial importance" to promote the container-free practice across Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Consumers need clear and easy-to-understand guidelines and promotion, complementing the operational procedures of eateries so that [bringing your own containers] can become a natural behaviour," the watchdog said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The council hopes that the government and the industry will work together to develop and promote reusable container lending services, so that the public can reduce the reliance on disposable containers and join hands to reduce plastic use at source."
  <br>
  <br>
  Checks by the council found some restaurants refusing to take boxes from outside for to-go orders.
  <br>
  <br>
  In August and September, the watchdog's staff members posed as customers and brought reusable food containers to 15 eateries during peak lunch hours on weekdays.
  <br>
  <br>
  Five of them were part of the government's bring-your-own-containers scheme.
  <br>
  <br>
  Of the 45 attempts made for the restaurants to accept self-brought containers for takeaways, almost 70 percent were successful, with the watchdog finding eateries taking part in the government initiative more inclined to do so.
  <br>
  <br>
  The council said four of the 15 eateries refused to accept people's own containers citing food safety and hygiene concerns, with one restaurant employee displaying "a slightly impatient tone" without giving an explanation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Others said to be accepting such containers were not able to entertain all requests citing practical constraints, such as the time being peak hours and the boxes being too small or dirty, the council added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The survey also found that none of the eateries offered discounts for [bringing your own containers], nor did they charge according to the number of disposable containers used on a 'user pays' basis, and some still charged [consumers who brought their own containers] for takeaway packaging," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong rolled out the first phase of a ban on single-use plastics in April, with restaurants prohibited from using or selling polystyrene utensils, plastic straws, cutlery and plates. People who fail to comply face fines of up to HK$100,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  Takeaway plastic lunch boxes and cups will also be prohibited in the second phase of the ban. There's no timetable yet on when that would be put in force.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A charity empowering people with genetic and neurodevelopmental disorders says members will be able to maintain their healthy lifestyle changes thanks to Operation Santa Claus (OSC).
 <br>
  <br>
  The first of 11 OSC beneficiaries this year, LOVE 21 supports Hong Kong’s Down syndrome and autistic communities through sport, nutrition and other programmes that include art therapy, music therapy, and African drumming.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carmel Armstrong, Chief Operating Officer of LOVE 21, said the charity – which now has 457 members – was founded to raise awareness of people who are rarely seen and often misunderstood.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Just have a little think: when did you last see a Down syndrome or autistic person on a train, or kicking a football, or running in the public park? And the answer's probably not very often, or not recently anyway. And we believe that's because of the stigma that is attached to being disabled in this part of the world,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Armstrong said with funding from OSC this year, the charity will expand an existing comprehensive nutrition programme, called "Follow-up Nutrition and Sport Programme", to help their members lead healthier, longer lives.
  <br>
  <br>
  “People with Down syndrome are often born with a higher propensity to be obese, slower metabolism, often eyesight problems, heart problems. And our autistic people often need to put on weight, or they need to learn how to eat in a more varied manner. They often don't like certain textures or colours, and so trying to get them to eat healthily and exercise is important.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Armstrong added the expansion would not only have members on the nutrition programme for a 12-month period, but it would also enable the charity to follow up with members to ensure they are maintaining good eating habits and meeting personal goals.
  <br>
  <br>
  One of those who has been part of LOVE 21’s programmes is Nathan, who said he has been “happy, confident and independent” since taking part.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Since I started the programmes here, most of it has helped in looking at better habits like better eating habits, better exercise habits and personal habits and making sure I make myself an intention to follow. I actually want this foundation to support as many people, as many friends that I have,” the member-turned-staff said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jointly organised by RTHK and South China Morning Post, OSC funds charitable projects that focus on children and youth, the elderly, the community, those with physical and mental disabilities, medical projects, and those concerning the environment.

 The Observatory cancelled all tropical cyclone warning signals at 1.20am on Friday as Typhoon Toraji weakened and the threat to Hong Kong receded. .
 <br>
  <br>
  However, the Observatory said it's still monitoring another tropical cyclone, Tropical Cyclone Usagi.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said Tropical Cyclone Usagi is currently forecast to cross the Luzon Strait on Friday morning and enter within 800 kilometres of Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said it's expected to stay more than 500 kilometres from Hong Kong, posing little direct threat to the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  It will then move northeastward toward the Ryukyu Islands and to gradually weaken.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Observatory downgraded the T3 signal to a T1 at 10.20pm on Thursday as tropical depression Toraji continues to weaken and moves away from Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  At 10pm, Toraji was estimated to be about 150 kilometres south-southwest of Hong Kong, and is forecast to move west slowly across the seas south of the Pearl River Estuary.
  <br>
  <br>
  The forecaster said it will drop all typhoon signals when Toraji no longer poses a threat to the SAR.

    Seven sentenced over 2019 bomb plot

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The mastermind of a plot to plant bombs and shoot police officers in 2019 was on Thursday jailed for more than 23 years while six others were slapped with jail terms ranging from five years and 10 months to 13 1/2 years each.
 <br>
  <br>
  The case involving the "Dragon Slaying Brigade" was Hong Kong's first-ever trial under a United Nations anti-terrorism ordinance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ng Chi-hung, whom the High Court heard was the mastermind in the case, was given the heaviest sentence of 23 years and 10 months after pleading guilty to one count of conspiring to commit the bombing of prescribed objects and one count of possession of arms or ammunition with intent to endanger life.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong Chun-keung, described as the leader of the group, was sentenced to 13 years and six months behind bars.
  <br>
  <br>
  Five other defendants received jail terms ranging from five years and 10 months to 12 years.
  <br>
  <br>
  During the trial, the High Court heard the defendants had planned to plant two bombs during a rally marking International Human Rights Day in December 2019, one on Hennessy Road in Wan Chai and the other around 100 metres away.
  <br>
  <br>
  Steve Li, chief superintendent from the national security police department, told reporters after the ruling that the heavy sentences reflected the severity of the case.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The statements and evidence [presented in court] showed that this group had the capability and was very active in trying to carry out the action," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If the police hadn't dismantled this group and their plan in time, it's believed that many people would have been impacted, including those participating in protests or innocent bystanders."
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, the government said the ruling shows that Hong Kong is a society underpinned by the rule of law.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The fact that the defendants were convicted and sentenced to imprisonment demonstrates that any person intending to plan and commit terrorist activities, endanger public security or disrupt society tranquillity can never escape sanctions of the law," it wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  It added that the Department of Justice will study the reasons for sentencing and consider whether to appeal the sentences.

    Manpower shortage to more than triple by 2028

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong will face a manpower crunch of 180,000 workers by 2028, compared with the shortage of 50,000 that was recorded last year, according to the government's manpower projection released on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The shortfall in the service industry was the worst last year, as it saw a shortage of 24,000 staff.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the Labour and Welfare Bureau said the situation would change by 2028 as jobs requiring skilled technicians would see a significant shortage of talent.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said the city needs to find at least 60,000 additional staff to fill the shortfall, a six-fold increase from last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Secretary for Labour and Welfare Chris Sun revealed the government already has plans to import 30,000 skilled workers in phases over the next three years.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are going to allow qualified technical professionals, who may not have a graduate degree, they may be educated below the bachelor level, to allow them into Hong Kong to fill the gap," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But one criteria we have to uphold is these people - they must be young technical professionals. By young, we mean those aged at or under 35."
  <br>
  <br>
  Sun revealed the bureau came up with the projection after holding more than 170 consultation sessions with different industries.
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted the rapid development of AI and automation, saying that the labour shortfall would be worse without the help of technology.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An international rugby match will be held on Saturday as part of trial events to test the new Kai Tak Youth Sports Ground.
 <br>
  <br>
  The match from 4pm between Hong Kong and Brazil is the second test event at the 5,000-seat venue, following a local football league game there last month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sports Commissioner George Tsoi said more than 3,000 spectators are expected to attend the match – double the number at the football game.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So we will be progressively increasing the intensity as well as the scale of our test events in the different venues within the Kai Tak Sports Park," Tsoi said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will increase the number of participants each time."
  <br>
  <br>
  Tsoi added that authorities will make direction signs larger and install more gates with metal detectors at the venue.
  <br>
  <br>
  The commissioner also said the government plans to hold a trial event for an indoor venue at the park next month, and another in the 50,000-seat main stadium in January.
  <br>
  <br>
  James Farndon, the CEO of Hong Kong China Rugby, said Saturday's match will be more than just a trial run.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It also gives us a prime opportunity to build on our collaboration with all the local government stakeholders that we've been working with in recent months," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "From a Hong Kong China Rugby perspective, we get the opportunity to really utilise the event as a means to learn and test our event operations as we move towards the big event in March."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong Rugby Sevens will take place at Kai Tak Sports Park from 28-30 March.

    'Professionals need guidance on child abuse reports'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A child welfare organisation on Thursday urged the government to offer professionals guidance before a mandatory reporting mechanism for suspected child abuse comes into effect.
 <br>
  <br>
  Against Child Abuse (ACA) said it handled about 1,000 enquiries between April last year and March this year, of which 185 involved child abuse fears.
  <br>
  <br>
  The organisation said more than 15 percent of the enquiries were from professionals, such as teachers, social workers and doctors.
  <br>
  <br>
  ACA director Donna Wong said she expects the number of cases reported by professionals to gradually increase, as awareness has improved since Legco passed the Mandatory Reporting of Child Abuse Ordinance in July.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Wong said sufficient preparatory work must be carried out before the legislation comes into effect in 2026.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We hope that relevant support measures, such as the mandatory reporting guide, trainings for related professionals, the childcare residential placement, emergency placement and publicity education… will be well prepared in the 18-month transition period so that the mechanism will fully play its effectiveness,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under the legislation, professionals who fail to report abuse cases risk a three-month jail term and a HK$50,000 fine.

 Legislators on Thursday said Hong Kong’s stock market operated as usual during the first session under a T8.
 <br>
  <br>
  The decades-long practice of shutting down the markets when there's severe weather was scrapped in September.
  <br>
  <br>
  Financial services sector lawmaker Robert Lee said no major incidents were seen during the morning trading session, but there was room for improvement regarding the use of physical cheques.
  <br>
  <br>
  “From the brokers' perspective a lot of them already have electronic payment methods with the exchange. However, for a lot of the ultimate end clients, they may not all have these electronic payment methods,” he told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I think in terms of physical cheques, that's something that the HKMA recognises as a form of payment. For some of these people that are having some difficulties with dealing with physical cheques, I think there's room for improvement.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Accountancy sector lawmaker Edmund Wong said the stock exchange and the finance sector were well-prepared for business under severe weather conditions, allowing the stock market to run smoothly.
  <br>
  <br>
  The stock market opened at 9.30am. The observatory downgraded the T8 to a T3 at 10.20am.

    HK to sign free trade agreement with Peru: CE

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee has confirmed that a free-trade agreement between Hong Kong and Peru will be signed this week.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lee arrived in Lima on Wednesday evening local time, ahead of the Apec Economic Leaders’ meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a Facebook entry, the CE said he was greeted at the airport by Peruvian energy minister Romulo Mucho Mamani and Chinese Ambassador to Peru Song Yang.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong began negotiating the pact with Peru in January 2023, with the agreement to cover goods and services, as well as investment and a dispute settlement mechanism. Talks concluded in July this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  This will be Hong Kong’s ninth free-trade agreement with the existing eight covering 20 economies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Apart from securing the much-anticipated trade pact, the SAR leader will also attend bilateral meetings with other Apec leaders and meet local business representatives in Lima.
  <br>
  <br>
  Peru is Hong Kong’s fifth-largest trading partner in Latin America and 46th globally. Merchandise trade between the two places totalled HK$5.2 billion last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee will return to Hong Kong next Tuesday.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong climbed to seventh in a survey of economies ranking their global digital competitiveness.
 <br>
  <br>
  It was the city's highest ranking in three years.
  <br>
  <br>
  That's according to the latest World Digital Competitiveness Ranking compiled by the Switzerland-based International Institute for Management Development.
  <br>
  <br>
  The institute said Hong Kong had advanced three places following an improvement in three areas - technology, knowledge and future readiness.
  <br>
  <br>
  It added that employee training in the city demonstrated a significant enhancement.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, the SAR government said the result recognised Hong Kong's status as one of the most digitally competitive economies in the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Going forward, the HKSAR Government will continue to collaborate with various sectors of society to further enhance Hong Kong's I&T ecosystem, thereby upholding our competitive edge in the global market and injecting new impetus to economic development," a spokesperson said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Singapore claimed top spot in the ranking, followed by Switzerland and Denmark.

    Toraji not as bad as expected, say commuters

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Toraji left Hong Kong relatively unscathed, with commuters saying the storm was not as bad as they expected.
 <br>
  <br>
  At Admiralty Station many people were making their way to work as the observatory downgraded the T8 signal to T3 at 10.20am.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hotel worker Jana said getting to work wasn't a hassle, but she thinks the T3 announcement could have come earlier.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Not good. So everybody needs to be fast. We're going to work and [hurrying] to get ready... it's not good," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jason, who was waiting for a taxi at Kowloon Tong Station, shared her sentiment.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It’s not really a big issue but there needs to be more transportation options to help people get to work immediately. I think transportation should resume to normality a little before the signal is lowered," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Peter, a barrister, said taxi drivers were jacking up fares during the storm so he had to take the MTR instead.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The taxis are playing the usual game. I live in Sheung Wan. I got into a cab, wanted to go to Bank of China Tower. Once I was in, he said, oh, that'll be 100 dollars. Well, it's a scam," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The MTR is always operating, unless it's a direct hit when everything shuts down. I've lived in Hong Kong for so long, it's just part of the summer or late summer, isn't it?"
  <br>
  <br>
  Maeva, who was getting breakfast before a job interview, said transport was smooth but many shops were still closed because of the storm.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I came here to do some shopping but everything is closed, because of the storm. It's less [smooth] than usual but still. I think it was rainy and windy but not that bad," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some tourists told RTHK that it didn't feel like a T8 at all and they were eager to explore the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  "No, not affected in anyway. I feel relatively safe. I am looking forward to travelling around here," said a US visitor.
  <br>
  <br>
  But a tourist from Russia, Vladislav, said he had to start his activities for the day a little later than planned because most stores were closed in Kowloon Tong.

 The Observatory issued the T3 signal in place of T8 at 10.20am on Thursday as Hong Kong gradually returns to normalcy with the departure of Tropical Storm Toraji.
 <br>
  <br>
  The T8 had been up for more than 11 hours, with the SAR largely unscathed as the storm skirted around 130km south of the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  Forecasters said the T3 would remain in force for most of the day.
  <br>
  <br>
  The storm led to the cancellation of 10 flights, with 20 others delayed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials said the airport would operate as normal for the day and should be able to handle more than 1,000 flights.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other modes of public transport would also gradually get back to normal.
  <br>
  <br>
  The MTR Corporation and bus companies said most services have gradually resumed to normal frequencies as T3 replaced T8.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shuttle buses to the bridge to Zhuhai and Macau would return to full operations from 10.30am.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, ferry services between Discovery Bay and Central would also resume from 10.40am.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sun Ferry said outlying island ferry services would resume from 11.30am, while Star Ferry said its cross-harbour services between Tsim Sha Tsui and Central as well as Wan Chai would resume at noon.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hospital Authority said public out-patient and specialist out-patient clinics as well as day services would gradually resume within two hours after T8 was replaced.
  <br>
  <br>
  The authority also said patients whose appointments were affected by the storm, and who made their bookings through the phone or the mobile app, HA Go, could make a new appointment from 11.20am.
  <br>
  <br>
  For the first time during a T8, the stock market stayed open under a new arrangement introduced in September to keep trading going despite adverse weather.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tourist spots would also reopen gradually. Hong Kong Disneyland said it would provide limited services from 11.30am, while Ocean Park would do the same from noon.
  <br>
  <br>
  The West Kowloon Cultural District would reopen at 1pm, and tickets to M+ and the Hong Kong Palace Museum were extended for 60 days.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development Algernon Yau is on a mission in Lima as he seeks cooperation and investment opportunities with other economies in the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, or Apec.
 <br>
  <br>
  On his first full day in the Peruvian capital, Yau held bilateral meetings with his Thai and Indonesian counterparts on the sidelines of the Apec summit.
  <br>
  <br>
  He first met Thai commerce minister Pichai Naripthaphan. The pair exchanged pleasantries in basic Cantonese, before sitting down for a formal dialogue behind closed doors.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SAR commerce chief then held similar exchanges with Budi Santoso, the Indonesian minister of trade.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yau briefed the Southeast Asian delegations about the latest development in Hong Kong, and explored potential cooperation opportunities.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also expressed gratitude to both Thailand and Indonesia for their support regarding the SAR’s accession to the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, or RCEP.

    T8 to be downgraded at 10.20am as Toraji departs

 The Hong Kong Observatory (HKO) said it will downgrade the T8 storm signal to T3 at 10.20am – in time for students of afternoon primary and secondary schools to go back to class.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Observatory said winds are expected to weaken as Tropical Storm Toraji slowly moves away after coming within 130 kilometres of the territory.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Toraji is now closest to the territory,” the HKO said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Toraji is expected to weaken and move away from Hong Kong, and local winds will moderat gradually during the day today.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Forecasters are nonetheless expecting occasional squally showers on Thursday. They also urged people to stay away from the shoreline, as seas are very rough with swells.
  <br>
  <br>
  The T8 signal was issued at 11.10pm on Wednesday night. However, the storm didn’t have any major impact on the city, with authorities receiving three reports of fallen trees as of 6am, with no reports of landslides or flooding.
  <br>
  <br>
  One woman sought treatment at the Accident and Emergency Department at a public hospital during the T8 signal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Most students will get a day off, with morning and whole-day classes cancelled for the day. However, afternoon and evening classes will resume.
  <br>
  <br>
  Many public services, including outpatient services at hospitals and social welfare care centres will be suspended during the storm’s passage. All court hearings in the morning were also adjourned, while afternoon hearings will be held as scheduled.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the MTR Corporation said it would continue providing rail services – albeit at limited frequencies. It said trains on most lines would run at 10-minute intervals, while there would be 15 minutes between trains operating between Tiu Keng Leng and LOHAS Park, and a 20-minute gap on the Disneyland Resort line, as well as for East Rail trains running between Admiralty and Lok Ma Chau.
  <br>
  <br>
  Light rail services would run at intervals of between 15 and 20 minutes during the T8 signal.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 100 people have sought shelter at 27 temporary shelters opened in various districts by the Home Affairs Department.

 The Hong Kong Observatory on Thursday said it would consider downgrading the T8 storm signal between 10am and noon, as Tropical Storm Toraji starts slowly moving away after coming within 130 kilometres of the territory.
 <br>
  <br>
  Wind gusts in excess of 80 kilometres per hour were recorded at Waglan Island and Tate’s Cairn as the storm inched its way past Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a 6am briefing, Senior Scientific Officer Yeung Kwok-chung of the Observatory said Toraji was at that point the closest it would come to Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Toraji is expected to weaken and move away from Hong Kong, and local winds will moderate gradually during the day today. Depending on the weakening of local winds, the Observatory will consider issuing the Strong Wind Signal No. 3 between 10am and 12 noon,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Forecasters are nonetheless expecting occasional squally showers on Thursday. They also urged people to stay away from the shoreline, as seas are very rough with swells.
  <br>
  <br>
  The T8 signal was issued at 11.10pm on Wednesday night.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the storm didn’t have any major impact on the city, with authorities receiving three reports of fallen trees as of 6am, with no reports of landslides or flooding.
  <br>

  <br>
  <br>
  Most students will get a day off, with morning and whole-day classes cancelled for the day. However, afternoon and evening classes would resume if the T8 signal is downgraded before 10.30am.
  <br>
  <br>
  Many public services, including outpatient services at hospitals and social welfare care centres will be suspended during the storm’s passage. All court hearings in the morning are also adjourned, and afternoon hearings will also be put off if the T8 warning is still up as of 11am.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the MTR Corporation said it would continue providing rail services – albeit at limited frequencies.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said trains on most lines would run at 10-minute intervals, while there would be 15 minutes between trains operating between Tiu Keng Leng and LOHAS Park, and a 20-minute gap on the Disneyland Resort line, as well as for East Rail trains running between Admiralty and Lok Ma Chau.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Gale force winds buffeted some areas of Hong Kong early on Thursday morning as Tropical Storm Toraji slowly made its way towards the Pearl River Estuary.
 <br>
  <br>
  The T8 storm signal was issued at 11.10pm on Wednesday and will remain in force until 10am on Thursday at the earliest.
  <br>
  <br>
  By 3am, Toraji was centred around 140 kilometres south-southeast of Hong Kong, and was not expected to come much closer.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong Observatory said the storm has been taking a more westerly track, and is moving west slowly.
  <br>
  <br>
  Winds in excess of 90 kilometres an hour have been recorded on Waglan Island and Tate’s Cairn, but the Observatory said it expects the wind to weaken later in the morning.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Local winds will moderate gradually during the day on Thursday”, Senior Scientific Officer Yeung Kwok-chung said in a briefing.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Depending on the movement of Toraji and the weakening trend of local winds, the Observatory will assess the time of issuing the Strong Wind Signal No. 3."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Education Bureau said classes of all morning and whole-day schools, including secondary schools, primary schools, schools for children with physical disability, schools for children with intellectual disability, kindergartens, and kindergartens-cum-child care centres, will be suspended on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  It added that afternoon and evening classes would resume if the T8 is downgraded before 10.30am.
  <br>
  <br>
  The MTR Corporation said it would continue providing rail services -- albeit at limited frequencies.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was trains on most lines would run at 10-minute intervals, while there would be 15 minutes between trains operating between Tiu Keng Leng and Lohas Park, a 20-minute gap on the Disneyland Resort line, as well as for East Rail trains running between Admiralty and Lok Ma Chau.
  <br>
  <br>
  Light rail services would run at intervals of between 15 and 20 minutes during the T8 signal.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 100 people have sought shelter at 27 temporary shelters opened in various districts by the Home Affairs Department.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities had by 2am received one single report of a fallen tree, while there have been no reports of landslides or flooding.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lawmakers on Wednesday welcomed the government's plan to develop a university town, including Hong Kong's third medical school, in San Tin in Yuen Long.
 <br>
  <br>
  As part of the Northern Metropolis development project, authorities plan to use more than one-third of a 127-hectare land in Ngau Tam Mei to build an academic town, to bolster the SAR's status as an international education hub.
  <br>
  <br>
  The so-called UniTown will house a medical school, where a new hospital will be built next to it.
  <br>
  <br>
  Medical sector lawmaker David Lam said he expects the new facilities to offer advanced medical services to the residents there.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If we want to develop the region, Northern Metropolis, into a big area with high-end research and a population, they would certainly expect to have good hospitals and state-of-the-art medical services," he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With a university hospital in the region, you would expect this university hospital to provide state-of-the-art medical services to the people in the region."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lam believes the new hospital, along with the existing Pok Oi and North District hospitals, will be able to cope with an expected increase in the region's population.
  <br>
  <br>
  DAB lawmaker Edward Lau said the Ngau Tam Mei development plan, which he described as "reasonable", will offer crucial infrastructure to the nearby San Tin Technopole.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he also pointed out that the development of some nearby areas, such as Au Tau located to the south of Ngau Tam Mei, has been lagging behind.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lau called on the government to present plans to develop Au Tau and North Kam Tin as soon as possible.

<img alt="A side event forum is held at this year's COP29 China Pavilion in Azerbaijan. Photo courtesy of Friends of the Earth (HK) and the Financial Services Development Council" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1778937_1_20241113210609.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The head of a green group said on Wednesday that it is important to further promote Hong Kong's status as a leading green financing hub on the global stage, highlighting the pivotal role of the city's financial expertise in advancing transition finance and fostering investment in sustainable projects throughout the region.
 <br>
  <br>
  Friends of the Earth (HK) and the Financial Services Development Council this week co-hosted a forum titled "Advancing Transition Finance and Cross-Border Green Financing – Engaging the Public to Achieve a Net-Zero Economy" at the COP29 China Pavilion in Azerbaijan where the United Nations Climate Change Conference is being held.
  <br>
  <br>
  Plato Yip, chairman of Friends of the Earth, said more people attended the event this year than in Dubai a year ago, proving that people from other countries are interested in what Hong Kong has to offer.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think there is a lot of interest how Hong Kong has issued like green bonds. We topped Asia. We actually issued one-third of Asia's green bonds and [people are interested in] how we are so successful in doing this. I think it's also because people understand that climate finance is so important for effective climate change mitigation and resilience programme," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The side event really helped us help Hong Kong and amplify our voice on green finance on the global stage. We do have very strong financial infrastructure, very supportive policies and talented professionals."
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that there is optimism China and Europe can play leading roles in shaping the future.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Most participants would acknowledge that the global green economy or green transformation is under way, particularly focusing on energy transformation or energy transition. This process is largely supported by China's supply chain. I have to note that Hong Kong has a huge role to play here too because coupled with the technology from China and the edge of Hong Kong's green finance, this is the winning formula," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yip also said that a methane fee for major oil and gas producers was finalised by the Biden administration in the United States, but that some people fear the measure could be scrapped with Donald Trump returning to the White House.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We can expect him to take a more sceptical view on climate change initiatives, which might lead to a rollback of some US policies and measures, and this could create some uncertainty in the market and potentially slow down climate action from the US side. I think it's also important to remember that the global push for sustainability and low-carbon economy is still very strong and unlikely to be completely derailed by any one administration," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Many countries and regions like the EU, China, Canada, Australia, and etc., they are all very committed, [and are] still very committed to their climate goals, regardless of what happens in the US, I think. Plus, there's another important factor is that the private sector is increasingly aware that sustainability is key for their long-term resilience and profitability."

 The Hong Kong Observatory (HKO) says it will issue a T8 storm signal at 11.10pm on Wednesday, as Tropical Storm Toraji edges closer to Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  The forecaster said that Toraji has moved on a more northerly track towards the coast of Guangddong in the past few hours, adding that gale winds and squally showers will affect Hong Kong overnight and on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Observatory added that Toraji will be closest to the Pearl River Estuary Thursday morning, skirting around 150 kilometres south of Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Observatory said that the T8 storm signal will remain until at least 10am on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  MTR rail and bus services, along with the local section of high-speed rail link, will remain normal for the rest of the evening.
  <br>
  <br>
  The railway company added that services on open sections of the railway, Light Rail and bus will be suspended immediately if T9 or above is issued.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The government said it plans to build the city's third medical school in San Tin in Yuen Long, as part of the Northern Metropolis development plan.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a proposal submitted by the Development Bureau to the Legislative Council, officials outlined the allocation of more than one-third of a 127-hectare plot in Ngau Tam Mei to develop a university town, which will house the medical school.
  <br>
  <br>
  The project to build the so-called UniTown will begin in 2027 at the earliest.
  <br>
  <br>
  Covering 46 hectares, the plot is larger than the proposed 30 hectares revealed by Secretary for Development Bernadette Linn earlier.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a closed-door press briefing on Wednesday, Development Bureau officials said they decided to arrange more land for local institutions to collaborate with mainland and overseas universities to build schools there, to help boost the SAR's status as an international education hub.
  <br>
  <br>
  But they did not say how many educational institutions will call the UniTown home.
  <br>
  <br>
  The University of Science and Technology has expressed interest in running Hong Kong's third medical school.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government also plans to build a hospital with 3,000 beds near the school.
  <br>
  <br>
  The hospital will be used to cope with the potential population growth in Yuen Long and North District thanks to the area's development, and to train doctors.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government also said the development project in Ngau Tam Mei will create about 13,000 housing units – mainly private homes – with the first batch of residents expected to move in from 2034.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government said it will reveal the cost of the project before construction begins.

 Executive Council convenor and New People's Party chairwoman Regina Ip on Wednesday said her party had fruitful exchanges with British government officials, think tanks and business leaders during a recent visit to the UK.
 <br>
  <br>
  "The key takeaways are that they are very interested in Hong Kong's development – in particular the development of our financial markets, our family offices, our connectivity schemes with mainland China, [and] the Greater Bay Area development," Ip told reporters after leading a delegation to London.
  <br>
  <br>
  She also said in response to questions from some UK media outlets about the national security laws in Hong Kong, her delegation assured them that the provisions are on par with British laws, and that press freedom is alive and well in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We explained to them our two national security laws actually only affected a very small number of people. All the trials were conducted openly in full transparency, and nobody has been able to point any finger at the quality of the judgements," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  On US president-elect Donald Trump possibly naming Marco Rubio as secretary of state and how this could affect the SAR, Ip said she hopes the Florida senator would visit Hong Kong to clear up "misunderstandings".
  <br>
  <br>
  Rubio sponsored the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act of 2019 to sanction SAR and central government officials, drawing condemnation from Beijing.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I hope he will actually visit Hong Kong to see the true situation in Hong Kong, and not just listen to a small minority of Hong Kong people who have a twisted view of One Country, Two Systems," Ip said.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government said on Wednesday that part of the money it earmarked for implementing a waste charging scheme has been used on other green policies, after the programme was shelved in May.
 <br>
  <br>
  It was responding to a written question from Third Side lawmaker Tik Chi-yuen, who noted that the scheme's estimated expenditure for the current financial year was more than HK$580 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  Environment chief Tse Chin-wan said in response that the money has been reallocated, to things including strengthening recycling facilities and improving publicity on waste reduction and recycling.
  <br>
  <br>
  Staff have also been redeployed to build up community and food waste recycling networks, he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tse said a revised estimate for the Environmental Protection Department for this financial year will be released in next year's budget, for the scrutiny of lawmakers.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister said the government's contracts with designated garbage bag and label suppliers are still ongoing, but they don't mandate production and storage quantities, and payment is needed only for the actual amount produced.
  <br>
  <br>
  "These contracts are still in effect at present and we will continue to maintain communication with the suppliers and properly handle all issues in accordance with the contract provisions," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tse added that agreements with major retail chains and wholesalers run through 2027, and officials have collected all unsold bags and labels from them, and are verifying sales figures for making payments.

    Govt, DAB hold jobs fair for ethnic minorities

<div class="itemFullText">
 The government is determined to build an inclusive work environment for ethnic minorities (EM), Undersecretary for Labour Ho Kai-ming said as he officiated at the opening ceremony of a jobs fair on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Ho told reporters that the Labour Department has been assisting non-Chinese people in landing government jobs, such as relaxing language requirements.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have provided some case management projects to provide some help for them to work. Last year, we have helped about 500 EM employees to take up jobs," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Furthermore, we have adjusted our Chinese proficiency levels to help them enter the government to work, but all of the civil servants need to know some Chinese. Therefore, we will discuss with departments continuously to employ more EM citizens."
  <br>
  <br>
  Equal Opportunities Commission chairwoman Linda Lam, meanwhile, said job fairs are a way to promote a more racially diverse workplace.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The language barrier is a common hurdle [for EM job-seekers], but other factors such as bias and stereotypes exist too," Lam said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have reached out to our racially diverse network of employers to bring in job openings that could be promising for potential employees from diverse races and qualifications, and have their language barrier thoughtfully considered," she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jobseeker Rizwan who was at the fair said he has been looking for a job for around a year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Once I went into the job market, [not knowing Chinese] was very tough. They [companies] do require you to either speak Chinese or they want you to have a lot of other experience. But in the CV and experience I show, they say that I don't have that experience," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Non-Chinese students were also taken to the event to learn how to search for a job.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think every non-Chinese students is used to that [discrimination] in Hong Kong, a little racism here and there. But it's not too bad. People just want to judge, and you can't change the way other people think," said Nareena, 16.
  <br>
  <br>
  She added that she will maintain her confidence and continue to pursue her dreams.
  <br>
  <br>
  The job fair, co-organised by the Labour Department and the DAB's ethnic minority committee, is being held in Mong Kok for two days. A total of 50 companies will participate in the fair, offering more than 3,100 job openings.

    EOC talking to catering sector about discrimination

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Equal Opportunities Commission (EOC) on Wednesday said it is actively communicating with the catering industry on ways to enhance awareness among staff about anti-discrimination measures.
 <br>
  <br>
  Paralympian Ho Yuen-kei, who uses a wheelchair, recently complained that she was denied entry into a restaurant due to limited space. The restaurant apologised to the athlete after the incident, but the matter sparked public concern.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The recent discussions have aroused public attention about the need to pay regard to the welfare of persons with disabilities and the importance of not to discriminate against them because of their disability. We treat this as a very positive development," said EOC chairwoman Linda Lam.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will work on what has been discussed in the media, including the general consensus that there is a need to enhance education and awareness of service providers in the catering industry."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lam said the commission published guidelines last November on how to ensure a barrier-free environment in restaurants, and has held seminars on providing accessible technology for food ordering services.
  <br>
  <br>
  She added that the watchdog will continue to have discussions with the industry about exploring training options, especially for frontline workers.

    T3 will be in force until 11pm, higher signal possible

<img alt="The T3 signal was issued at 2.40pm and will last until at least 11pm, with a higher signal possible depending on the intensity of Toraji's winds. Image courtesy of the Hong Kong Observatory" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1778862_1_20241113150332.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Observatory (HKO) issued the T3 storm warning signal at 2.40pm, while warning that Tropical Storm Toraji may come closer to Hong Kong than earlier anticipated.
 <br>
  <br>
  Forecasters say winds will pick up as Toraji creeps towards Hong Kong. As of 5pm on Wednesday, Toraji was around 210km southeast of the territory but is now expected to come between 150 to 200km of the city either on Wednesday night or Thursday morning -- compared to an earlier estimate of around 200km.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Observatory says the T3 signal will remain in force until at least 11pm on Wednesday night, and a higher signal is possible after that.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Whether a higher Tropical Cyclone Warning Signal will be issued depends on the degree of weakening of Toraji when it edges closer to the Pearl River Estuary, the distance of its associated gale winds from the Pearl River Estuary and the change of local wind conditions”, the Observatory said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The HKO also said winds in Hong Kong are strengthening gradually due to the approaching storm, combined with the effects of the northeast monsoon. More showers and squalls are also forecast. Gusts of wind in excess of 78 kilometres an hour have been measured at Tate's Cairn in Ma On Shan Country Park.
  <br>
  <br>
  As seas are rough, the Observatory said members of the public should stay away from the shoreline and not to engage in water sports.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Education Bureau announced that kindergartens as well as schools for children with physical disability and intellectual disability were suspended for Wednesday, and that the premises should stay open to accommodate students.
  <br>
  <br>
  The light-and-sound show "A Symphony of Lights" scheduled for Wednesday has been cancelled.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Social Welfare Department said all child care centres, centres providing after school care programmes, elderly services centres and day rehabilitation units will remain open under normal operating hours.

    KMB, Citybus seek fare increases
   </title>

<img alt="" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1778841_1_20241113130934.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Bus company KMB has applied to put fares up by 6.5 percent while Citybus is seeking increases of nearly 10 percent, sources have told RTHK.
 <br>
  <br>
  The firms' ticket prices last rose in June last year, by four to five percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  KMB said on Wednesday that it's facing a number of issues such as fewer passengers, a rise in operating costs and unstable fuel prices.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said it raised staff wages by 3.5 percent this year and 4.2 percent last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Citybus also pointed to wages increases over the past three years, saying this contributed to a rise in operating costs.
  <br>
  <br>
  A spokesman for the company said the application for fare increases was made in January, without disclosing how much it is seeking.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This fare increase application is still pending for approval, meaning that our fares have remained at the same level for over a year unlike other key transportation operators such as the railway, minibuses, taxi and ferry companies," the spokesman said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The company cited a poor economy as one reason passenger numbers have not recovered to pre-Covid levels.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Transport Department said officials are vetting the applications, adding that advisers and lawmakers will be consulted on the matter.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Legislative Council’s transport panel will discuss the issue on Friday next week, its chairman Ben Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the DAB lawmaker is already expressing concern about the proposal, saying “excessive” fare hikes would add to the public's burden amid an economic downturn.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said the government should instead explore other avenues for bus companies to make money while leaving fares alone – such as allowing shops at major bus interchanges.
  <br>
  <br>
  Roundtable lawmaker Michael Tien said the companies’ demands are unreasonable, adding that making such demands is a part of a “predictable” process that does nothing but annoy everyone concerned.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If you look at the past, it's becoming so expected that the whole thing is like a joke," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The bus companies would ask for the moon, the government would eventually give them 30, 40 percent of what they want. During the period, the companies bear all the curse of the community about being heartless."
  <br>
  <br>
  In past years, approved increases have often been lower than the levels requested by bus firms.
  <br>

    National Games test events to begin this month

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Test events for next year's National Games will get underway in Hong Kong this month, a government official said on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong will co-host the Games for the first time next November, alongside Guangdong and Macau.
  <br>
  <br>
  The eight competitive events to take place in the SAR are fencing, track cycling, rugby sevens, golf, triathlon, beach volleyball, men's handball and men's under-22 basketball.
  <br>
  <br>
  Additionally, Hong Kong will help organise cross-border events, including a marathon and road cycling competition.
  <br>
  <br>
  In an exclusive interview with RTHK, the head of the National Games Coordination Office, Yeung Tak-keung, said each competitive event must have a trial  six to 12 months beforehand.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For example, a test event will be held at Fanling golf course this month. Since many major tournaments have taken place there before, we’re quite familiar with the venue. However, we need to consider whether there are any differences in requirements between the Hong Kong Open and other large tournaments compared to the National Games. We’ll focus on any adjustments that need to be made during the November test event," Yeung said.
  <br>
  <br>
  A test event for the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau road cycling race will be held on November 24, although Yeung said most trials will take place between January and May next year, including handball and fencing at Kai Tak Sports Park, beach volleyball at Victoria Park and the triathlon along the Central promenade.
  <br>
  <br>
  The former sports commissioner said officials will work with counterparts in Guangdong and Macau on back-up plans in case of extreme weather conditions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The outdoor competitions will likely face a bigger impact from bad weather. For example, the triathlon involves swimming, cycling, and running, so if the weather is poor, we may need an alternative date. Also, the cross-border road bicycle race is lengthy and passes through some windy spots, so we need to think about these weather conditions and have back-up options ready," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  In terms of the accommodation arrangements for the thousands of athletes and journalists expected to come to the SAR, Yeung said due to the Games' "simple" concept, there will not be an athletes' village.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he stressed there will be enough hotel rooms for everyone.
  <br>
  <br>
  Over 32,000 people from Hong Kong have signed up to be volunteers at the Games, far beyond the original target of 10,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeung said he was surprised by the response and noted that those selected through interviews will receive training next year and will be assigned different roles, including at competition venues, hotels and border crossings.

    T3 to be issued 2.40pm as Toraji is expected to weaken

<img alt="The Observatory says Toraji is expected to be closest to Hong Kong on Thursday morning. Image courtesy: HKO" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1778806_2_20241113102954.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Observatory (HKO) says it will issue a T3 storm signal at 2.40pm on Wednesday, and will have to wait and see whether a higher storm signal is needed later as tropical storm Toraji shows signs of weakening as it approaches Hong Kong
 <br>
  <br>
  As of 1pm, the storm was around 260 kilometres southeast of Hong Kong and is expected to pass some 200 kilometres to the south of the territory on Thursday morning.
  <br>
  <br>
  Senior Scientific Officer Lee Shuk-ming from the Observatory, says whether or not a higher storm signal is needed depends on Toraji's intensity.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Right now, Toraji has adopted a west-northwesterly track. It will gradually edge closer to places with a cooler sea temperature. This will also cause its intensity to weaken," she told a radio programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  "On the other hand, we expect Toraji's vertical wind-shear to strengthen, which at the same time might cause Toraji to weaken when it edges closer to Hong Kong."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Observatory said the outer rain bands of the storm are affecting the coast of Guangdong, and local winds are expected to strengthen gradually on Wednesday afternoon, as the effects of the approaching combine with the northeast monsoon.
  <br>
  <br>
  It advised people to stay away from the shoreline as seas are rough with swells.

    Everyone's a hero as Operation Santa Claus kicks off

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Everyone is encouraged to become a hero of goodwill as Operation Santa Claus 2024 kicked off on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Co-organised by RTHK Radio 3 and the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the annual charity campaign has been holding fundraising projects for over 35 years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at the launch ceremony, acting director of broadcasting Christine Wai said the campaign has raised HK$383 million to support more than 350 projects over the years.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As we are about to launch into the main fundraising period of Operation Centre Claus for the 37th time, this is a chance to get together and share our common purpose and appreciate the value of this seasonal fixture which has become so much a part of our life," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Over the next few weeks, we'll be telling our listeners, readers and viewers what's going on and all about the fundraising activities, the creativity and imagination, and of course the fund."
  <br>
  <br>
  The theme for this year's campaign is "Everyday Heroes", and SCMP general counsel and company secretary Paul Wong urged people to take this theme to heart.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Through Operation Santa Claus, we are all brought in together with one another", he said. "We have a chance to help those who are in need and to support our neighbours, so let's be generous, and let's all be the everyday heroes of other people's lives."
  <br>
  <br>
  The funds raised this year will be shared among 11 beneficiaries that serve and support children and youth, the elderly, the environment and those with physical and mental disabilities.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong wheelchair badminton star Daniel Chan and singer Jay Fung are the ambassadors of this year's campaign.

    'Systemic issues affect construction safety'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A workers' rights representative on Tuesday said systemic issues in the construction industry were to blame for a drop in workplace safety.
 <br>
  <br>
  Siu Sin-man from the Association for the Rights of Industrial Accident Victims told a press conference that more than 100 workers, 11 of them from the construction industry, have died on the job since the start of the year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last week, three workers lost their lives within a span of five days while another died on Tuesday after falling into the sea near Stonecutters Island.
  <br>
  <br>
  Siu cited a 7.5-hour mandatory safety training course currently in place – commonly known as the Green Card – and said it failed to provide new workers with adequate safety knowledge and awareness.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The government should increase the length of Green Card courses, and a certain training hours must be completed before they renew any speciality licences," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Siu also said the "lowest bid wins" principle and a low weight of safety scores in the overall bidding process led to insufficient resources to help ensure safety.
  <br>
  <br>
  To help raise public awareness at an early age, she called on the government to introduce construction safety education in primary schools.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho Wing-ip, an electrical and building services engineer, noted that the fatality rate for construction workers had dropped to 0.093 per 1,000 workers in 2016, but has since risen annually, reaching 0.178 last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  “As an engineer, I would conclude that the external factors must have deteriorated. The external factors include the tendering system, monitoring system, supervision system, audit system, mentality of workers, all these, I think they are deteriorating," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Personally I think we have room for improvement, especially touching on the penalty in the construction laws in relation to the safe working environment."
  <br>
  <br>
  Currently, all capital works with contracts over HK$30 million are required to implement the Smart Site Safety System, which includes features like centralised management platforms, monitoring devices for workers and electric locks for dangerous areas.
  <br>
  <br>
  Besides the safety features, Ho said a key focus should be on educating stakeholders about safety.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Sports Institute (HKSI) and the Hong Kong Academy of Medicine (HKAM) signed a Memorandum of Understanding on Tuesday to promote sports medicine and sports science, in the hope of enhancing better support systems for elite athletes.
 <br>
  <br>
  HKAM president Gilberto Leung said the Medical Council doesn't recognise sports medicine as a specialisation, so the SAR needs to catch up through developing training programmes in this area.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Hong Kong Academy of Medicine has a very good track record and we have rich experience in designing training for specialists, whereas the Hong Kong Sports Institute has a lot of experience with actually dealing with patients or athletes with injuries and how to handle their psychology, their nutritional needs, and also injury prevention," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We want to put the two together, our statutory status, in providing training for doctors and also the experience that the Sports Institute has, and hopefully with that, we can design some really effective and impactful programmes, and on top of that, we would like to explore how to do research because if you have good research, you can improve service and the care to the athletes as well."
  <br>
  <br>
  HKSI chairman Tang King-shing said the future cooperation between the two bodies will focus on providing medical training programmes, organising seminars and workshops to better understand sports medicine trends and technology advancements, and strengthening professional exchanges and experience sharing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two-time Olympic gold medallist Edgar Cheung and the SAR's "Flying Fish" Siobhan Haughey were among athletes attending the signing event to share the importance of sports medicine for elite athletes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I go to [the Sports Medicine Centre at HKSI] for physiotherapy pretty frequently because having fenced for so long, it's no surprise that many athletes have injuries. Even if we don't have injuries, preventative care is important for protecting our bodies, so that we can perform our best at the highest level," Cheung said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I see my nutritionist every week and we draw blood to collect my body's data, like white and red blood cell count, iron content and other data. Based on that information, we can see whether my body is healthy and in a normal state," Haughey said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If some numbers are not within the normal range or are out of range, my nutritionist will then suggest what I should eat so that I can supplement the missing nutrients."

    HKO to consider issuing T3 on Wednesday afternoon

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Observatory (HKO) says it will consider issuing a T3 on Wednesday afternoon as Severe Tropical Storm Toraji continues to move towards Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  The forecaster said it expects Toraji will skirt around 200 kilometres to the south of the territory on Thursday morning.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Depending on the intensity of Toraji at that time, the distance of its associated gale winds from the Pearl River Estuary, and the change in local wind conditions, the observatory will assess the need of issuing higher tropical cyclone warning signals," said Senior Scientific Officer Lee Shuk-ming.
  <br>
  <br>
  The existing T1 will remain in force until at least midday on Wednesday as Toraji is expected to maintain quite some distance from the SAR for the time being.
  <br>
  <br>
  Winds are expected to strengthen on Wednesday, the HKO said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The observatory also warned people to stay away from the shoreline and to avoid water sports.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Tuesday expressed confidence that Hong Kong's exchange traded-fund (ETF) market will continue to grow and reinforce the SAR's status as an international financial centre.
 <br>
  <br>
  At a ceremony marking the 25th anniversary of the Tracker Fund, Chan said the city has established itself as a leading ETF hub, offering a wide range of products and attracting many issuers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Created during the Asian financial crisis, the Tracker Fund has grown five-fold from an initial size of over HK$33 billion to become Hong Kong's largest ETF with a market cap of over HK$150 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Over the past 25 years, along with Hong Kong and our capital market, the Tracker Fund has demonstrated incredible resilience in navigating multiple challenges," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It has earned the trust of local, mainland and international investors seeking exposure to Hang Seng Index's constituent stock. It offers investors a simple way to invest in a diversified portfolio of Hong Kong stocks, mitigating the risks of excessive concentration in a very cost-effective manner."
  <br>
  <br>
  The finance chief added that the fund's global footprint is expanding, including listings on the Thai stock exchange and a new ETF on the Saudi stock exchange.

    'Govt and businesspeople have to work together more'

 Former National People's Congress Standing Committee member Tam Yiu-chung on Tuesday called for stronger communication between the SAR government and the city’s business community, saying officials could do more to support local enterprises.
 <br>
  <br>
  Tam, who's now vice-president of the think tank Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macau Studies, said that a key message that Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office Director Xia Baolong gave to local business leaders during a meeting last Friday, was for officials and businesses to work together to solve problems.
  <br>
  <br>
  On an RTHK programme, the veteran politician said the government could have done better in working hand-in-hand with businesspeople.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For example, when the government is granting permits, can the relevant government departments carry out approvals more proactively, and not delay them for an unnecessarily long time?" Tam queried.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that the authorities should also understand that nowadays it is difficult to do business and the government should cooperate with the sector whenever it can to boost confidence.
  <br>
  <br>
  President of the Chinese Manufacturers' Association Wingco Lo was among those attended the meeting with Xia.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said Xia noted that the logistics sector is one of Hong Kong's advantages.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Xia also mentioned that Hong Kong cannot go it alone. It has to work with the Greater Bay Area to form a port cluster, and cooperate with ports on the mainland to expand its transportation and logistics industry," Lo said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Agnes Chan, who chairs the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce, said there had been a "productive discussion" in Shenzhen on how the business community can leverage its expertise to help with the city's economic growth.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We must enhance our status as a premier maritime and aviation hub, as well as a vital land gateway to the mainland," she said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The chamber said apart from offering suggestions to the government, it will also organise overseas events to promote the SAR.

    Business leaders should 'show love for Hong Kong'

<div class="itemFullText">
 The top Beijing official overseeing Hong Kong affairs has told business leaders to show their love for the SAR and take concrete action to promote the economy, Chief Executive John Lee said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Xia Baolong, the director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, held exchanges with 29 business and industrial representatives during a seminar in Shenzhen last week.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters ahead of a weekly Exco meeting, the CE said Xia's message to businesses is that they should contribute to the overall well-being of the Hong Kong "family."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Of course, enterprises can make their decisions. But the key point is how much you love this place and how much you think you should contribute," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Whether it's just a business decision or whether you want to be showing your love to the people who live with you every day, showing your love to the home, which is the home for your children."
  <br>
  <br>
  Xia also told attendees to "wake up to the challenges and all collectively strengthen our competitiveness" while at the same time acknowledging the complexity of the world, Lee said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked what kind of concrete action should be taken, Lee said entrepreneurs and investors could take forward projects in the Northern Metropolis, adding that the government is rolling out larger pieces of land for developers in the area.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CE added that officials will soon promulgate a new development blueprint on tourism which will cover various areas to upgrade and transform the industry.
