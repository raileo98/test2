<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Thursday said they arrested 12 people, including seven police officers, on suspicion of money laundering, involving about HK$10.5 million.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, the force said the eight men and four women, aged between 28 and 68, allegedly laundered suspected criminal proceeds using 22 bank accounts between 2017 and last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two of the detained officers were also arrested for suspected fraud. They’d allegedly rented out their mortgaged residential properties between 2019 and last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officers from the Financial Intelligence and Investigation Bureau arrested the 12 people in Sheung Shui, Fanling, Tuen Mun and Kwai Chung on Thursday morning. The police officers were off-duty at the time of the arrests.
  <br>
  <br>
  The force said all seven officers, aged between 28 and 39, have been suspended from duty.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities stressed they attach great emphasis on the conduct of their officers, adding that those who breach the law will not be condoned.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Thursday said a Hongkonger who was rescued after being trapped in Southeast Asia was forced to work 17 hours a day and beaten for not meeting targets.
 <br>
  <br>
  Officers said the victim, 25, was lured by a social media job advertisement offering HK$120,000 to transport diamonds from Thailand to Taiwan.
  <br>
  <br>
  After arriving in Bangkok last October, he was taken to Myanmar and held in a mountain compound guarded by armed men.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lau Ho-tak, a chief inspector with the force, said the victim was forced to conduct online scams on social media.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Over the past three months, the victim was repeatedly beaten and denied meals because he failed to meet the fraud targets set by management staff at the compound. There are still visible injuries on his body," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police did not disclose whether the victim's family paid ransom in this case.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officers added that they are still in contact with some of the remaining 11 Hongkongers held captive in Southeast Asia and are trying all means to rescue them.
  <br>
  <br>
  The force warned members of the public to stay vigilant against overseas job offers that promise high salaries without requiring professional skills.

    Hong Kong Disneyland pleased with 2024 performance

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong Disneyland said on Thursday that it’s pleased with the theme park’s performance last year in terms of visitor numbers and revenue, and expects it to continue doing very well this year.
 <br>
  <br>
  The theme park’s vice president for communications and public affairs, Anita Lai, said the new 'World of Frozen' attraction, which opened in November 2023, was a big draw for tourists.
  <br>
  <br>
  “A year ago, we launched 'World of Frozen'. This is a movie and a story that people love,” Lai told reporters, adding that there’s been a surge in the number of mainland tourists buying the park’s annual pass.
  <br>
  <br>
  She pointed out that there was a double-digit growth in the number of Shenzhen visitors during last year’s Halloween compared to the same period in 2023, and that Hong Kong Disneyland Resort hotels reached 90 percent occupancy during the Christmas period.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said the park will step up promotions in both the mainland and Southeast Asian countries to entice more visitors during the Lunar New Year period.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked if the park is worried about vigorous competition with Ocean Park -- which will be putting the twin panda cubs on display next month -- Lai said Hong Kong Disneyland welcomes new events and highlights to inject momentum into the city's tourism industry.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Chinese Manufacturers' Association of Hong Kong has urged the government to provide more fiscal and tax support for local enterprises, including extending the principal moratorium arrangements to allow companies to delay their loan payments for a longer time.
 <br>
  <br>
  This was among an array of proposals it put forward to the administration on Thursday ahead of the financial budget next month.
  <br>
  <br>
  The association’s president Wingco Lo said small and medium-sized companies are facing several challenges at the moment.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Currently we are facing a couple of difficulties, like the pricing from the importer, and also the geopolitical pressure, and also the operating [costs]. We are suggesting the government have more support for the small and medium companies to promote local businesses," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  With Donald Trump set to return to the White House next week, Lo said more efforts are needed to diversify businesses to minimise the impact of possible tariffs and Sino-US tensions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lawmaker Jimmy Ng, and the association's executive committee member, said he wants to see more bilateral free trade agreements between the SAR and emerging economies.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We should now focus more on the Asean countries and the Belt and Road countries. For a traditional market they are either not rich enough now or they are not very friendly to us. So the international market is no longer only the States and Europe. We should look for other business economies for a better future."

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Airport Authority on Thursday unveiled a new development called "SKYTOPIA" for Hong Kong's Airport City, aiming to develop it into a world-class landmark.
 <br>
  <br>
  The authority unveiled the Airport City development blueprint which includes measures to expand AsiaWorld-Expo, build the city’s largest yacht bay, and set up the city’s first art storage facility.
  <br>
  <br>
  The three-runway system at the airport commenced operation in November last year, and will boost the airport’s capacity to 120 million passengers a year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chairman of the Airport Authority, Fred Lam, said the Airport City will be more than just about serving travellers using the airport.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We envisage that our airport will not be just a place for passengers to board their planes or a portal for entering Hong Kong,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Our vision is to develop SKYTOPIA into a landmark of its own and also a world leading destination, attracting visitors from within Hong Kong and its prosperous Greater Bay Area, as well as major markets in Asia and around the world.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Cissy Chan, an executive director with the authority, said the Airport City will integrate commercial and cultural activities, and will be a key economic driver for Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said the project would not only consolidate Hong Kong’s status as an international aviation hub, but also boost the city’s development in art trading and entertainment.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Airport Authority said the project would cost about HK$100 billion, including HK$30 billion on infrastructure.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police say they believe they have caught one of four people who raided a jewellery store in Sheung Shui on Wednesday evening and the man, 23, will be charged with robbery.
 <br>
  <br>
  Jewellery worth HK$1.5 million was stolen from a shop on San Fung Avenue by a group of people wielding knives and hammers who escaped in a private car, officers said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Weapons believed to be linked to the raid were later found in a car involved in a crash on Lam Kam Road, while clothes and masks officers suspect were worn by the robbers were found on a nearby hillside.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Through our investigation, we suspect that the vehicle that we mentioned had been surveilling the crime scene a couple of days before the incident took place," Chief Inspector Law Like-him said at a media briefing.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We suspect this shows it was a pre-planned, organised crime."
  <br>
  <br>
  The suspect, who was arrested in Pat Heung in the early hours of Thursday, is expected to appear in Tuen Mun Magistrates' Courts on Saturday, police said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Another Hongkonger held captive in Southeast Asia has been released and returned to Hong Kong on Thursday, officials said.
 <br>
  <br>
  No details were revealed as to what had happened to the SAR resident or how their ordeal came to an end.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Security Bureau, along with colleagues from the police force and the Immigration Department, immediately went to the airport to follow up, confirming that the rescued individual had arrived safely," an official post on social media said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Secretary for Security Chris Tang described the return as "good news".
  <br>
  <br>
  "My team and I will continue to follow up and hope that every Hong Kong resident [detained] can come home safely," he wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier this week, officials said 12 Hongkongers were being held prisoner in Myanmar and Cambodia after being tricked into travelling to Thailand on the false promise of well-paid work there. The captives are said to have been forced into taking part in scams.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police on Wednesday said two women also recently returned to Hong Kong after suffering a similar fate, with their families paying ransoms to secure their release.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tang met representatives from the Royal Thai Consulate-General on Thursday to discuss rescue plans for those still detained in the region.
  <br>
  <br>
  A government taskforce also went to Bangkok earlier this week to talk to officials there about the situation.

    First concert test to happen at main Kai Tak Stadium

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A charity concert is set to take place on Saturday at Kai Tak Sports Park, marking the main stadium's inaugural non-sporting event, with authorities saying it will serve as a test to simulate the logistics for future large-scale performances at the venue.
 <br>
  <br>
  Authorities said approximately 18,000 spectators will attend, with about 4,000 gathering on the ground-level turf area.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tang King-shing, the venue's director for strategic planning, said that assessing the turf's use will be one area of focus during their testing.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The stage and the spectators will be sitting on protective layer using I-track, it's the name of the protective layer, so there won't be any question of damaging the turf itself. So that's why before we have been emphasising the fact that as far as the surface of the main stadium is concerned, it's a flexible arrangement," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We can use genuine turf for high-quality football or rugby events and use the layer underneath, the I-track, for concert events like the one coming this Saturday by simply removing the turf."
  <br>
  <br>
  Commissioner for Sports George Tsoi said event organisers have chosen to close the roof for this concert to better test their acoustics and audio effects.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We hope we can have the opportunity to test out all the different elements and the coordination amongst our different staff and as well as the arrival and dispersal of our audience," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We hope that we can have good experience and further improve our operations in future."
  <br>
  <br>
  Tsoi said doors will open for concert goers at 4pm, with the performance scheduled to start at 6pm and wrap up before 8pm.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that attendees should have already gotten their tickets in advance and they should review the list of prohibited items prior to arriving.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tsoi said more test events are to come, with each one increasing in scale and sophistication, highlighting another large test on January 24 with over 60,000 participants to prepare for the official opening of the Sports Park in March.
  <br>
  <br>
  Principal Transport Officer/Urban of the Transport Department Eric Wan said the MTR will implement special service arrangements, including increased train frequencies, and KMB and Citybus will organise three bus routes serving East Kowloon, West Kowloon and Hong Kong Island during the dispersal period.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Security minister Chris Tang said on Thursday that a government taskforce's trip to Thailand this week has improved the chances of securing the release of a dozen Hongkongers being held captive in Southeast Asia.
 <br>
  <br>
  Tang said the delegation, led by his deputy Michael Cheuk, exchanged important information with Thai counterparts, as well as the Chinese Embassy.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Of course our country helps a lot. During their trip, our officials met officials at the Chinese Embassy in Thailand. Organisations from our country are also working behind the scenes to get the 12 home safely," he told NOW TV.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tang conceded, however, that it will not be easy to rescue those being held prisoner.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will do everything we can in the hope that we can secure the safe return of the 12," the minister said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tang said the Hongkongers, in their early 20s to 40s, were tricked into travelling to Thailand by gangs who falsely promised them well-paid jobs and good accommodation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two other SAR residents who suffered a similar fate were recently freed after their families paid ransoms, according to the police. Tang said people should contact the police if they are asked to hand over money to secure the release of relatives held captive.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tang also offered advice for people who suspect they have been tricked into travelling abroad, saying they should scream while in a public place and seek help immediately.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said from 2022 to 2023, 46 people from Hong Kong were deceived into working for scamming syndicates in Southeast Asia, with the majority eventually returning to the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said such crimes resurfaced in the second quarter of last year.

 Sources on Thursday said a man has been arrested in Pat Heung, in connection with an armed robbery in Sheung Shui the previous evening.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a statement released earlier, police said they suspect that four men, wielding knives and hammers, had robbed a jewellery shop on San Fung Avenue at around 6.30pm on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officers said the suspects fled the scene in a private car, which later crashed with another vehicle on Lam Kam Road near Ng Tung Chai.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police said three men then fled the crash scene.

<img alt="Lawmaker Johnny Ng says there's no urgent need to raise the amber travel alert for Thailand, given it remains safe to travel there. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1787765_1_20250116094448.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A lawmaker on Thursday said the great importance that both Hong Kong and Thai officials have attached to tackling the problem of so-called scam farms in Southeast Asian countries will help prevent citizens falling prey to fake job offers in future.
 <br>
  <br>
  This came as police in Hong Kong arrested a woman for allegedly luring two females from the SAR to Southeast Asia and forcing them to take part in scams.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 32-year-old has been charged with conspiracy to defraud.
  <br>
  <br>
  Undersecretary for Security Michael Cheuk led a delegation to Thailand earlier in the week to help 12 Hong Kong residents who were detained in Myanmar and Cambodia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme, Johnny Ng noted the two governments took the matter very seriously.
  <br>
  <br>
  He believes this will allow the public to realise the seriousness of the matter.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is a very, very good education to let the general public know that we cannot take free air tickets, or free hotels, hospitality... in order to get more unbalanced [rewards] from some jobs," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He suggested the SAR government reach out to its Myanmar and Cambodian counterparts directly, as well as step up cooperation with international police with the help of the central government.
  <br>
  <br>
  While Hong Kong raised the travel alert for Thailand to amber in 2014 due to mass demonstrations in the country, Ng said there was no urgent need to raise the alert level amid the current situation, as it remains a safe destination.

 Police on Wednesday said they arrested a man for attempted snatching, after the 39-year-old allegedly tried to take a police officer’s gun at the Tsim Sha Tsui police station.
 <br>
  <br>
  A statement said officers subdued the man, who was held at the station for an investigation in another case.
  <br>
  <br>
  The force said the arrested person is an off-duty officer who had earlier been arrested on suspicion of voyeurism.
  <br>
  <br>
  The man, along with two officers who subdued him, sustained injuries and was taken to hospital.

<img alt="Police have charged a 32-year-old suspected of tricking two women into travelling to Southeast Asia where they were forced to work for fraudsters.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police in Hong Kong on Wednesday said they had arrested and charged a woman after two people from the SAR were lured to Southeast Asia and forced to take part in scams, with the victims' families paying ransoms to have them freed.
 <br>
  <br>
  The announcement came as SAR officials vowed to work with Bangkok to try to rescue a dozen Hongkongers being held captive in countries neighbouring Thailand.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police said a beauty worker, 32, had been charged with conspiracy to defraud and was due to appear at Shatin Magistrates' Courts on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a press conference, officers said she was suspected of enticing two women, aged 21 and 23, to Thailand in late December. The women were driven to a "scam hub" in Myanmar where they were forced to take part in fraudulent activities, officers said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The pair returned to Hong Kong this month after their families paid ransoms, police said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The women told officers there were armed guards at the site where they were held and the area was surrounded by a barbed wire fence.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chief Inspector Yu Pok-hon said the arrested woman is believed to have socialised with the two victims to gain their trust, before offering them free travel and job opportunities in Thailand.
  <br>
  <br>
  The force urged people to be wary of online adverts promising jobs with large salaries, and not to put too much trust in friends they have made only recently.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Security Secretary Chris Tang said he has been briefed by a government task force sent to Thailand over reports of other Hongkongers being held in dangerous locations after being tricked into travelling to Bangkok.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tang said the administration will continue to liaise with Thai authorities to bring home 12 SAR residents being held prisoner in Myanmar and Cambodia.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than a dozen other victims have already returned to Hong Kong, officials said on Tuesday.

    HK saw more than 44 million visitors in 2024

<img alt="The government said the 44.5 million visitor arrivals last year were in line with estimates. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1787653_1_20250115153427.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Wednesday said that Hong Kong saw 44.5 million tourist arrivals in 2024, in part boosted by Beijing's relaxation of visa rules for Shenzhen residents.
 <br>
  <br>
  Tourism minister Rosanna Law said the figure represented a near one-third increase from the year before, and was in line with estimates.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since the start of December, Shenzhen residents with the visas have been allowed to visit the SAR for as many times as they like, compared to a previous restriction of one trip per week.
  <br>
  <br>
  Law said last month, there were more than 3.1 million mainland visitor arrivals, or an average of more than 100,000 a day.
  <br>
  <br>
  That was a 17-percent rise from the daily average in November.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The government will make good use of the various measures benefiting Hong Kong to promote the all-round development of Hong Kong’s tourism industry," the minister said in a written reply to the legislature.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said officials will maintain communication with different ministries of the central government, with a view to enable more travellers from the mainland to visit the SAR in a flexible and convenient manner.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Tourism Board, meanwhile, noted that for the annual number of visitors, more than 10 million were from places outside the mainland, representing a 44 percent jump year on year.
  <br>
  <br>
  It noted that out of the 44.5 million arrivals, half of them spent at least one night in Hong Kong, and they stay for around three nights here on average.
  <br>
  <br>
  DAB lawmaker Brave Chan asked if the government would get the United Nation's culture agency, Unesco, to include Hong Kong on its list of "World Cities of Gastronomy".
  <br>
  <br>
  Law said there are now 50 such cities, with Macau, Chengdu, Shunde, Yangzhou, Huaian and Chaozhou the six Chinese places on the list.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said officials will study the matter with reference to the experience of cities on the list.

    EV charging providers urged to improve transparency

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Consumer Council on Wednesday urged charging service providers to improve transparency following complaints about electric vehicle (EV) charging facilities across Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  The watchdog received 179 complaints last year on issues such as unstable power supply, insufficient charging spots and fee disputes.
  <br>
  <br>
  In one case, an EV owner found his overnight charging sessions had been interrupted and his vehicle was left without sufficient power.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another complainant reported she was charged HK$150 in idle fees without being notified – nearly ten times the actual charging cost.
  <br>
  <br>
  The council’s chief executive, Gilly Wong, said service providers should explain the way they set fees.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is a free market, they can charge according to different business models. It could be charged by kilowatts, it could be charged by time, or it could be charged by a monthly plan,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We urge the service providers to align and standardise the unit that they use."
  <br>
  <br>
  The council reminded EV owners to carefully review charging plans and pricing details before use, and to promptly vacate charging spots to avoid idle fees.

    'Some tumblers have lower capacity than advertised'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Some brands of tumblers and travel mugs have a lower capacity than is claimed, the Consumer Council said on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The watchdog also found that plastic mugs are not as effective in keeping drinks hot or cold.
  <br>
  <br>
  The council tested 18 models of tumblers and travel mugs, which claimed a capacity from 350ml to 900ml.
  <br>
  <br>
  But only four models had the actual capacity that was stated. The rest of them held less liquid than claimed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Five mugs or tumblers, from Muji, 24Bottles, Decathlon, National Geographic, and PoleBear, were found to have a discrepancy in capacity of more than 10 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The Council reminds manufacturers that their product design must take into consideration the actual usage by consumers and clearly and accurately state on the product label the actual capacity,” said convenor of the council’s advisory group on digital economy and information technology Jack Poon.
  <br>
  <br>
  The watchdog also passed the results to the Customs and Excise Department for potential follow up actions.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the thermal insulation efficacy test, two stainless steel tumblers from NOC and Stanley performed well as they were able to keep the water temperature at over 60 degrees Celsius after six hours.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thirteen models could maintain the water temperature at above 40 degrees Celsius, but the water temperature in three plastic mugs or tumblers, dropped significantly to between 29 and 26.3 degrees.
  <br>
  <br>
  For cold drinks with temperatures from five degrees to minus one degree Celsius, temperatures from three plastic models rose to as much as 22 degrees after six hours.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two-thirds of samples showed a satisfactory performance in the leak-proof test.
  <br>
  <br>
  The council reminded people to clean their tumblers or mugs as often as they could and recommended they use tools like small brushes to wash narrow bottles.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It's better for you to clean it thoroughly because you never know when the pathogenic bacteria will breed in your container. So the cleaner it is, the better for your food safety,” the council’s chief executive Gilly Wong said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “When you buy this kind of tumbler, check out how many parts they have so that you know you have to open it up and how to clean it and put it back, ensure that you know it performs as well as its original,” she said.

 Hong Kong may need to import halal food for all the Muslim tourists it aims to entice to the city, a minister said on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Plans for new measures to attract visitors from the Middle East and Southeast Asia were announced in last year's chief executive policy address.
  <br>
  <br>
  On RTHK's Overview Policy programme, Deputy Chief Secretary Warner Cheuk said as Hong Kong develops into a Muslim-friendly tourist destination, halal food could be brought in from abroad.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong may not have many Muslims, but we need to make a lot of halal food. There are many Muslim countries in Asean, and we can attract restaurants and import food from these nations," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other government moves aimed at attracting more visitors from Muslim nations include encouraging hotels to set up worship facilities, and persuading taxi drivers to provide information in Arabic.

    'Alimony mediation helps divorcees reach settlement'

<div class="itemFullText">
 A pilot scheme which helps separating or divorcing couples from low-income families handle spouse maintenance has processed nearly 40 cases in the first two months since its introduction, taking less than a month on average to close a file.
 <br>
  <br>
  In October last year, authorities introduced a programme through the Community Care Fund to offer free mediation services.
  <br>
  <br>
  The initiative, set to last for three years, aims to process a total of 1,200 cases and help 2,400 people who are going through a separation or divorce.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alice Mak, secretary for home and youth affairs, said the scheme handled 38 cases relating to alimony as of the end of November.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Sixty percent of the cases have either reached an agreement or partially made an agreement, meaning there's an outcome from the mediation. For those completed cases, it takes roughly 24 days from opening to closing a file," she said during an exclusive interview with RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We can see that these mediation services have indeed helped some divorcees to reach maintenance agreements. Some of the participants told us that they found it helpful and they would recommend programme to those in need around them."
  <br>
  <br>
  As for the remaining 40 percent, Mak said the administration would look into possible follow-up actions after collecting more data.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, the minister said her bureau and the Family Council will jointly organise the "Hong Kong Excellent Family Awards" in the second quarter, with participants being judged on a number of areas.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said families must show how well they support each other and whether they have experiences on educating the next generation which are worthy of being referenced, among other criteria.

<img alt="Miachel Cheuk accepted a petition from Kelvin, whose brother is among those detained in Southeast Asia. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1787597_2_20250115102627.jpg&q=85">

<div class="itemFullText">
 Undersecretary for Security Michael Cheuk said he hopes 12 Hong Kong residents who remain unlawfully detained in Southeast Asia can come home before Chinese New Year, as a six-member task force he led concluded their two-day trip to Thailand.
 <br>
  <br>
  Cheuk was also pleased with the progress made by the task force, and expressed gratitude to their Thai counterparts for attaching great importance to the matter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters upon landing at Hong Kong airport on Tuesday evening, the former assistant police commissioner confirmed that 11 of the trapped SAR residents are in Myanmar, while the remaining one is in Cambodia.
  <br>
  <br>
  He described their locations as chaotic and not safe, while armed forces are also present.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cheuk pointed out that all of the victims fell for job scams, and were lured by the syndicates to Bangkok and picked up at the airport.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So far, none of the 72 people who sought assistance were abducted. In this regard, Thailand remains a very safe place," he said, although he cautioned against visiting regions bordering Myanmar, Laos or Cambodia.
  <br>
  <br>
  SAR authorities will now reach out to their counterparts in Myanmar, but admitted the situation was quite complicated.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cheuk also quoted Thai officials as saying that safety measures will be rolled out this week to enhance the safety of tourists.
  <br>
  <br>
  These include a 24-hour hotline that supports eight languages, and a mobile app that allows users to share their real-time location to law enforcement in emergency situations.
  <br>
  <br>
  The number two security official in Hong Kong also explained why the task force embarked on a visit to Thailand when the SAR residents are held elsewhere.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said Thailand has a lot of exchanges with neighbouring countries both historically and culturally, and Thai officials have numerous ways to talk to people in the region, including unofficial means.
  <br>
  <br>
  Before he left the airport, Cheuk received a petition letter from a man whose brother is among those unlawfully detained.
  <br>
  <br>
  The man, who gave his name as Kelvin, hopes to meet the task force soon and receive the latest update on the situation.

    Test strips to be used to detect space oil drug

<img alt="The rapid test kit contains a swabbing strip, a bottle of solution, a pair of surgical gloves, and a sample bag. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1787604_2_20250115101808.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police will begin using rapid test kits to detect a regulated sedative from Saturday to tackle the emerging use of the space oil drug.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chief Inspector of the narcotics bureau Kelvin Cheung said the test will serve as an aid during operations when officers suspect products could contain etomidate, a short-acting anaesthetic normally used as an ingredient for the narcotic.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The officers will conduct the stop-and-search in an ordinary manner. When they find the vapes, they will conduct enquiries, they will ask questions, and they will also conduct observations before conducting the interception," Cheung said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If they, after conducting all the necessary enquiries at the scene, are still unable to form the reasonable belief, and they still suspect that the vapes actually contain etomidate... they will use the test kit."
  <br>
  <br>
  The kit contains a testing strip used to swab samples of alternative smoking products. It will then be mixed with a solution that can show a positive or negative result in less than a minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  The accuracy of the test can reach up to 99 percent, Cheung said, adding that the force has procured a sufficient amount of testing kits.
  <br>
  <br>
  Etomidate is a controlled drug that is prescribed by a doctor and is currently classified as a Part 1 poison.
  <br>
  <br>
  The number of arrests relating to the controlled drug skyrocketed from eight in 2023 to 206 in the first 11 months of last year. Nearly 23 percent of those arrested last year were people aged below 21, with the youngest being only 12 years old.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sky, who is said to be about 20 years old, first got a taste of the space oil drug at a bar. Speaking at a police press event, Sky said it looked like a normal e-cigarette. Sky later became addicted to the drug and started experiencing memory loss.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Sometimes I forgot what I did. I also had errors in my judgement. When my friends saw the traffic light was red, I thought it was green and walked out onto the road," Sky said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Leo Man, from the Hong Kong Federation of Youth Groups, told the same event that etomidate is very addictive. He said there has been a case where someone taking the drug died after mistaking a window for a door.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government is planning to list etomidate as a dangerous drug on February 14.
  <br>
  <br>
  Once listed, those illegally possessing or consuming space oil drugs containing the sedative would face a maximum of seven years in prison and a fine of HK$1 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  And those trafficking or illegally importing the drug would be liable to a maximum penalty of life imprisonment and a fine of HK$5 million.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The government's task force to help Hong Kong residents who were allegedly lured to Southeast Asian countries to engage in illegal work on Tuesday concluded its visit to Thailand.
 <br>
  <br>
  Led by Under Secretary for Security Michael Cheuk, the task force arrived in the country on Sunday to follow up on the cases.
  <br>
  <br>
  A government statement said Cheuk received positive feedback in a Tuesday meeting to exchange intelligence with Thailand's senior inspector general Thatchai Pitaneelaboot.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pitaneelaboot said Thai authorities will further strengthen the prevention of transnational crimes, and do their utmost to assist the safe return of Hong Kong residents.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cheuk also met Thailand's vice minister for tourism and sports Jakkaphon Tangsutthitham and the commissioner of the tourist police bureau Saksira Pheuak-um to learn about the latest measures to protect tourists.
  <br>
  <br>
  Members of the task force later met a deputy commissioner general of the Thai National Police Prachuab Wongsuk to reflect the situation of the cases involving Hong Kong residents.
  <br>
  <br>
  The statement also said Cheuk expressed gratitude to the Chinese Embassy in Thailand and Thai authorities for attaching great importance to the requests for assistance from Hong Kong people.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[Authorities] will continue to maintain close liaison with the embassy and the Thai authorities in the future to exchange intelligence on the latest situation of the cases, and to provide appropriate advice and all practicable assistance to the assistance seekers and their families," it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The task force is expected to return to Hong Kong on Tuesday night.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A scholar has been convicted of killing his wife and daughter with a yoga ball filled with lethal gas following a retrial, with a High Court judge sentencing him to life imprisonment.
 <br>
  <br>
  A seven-member jury unanimously found Khaw Kim Sun, a former Chinese University medical professor, guilty of causing the deaths of his wife and second child, after less than four hours of deliberation.
  <br>
  <br>
  The academic appeared calm when the verdict was handed down and chose not to make a mitigation plea.
  <br>
  <br>
  He had been accused of putting a yoga ball filled with carbon monoxide in the boot of a Mini Cooper in 2015, with the gas leaking out and killing the pair.
  <br>
  <br>
  Khaw was first convicted of two counts of murder in 2018 and sentenced to life behind bars.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2023, the top court quashed his murder conviction and ordered a retrial, after ruling the initial trial judge had misdirected the jury.
  <br>
  <br>
  During the retrial that began in November last year, Khaw opted to defend himself and claimed he had bought carbon monoxide for an experiment.
  <br>
  <br>
  But prosecutors challenged his claims, saying the experiment was a "sham" to hide his real motive of possessing the lethal gas.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Tuesday launched a caring food coupon programme, allowing elderly people in need to taste dishes at discounted prices from the Lunar New Year holiday.
 <br>
  <br>
  About 50,000 seniors, including those living alone, will receive a set of five coupons so they can try signature dishes from five catering groups for just HK$25 each.
  <br>
  <br>
  The coupons will be accepted from January 29 to late March.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chief Secretary Eric Chan, who officiated at a launching ceremony, said he hopes the elderly people will feel warmth through the programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is a collaboration between the government, the business sector and the community, building a harmonious and caring society together," Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are going to test out this programme, and see how to review it based on the experience. We hope more catering groups and restaurants will participate in the future."
  <br>
  <br>
  One of the fast food chains taking part in the programme, Café de Coral, said it is a meaningful way to help the elderly.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This time, we have HK$25 baked pork chop rice, which is our signature dish. All the Café de Coral stores will offer this special price for the programme's participants," general manager Nelson Lo said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other chains will offer dishes like boneless Hainan chicken rice, fish burgers, and char siu rice with sunny-side up eggs.

<img alt="About a third of mainland residents in Hong Kong felt the SAR could cut down on red tape. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1787463_1_20250114144638.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Nearly a third of mainland students and workers in Hong Kong said there is too much red tape in the city, according to a survey by a concern group helping young mainlanders.
 <br>
  <br>
  Around 800 young and educated mainlanders who are working or studying in Hong Kong, participated in an online survey jointly conducted by the Youth Expats Association and two lawmakers, Gary Zhang and Johnny Ng.
  <br>
  <br>
  The respondents were asked about their life in Hong Kong and their perspectives on the economy, culture and policies in the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 30 percent said there is too much red tape in Hong Kong, such as regulations governing money transfers.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The banking system is very troublesome if you want to make a legal transfer back to mainland China,” Zhang said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said some drifters also encountered difficulties when starting a business in Hong Kong, such as getting licences.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Like if they want to open a restaurant, the requirements from different government departments are quite complicated and stringent,” Zhang said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some 45 percent of respondents also said they had trouble building connections at work.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zhang said the drifters also needed more support as they do not have family and friends in Hong Kong, and the language barrier also hindered them from building relationships in the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 10 percent of respondents found there was a lack of smoking areas in Hong Kong, and think the government should not impose more tobacco control measures at this stage.

 Serious misuse of public housing could be made a criminal offence, Housing Department sources said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  At present the toughest punishment for tenants who break the rules, for example by subletting their units or using them for business purposes, is eviction.
  <br>
  <br>
  But plans are in place to amend the Housing Ordinance to allow the Housing Authority to prosecute offenders, with proposed fines of up to HK$500,000 and jail terms of up to a year.
  <br>
  <br>
  It's understood the authority also wants officials to be given the power to check the identity of any suspicious people they encounter while carrying out inspections at public flats. Anyone who refuses to hand over their details could be fined HK$10,000 or imprisoned for six months.
  <br>
  <br>
  Providing false statements to the authorities can already lead to prosecution, but officials want to extend the time period for bringing cases to court to six years after the offence, or one year after it is discovered, whichever comes first.
  <br>
  <br>
  The authority's subsidised housing committee held a meeting on Tuesday morning to discuss the plans.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters afterwards, Cleresa Wong, who chairs the committee, said she believes the proposed legislation would have a deterrent effect.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We do not propose to encompass all abuses under the new piece of legislation that we are proposing. We will only focus on the severe abuses and the reason is because if convicted, the people who are charged with these kinds of crimes would be criminalised, and they would have a criminal record. And so that, I think, is a deterrence,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The proposed legal amendments would not be applied retrospectively, it is believed.
  <br>
  <br>
  “As a matter of law, legal principles, it is very rare for a government to introduce crimes with retrospective effect because this is somehow contrary to natural justice and fairness,” Wong said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I think that would have a very draconian effect and that should be avoided in my personal view.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Sources said the proposals will be reviewed by Legco's housing panel next month and are still subject to change.
  <br>
  <br>
  It’s believed the authority hopes to bring a bill to Legco for vetting in April.

 Chief Executive John Lee said on Tuesday authorities will comprehensively investigate any suspected links people or organisations may have with those who endanger national security, to see if any support or assistance has been given.
 <br>
  <br>
  His comments came a day after prominent pollster Robert Chung was was taken away from his home on Monday morning, and brought to the Wong Chuk Hang office of the Public Opinion Research Institute (Pori), of which he is president and chief executive officer.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officers also took away computers and boxes of materials from his office.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sources said the investigation was to do with his former deputy at the institute, Chung Kim-wah, who was put on the national security wanted list last month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ahead of the Executive Council meeting, Lee said professional bodies have nothing to worry about if they have no intention to break the law, saying the security laws clearly define what constitutes an offence.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If professional organisations don't have any intention to endanger national security, they just need to follow their own work process, their ethics, their code of conduct in carrying on with their business, and that will be fine," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's stated clearly in the law which sorts of acts constitute offences. And then each time, in every operation, the law enforcement agency will explain clearly what sorts of acts constitute the offence of endangering national security."
  <br>
  <br>
  The chief executive stressed that officers will get to the bottom of every case in accordance with the law.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, sources said the wife and son of Chung Kim-wah were taken to the police station to assist with the investigation.

 Chief Executive John Lee said on Tuesday that plans to redevelop a cluster of government buildings in Wan Chai will go ahead, even though his predecessor, Carrie Lam, is moving her office there.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lam's relocation to Immigration Tower later this year comes after lawmakers complained about how much public money is being spent on the rent for her current office in Pacific Place.
  <br>
  <br>
  Immigration Tower is earmarked for redevelopment, with the building to be used for conventions and commercial use.
  <br>
  <br>
  Before the weekly Executive Council meeting, Lee said Lam's move will be temporary and will ensure the proper use of government resources.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Wan Chai redevelopment plan will go ahead as planned," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The buildings that have been vacated, we should make good use of them. That is why we're now renovating, so as to allow the former chief executive to move in."
  <br>
  <br>
  The government earlier explained that Lam rented the Grade A office space in Admiralty after her term ended in 2022 because there was no room for her at offices for former CEs in Mid-Levels.

 Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday said the government is doing what it can to help Hong Kong residents who were reportedly lured to Southeast Asia for illegal work.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters before the weekly Executive Council meeting, Lee said a task force led by Under Secretary for Security Michael Cheuk has made significant progress.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The visit by the Security Bureau task force I think has achieved some positive results, and they have been met by the Minister of Justice in Thailand," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Thailand officials have already indicated that they will attach great importance to the cases and try all their means to try to rescue those Hong Kong people who are [in captivity]."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee added that authorities will consider various factors when deciding whether to raise Thailand's travel alert to red.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have included a lot of information on the Security Bureau's web page in relation to travel information to Thailand, so I have asked the SB [Security Bureau] to update it regularly with the latest information and developments."
  <br>
  <br>
  SAR officials have received 28 requests for assistance in relation to Hong Kong residents who are allegedly being detained in various Southeast Asian countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sixteen of these people have already returned to Hong Kong, while the other 12 remain stranded.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong passport holders can obtain tourist visas when they arrive at designated control points in Saudi Arabia starting on Wednesday, Chief Executive John Lee announced.
 <br>
  <br>
  Visitors can apply for a multiple-entry visa with stays for up to 90 days or a single-entry visa for a maximum 30-day stay.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That means holders of [an] SAR passport could visit all six members of the Cooperation Council of the Arab States, including Kuwait, Qatar, UAE, Oman and so on," Lee told reporters on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So they could all enjoy either visa-free access or visa-on-arrival application on arrival."
  <br>
  <br>
  Also from Wednesday, Saudi Arabian nationals will be able to visit Hong Kong without a visa for up to 90 days instead of 30, Lee added.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, the Immigration Department said the new arrangements would foster closer ties between the two places.
  <br>
  <br>
  "These arrangements and the extension of the visa-free visit period for nationals of Saudi Arabia will enhance tourism, cultural and economic ties between the two places."

    Three hurt in excavator, rubbish truck smash

<div class="itemFullText">
 Three men were injured on Tuesday when a rubbish truck was crushed by a collapsing noise barrier that had been hit by an out-of-control excavator.
 <br>
  <br>
  The excavator rolled down a slope at a construction site in Lin Tak Road, Lam Tin at around 9.40am, firefighters said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The drivers of both vehicles were among those hurt, but were able to free themselves and were said to have suffered minor injuries.
  <br>
  <br>
  A passenger was trapped in the truck and firefighters spent about two hours freeing him.
  <br>
  <br>
  “After conducting a risk assessment and stabilising the injured person, the Disaster Response and Rescue Team arranged a crane to secure and lift the excavator and the stone block, while simultaneously using explosive tools to create enough space to enable us to rescue him,” Assistant Divisional Officer Kao Chung-lei said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The three men aged between 25 to 50, were conscious when taken to United Christian Hospital for treatment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police said they were investigating the cause of the incident.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong Construction Industry Employees General Union said frontline staff and inspectors should do more to ensure site safety.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Working on-site we have safety personnel and construction workers. They all bear significant responsibility. In situations like this, it's important to find out whether the frontline construction workers and management did their jobs properly," said chairman Chau Sze-kit.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Edward Ma from the Association for the Rights of Industrial Accident Victims said the group is really worried about serious industrial accidents occurring two days in a row, adding that safety awareness is still lacking.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eleven people were injured in a scaffolding collapse at a construction site in Kai Tak on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The code of practice on bamboo scaffolding safety was revised in October, requiring workers to hold a valid safety training certificate before carrying out such works.
  <br>
  <br>
  Labour minister Chris Sun said on Tuesday that the administration would hold a conference with relevant stakeholders to seek improvements in the industry workflow.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Apart from looking into whether or not those involved, have fully complied with the code of practice, we have to look at, which is why we're going to hold a stakeholders conference, inviting not just those involved in scaffolding work, but also the principal contractors as well as those responsible for installing external glass walls,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It's because we have to look at not just the scaffolding work itself, but also the workflow, and also the related work procedures.”
  <br>
  <br>
  He added the government will step up its inspections, as well as take enforcement action against those violating the law.

    Thailand still safe for tourists: travel agency boss

<img alt="Thailand is one of Hong Kong residents' favourite destinations, attracting around 1 million visitors from the SAR each year before Covid.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A leading travel agency said on Tuesday it has no plans to adjust the itinerary of its package tours to Thailand, amid an ongoing investigation by the Hong Kong government to see if any SAR resident was unlawfully detained there.
 <br>
  <br>
  In an interview with RTHK, EGL Tours executive director Steve Huen insisted Thailand remains safe for recreational travellers, and dismissed fears that people would be abducted on the streets.
  <br>
  <br>
  He pointed out the SAR's amber outbound travel alert was issued years ago in response to mass demonstrations in Thailand, and had nothing to do with the current situation.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Huen admitted that enquiries for travel products in the region have dropped. A few individual customers who decided to go ahead signed up for package tours because they felt safer to stick to a group, he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  He did offer some general tips for travellers whenever they are overseas.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When heading out at night for a drink or walk, you should be careful," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You should also stay alert, and for instance, not let others exploit our kindness and trick us into into suffering financial losses."
  <br>
  <br>
  He was confident the jitters will die down soon, especially after government officials clarified on Monday that none of the Hongkongers involved in the alleged incidents of false imprisonment were abducted
  <br>
  <br>
  A task force led by Undersecretary for Security Michael Cheuk is expected to return from Bangkok on Tuesday evening.

<img alt="CES 2025 saw more than 138,000 attendees, according to the Consumer Technology Association. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1787411_1_20250114100720.jpg&q=45">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Everything from autonomous snow blowers to humanoid robots filled the show floors at this year's Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas.
 <br>
  <br>
  Considered the World Cup of technology, the world's largest personal electronics convention wrapped up on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Making their tech presence felt at the four-day event were nearly 100 registered companies from Hong Kong, more than half supported by the Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks Corporation (HKSTP).
  <br>
  <br>
  "So this year, we bring 51 companies from Hong Kong... it's actually a huge growth compared to last year. Last year we have about 18," says Derek Chim, Head of Startup Ecosystem at HKSTP.
  <br>
  <br>
  HKSTP-supported companies brought in three CES Innovation Awards.
  <br>
  <br>
  One of those, Vidi Labs, demonstrated how their wearable device - with AI-driven software - could describe the surrounding environment for a visually-impaired user.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This actually proves a lot that the route that we are on is actually the right one, because a product like this not only is for Hong Kong, it's actually for the rest of the world," said Turzo Bose, co-founder & CEO of Vidi Labs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Also at the Hong Kong Pavilion, South Korean Minji Seo - who earned her PhD in Hong Kong - displays technology that rejuvenates your eyeballs with hot yoga therapy. It's intended to help people with dry eyes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We create a vacuum seal, using the silicone band around the goggle, and that's the chamber that we are controlling the temperature and pressure. Our main goal to join this event was to, like, verify whether we have a market here. And we definitely verified it," said Seo, founder of Ooley Care.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another Hong Kong exhibitor, Michael Wong - a veteran of the Hong Kong hair care industry - uses a scanner to take images of your hair and scalp, and provide an analysis and recommendation for the right shampoo, conditioner and treatment.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We use over millions of pictures to train our AI models so that's why it's accurate, over 90 percent. So everything just can do it within three minutes. So every American has their hair growth again, said Wong, founder and CEO of HairCoSys.
  <br>
  <br>
  His showmanship helps his startup, HairCoSys, stand out among the more than 4,500 exhibitors.
  <br>
  <br>
  But so do products with unique compositions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fever Chu, co-founder of Zence Object Technology, displays everything from a TV remote that integrates recycled tea leaves, to a calculator frame composed of coffee grounds.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are using their waste and turn it into new material and give back to them. Somehow we can help them to promote their waste product, the material, to the bigger market," said Chu.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chu says their products have drawn plenty of interest.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Last night... over 60 [emails] within two days to the potential clients."

 Security chief Chris Tang on Monday said senior Thai officials have promised to do all they could to secure the safe return of Hongkongers who were reportedly lured to Southeast Asia for illegal work.
 <br>
  <br>
  "The minister of justice gave great importance of our concern, and had responded positively. [Thai authorities] said they would do their utmost to help with the safe return of the Hong Kong people," said Tang, who stressed that none of those involved were abducted.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tang's comments came as a task force, led by Under Secretary for Security Michael Cheuk, met Thai officials and representatives of the Chinese embassy in Bangkok.
  <br>
  <br>
  They spoke with representatives from Thailand's justice ministry who sit on the Anti Trafficking-in-Persons Committee chaired by the country's prime minister.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cheuk said he is confident that Thai authorities would do their best to help those affected, noting that Hongkongers involved had been brought to areas near borders with Myanmar and Laos.
  <br>
  <br>
  He declined to disclose further details, saying that the SAR government wishes to rescue these residents as soon as possible.
  <br>
  <br>
  The task force also held talks with Wu Zhiwu, the deputy chief of mission at the Chinese embassy in Thailand, on topics such as offering consular assistance, before meeting with staff at the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office in the Thai capital to discuss further actions.
  <br>
  <br>
  The delegation is set to meet representatives of the Royal Thai Police on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  SAR authorities have so far received 28 requests for assistance in relation to Hong Kong residents alleging to be detained in Southeast Asian countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sixteen of these people have already returned to Hong Kong, while the remaining 12 reported that there were restrictions on their movement but were safe and able to remain in touch with the task force.

    'Marriage a goal for many same-sex couples in HK'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A survey carried out by Chinese University researchers suggests many same-sex couples in Hong Kong would like to get married one day.
 <br>
  <br>
  The government last year said it was working on an alternative legal framework, after the city's top court ordered authorities to look at how to recognise same-sex relationships by October.
  <br>
  <br>
  CUHK researchers on Monday said a survey involving 908 people who identify as members of sexual minorities in Hong Kong in 2023 found 90 percent believe same-sex marriage is important, and around 70 percent would like to get married themselves one day.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Right now, so for married heterosexual couples, they already have an existing framework. So if they can pass on kind of the same pattern of laws, which they can call civil partnership, they can call it marriage, but then make it comparable to non-heterosexual couples, then that would be great," said Alan, who joined the researchers' press conference along with his partner Hong.
  <br>
  <br>
  The couple, who wed in the US in 2022, said the lack of legal recognition of same-sex marriages in Hong Kong at the moment can pose challenges.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For example, when my spouse gets sick, I would like to use my insurance package from work so that he can also be covered for medical visits. But I know in Hong Kong, not all insurance companies explicitly state that your spouse also includes same-sex couples," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And also inheritance rights, that's also a significant hurdle for us," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, CUHK said another survey involving 146 people with non-heterosexual children found more than half of the parents were worried their sons and daughters would not get married due to their sexual orientation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Seventy percent of the parents expressed fears that their children would have no one to take care of them when they are older.

    Four critically injured in scaffolding collapse

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Eleven people on Monday were injured in a scaffolding collapse at a construction site in Kai Tak, with four in critical condition and one seriously hurt.
 <br>
  <br>
  Emergency personnel received reports of the incident on Shing Cheong Road at around 4pm.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bamboo structure, measuring 60 by 20 metres, was said to give way at the site where the New Acute Hospital is being built.
  <br>
  <br>
  One worker was temporarily trapped five metres above ground after the collapse, according to firefighters, who said the rescue operation took about an hour.
  <br>
  <br>
  Given the seriousness of the incident, police said they are working with government departments to conduct in-depth investigations.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We would see whether anyone should bear criminal responsibility... The cause of the scaffolding collapse is one of the directions of our investigation," said senior Inspector Li Ka-wai of the Kowloon East regional crime unit.
  <br>
  <br>
  The project at the Kai Tak Development Area is set to be one of the largest hospitals in Hong Kong, with 2,400 beds, and 37 operating theatres.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hospital Authority (HA) expressed concerns over the incident and said the injured workers were hired by the contractor, China State Construction Engineering (Hong Kong) Limited.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The incident occurred at one of the buildings at the new acute hospital construction site, where curtain wall installation works were undergone," the authority said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "All scaffolding work at the site will be temporarily suspended, and the HA reserves the right to hold the construction contractor accountable."
  <br>
  <br>
  The authority has instructed the contractor to implement all necessary safety measures as soon as possible and requested it to thoroughly investigate the cause of the incident and to submit a report.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fay Siu from the Association for the Rights of Industrial Accident Victims noted that a similar incident happened in Kai Tak almost a year ago, saying it showed that there are safety hazards when bamboo scaffolding is used.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The government should review the safety of bamboo scaffolding, because they are not made from a very stable material," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If we are continuing to use bamboo scaffolding, there should be better inspections. The use of metal scaffolding should be encouraged too."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong Construction Industry Employees General Union has also strongly urged labour authorities to conduct an in-depth probe and make its report public.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Labour Department must seriously learn from the hard lessons of past industrial accidents, quickly review regulatory and enforcement loopholes, swiftly address deficiencies, and effectively strengthen supervision and inspection work," it said.

    'Reducing sodium will not affect dim sum taste'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Centre for Food Safety of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department urged dim sum restaurants to reduce sodium content in their dishes after its survey revealed that a small decrease in salt would not affect its taste.
 <br>
  <br>
  The department conducted a test among 72 people to evaluate standard and reduced-sodium samples of two types of classic dim sum dishes, including shrimp siu mai and steamed pork ribs in black bean sauce.
  <br>
  <br>
  The results showed that only 15 people were able to identify the altered shrimp siu mai, while only 13 spotted the modified steamed pork ribs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tony Chow, principal medical officer of risk assessment and communication at the Centre for Food Safety, said restaurants could consider choosing ingredients with lower sodium content or using natural ingredients for flavouring and marinating.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We advise the [dim sum] trade to consider the reformulation of the dim sum so that the sodium content can be reduced because our study indicates that for the 10 to 20 percent reduction in sodium, the consumer will not differentiate the difference in the sodium content," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They should not worry [that] the less salty food will be rejected by the consumer."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chow also said people should request that their dim sum be served separately from sauces when possible, and to taste before including additional flavouring.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also recommended that people share dim sum dishes when possible to avoid indulging, adding that the elderly should be more mindful of sodium levels when choosing their dishes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The department said the World Health Organisation recommends less than five grammes of salt intake daily, as excessive sodium intake could increase the risk of high blood pressure, and other diseases.

    HK can help companies diversify risk: FS

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan said on Monday that Hong Kong can offer professional services to companies seeking to diversify risk by moving their businesses to different places.
 <br>
  <br>
  At the annual Asian Financial Forum, the minister noted that many firms are realigning or restructuring their industrial and supply chains across different countries, particularly in the Global South.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said Hong Kong, as a supply chain management centre, has things to offer companies seeking diversification.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The [firms] would require project finance, corporate treasury and logistics services, professional consultancies and extensive international connections," Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong is well positioned and geared up to provide all these services as a one-stop shop to help businesses expand their presence in the region and beyond effectively."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said the SAR will navigate the global geopolitical and economic landscape with caution and confidence, saying opportunities come with every challenge.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that Hong Kong can also offer technological solutions and sustainable development for the region, with its plans to develop an innovation and technology cooperation zone with Shenzhen in the Hetao area, also known as the Lok Ma Chau Loop.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said the SAR is looking to expand in areas such as artificial intelligence, biotech and new energy.
  <br>
  <br>
  And the Loop, he said, is an example of Hong Kong forming synergy with sister cities in the Greater Bay area for IT development, such as speeding up the development of medicines.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[The zone] will be a base to pioneer with innovative policies and collaborations, such as joint clinical trials that leverage on data and bio-samples from both the mainland and Hong Kong," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister stressed that these areas of development come on top of the SAR's traditional positioning as an international financial centre.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Tourism officials on Monday called on industry leaders to find ways to attract more overnight visitors to Hong Kong during the Lunar New Year "golden week" holiday on the mainland, as they expect a significant rise in tourist numbers over the eight-day period.
 <br>
  <br>
  Rosanna Law, the secretary for culture, sports and tourism, noted the upcoming holiday is a peak travel season and the SAR would be holding a series of festive activities.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We expect there to be a significant increase in tourists visiting Hong Kong during the Lunar New Year golden week," Law said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We encourage the industry to seize this opportunity and be flexible to provide visitors with more high-quality and innovative experiences, attract them to stay overnight in Hong Kong to fully experience Hong Kong's unique festive atmosphere."
  <br>
  <br>
  Law, who chaired a meeting with various government departments and representatives of the tourism and hotel sectors, also said relevant authorities would continue to maintain close communication and make preparations on welcoming visitors.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The chief executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, Eddie Yue, has welcomed news that the People's Bank of China will unveil various measures to boost financial collaboration between the SAR and the mainland.
 <br>
  <br>
  PBOC Governor Pan Gongsheng made the announcement during a speech on the first day of the Asian Financial Forum.
  <br>
  <br>
  The measures include the linking of Hong Kong's Fast Payment System (FPS) to the mainland's Internet Banking Payment System (IBPS).
  <br>
  <br>
  “Residents in the two places can make real-time cross-boundary payments using their phone number,” Yue told reporters after attending the forum.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We expect to launch part of the service in the middle of the year, and will expand the scheme slowly and in an orderly manner, based on our actual implementation situation and experience.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Other measures include the launch of a trade finance scheme to help enterprises trading in yuan improve liquidity.
  <br>
  <br>
  There will be 100 billion yuan available in currency swaps for one, three and six months.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yue said the scheme will be rolled out by February.
  <br>
  <br>
  From Tuesday, the clearing time for Southbound Trading under Bond Connect will be pushed back by one hour to 4.30pm, while mainland investors will also be allowed to buy securities of more currency types, including the US dollar and the euro.
  <br>
  <br>
  Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury Christopher Hui, for his part, said the various measures show the central bank’s support in consolidating Hong Kong’s role as a financial centre.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Governor of the People's Bank of China (PBOC) Pan Gongsheng on Monday said Beijing will significantly increase the proportion of its national foreign exchange reserves and asset allocation in Hong Kong, as part of efforts to boost the development of the city's financial markets.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at the 18th annual Asian Financial Forum in the SAR, Pan also said authorities will continue to deepen the financial market connectivity between Hong Kong and the mainland, to attract foreign capital.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Prosperous capital markets are the cornerstone of Hong Kong as an international financial centre...We'll support more quality enterprises to list and issue bonds in the SAR, and continue to improve connectivity between the mainland and Hong Kong in areas like stocks, bonds, wealth management and interest rate swaps, to deepen financial cooperation within the Greater Bay Area," he told forum participants.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will significantly increase the proportion of our foreign exchange reserves and our asset allocation in Hong Kong to open up a broader space for Hong Kong's financial development."
  <br>
  <br>
  Pan said the PBOC and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority will introduce relevant policies to improve Hong Kong's offshore renminbi markets, while providing more convenience regarding cross-border payment and settlements.
  <br>
  <br>
  One of the measures is the launch of an additional renminbi trade financing liquidity fund, with terms of one month, three months and six months, totalling 100 billion yuan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, Zhou Ji, executive deputy director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office (HKMAO), said the central government will continue to support the SAR in consolidating its status as a global financial hub.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the future, the central government will, as always, do its utmost to support the consolidation of Hong Kong's status as an international financial centre, trade centre and shipping centre, and will support the SAR in accelerating the pace of developing scientific and technological innovation," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  On another note, Zhou said Beijing will continue to create new advantages by developing new quality productive forces to help with regional growth, stressing that the Chinese economy remains resilient with stable fundamentals.

    'High hopes for the SAR's task force in Thailand'

<img alt="Former security minister Lai Tung-kwok said he was confident the SAR task force in Thailand would deliver results. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1787266_1_20250113115736.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Former security minister Lai Tung-kwok said he was optimistic about the prospects of the SAR's task force in Thailand, which is investigating allegations that Hongkongers have been lured to Southeast Asian countries to engage in illegal types of work.
 <br>
  <br>
  The task force, led by Undersecretary for Security Michael Cheuk, with members from Security Bureau and the Immigration Department, flew to Thailand on Sunday, after receiving 28 requests for assistance connected to Hong Kong residents who were allegedly held in the region against their will.
  <br>
  <br>
  So far, 16 people have managed to return to Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  Seven men and five women reported restrictions on their movement, but are safe and able to remain in touch with the task force. It is thought they were not forcibly abducted.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a RTHK programme on Monday, Lai said the SAR government was highly concerned which is why it sent the task force led by Cheuk.
  <br>
  <br>
  He had high hopes for the task force's prospects given it has been liaising with Thai authorities.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lai also believed the Thai police would also pay high attention to such incidents, considering the potential impact on tourism.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The Thai police also attach importance to this issue because it seriously affects the country's tourist industry. There have been media reports that many mainland tourists have cancelled trips to Thailand over the upcoming Lunar New Year - so I think Thailand wants to handle any incidents well,” Lai said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lai said many were lured to Southeast Asia on bogus job offers.
  <br>
  <br>
  He called on authorities to raise public awareness about the dangers of getting lured by such schemes.

    Pollster under probe over 'assisting absconder'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Security minister Chris Tang has confirmed that national security police are investigating whether pollster Robert Chung or his research organisation had provided assistance to an absconder.
 <br>
  <br>
  Sources earlier said Chung was taken away from his home on Monday morning, and brought to the Wong Chuk Hang office of the Public Opinion Research Institute, of which he is president and chief executive officer.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Chung was being invited back to the police station for investigations on suspected assistance to an absconder. At this moment in time, Chung has not been arrested," Tang told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This has nothing to do with any research being done by Chung or his organisation. Our whole investigation is focusing on how Chung and his organisation [allegedly assisted] the absconder. It's absolutely nothing to do with the result of their poll."
  <br>
  <br>
  It's understood the probe is related to the pollster's former deputy at the institute, Chung Kim-wah.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last month, Chung Kim-wah was last month put on a police wanted list for alleged national security offences.
  <br>
  <br>
  He is suspected of inciting secession on social media and colluding with foreign forces, and police are offering a HK$1 million reward for information leading to his arrest.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee has told thousands of business leaders from around the world that Hong Kong is working towards developing itself into an international gold trading centre.
 <br>
  <br>
  Delivering his opening remarks at the Asian Financial Forum on Monday, Lee revealed that the SAR will build world-class gold storage facilities, and strengthen support services in insurance, testing and certification, as well as logistics.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Ultimately, we plan to create a holistic gold trading centre with an industry chain," Lee said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The stability in Hong Kong amidst rapid changes in geopolitics around the world will provide a world of investors a secure environment for gold storage as well as other forms of wealth management."
  <br>
  <br>
  He also said the SAR will build on its existing advantages, and expand its overseas network, particularly with Belt and Road countries and regions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our strategies include strengthening financial cooperation with the Middle East and the 10-member states of ASEAN, as well as other established and emerging markets."
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will also organise more international financial events, seek collaboration in financial products, talent and experience sharing, and attract more overseas enterprises and capital to Hong Kong."
  <br>
  <br>
  The 18th edition of the two-day Asian Financial Forum - themed "Powering the Next Growth Engine" - has attracted some 3,600 business and financial leaders from more than 50 countries and regions this year.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Department of Health said on Sunday that around 1,700 staff members have been deployed to two test events at the Kai Tak Sports Park - but it stressed that this had "not in any way" affected the treatment of patients.
 <br>
  <br>
  The clarification came after multiple media reports suggested some patients had to reschedule their bookings because medical staff were drafted in to take part in upcoming drills to gauge the park's crowd management measures.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, the department confirmed that staff will be sent to drills on January 24 and February 4.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said minor adjustments were made to the appointment dates for non-therapeutic student health services with the consent of service recipients.
  <br>
  <br>
  "All have been agreed by the members of the public concerned and only two appointments will be postponed by one working day, while the others will be brought forward by two to 10 working days," the statement read.
  <br>
  <br>
  The department stressed that the Student Health Service provides regular health assessment and health education of a preventive nature.
  <br>
  <br>
  That said, it pledged to make more careful planning and strengthen internal co-ordination when deploying staff for future drills, so as to minimise disruption to public services.

    Industry to bear cost of cigarette tax labels: Customs

<img alt="Customs chief Chan Tsz-tat says the labelling system is aimed at targeting untaxed cigarettes attempting to pass off as legal, duty-paid ones. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1787178_1_20250112155320.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Customs say tobacco firms will likely have to bear the cost of an upcoming labelling system which will help consumers differentiate duty-paid cigarettes from illicit ones.
 <br>
  <br>
  Commissioner of Customs and Excise Chan Tsz-tat explained the proposed scheme is aimed at weeding out untaxed cigarettes which boast identical or similar packaging to their duty-paid counterparts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both feature government health warnings, and can be difficult to distinguish even by retailers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said one way to implement the scheme is to introduce anti-forgery features on the packaging.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The labels will be similar to anti-forgery features on banknotes, which are hard to replicate," Chan told a television programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There will also be a digital tag to be scanned. The tag can be attached when the cigarettes are produced but duty has not been paid. When duty is paid, we can activate the label from the back end. Then we will know the batch has been taxed."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan dismissed concerns that tobacco companies will transfer the extra costs to consumers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our initial thought is to have the tobacco industry shoulder the cost. Currently, a pack of cigarettes on the market is sold for over HK$100. The cost of adding labels is minimal and will have no impact on the selling price," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities are also looking to introduce stiffer penalties for people who flout a law on the permitted amount of cigarettes they can bring into Hong Kong tax-free.
  <br>
  <br>
  Currently, each traveller can carry 19 sticks of cigarettes every time they enter the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said officials are looking to amend legislation within this year, so offenders will be fined HK$5,000, up from HK$2,000.

<img alt="Paul Chan said a new chapter discussing cooperation with Gulf countries has been added to this week's Asian Financial Forum. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1787162_1_20250112122438.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The financial secretary said an annual financial forum this week includes a new discussion panel on how to cooperate with Gulf countries, as Hong Kong looks to grasp development opportunities with the Global South.
 <br>
  <br>
  Paul Chan said the Asian Financial Forum - set to begin on Monday - will host some 3,600 policymakers and business leaders from more than 50 countries and regions, a scale similar to last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The forum sets up a new chapter on the Gulf Cooperation Council, making new explorations on how to deepen financial cooperation between Hong Kong and the Middle East, while encouraging more bilateral capital flows," Chan wrote on his weekly blog.
  <br>
  <br>
  He urged Hong Kong businesses to grasp the new development opportunities brought by the emerging markets. These include the Middle East, as well as nations from Asean and the Global South.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan also noted that the SAR serve as a platform for countries like Indonesia to raise funds for products such as catastrophe bonds, or infrastructure and green projects.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last week, he led a 130-strong delegation to Jakarta to conduct business exchange and lure investment.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said given the risks of disasters brought by climate change, companies can opt for Hong Kong's catastrophe bond products, raise funds through issuing bonds in different currencies, or establish trusts.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister added that Indonesian representatives also expressed keen interest in Hong Kong's innovation and technology sector.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ten startups from the Hong Kong Science and Technology Park took part in dozens of business matching sessions, potentially reeling in over US$5 million of business, Chan revealed.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A six-member task force led by Undersecretary for Security Michael Cheuk has set off for Thailand on Sunday to investigate reports of Hong Kong residents allegedly lured to Southeast Asian countries and detained to engage in illegal work.
 <br>
  <br>
  The task force comprises officials from the Security Bureau, as well as police and the Immigration Department.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters at the airport, Cheuk said the Thai government is very concerned about the issue and is willing to arrange a meeting with SAR officials.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the past, we have been communicating with the relevant authorities. In terms of the latest development, we hope to meet them face-to-face and understand the situation and to seek all feasible help from them and see how we collaborate," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As for the operation goal, we for sure want all Hongkongers to come back safely. This is our ultimate goal."
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted criminals are adopting new methods to lure victims to Southeast Asian countries. These include asking people to help bring packages to Japan or Taiwan, but then changing the destination to a Southeast Asian country at the last minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  The task force will also meet officials from the Chinese embassy in Bangkok, and talk to Ministry of Justice representatives on an anti-human trafficking committee chaired by the Thai prime minister.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said that SAR authorities have so far received 28 requests for assistance in relation to Hong Kong residents alleging to be detained in Southeast Asian countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sixteen have already returned to Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cheuk said the remaining 12 are aged 21 to 43, and none were abducted. They reported restrictions on their movement but are safe and able to remain in touch with the task force, he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  In response to media enquiries, the Security Bureau revealed on Saturday that it had recently received an assistance request from the family of an SAR resident.
  <br>
  <br>
  The woman, in her twenties, was reportedly detained in a Southeast Asian country.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said the case had since been taken up by the Office of the Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Hong Kong, and the local Chinese Embassy.
  <br>
  <br>
  The relevant parities provided advice and all feasible help based on the family’s wishes, and it is understood the woman has returned to the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Security Bureau called on the public to be vigilant against online job advertisements which are too good to be true - either those which claim to offer quick money, or highly-paid positions which do not require any work experience or academic qualification.

 A hill fire which had been burning in Pat Heung since Saturday afternoon was largely put out after more than 20 hours.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Fire Services Department said Sunday that the Government Flying Service is also water bombing the site.
  <br>
  <br>
  The blaze near Kai Kung Leng, literally meaning Rooster Ridge, once stretched to 200 metres from one end to the other.
  <br>
  <br>
  Emergency services first received reports about the fire at around 5.30pm on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  A Government Flying Service helicopter was deployed later that evening to extract two hikers trapped inside Lam Tsuen Country Park due to the fire and strong winds. They were both evacuated safely.

    2025 full of uncertainties and challenges: HKMA chief

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The head of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has predicted that 2025 will be a year marked by uncertainties and many changes, while the SAR will be affected by policies set to be introduced by incoming US President Donald Trump.
 <br>
  <br>
  Authority chief executive Eddie Yue also admitted on Sunday the city cannot fully shield itself from unforeseen factors in global financial markets.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When we look at the global monetary policy from a couple years ago, we experienced similar external shocks - our interest rates went up and down together," he told a radio programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But now there's division in international monetary policy. The United States may have slower rate cuts, but other places will increase interest rates. It could lead to faster and more volatile global capital flows, with cracks emerging that we didn't see over the past few years."
  <br>
  <br>
  Looking back at the past year, Yue said Hong Kong's overall financial system had developed "quite well". The Hong Kong dollar remained stable, while the linked exchange rate system operated in an orderly manner, he noted.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong's de-facto central banker also said global investors had changed their impression of the SAR over the past year, referring to his observations at the Global Financial Leaders' Investment Summit last November.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Whether they were being interviewed on stage or chatting with us on the side, they had full confidence in Hong Kong and saw that we have many opportunities in the future," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "No one asked me how the Article 23 [legislation] affected Hong Kong or how the national security law affected Hong Kong. Those were no longer topics of interest. [Investors] were more concerned about the development of the mainland."

<div class="itemFullText">
 More than 200,000 people visited an exhibition in Dubai showcasing the appeal and vibrancy of Hong Kong through interactive art technology.
 <br>
  <br>
  The "Immersive Hong Kong" exhibition was part of Hong Kong's broader initiative to strengthen ties with the Middle East, with Chief Executive John Lee and other senior officials leading delegations to the region since 2023, to tell good stories of the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  The event, held from December 20 last year to January 5, was organised by the Information Services Department and the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office in Dubai.
  <br>
  <br>
  Apollonia Liu, the Director of Information Services, said the city has been fostering closer ties with the Middle East.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are very delighted with the positive response as well as the expansion of our circle of friends and network through staging this exhibition," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Information Services Department said it will explore organising the exhibition in other cities later this year, after already holding it in Dubai, Jakarta, Bangkok, Kuala Lumpur, and Guangzhou.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong experienced its coldest day so far this winter, with the observatory recording a minimum temperature of 11.5 degrees at its Tsim Sha Tsui headquarters on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The mercury dipped even lower in parts of the New Territories.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier, the forecaster warned of possible frost on Saturday morning, on high ground or in the northern part of the New Territories.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, hikers in Tai Mo Shan told RTHK that they hadn't seen any frost overnight.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It would create a really memorable experience. We'll take some photos if we see it. There's a small chance it could happen, but I won't be disappointed if we don't see it," said a hiker.
  <br>
  <br>
  The observatory reminded the public to wrap up warm and maintain proper indoor ventilation, adding that chilly weather is expected on Sunday morning.

    'Customs officers must hold themselves accountable'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Customs chief Chan Tsz-tat stressed that safety takes priority for officers and they must hold themselves accountable for their actions.
 <br>
  <br>
  A 27-year-old motorcyclist was killed last week in Kowloon Bay, after his vehicle rammed into an iron pole, and a 40-year-old man was later arrested on suspicion of tampering with a motor vehicle.
  <br>
  <br>
  Customs earlier said it was a tragic incident, and confirmed that one of their officers was involved.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a radio programme on Saturday, Chan said the case has been undergoing investigation and the involved frontline officer is now on leave.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan stressed that officers should contribute to society within legal and safe circumstances, and be responsible for every action even if they are not on duty.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have all along provided very comprehensive training for our staff members, starting from joining our department to on-the-job training, we have set very clear instructions," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Regarding the case, I must reiterate that safety is our primary consideration, no matter if a staff member is carrying out his duty in his official capacity or as a private citizen."

    Naming schools refusing flu jab sensible: Lo

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Health Secretary Lo Chung-mau on Saturday said the government must inform parents about which schools are not offering on-site flu shots so they can plan to get their children vaccinated elsewhere.
 <br>
  <br>
  His comment came a day after the Department of Health named 168 schools that refused to take part in a voluntary on-campus vaccination programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters after attending a radio programme, Lo said the transparency isn't about damaging school reputations but about protecting children's health.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If the parents are not aware that their school does not offer the program, they will not be aware that they would need to bring their kids to a private clinic or whatever facility and arrange the vaccination for their own kids," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have the responsibility to inform the public and especially the parents. So it's not a matter of affecting the reputation of a certain school. I think this is a fact and we all have the same mission and that is to protect our kids especially in this winter flu season."
  <br>
  <br>
  The health chief also said that the winter influenza season has officially begun, with a four-year-old boy who didn't get a flu shot and whose school didn't offer vaccines, now in intensive care.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, Lo said elderly patients no longer need to wait in long queues outside dental clinics in cold weather with the new online appointment system.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We hope that at the age of 80, our elderly will still be able to retain their [teeth], at least have more than 20 teeth. That would save a lot of our resources in providing treatment for them," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lo added that officials are planning to expand the student dental care programme to include both kindergarten and secondary students within this year.

    CE urges firms to invest more on the mainland

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Friday called on businesses to contribute to the country's development by investing on the mainland.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a forum in Shenzhen on technological collaboration between the two places, the CE noted that firms can benefit from Beijing's new amendments to the Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement, or CEPA, which will take effect in March.
  <br>
  <br>
  The changes include applying Hong Kong laws when firms from the SAR engage in arbitration, and allowing the proceedings to take place in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I encourage Hong Kong firms, or even companies from around the world, to make use of CEPA's new preferential treatments, and explore countless opportunities in the mainland market," Lee said in a speech.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They can then serve the country by bringing in capital and talent, while companies can go global."
  <br>
  <br>
  The CE said Hong Kong and Shenzhen can become a driving force in the development of new quality productive forces.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the SAR's businesses should also further develop their regional and international networks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee added that as the latest round of technological revolution takes place rapidly, firms should adapt to changes and seize opportunities provided by the nation's opening up.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at the same event, innovation, technology and industry minister Sun Dong noted that the SAR needs to align itself with the country's development plans.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also highlighted the need to speed up the construction of the Hetao Shenzhen-Hong Kong Science and Technology Innovation Co-operation Zone to provide impetus for high-level development in the region.

 Police on Friday said they arrested 17 people for allegedly conspiring to verbally intimidate the candidates and scrutineers in an election to pick the representatives of a public housing estate.
 <br>
  <br>
  The votes, which took place last month, was to select residents to oversee the management of King Lam Estate in Tseung Kwan O.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a press briefing, Chief Inspector Ho Kai-ho said officers made the arrests between December 18 and Friday.

  Ho added the suspects were aged between 25 and 77 years old.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Some of them have backgrounds related to triads, but it is not appropriate to disclose the exact number of suspects with triad backgrounds here. Among those arrested in this operation, some were candidates in this election," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho also said if convicted of conspiracy to criminally intimidate, offenders could face up to a five-year jail term.

 A 67-year-old patient was transferred from the Greater Bay Area (GBA) to Tuen Mun Hospital on Friday, the first case arranged under a cross-boundary ambulance transfer scheme.
 <br>
  <br>
  The one-year pilot scheme for direct cross-boundary ambulance transfer was launched in November last year, allowing patients in the GBA to be conveyed to designated hospitals in the SAR directly without the need to be handed over to local health authorities at boundary control points.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hospital Authority said its major incident control centre received a request for a patient transfer from the Shenzhen Hospital of the University of Hong Kong on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said the patient was admitted to the hospital in the GBA on Tuesday due to respiratory failure and had to be put on a ventilator.
  <br>
  <br>
  Anne Lee, deputy hospital chief executive of the Shenzhen Hospital, said the patient's condition improved and his family hoped he could be treated in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Although the patient is still in a serious condition, we think he is stable enough for a safe transfer," she told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee said the man was transferred from the GBA hospital at 11am via the Shenzhen Bay Port, and arrived at Tuen Mun Hospital in about 40 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said the process was smooth and the patient had been admitted to a ward.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked about the criteria for patients to be transferred to Hong Kong, she said authorities are always willing to help patients in need.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Not only patients using a ventilator are suitable for a transfer. If patients were involved in a traffic accident on the mainland, and have suffered fractures, they would not be able to use public transport to cross the border," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Lee stressed that if patients were able to make use of public transportation or could make arrangements themselves, they should not use this cross-boundary ambulance service.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Polytechnic University (PolyU) on Friday said that artificial intelligence, cancer treatment and innovative construction technologies were among 18 research projects it had received public funding for in the current financial year.
 <br>
  <br>
  It said in a statement it received nearly HK$92 million from the Research Grants Council, an advisory body under the University Grants Committee that allocates funding to eight local universities.
  <br>
  <br>
  The university said money for three of the projects came from a grant that supports younger academic staff with their research.
  <br>
  <br>
  Four others are to do with the Research Impact Fund, and they cover studies on sustainable aviation fuel engineering, cancer immunotherapy, modular integrated 3D-printed concrete construction, and headsets design for virtual reality and augmented reality.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The successes in securing [the council's] funds further illustrate PolyU’s strength in basic research and its capacity to lead innovative projects with significant societal impact, delivering valuable benefits," said the university's vice president for research and innovation, Christopher Chao.

 The Observatory (HKO) on Friday said a 4.2 magnitude earthquake stuck the sea south of Guangdong.
 <br>
  <br>
  The forecaster said more than 10 people in Hong Kong reported feeling minor shaking sensations for a few seconds.
  <br>
  <br>
  The HKO said the quake hit the waters south of Shanwei city at 2.40pm, with the epicentre around 200 kilometres south-east of Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tremor's focal depth was about 10 kilometres.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Initial estimate gave a local intensity of III (three) on the Modified Mercalli Intensity Scale, that is felt indoors. The vibration was like passing of light trucks," the HKO said.
