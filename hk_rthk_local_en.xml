<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's public hospitals are ready to handle an expected rise in flu cases during the Lunar New Year, Hospital Authority (HA) chief executive Tony Ko said on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a television programme, Ko said the authority has taken steps to prepare for the peak flu season.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have arranged additional manpower and asked colleagues to avoid taking many leaves during that period. We have also increased the number of hospital beds, so we are confident in our ability to handle an uptick in service demand," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ko, who will step down in July after serving for almost six years, said it is an appropriate time to leave and that he has no regrets.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have successfully overcome many challenges like the Covid pandemic. Looking at the Hospital Authority now, we've recovered our services, improved our systems, and built better cooperation with the mainland and other countries... I can see many things are on track. It's the right time to leave," he explained.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that the HA will continue to automate and streamline certain work processes so that clinical staff can spend more time with patients and better serve them.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hongkongers braved the chilly conditions to explore the 1.1-kilometre section of the East Coast boardwalk from Fortress Hill to North Point, which opened on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  North Point resident Adrienne Garvey told RTHK that her family is looking forward to using the promenade.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The kids play area here is fantastic… the kids are loving and exploring it, and I am looking forward to running along here, all the way down to Kennedy Town [in future]. I can have a nice long running route to train on," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hopefully we'll be here every week, if it's the kids with their scooters and running and playing in the park, I think this is a really nice place. It is under the shade as well, so in the summer it will be so good.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Her son Max also said he loves the play area.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The waterfront looks quite nice, and I think it's very fun because it has a playground. Also we like running down the bumps. It's the first day we are here, so we are just going to maybe go and see the whole bridge," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another resident, surnamed Kwok, said the trail is perfect for running.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I often run, and it is impossible to run along the harbour before. So I came this morning to take a look to prepare for future runs… It is very comfortable and faces the sea," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pet owner Carina Chan also told RTHK that the boardwalk is great for walking her dog.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We go to East Coast Park every day via Java Road. We had to cross the road each time, but now with the boardwalk... it is more convenient and safe," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The harbourfront walkway - built under the Island Eastern Corridor - spans 2.2 kilometres in total.
  <br>
  <br>
  Its eastern section, which will connect North Point to Quarry Bay, is set to open in phases in the second half of this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The walkway is part of a bigger, 13-kilometre harbourfront promenade project that will eventually connect Kennedy Town with Shau Kei Wan.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan has vowed to beef up efforts in promoting Hong Kong to the rest of the world, saying some of those attending the World Economic Forum in Davos have signalled their intention to set up shop in the SAR.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chan also said on Sunday that he has invited delegations to explore the "tremendous opportunities" offered by Hong Kong, the Greater Bay Area as well as the mainland, during the high-level conference in Switzerland.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Some fintech companies in Europe said they are planning to set up shop in Hong Kong, and use the city as a base for expanding business in Asia," he wrote on his weekly blog.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This year, we will continue to step up our efforts to promote Hong Kong, so that more friends can learn about, make good use of, and contribute to Hong Kong."
  <br>
  <br>
  The finance chief added that the SAR can help connect the mainland with developed economies and emerging markets in the Global South in areas like technology and green finance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan also pointed out that the economic situation in China and the United States, as well as Sino-US ties, were topics of concern among those attending the Davos forum.
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted that Vice Premier Ding Xuexiang had cited facts and data in explaining China's economy to let foreign investors have a more comprehensive understanding of the country's development while strengthening their confidence.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Sunday said the government will set up three more community living rooms this year to improve the quality of life for underprivileged families.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a Facebook post, Lee said two projects -- in Shau Kei Wan and Kowloon City -- have already received funding from the Community Care Fund and are expected to begin operations by mid-2025.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CE said some grassroots families told him that community living rooms have become another home for them, with shared facilities such as kitchens and bathrooms; and offering services like homework assistance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, Lee said the first batch of light public housing units in Yuen Long -- providing 2,150 units -- will be ready for move in, in the first quarter.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that the second phase of the project will be open for applications soon.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The administration is committed to fixing housing problems for grassroots families. We are taking concrete action to help these families find a place to live and feel secure," he wrote.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The head of the government's investment promotion agency on Sunday said her office will focus on bringing in non-local companies that can "create a larger financial impact" in Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  In the past year, InvestHK helped a record 539 non-local companies establish or expand in the SAR, with total investment reaching HK$67.7 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The companies we want to attract are from all industries... We want to put more focus on companies that would create more jobs, and to bring in more direct investments, and create a larger financial impact for Hong Kong," its director-general, Alpha Lau, said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A lot of these [companies] that we brought in... they are looking at the growth of the demographics and the wealth in the region, so they would want to invest more here."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lau said her department would boost promotional efforts in regions like Eastern Europe, Central Asia and Southeast Asia.
  <br>
  <br>
  The director-general added that she would act as a “salesperson” and clarify any misunderstandings that foreign firms might have about the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The concerns that some of them might have, whether because of geopolitics or other reasons -- they might be due to a misunderstanding or a lack of knowledge about Hong Kong. I think facts tell a thousand words," Lau said.

    Flu outbreak to worsen after LNY break: paediatrician

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A University of Hong Kong (HKU) paediatrician on Sunday called on people to stay on the alert, saying the current influenza outbreak may worsen after the Lunar New Year holiday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a radio programme, Mike Kwan from HKU’s Department of Paediatrics and Adolescent Medicine said the flu season is expected to peak next month, and people should get vaccinated as soon as possible, if they haven’t already done so.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Temperatures will drop during the upcoming Lunar New Year [holiday], and there will be more social contact through New Year visits and gatherings," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Some residents will also travel abroad, but they should be aware that many countries across Asia, including Japan and Korea, are currently experiencing flu outbreaks, so everyone needs to be careful."
  <br>
  <br>
  Three severe flu cases involving children were reported last week, with two of them unvaccinated.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kwan said kids who’ve received the flu jab typically show milder symptoms, and require only one to two days of hospitalisation in more serious cases.
  <br>
  <br>
  The expert also urged members of the public to use reliable test kits and maintain good personal hygiene.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Saturday condemned lawmakers in the United States again for proposing a bill to review sanctions against certain SAR officials, judges and prosecutors, calling it an attempt to intimidate those safeguarding national security.
 <br>
  <br>
  A government spokesperson said in a statement that safeguarding national security is a constitutional duty and an inherent right of sovereign states, while accusing US officials of hypocrisy and using double standards.
  <br>
  <br>
  The statement said that the National Security Law has helped restore social stability and improve the business environment after the “black-clad violence” of 2019.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the Economic Freedom of the World 2024 Annual Report, Hong Kong ranks as the world's freest economies among 165 economies. In the World Competitiveness Yearbook 2024, Hong Kong's ranking improved by two places to fifth globally," the spokesperson said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "However, those US politicians insist on turning a blind eye to all these facts, and even clamour for so-called 'sanctions' against the HKSAR personnel who dutifully safeguard national security.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The HKSAR Government strongly condemns their political grandstanding rife with ill intentions, which have been seen through by all."
  <br>
  <br>
  The spokesperson also said that authorities reject any so-called sanctions and vowed to continue its efforts to safeguard national security, and urged US lawmakers to respect international law and stop interfering in Hong Kong's internal affairs.
  <br>
  <br>
  The spokesman also affirmed that human rights in Hong Kong are constitutionally protected and that law enforcement actions are conducted based on evidence without regard to political beliefs.
  <br>
  <br>
  They added that the judiciary operates independently, ensuring fair trials and adherence to the rule of law.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The judicial system of the HKSAR has always been highly regarded by international communities. Any attempt by any country, organisation, or individual to interfere with the judicial proceedings in the HKSAR by means of political power is a reprehensible act undermining the rule of law of the HKSAR," the spokesperson said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Making any statement with the intent to interfere with or obstruct the course of justice, or engaging in conduct with the same intent, is very likely to constitute the offence of criminal contempt of court or the offence of perverting the course of justice."
  <br>
  <br>
  The statement added that the government remains committed to implementing the National Security Law and upholding the principle of "One Country, Two Systems".

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Saturday visited residents in Oi Man Estate ahead of the Lunar New Year.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lee greeted those who came out to see him at the housing estate in Ho Man Tin, and shook hands with members of the public.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm also here to have a look at the operation of shops. I bought these turnip cakes. I love them and I will share them with my wife. I heard from the shops that business has been good, meeting their expectations," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier in the day, Lee visited the community living room in Hung Hom, and had a meal with people there.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee was accompanied by the Secretary for Home and Youth Affairs, Alice Mak, who pointed out that care teams have an important role to play when it comes to assisting residents.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The chief executive visited the residents with a care team, and learnt about how they provide services to people in the community. We did a year-end clean-up and home repairs for the elderly," Mak said.
  <br>
  <br>
  She added government officials will continue to visit residents, including elderly people, grassroots families and ethnic minorities, at different districts before the Lunar New Year.
  <br>
  <br>
  An 88-year-old resident said she was happy that she was able to shake hands with the Chief Executive and that people have high expectations of him.

    'Police sparing no effort to fight violent crimes'

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police commissioner Raymond Siu on Saturday said cracking down on triads and violent crimes are some of his top priorities.
 <br>
  <br>
  Siu made the comments following the Police College's passing-out parade, where reporters asked him about two men who were attacked by a group of knife-wielding men outside a Yuen Long industrial building in the early hours of Wednesday, leaving one dead and another injured.
  <br>
  <br>
  The commissioner said there were a total of 3,313 assault cases in the first eleven months of last year, down from the same period in the previous year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are focusing on these violent cases, and we will spare no effort. In addition to our intelligence collection to cracking down on their illegal activities, we will also use other means, such as cutting off their financial resources," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We also have many intelligence-led operations. In the past, our arrest rate for triad-related crimes was actually close to 40 percent. It is up to us to take the initiative to carry out operations to attack them."
  <br>
  <br>
  Siu also said that the police adopts a zero-tolerance policy towards any illegal or disciplinary violations and will handle such cases seriously.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was referring to the case where police arrested 12 people, including seven officers, on suspicion of money laundering, involving about HK$10.5 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will definitely deal with any colleague who violates laws and discipline. On the other hand, we have many colleagues. Colleagues who violate laws only account for a very small part of the entire police force," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Of course, we think even one case is too many but I hope everyone understands that we maintain public order and prevent and combat crime in the Hong Kong Police Force. Most of our colleagues work very hard, and our low crime rate today is also the result of our colleagues’ hard work."
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Siu said the police force is steadily increasing in size, with the number of applications rising by 46 percent in the current fiscal year, compared to the one before.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said various measures are being implemented, including a recruitment fast-track process at overseas universities.

    Remaining land sales to top HK$4bn: minister
   </title>

<img alt="" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1789094_2_20250125115027.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Development Secretary said on Saturday that she's confident that revenues from land sales in the next two months will top HK$4 billion, but the full year figure might still fall short of the government's original projection in last year's budget forecast.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a radio programme, Bernadette Linn noted that a land parcel in Tai Wai had attracted a significant number of bids on Friday. The government has several land sales scheduled between now and the end of the fiscal year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I believe that the final number will be higher than the number just mentioned, but it may not reach the original estimate of more than HK$30 billion," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think that at this time our real estate market hasn't fully recovered, so that's understandable. It takes time for the market to warm up."
  <br>
  <br>
  She noted that the last budget had projected average annual expenditure of about HK$90 billion on public works projects over the next four years.
  <br>
  <br>
  The development secretary said work is proceeding on these projects, including the Northern Metropolis project, which she believes can meet existing benchmarks.
  <br>
  <br>
  She also said some Northern Metropolis projects are already under construction, and others have entered the planning process, stressing that these works were huge in scale, and would take years to complete.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said the New Territories North New Town will be carried out in phases.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the past, people often heard about new development areas like the Kwu Tung North New Development Area, which is just a few hundred hectares. The entire San Tin Technopole is about 600 hectares. Thus, the development of over 1,000 hectares has to be carried out in phases," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In this case, we'll prioritize about 200 hectares within that area. It will include industrial parks, private housing, and part of a university town. We hope to finalize discussions here so we can start the statutory process early and begin construction in 2028."
  <br>
  <br>
  Linn added that the authorities will adjust the pace of some projects, to ensure that the government's cash flow is managed effectively, such as waterfront beautification and park facilities.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, she noted that the Kau Yi Chau Artifical Islands project has not been abandoned, but time constraints mean it's uncertain whether reclamation work can begin under the current administration.

    Largest Kai Tak drill yet meets expectations: minister

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Transport Secretary Mable Chan said on Saturday that it took just 45 minutes to process spectators after a test event at the Kai Tak Sports Park.
 <br>
  <br>
  The largest drill to date involved some 63,000 people, and was held on Friday evening at three venues at the park.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on an RTHK radio programme, Chan said extra MTR train services had been laid on and ten extra bus routes were arranged to carry 7,300 passengers, which was higher than expected.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Two franchised bus operators arranged the ten special routes... We hope these routes can be used to carry passengers when large-scale events are organised in the future. So it would be similar to the arrangements at the Hong Kong Coliseum and the Hong Kong Stadium," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, Chan said Greater Bay Airlines had let passengers and the government down, after it cancelled more than 100 flights for February and March, blaming factors like delayed aircraft deliveries and inspection requirements. She said it's been asked to submit a report on the problems.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan also said she hoped it's better prepared to deal with increased traffic expected over the Lunar New Year and Easter holidays.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Secretary for Security, Chris Tang, said that a Hong Kong resident who was detained in Myanmar and forced to carry out illegal work will return to the SAR on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  A government task force has been in Thailand investigating reports that a number of Hongkongers had been lured to Southeast Asian countries and held against their will.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a radio programme, Tang said the 29-year-old man had been rescued and taken to Thailand, and was in good shape mentally and physically.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister said the man will return to the city, accompanied by members of the task force.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the government would do its utmost to rescue the remaining ten Hong Kong residents being detained in the region, noting that civil conflicts present challenges to the task force members.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In fact, I have been seeing the Myanmar consulate and also the Cambodian consulate in Hong Kong to discuss how to have the safe return of our Hong Kong people," Tang said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said all parties were committed to doing their utmost to ensure the safe return of the Hong Kong residents.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tang also thanked the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for its support and assistance, allowing the man to reunite with his family before the Lunar New Year.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government said the largest drill to date was successfully held at Kai Tak Sports Park on Friday evening, involving some 63,000 people.
 <br>
  <br>
  Most of the participants were government workers or people from community groups.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two-hour drills were held at three venues -- the main stadium, the Kai Tak Arena and the youth sports ground, as officials tested out arrangements with the first two having capacity crowds.
  <br>
  <br>
  At the 50,000-seater main stadium, bands from the disciplined forces put on a concert, as different scenarios, including simulated security issues, were tested.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials carried out evacuation drills as well as having spectators leave in a regular manner at the other two venues.
  <br>
  <br>
  A number of senior officials, including Chief Secretary for Administration Eric Chan, culture, sports and tourism minister Rosanna Law and civil service chief Ingrid Yeung were on hand to observe the proceedings.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said the park is scheduled to open sometime in March, but added reports saying that March 1 is the official opening day might be premature.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Because we have many stress tests in the future - we have two large-scale stress tests [next month], so up to now, depending on the results of the tests, I think we cannot confirm the opening date," he told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  As part of the tests, all participants left the venues at around the same time as they picked their own mode of transport.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities recorded crowd control and transport data for analysis.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan added the scheduling of events in future should ensure that a capacity crowd at the three venues would not leave the park at the same time.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he said authorities mapped out worst-case scenarios to train up the ability of different parties to react to emergencies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Several participants told RTHK they were happy with the experience, saying signs giving directions were good and the sound system was solid.

 Two men were charged on Friday with murdering a man in Yuen Long in the early hours of Wednesday, as well as wounding another.
 <br>
  <br>
  Police said the pair, 19 and 27, are due to appear in Fanling Court on Saturday. The 27-year-old suspect also faces a charge of possessing dangerous drugs.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two defendants were among six men arrested so far over the death of the 24-year-old man.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officers said two suspects, 23 and 26, were arrested in Tin Shui Wai on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The incident took place outside an industrial building on Wang Yip Street West, when two men were attacked by a group of knife-wielding men.
  <br>
  <br>
  One of them died and the other was conscious when he was taken to hospital.

 Licensed billiard establishments that meet specific criteria can apply to let people as young as eight years old enter these premises, as a means of promoting the sport's development in Hong Kong, said the Leisure and Cultural Services Department (LCSD).
 <br>
  <br>
  Currently, only those aged 16 or above are allowed entry.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other relaxations include allowing young patrons to stay until 11pm, compared with 8pm right now, and they could enter as early as 7am.
  <br>
  <br>
  Those in school uniforms will also be permitted to enter.
  <br>
  <br>
  The department said licensed billiard establishments hoping to accept younger patrons can make applications from February 25.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vincent Law, chairman of the Billiard Sports Council of Hong Kong China (HKBSCC), said he hopes the department can clearly lay out the specific requirements that billiard halls need to take.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The details of the requirements are yet to be announced, but according to my understanding, you have to have certain security facilities implemented in the premises, for example, maybe CCTV. Also you need certain tools and facilities which are suitable for use by children," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "During some sessions, such as training sessions and tournaments, there needs to be some coach who is qualified to coach billiard sports."
  <br>
  <br>
  Law also said that he hopes to see all restrictions removed in the long run.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is only a first step because I think the ultimate objective is to completely remove all restrictions on billiard establishments because we are just like any other sports venue," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Why should there be a restriction on the age of the person who uses the facilities?"
  <br>
  <br>
  He added he hopes to see the LCSD promote the scheme to the around 50 currently licensed billiard halls, noting that establishment owners will have to assess the administrative work and costs before considering to apply.

    'Beetroot salad not ruled out in poisoning cases'

<img alt="Health officials say they can't rule out that a beetroot salad gave passengers on two Cathay flights food poisoning earlier this month. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1789003_1_20250124174253.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Health officials said on Friday that they could not rule out that beetroot salad contaminated with a bacterium served on board was responsible for the suspected food poisoning suffered by dozens of passengers of two Cathay Pacific flights arriving from Nepal this month.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) said its investigation found that 43 passengers, aged between 11 and 75, developed food poisoning symptoms such as vomiting, nausea, abdominal pain and diarrhoea, about 10 to 60 minutes after having meals on the CX640 flights from Kathmandul on January 8 and 9.
  <br>
  <br>
  None of the passengers had to be taken to hospital, the CHP said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Stool samples from two patients tested positive for Staphylococcus aureus. The overall clinical symptoms and incubation period of the affected persons were compatible with food poisoning caused by Staphylococcus aureus," the centre said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  It added that the beetroot salad was the only food served on board that was likely to have caused such poisoning, from a statistical standpoint.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, tests on samples taken from the aircraft showed the level of Staphylococcus aureus in the salad did not exceed food safety standards.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CHP said the food was supplied exclusively to Cathay for its flights from Kathmandu since the start of the month and the factory concerned was later asked to stop providing it. Inspections of the factory found the way the food was being handled might have increased the risk of contamination.
  <br>
  <br>
  In response, Cathay acknowledged the findings but stressed that no signs of contamination were found in the samples it checked in its own lab.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Cathay Pacific confirms that this salad is not served on any of our other flights. Aside from these two cases, there have not been any similar instances of customers experiencing symptoms of suspected food poisoning on any of our recent flights," it said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The airline apologised again to passengers affected and added that it has reinforced food-handling processes and staff training on hygiene.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Home prices fell 7.1 percent in 2024, official figures showed on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  It was the third year in a row of declining prices, which have dropped 27 percent since the start of 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eddie Kwok, executive director of CBRE Hong Kong’s valuation and advisory services, said price increases could be on the cards after Lunar New Year and the financial secretary's budget speech next month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kwok said major banks have lowered their prime rates since the US Federal Reserve's interest rate cut last September and since then prices have been stabilising.
  <br>
  <br>
  Martin Wong, head of research and consultancy for Greater China at Knight Frank, said prices could rebound by up to five percent this year, with most of the increase likely to come in the second half.
  <br>
  <br>
  Figures from the Rating and Valuation Department also showed that prices fell 0.7 percent in December from the month before, ending a two-month increase.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A worker died after falling to the ground at a construction site on Tsung Tau Ha Road in Fo Tan.
 <br>
  <br>
  Police said they received a report at around 1pm on Friday that a man fell from a height of between three and four metres.
  <br>
  <br>
  Emergency personnel were called to scene where the man was certified dead.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Labour Department said officers were sent to investigate the cause of the incident.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chiu Kin-keung, the vice chairman of the Hong Kong Construction Industry Employees General Union, said the deceased welding worker was on a spider lift platform before the fall.
  <br>
  <br>
  He believed that a fractured steel beam struck the platform, causing it and the worker to fall.
  <br>
  <br>
  The worker had his safety harness attached to the platform but that also broke, Chiu said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the Association for the Rights of Industrial Accident Victims said it would be providing support to the family of the man killed.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said the accident marked at least the 10th fatal fall since the beginning of last year.

    FTU wants more religious tours, tour guide training

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Federation of Trade Unions (FTU) on Friday urged the government to step up efforts to promote Hong Kong’s tourist spots and nurture more talent in the sector.
 <br>
  <br>
  At a press conference, the party called for more religious and architectural tours to showcase the city's beauty beyond Victoria Harbour.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Apart from the traditional shopping theme that we are quite well-recognised in the international arena, we would also like international tourists to know about how Hong Kong is naturally beautiful," said FTU lawmaker Joephy Chan.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Apart from Victoria Harbour, of course, there are also different sea views that you can have in Hong Kong. We need to further elaborate on that on different social [media] platforms as well."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan suggested journeys to temples, mosques and landmarks such as Sun Yat Sen Memorial Park to promote religious diversity and peace education.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another FTU lawmaker, Dennis Leung, highlighted the need for more training for tour guides and the recruitment of retirees into the role.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Because we have some sites in New Territories where the younger generation do not understand the history, so we hope that the government can gather all the village inhabitants or some retired people to help to promote tourism, to act as a guide to help the visitors to know more about the culture in this visiting site," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The party also urged officials to improve accessibility to tourist spots by adding more bus routes.

    Tourists want to see pandas all over Hong Kong: DAB

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 DAB lawmakers on Friday said each district should have panda-themed events and decorations to encourage tourists to explore different places across Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  The party said it has submitted various suggestions to the government's Working Group on Developing Tourist Hotspots, which was established last year to come up with ways to revitalise the tourism industry.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lawmaker Vincent Cheng said Hong Kong should promote the concept of "panda is everywhere" on top of "tourism is everywhere".
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's definitely a good chance for businesses to have a showcase everywhere, in different districts," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A lot of visitors, they're not only visiting the places, they also would like to see panda decorations everywhere in Hong Kong. We can also dress them up. Like in Sham Shui Po, they can dress up like a Sham Shui Po special edition for the panda as well."
  <br>
  <br>
  Other suggestions the party made included a walking tour in Central and Western for tourists to visit temples and taste food and drink, including sugarcane juice and dim sum.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the legislators urged the authorities to set up a one-stop platform to enable event organisers to reach out to different government departments in a more simple way.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Friday said the city's financial system remains robust, despite intensified geopolitical risks causing greater volatility in regional and global markets.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chan made the remark during a discussion on "stemming financial fragmentation", at the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting in Davos.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also said Hong Kong "steadfastly" upholds the linked exchange rate system, or the currency peg, and that recent surveys showed global investors were optimistic about the SAR's business outlook.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan added that the city has undergone significant transformations in the stock markets, wealth management and digital asset sectors, as he also stressed that China's economy is steadily growing and achieving high-quality development.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, the finance minister continued to promote green finance projects, as well as "impact investments", or funds aimed at generating social or environmental effects.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan held talks on trade with some of his global counterparts, including the investment minister of Saudi Arabia, Khalid Al-Falih, and the finance chief of Egypt, Ahmed Kouchouk. Chan invited the ministers to visit the SAR as part of efforts to deepen ties with the Global South.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also met Jenny Johnson, CEO of investment firm Franklin Templeton, to discuss how to expand the company's business in the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan is due to return to Hong Kong on Saturday.

 A Hong Kong woman on holiday in Japan has died after being hit by a train.
 <br>
  <br>
  Japanese media reports said the woman, 61, was standing on tracks near Otaru, Hokkaido on Thursday and was taking photos of the sea when she was struck by the train.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kyodo News Agency cited police as saying the woman's husband was standing nearby at the time but was not injured.
  <br>
  <br>
  The accident caused the suspension of almost 20 train services, including some to the region's main airport, railway officials said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Chinese Consulate in Sapporo and the Immigration Department in Hong Kong both said they were ready to help the woman's family if assistance was required.

    'Travel agencies should be flexible in giving refund'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Consumer Council has called on travel agencies to be flexible in refunding passengers affected by the cancellation of flights at Greater Bay Airlines.
 <br>
  <br>
  The low-cost carrier earlier announced the cancellation of 128 flights in February and March, while stressing that Lunar New Year services won't be affected.
  <br>
  <br>
  The consumer watchdog had received six complaints as of Thursday night, involving about HK$14,000 in total.
  <br>
  <br>
  Its chief executive Gilly Wong told an RTHK radio programme on Friday that travel agencies should maintain close contact with the airline to offer refunds to passengers as soon as possible.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In principle, they (agencies) should only arrange a refund after receiving the money [from the airline]. But they can exercise discretion and compassion when handling individual cases," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong pointed out that some agencies had told passengers it could take months for them to get their money back, but said in some cases the refund should arrive earlier.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If they only stick to the rulebook, that leads to customer dissatisfaction and complaints. It's not an ideal approach in terms of their reputation."
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong also said Greater Bay Airlines should not impose surcharges for passengers opting for other destinations.
  <br>
  <br>
  She added that the airline should offer updates and reach out to consumers quickly.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The SAR government on Thursday said it condemns and strongly disapproves of a recent meeting between UK officials and national security suspects wanted by Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  British Foreign Secretary David Lammy and Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State Catherine West earlier met with four Hong Kong fugitives based in the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, the SAR government expressed its strong disapproval and condemnation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Endangering national security is a very serious crime. No country will watch with folded arms the acts and activities that endanger national security. Those persons who have fled overseas are suspected of continuing to commit offences under the Hong Kong National Security Law,” a government spokesperson said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The UK Government has ignored the malicious acts of those wanted persons, which showcases the hypocrisy with double standards."
  <br>
  <br>
  The spokesperson stressed that SAR law enforcement agencies will exhaust all means to pursue the fugitives, and called on the UK to stop interfering in Hong Kong matters which are purely China's internal affairs.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Thursday said they have arrested four men for their alleged involvement in a murder case in Yuen Long.
 <br>
  <br>
  A man died and another was hurt on Wednesday, after they were attacked by a group of knife-wielding men when they were leaving an industrial building on Wang Yip Street West.
  <br>
  <br>
  Acting Senior Superintendent Tang Yick-kay said two of the arrestees had tried to escape to Thailand.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The police learned that the two, aged 20 and 21, had flown to Bangkok on Wednesday. We quickly alerted the Thai authorities through our cooperation channels. The two men were subsequently denied entry at Bangkok airport and were sent back to Hong Kong on a flight,” he said, adding that the pair was arrested upon their arrival.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officers made one more arrest at the Hong Kong International Airport; while the fourth man was taken from a Tuen Mun flat, where suspected space oil drugs were also found.
  <br>
  <br>
  The four people arrested, aged 20 to 29, are said to have ties to a triad and are being held for questioning.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police said they are still tracking down on other suspects, and urged members of the public to come forward with information.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Senior Counsel Jose-Antonio Maurellet has been elected the new chairman of the Bar Association, succeeding the outgoing Victor Dawes.
 <br>
  <br>
  Senior Counsels Martin Hui and Eva Sit, meanwhile, were chosen as vice-chairmen.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters after the election on Thursday evening, Maurellet said the association will continue to defend the rule of law and judicial independence.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that the professional body will adhere to the highest standards of professional conduct, discipline and etiquette.
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted that while there are calls for Hong Kong to focus on developing the economy this year, he stressed the rule of law and economic development go hand in hand to ensure the long-term prosperity and stability of the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  Maurellet also expressed hope that more overseas non-permanent judges can be appointed to the city’s top court.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Obviously we would welcome the appointment of further such experienced jurists to our court. We believe that it strengthens Hong Kong as a jurisdiction and is also supported by members of the public,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Maurellet was appointed as Senior Counsel in 2016, and had served as vice chairman for the Bar Association for six years.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The opening of a new harbourfront walkway in North Point will create shared spaces for Hongkongers with stunning views of Victoria Harbour, officials said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The East Coast boardwalk - built under the Island Eastern Corridor - spans 2.2 kilometres in total.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 1.1-kilometre section from Fortress Hill to North Point will open to the public on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Acting Financial Secretary Michael Wong said the government hopes to open the eastern section by the end of this year, adding efforts are underway to make the harbour more accessible.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ivan Ho, chairman of the Harbourfront Commission, said there’s a shared space for pedestrians, joggers, cyclists and pet owners.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We have a shared path which allows people to cycle, walk dogs and jog, so basically we are encouraging people to use our boardwalk together in a harmonious way,” Ho said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We also created what we call a pocket space, which allow children to play around, allow some small-scale function or activity.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Movable bridges have also been installed to allow vessels access to the inner waters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho said construction has not been easy with height restrictions and machinery constraints, and officials have tried to minimise disturbance to nearby residents.

    Snakes and pandas galore as LNY fairs open

<div class="itemFullText">
 Lunar New Year fairs kicked off at 15 sites across Hong Kong on Thursday, with many a panda-themed product among the array of goods, flowers and fast food on offer.
 <br>
  <br>
  Snakes were also spotted rearing their heads among the goodies, what with the Year of the Snake about to get underway.
  <br>
  <br>
  Students were running some of the stalls at Victoria Park – home to the city's biggest fair – hoping to put their newly acquired business management skills and sales techniques into practice.
  <br>
  <br>
  A flower-seller said she has been a regular at the fair for two decades and isn't worried that a sluggish economy and people heading elsewhere to spend will put a dent in her sales.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Lunar New Year is just once a year, for good fortune, people will buy and put them at home like they always do," the woman told RTHK, adding that she has a loyal customer base for her oranges.
  <br>
  <br>
  A woman shopping with her children was delighted with the atmosphere at the fair.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This year, I think there are more people than in previous years. Perhaps it's because during Covid, only flowers were sold at the fairs. Now with more dry goods, everyone's happier, the children are happier," she told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  Customs officers are also planning to attend the fairs, with flyers and souvenirs to be handed out to remind people the importance of respecting copyright law.
  <br>
  <br>
  Divisional Commander Ho Chun-wing said officers on patrol will take immediate action if they find anything suspicious.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong people do like goods with popular models. So we will put a lot of effort into targeting those goods with suspected counterfeiting trademarks and copyright," he told RTHK.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's privacy watchdog on Thursday said the number of data breach incidents in the city increased by 30 percent last year.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data received more than 200 data breach reports last year, in which 30 percent of them involved hacking and 25 percent involved the loss of documents or portable devices.
  <br>
  <br>
  Privacy Commissioner Ada Chung said the value of personal data has increased with the rapid development of digitalisation, and she expects the trend to continue.
  <br>
  <br>
  The office conducted a review of the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance and made suggestions which included the mandatory notification of data breaches, a complete review of the penalty levels outlined in the ordinance and also empowering the Privacy Commissioner to hand down administrative fines.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the level of penalty administered, Chung said her office would take Hong Kong's economic situation into account and make reference to similar legislation in other jurisdictions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the process of consultation, we have received feedback saying that, for example, small and medium enterprises, they are concerned about the effect of all these penalties on their business environment and their compliance costs," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I believe that the government and my office would take all these concerns into account in formulating the concrete details."

<div class="itemFullText">
 Cathay Pacific says it will give its staff bonuses worth at least a month's pay following positive financial results in the past year.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a letter to employees, CEO Ronald Lam said the final level will be announced alongside the company's annual financial postings in mid-March.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm pleased to share that we will be distributing at least four weeks of eligible pay this year," Lam said on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also told staff that the company successfully completed its rebuilding journey last year, allowing flights to return to 100 percent of pre-Covid levels this month.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our strong financial performance for two years in a row also made it possible for us to commit more than HK$100 billion investments into further elevating our customers' experience in the future," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lam vowed to work towards Cathay's vision of "becoming one of the world's greatest service brands".
  <br>
  <br>
  The company's four lines of business, namely Cathay Pacific, Cathay Cargo, Cathay Lifestyle and HK Express, have formulated robust plans to serve customers and deliver great profitability, Lam added.

 Cathay Pacific has apologised to customers after technical issues temporarily disrupted a number of services, including flight bookings and online check-in.
 <br>
  <br>
  The services affected started returning to normal after 2pm on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Various services online and at self check-in kiosks were unavailable "due to a system issue", according to the flagship carrier.
  <br>
  <br>
  Airport check-in counters were not affected and Cathay's flight operations remained normal.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We apologise to our customers for the inconvenience caused and are grateful for their patience," the airline said.
  <br>
  <br>
  It had earlier advised passengers to arrive at the airport at least three hours before departure to allow sufficient time to complete check-in formalities.

    'Oxfam data breach due to outdated firewalls'

<img alt="Privacy Commissioner Ada Chung said about 550,000 subjects were potentially affected. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1788806_1_20250123130332.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data on Thursday said outdated firewalls and ineffective detection measures led to the data breach incident at Oxfam Hong Kong last year.
 <br>
  <br>
  In July, the organisation suffered a ransomware attack, affecting its information systems and resulting in file encryption and data exfiltration.
  <br>
  <br>
  The privacy watchdog’s investigation revealed that over 330 GB of data was exfiltrated from Oxfam’s systems, potentially affecting about 550,000 subjects.
  <br>
  <br>
  The leaked data included identity card and passport copies, credit card and bank account numbers of Oxfam staff members, donors, job applicants and governance members.
  <br>
  <br>
  Privacy Commissioner Ada Chung said Oxfam had not updated its firewalls since 2023, and it failed to take any action despite multiple detections of suspicious activities prior to the incident.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It is a very regrettable situation, because basically we found that the data security measures adopted by Oxfam before the incident were neither adequate nor effective,” Chung said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “That was why it was relatively easy for the hacker to gain access into Oxfam’s system, because basically the firewalls were outdated, and some of the servers had significant vulnerabilities as well.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Chung added Oxfam retained some personal data for a period longer than necessary, including multiple items being held for over seven years.
  <br>
  <br>
  The watchdog said it served an enforcement notice on Oxfam, as it contravened the data protection principle, in which the organisation will have to take measures to prevent similar contraventions in the future.

<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump's incoming policies are casting a shadow over business confidence among small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the city, an economist said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Kelvin Lau, a senior economist at Standard Chartered Bank, said Washington has contributed to global economic uncertainties.
  <br>
  <br>
  "One of the biggest uncertainties recently is the retrenchment of US rate cut expectations. Secondly, it's the uncertainty around Trump's tariffs, how fast and how far he would take them higher," Lau said.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to the results of a Productivity Council survey, the Standard Chartered Hong Kong SME Leading Business Index fell to 42.8 in the January-to-March period, down 2.9 points from the previous three months. Figures below 50 indicate a negative outlook, while those above 50 show a positive one.
  <br>
  <br>
  The drop indicated the overall business confidence of local SMEs "has become more conservative under the uncertain global economic outlook", the council said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Of the more than 800 local firms polled, around 38 percent said the US presidential transition had affected their business confidence.
  <br>
  <br>
  They cited potential tariffs and changes in the economic environment as primary factors. Trump had warned of imposing a 10 percent duty on Chinese imports as soon as February 1.
  <br>
  <br>
  “A lot of things are less to do with local issues, but more to do with external issues. But then the downside is, because it's external, there are a very few things that we can actually control about it," Lau said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We're just hoping that we can also benefit from more policy easing from the US and from China as well. Hopefully the achievement of a global soft landing will help Hong Kong maintain a modest pace of recovery."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lau added that the first round of potential tariffs would be "in line with market expectations", and further hikes, which might not come until 2026, would bring more certainty to enterprises.

    Govt says Greater Bay Airlines has room to improve

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Transport and Logistics Mable Chan on Thursday said there's room for improvement in the performance of Greater Bay Airlines which has announced the cancellation of 128 flights in February and March.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a media gathering, Chan said the airline could have done better with flight arrangements.
  <br>
  <br>
  The transport minister also said the government will try to help the company, which faces operational difficulties, as much as possible, but that officials won't give special treatment to individual firms.
  <br>
  <br>
  She added that the carrier should minimise the inconvenience caused, and rebuild confidence among passengers.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CEO of Greater Bay Airlines said Lunar New Year services will not be affected.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liza Ng apologised on a Commercial Radio programme for the flight cancellations, blamed on a delay in the arrival of new aircraft and planned inspections of planes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ng admitted that the airline could have done better at informing those customers affected.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Because we notified all 5,500 passengers about the cancellations at the same time, by doing so, they will definitely be nervous as it will affect their trip," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When they called us, our staff might not have been able to pick up their calls immediately, making them more anxious. In this case, our customer service didn't handle the incident too well."
  <br>
  <br>
  Ng said the airline has boosted manpower and will look at setting up more communication channels for keeping customers informed of developments.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, an academic who specialises in aviation transport told RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme that it's usual practice for airlines to start selling tickets for flights involving new aircraft that have yet to be delivered.
  <br>
  <br>
  Achim Czerny, a professor at Polytechnic University's department of logistics and maritime studies, said buying new planes is a massive investment and the aircraft must be fully utilised as quickly as possible.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The aircraft deliveries, the airline business is a relatively complex business, and the performance of an airline depends on many players along the supply chain, for instance, aircraft manufacturers," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And that's certainly something that's not entirely under the control of the airline."
  <br>
  <br>
  Tourism sector lawmaker Perry Yiu told RTHK it is crucial that Greater Bay Airlines reviews its flight scheduling, as well as the destinations it flies to.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the airline only has a fleet of eight planes and this means there isn't much flexibility to make temporary adjustments.
  <br>
  <br>
  "After the airline opened new routes, the changes in local environment, political situation, or all kinds of negative news will affect the overall passenger traffic. These are unpredictable," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "To be honest, it's also challenging for the airline, as well as the tourism sector, because a destination that used to be a popular tourist hotspot might have drastic changes."
  <br>
  <br>
  The airline said this week that it is considering ending its flights to Seoul because of an unsatisfactory performance.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan has met with his counterparts from Qatar and Switzerland in Davos as he continued to promote Hong Kong's competitive edge on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum
 <br>
  <br>
  Chan on Wednesday held talks with Ali bin Ahmed Al-Kuwari, the Qatari finance minister, and Daniela Stoffel, state secretary for international finance of Switzerland.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They exchanged insights on the latest global economic and financial landscapes and discussed ways to enhance co-operation between Hong Kong and both economies in trade, financial services and infrastructure," according to a statement by the SAR government.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan also held bilateral meetings with government officials and business leaders from different countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  He discussed strategies to "prevent a new, non-co-operative normal" with some 70 political and economic leaders, according to the statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The financial secretary also told the founder and executive chairman of the World Economic Forum, Klaus Schwab, that Hong Kong values taking part in the annual forum.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This platform offers an opportunity for Hong Kong to showcase its latest economic and social developments to global leaders, and the city's unique advantages under the 'one country, two systems' principle," the statement read.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Such participation also enables Hong Kong representatives to better understand international trends, exchange views with various economic and sectoral representatives, and present Hong Kong's perspectives."

<div class="itemFullText">
 Guangdong have defended their title at the annual Guangdong-Hong Kong Cup football competition, after beating the SAR on aggregate following a 2-1 win on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The two sides had settled for a 1-1 draw in the first leg in Guangzhou a week ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  The return leg was played at the Hong Kong Stadium in front of thousands of home supporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  The first shot on target for Hong Kong, China came shortly after the kick-off, although Mahama Awal’s attempt from the box was comfortably saved by Guangdong goalkeeper Zhao Shi.
  <br>
  <br>
  But it was Guangdong who struck first, when national team player Behram Abduweli scored with a narrow angle shot in the 31st minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  Things got slightly heated after the goal, as Abduweli celebrated by taking off his shirt in front of the home crowd, triggering some Hong Kong fans to throw things at him.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SAR side later suffered another blow when they had to make an early substitution after Awal got injured. Ma Hei-wai replaced him.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the hosts responded swiftly after half-time as Lau Ka-kiu made a quick run into the box and to score an equaliser.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SAR team continued their attack and created multiple scoring chances, including a one-two play between Ma and Wu Chun-ming that led to a shot by Wu.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xia Dalong put Guangdong ahead again in the 85th minute with a stunning header that caught Hong Kong goalkeeper Ng Wai-him off guard.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SAR squad made a final effort to level the game in stoppage time, but captain Stefan Pereira’s free kick was again denied by the Guangdong goalkeeper.

 Border checkpoints will not operate beyond existing hours during the Lunar New Year period, the government announced on Wednesday.

  <br>
  Last year, Lo Wu and Shenzhen Bay extending their operating hours over the festive period – something that officials decided not to do this time around.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[The government] has given due consideration to the relevant circumstances... and decided, in discussion with relevant mainland authorities, to maintain the existing operating hours of the [border control points] during this year's Chinese New Year holiday. The Lok Ma Chau/Huanggang Port and the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge Port will maintain a 24-hour operation as usual," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The HKSAR government appeals to visitors to plan ahead for their itineraries, and stay overnight after participating in various local celebratory activities for the Chinese New Year to fully enjoy the rich and diverse celebratory activities to be held across various districts in the city and experience Hong Kong's unique city charm."
  <br>
  <br>
  The administration also said around 8.67 million passengers trips in and out of the city are expected to take place over the eight-day Lunar New Year "golden week" holiday, with the majority of travellers passing through land border points.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) on Wednesday said banks have made preparations to deal with any risks posed by potential US trade tariffs and are closely monitoring developments.
 <br>
  <br>
  At a press briefing about the banking sector's performance in 2024, HKMA deputy chief executive Arthur Yuen noted that there's a lack of clarity in terms of US President Donald Trump's trade policies.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Generally speaking, you can expect that if the US imposes tariffs on the rest of the world, then the global trade system will suffer and that would actually also impact on business outlook, " Yuen said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have actually asked our banks to stay on high alert on what's the impact of those, and to make sure the risk-management practices are fully in place for handling whatever is coming their way."

<div class="itemFullText">
 Officials in Thailand on Wednesday stressed that the country remains "a safe destination for all international visitors", following reports of Hong Kong residents being lured to Southeast Asia for illegal work.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Royal Thai Consulate-General in Hong Kong also expressed its deep regret, saying it understands what happened had raised concern about the safety among SAR travellers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I would like to assure that Thailand remains a safe destination for all international visitors since none of the victims are tourists. They were misled by scammers to travel to Thailand to work in high-paying jobs but ended up being escorted across the border to the scam centres," a consulate spokesperson said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ten Hongkongers are believed to still be held captive in the region and forced to work in so-called scam farms.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thai authorities have taken steps to tackle transnational crimes and human trafficking that "will help reassure international tourists and visitors of their safety", the spokesperson added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The measures include addressing misinformation online, ensuring sufficient police deployment in high-risk areas, and introducing a two-level boundary control system along the eastern and western borders across 14 provinces.
  <br>
  <br>
  Senior Thai officials had also met their Chinese and Myanmar counterparts in Kunming and "reached positive consensus on eradicating the scam centres in Myanmar", the statement said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, the Thai government posted an AI-generated video of its prime minister speaking in Mandarin, encouraging Chinese tourists to visit the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the clip posted to the government's Facebook page, a likeness of Paetongtarn Shinawatra appeared to speak in fluent Mandarin, a language that the prime minister does not speak in real life.
  <br>
  <br>
  The character emphasised at the start of the video that it had been made with AI.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I understand that recent reports of Chinese nationals being lured to scam compounds around Thailand's borders have triggered concerns among Chinese tourists... Thailand's government puts the safety of all tourists as its utmost priority," the AI Paetongtarn said.

    Govt urged to speed up ban on flavoured tobacco

<img alt="COSH and HKU researchers found that nearly half of surveyed smokers use flavoured cigarettes. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1788690_1_20250122172324.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Council on Smoking and Health (COSH) on Wednesday called on the government to speed up a ban on flavoured tobacco products, saying they make it harder for smokers to quit.
 <br>
  <br>
  From January to May last year, COSH and the University of Hong Kong polled 5,600 people, of whom 2,600 were smokers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Researchers found that nearly half of smokers used flavoured cigarettes, with around 40 percent of teenagers in the poll moderately to severely addicted.
  <br>
  <br>
  Henry Tong, the council’s chairman, said flavoured cigarettes give a false impression to young people that they are less harmful.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The flavours, which might include mint, strawberry, or even alcohol-tasting flavours, are attractive to young people. They cover up the unpleasant smell and unpleasant feeling caused by traditional cigarettes,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last June, health officials announced plans to ban e-cigarettes, flavoured tobacco and lighting up while in a queue. But there is no timeline for the legislation yet.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tong urged the government to table the amendments to the Legislative Council as soon as possible.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also brushed off the possible impact on the tourism sector and bar industry if the ban takes effect.

  “Usually the economic impact of tobacco control has been exaggerated. We believe that better tobacco control in Hong Kong would attract more businesses and help the economy,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tong noted that bars and restaurants saw revenues increase by 30 percent within two years after the indoor smoking ban was introduced in 2007.

 Director of Fire Services Andy Yeung on Wednesday said fire service installation and equipment inspections at new buildings will be dealt with quicker once a new office opens in March.
 <br>
  <br>
  At a press briefing, he said the One-stop Coordination Office for New Fire Protection Facilities Acceptance is expected to cut the certification process down, from an average 52 days to 35.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also said the Fire Services Department will review licensing procedures in light of potential budget cuts to help address the government's deficit.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The financial secretary is now preparing the budget. As usual, we will use our resources prudently and review the resources allocations, review the workflow, review all the licensing, in particular, the licensing procedure in order to cope with the government's budget cuts," Yeung said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The fire chief also said his department has beefed up inspections of old buildings after a fire in a residential building in Jordan killed five people last April.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We conducted inspections of 1,000 old buildings last year with a relatively higher fire risk after the tragic fire at the New Lucky House. More than 8,661 fire hazard abatement notices were issued during the inspection and over half of these cases were related to smoke stop door irregularities," he said.

    'Data breach fines should not be too high or too low'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government says it will look at how big the fines should be for companies that breach data protection laws to make sure they are acceptable to firms, while still having a deterrent effect.
 <br>
  <br>
  Plans are in place to empower the Office of the Privacy Commissioner to fine those involved in data leaks, but some firms have expressed worries about being hit with stiff punishments for lapses, pointing to the sluggish economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  During a Legislative Council session on Wednesday, constitutional affairs minister Erick Tsang said the government understands the concerns.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The government is studying on how to appropriately adjust the legislative amendment proposals, e.g. whether to effect the legislative amendments by phases, thereby reducing the possible effect on business sectors; and how to suitably determine the amount of administrative fines, ensuring they are set at an acceptable level while not losing deterrent effect," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tsang told lawmakers there were 217 data breaches last year, a rise of nearly 30 percent from 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Election Committee lawmaker Carmen Kan asked whether the government could introduce a "shared responsibility" system when it comes to scams.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kan said under such a system, various parties such as financial institutions, telecommunication and media firms would have to fork out compensation for scam victims if the companies were deemed to have failed in their responsibilities.
  <br>
  <br>
  In response, financial services undersecretary Joseph Chan said a similar concept of shared responsibility over unauthorised transactions is already covered in existing laws.

    Consumer body 'deeply concerned' over axed flights

<img alt="The Consumer Council has contacted Greater Bay Airlines over its move to cancel flights. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1788681_1_20250122163348.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's consumer watchdog has expressed deep concern over Greater Bay Airlines' decision to cancel flights in the coming weeks, after receiving complaints regarding the low-cost carrier.
 <br>
  <br>
  The airline previously announced the cancellation of 128 flights in February and March, affecting around 5,500 passengers to places like Japan, Thailand and South Korea.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Consumer Council said it received two complaints regarding flight delays or changes involving HK$7,964 as of Wednesday noon, and has since contacted the budget carrier to follow up on the incident.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The council calls on airlines to prepare for emergencies in peak seasons, fulfil their service commitments, so as not to hurt the reputation of the air carrier and Hong Kong as an international aviation hub," the watchdog said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Haiyan Song, associate dean of the Polytechnic University's tourism management school, said passengers might think twice in future before booking with the budget carrier.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's understandable from the passengers' perspective. They would be unhappy with this cancellation, because this disrupted their travel plans. In the future, when the passengers travel to the same destinations, they would think twice whether they would book [with] Greater Bay Airlines," he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But if, in the future, the [airline] recovers from this crisis and provides good services, customers will gradually build their confidence in the airline."

    Govt wants flight cancellation report in a week

<div class="itemFullText">
 Transport minister Mable Chan said officials met the senior management of Greater Bay Airlines on Wednesday morning over its cancellation of 128 flights between February and March.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chan said authorities want a detailed report from the firm in around a week.
  <br>
  <br>
  The day before, the airline cited a delay in new aircraft deliveries and statutory safety inspections of existing aircraft as the reason for the cancellations, which will affect 5,500 passengers to places like Japan and South Korea.
  <br>
  <br>
  The budget airline added on Wednesday that negligence in its flight scheduling process was found following an internal review, but flights over the Lunar New Year period would not be affected.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking after attending a Legislative Council meeting, Chan said the government wants a detailed report on matters such as remedial measures in around a week's time, noting the airline had already submitted some initial figures to officials.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Transport and Logistics Bureau and the Civil Aviation Department have already met with senior management of Greater Bay Airlines, to learn more about the way forward," she told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our message is very clear. We told the company that it must protect the rights of affected travellers, and that it must do its best to minimise the effects on passengers through various means."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said aviation authorities meet with airlines regularly, and they require firms to submit regular financial and operational reports to ensure that they are run in a robust manner.
  <br>
  <br>
  She described the existing regulatory regime as comprehensive.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister said Greater Bay Airlines should learn from this experience, noting that it's a growing firm that her bureau wants to help in the process.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan expressed hope the airline could be more flexible in scheduling flights in future, by adding buffers in areas such as manpower and computer systems.

    Tackle PRH abuse through applicant, tenant land search
   </title>

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ombudsman Jack Chan has recommended the Housing Authority (HKHA) and the Housing Society (HKHS) conduct thorough land searches for public rental housing (PRH) applicants before determining their eligibility for allocation.
 <br>
  <br>
  The recommendation was part of a comprehensive set of 31 improvements proposed by the office following its investigation into the government's efforts to combat the abuse of public housing resources.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said alongside screening existing tenants, preventing abuse at the source through rigorous vetting can significantly minimise misuse, adding that a new mechanism can make the process more cost-efficient and task effective.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the past, it cost almost HK$640 for each verification. With the intervention of my office through this investigation, the Housing Authority and the Housing Society have devised a new mechanism by which both organisations will submit these tenants' information or declaration by batches to the Land Registry and use a computerised system to verify the information," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This has significantly reduced the cost for such verification process from HK$640 per case down to HK$4 per case."
  <br>
  <br>
  Other recommendations include developing specific incentive schemes for the staff of property service agents and security contractors to encourage their participation in combating abuse and enhancing communication with mainland and Macau authorities to obtain information about tenants' property ownership in those regions.
  <br>
  <br>
  The watchdog commended the authorities for successfully reclaiming over 7,000 flats over abuse or violations of tenancy agreements, but Chan pointed out that the highest prosecution rate in the past seven years was only 4.2 percent in 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said some tenants were evicted from their units but did not face prosecution for PRH abuse, while the two-year prosecution limit passed for other cases.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said he hopes that authorities will consider extending the prosecution time limit and imposing heavier penalties.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Housing Department (HD) thanked the watchdog for its investigation report, and said they would review and study the recommendations to enhance existing measures and explore new methods to combat abuse.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We just launched the Report Public Housing Abuse Award on January 15, hoping to gather more accurate intelligence on tenancy abuse for taking action. To strengthen the deterrent effect and gradually reduce the abuse of public housing resources, we are also actively exploring amendments to the Housing Ordinance to criminalise the act of serious tenancy abuse, targeting to have the Bills passed in the Legislative Council in mid-2025," a spokesman for the HD said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We hope that capable tenants will surrender their PRH flats so that precious public housing resources can be allocated to those in genuine need, optimising the use of public housing resources."

    Friday to see largest Kai Tak Sports Park stress test

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Motorists are being advised to give Kai Tak a swerve on Friday evening as tens of thousands of people head there for the biggest test event yet at the nearly completed sports park in the area.
 <br>
  <br>
  About 63,000 people are expected to pack the main stadium, the arena and the youth sports ground to capacity.
  <br>
  <br>
  The crowd, most of them civil servants, will be treated to a concert by bands from various disciplined services.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a press briefing on Wednesday, deputy police commissioner Chow Yat-ming said the test will be conducted in three stages between 6pm and 10pm.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The first stage is when participants enter the venues from about 6pm, and the second stage is a test of a simulated emergency evacuation, while the third will be when participants naturally exit the venues," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The test will involve civil servants, government employees, as well as members from different social communities, and we'll test our arrangements on the natural entry and exit of participants, and that for buses and taxis, to make sure that the event will be conducted in a safe manner."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chow said that being as 10 drills have been held at the park since last October, the main purpose this time will be evaluating facilities surrounding the site.
  <br>
  <br>
  Assistant transport commissioner Chow Bing-kay urged people taking part in the drill not to drive to the venue, saying roads in the area will already be busy with rush hour traffic.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other motorists would also do well to avoid Kai Tak if possible, Chow said, adding that extra MTR services will be running, especially between Kai Tak and Sung Wong Toi.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan has called on countries to promote collaboration among public, private and philanthropic sectors so as to encourage private investments in green and transition projects.
 <br>
  <br>
  At the World Economic Forum (WEF) Annual Meeting in Davos, Switzerland, on Tuesday, he joined a breakfast meeting organised by the Giving to Amplify Earth Action launched by the WEF.
  <br>
  <br>
  He pointed out that there was a significant funding gap globally in responding to climate change and highlighted Hong Kong's role as a leading green finance hub in Asia, gathering financial institutions, professional services and talent with relevant expertise.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said the thriving ecosystem of family offices, private equity funds, wealth and asset management was conducive to connecting wealth with climate transition projects.
  <br>
  <br>
  He briefed attendees at a luncheon meeting on Hong Kong's latest economic situation and development strategies, highlighting its collaboration with sister cities in the Greater Bay Area.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan met the Director-General of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), Daren Tang, to exchange views on strengthening cooperation in areas such as intellectual property protection and talent training.
  <br>
  <br>
  The financial secretary also met the United Arab Emirates' foreign trade minister, Thani bin Ahmed Al Zeyoudi, to discuss bilateral cooperation in finance and trade.
  <br>
  <br>
  During his attendance at Davos, Chan has highlighted Hong Kong's unique advantages, such as its role as a "super connector" and "super value-adder" between mainland China and the world, saying this creates opportunities for global businesses and investors.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The executive director of the Travel Industry Council, Fanny Yeung, on Wednesday said Greater Bay Airlines' move to cancel scores of flights in the coming weeks won't have a significant impact, given the city's overall capacity.
 <br>
  <br>
  Around 5,500 passengers are believed to have been affected by the cancellation of 128 flights in February and March.
  <br>
  <br>
  The airline cited a delay in new aircraft delivery and the need for plane inspections for the move, which mostly affects its services to Japan, Thailand and South Korea.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The number of affected passengers is around 5,000 plus, so it's still a very minor share when we compare with the overall flight capacity. So I don't think that will have a significant impact," Yeung told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nevertheless, the company should take steps to avoid a repeat of such issues, Yeung added.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, the low-cost carrier apologised for the cancellations and said it has already contacted customers regarding rebookings and refunds.
  <br>
  <br>
  "An internal review in this matter has been carried out immediately and negligence was found in our flight scheduling process. We have also taken immediate action to tighten up the relevant approval procedure for flight scheduling," the statement said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The airline also said no flights over the Lunar New Year are affected.
  <br>
  <br>
  The carrier added that it is considering dropping its flights to Seoul because of unsatisfactory performance.

    Guidelines to help govt staff uphold national security

<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Security Chris Tang said a set of guidelines will be introduced in the first quarter of this year, allowing public officers to better understand their responsibilities on safeguarding national security.
 <br>
  <br>
  Last year's Policy Address stated that all government bureaux and departments must review guidelines to ensure compliance with provisions in the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on RTHK's
  <i>
   Overview Policy
  </i>
  programme, Tang said the guidelines would provide clear explanations on 20 categories of national security and how they relate to officers' work.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Public officers not only have to make considerations of national security at work, but they also have to be proactive," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Some of them don't fully understand that, so we will introduce a set of guidelines in the first quarter of 2025, using plain language and examples, instead of legal terms, to make explanations."
  <br>
  <br>
  An example cited by Tang is how government procurement may be affected by foreign sanctions.
  <br>
  <br>
  On a cross-border emergency-response mechanism established last year strengthening collaboration between Hong Kong and other Greater Bay Area cities, the security minister said up to two large-scale drills are held every year, while small-scale ones take place more frequently.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong is set to host the World Snooker Grand Prix at the Kai Tak Arena, the first ranking tournament to be held in the city since 1989.
 <br>
  <br>
  The tournament will take place from March 4 to 9, featuring the top 32 players from around the world including Judd Trump and Ronnie O'Sullivan, who will be playing on home turf for the first time after becoming Hong Kong residents through the Quality Migrant Admission Scheme.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other snooker greats set to be in action include China's top player Ding Junhui, former World champions Mark Selby of England and Australian Neil Robertson, and the current World champion Kyren Wilson.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This will be the first formal sport event to be held in Kai Tak Arena, so there will be a lot of challenges because I don't think anyone in Hong Kong has the experience of organising something of this scale in this venue," said Vincent Law, chairman of the Billiard Sports Council of Hong Kong China.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are working on every single detail meticulously, especially the production, the seating plan, the scenery, the facilities for example the media room, the media centre, the other rooms for the players, a lot of things. It's not an easy task, but we are trying our best."
  <br>
  <br>
  It's also the first time Hong Kong will host the World Snooker Grand Prix.
  <br>
  <br>
  Simon Brownell, CEO of the World Snooker Tour, said it'll be a treat for both the fans and the players.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They will be desperate to become the first to lift the historic World Grand Prix trophy in Hong Kong, and to win the historic highs prize money for this event," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For the local fans, it will be incredible opportunity to watch the best players on the planet and marvel at their skills. We are sure the atmosphere will be electric and it will be a fabulous experience for everyone inside the arena."
  <br>
  <br>
  During the event, exhibition matches will be held for other elite players, including local favourite Marco Fu.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said it promises to be a great tournament that would further promote snooker in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Looking back, many years ago I went to Queen Elizabeth Stadium to watch the likes of Steve Davis, Jimmy White, they played in an exhibition tournament in Hong Kong, and that's when I really fell in love with the game of snooker," Fu told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm sure many youngsters will come to this tournament to watch all the top players playing, and I'm sure they're going to fall in love with the game of snooker.
  <br>
  <br>
  "After this tournament, more youngsters will pick up the cue and start to play snooker. It's going to be fantastic."

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Greater Bay Airlines on Tuesday announced the cancellation of flights, which could disrupt the plans of some Lunar New Year travellers.
 <br>
  <br>
  The airline did not specify the number of flights affected, but it's understood that more than 200 flights scheduled between January and March, mainly to Japan and South Korea, were cancelled.
  <br>
  <br>
  Greater Bay Airlines cited a delay in new aircraft delivery and statutory safety inspections of existing aircraft.
  <br>
  <br>
  The carrier said it's helping passengers to re-book tickets or with refunds.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will learn from the experience and review the relevant arrangements to avoid similar situations from happening again," it wrote in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The airline also said all fees will be waived to reduce the possible impact on people's travel plans.
  <br>
  <br>
  The flight cancellations sparked a backlash on social media, with would-be holidaymakers complaining that their travel plans have been disrupted in a Facebook group.
  <br>
  <br>
  Transport secretary Mable Chan expressed deep concern and requested a detailed report.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a Facebook post, Chan said the Transport and Logistics Bureau will meet with airline representatives to understand the latest situation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Steve Huen, executive director of EGL Tours, said 11 tour groups heading to Tokushima, Japan, after February 10 will be affected, involving more than 100 people.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Generally, we give customers options. They can choose to switch to other destinations. If they cannot find a suitable alternative due to flight disruption, we usually provide a full refund," Huen said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yuen Chun-ning, executive director of WWPKG Holdings, said five tour groups going to Sendai in March will have to be cancelled, with around 100 people affected.
  <br>
  <br>
  Travellers can reschedule or choose to cancel for a full refund, Yuen said.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Immigration officials on Tuesday said seven mainland visitors were jailed for up to two months each for working illegally in Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  The jail sentences came after officers arrested eight people this month who provided illegal tour guide services and acted as "shopping agents".
  <br>
  <br>
  Seven earlier appeared at Sha Tin Magistrates’ Courts and at Tuen Mun Magistrates’ Courts, and admitted they had breached their condition of stay.
  <br>
  <br>
  They were given 54 days to two months in jail.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officers said one case is still under investigation, and there could be more arrests.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officers said four women acted as tour guides in Hong Kong. They arranged guided visits for their guests to different tourist attractions in the city, and took photos for them, at an hourly rate of HK$100 to HK$300.
  <br>
  <br>
  For the other four men, officers said they acted as “shopping agents” by buying food and necessities at supermarkets and restaurants on the mainland, and delivered the goods to customers in Hong Kong. They could earn anywhere between HK$100 and HK$200 for each transaction.
  <br>
  <br>
  The four men and four women, aged between 19 and 52, were arrested in Hong Kong between January 13 and Monday, after officers posed as customers and reserved services from them through social media.
  <br>
  <br>
  Immigration Department deputy commander Leung Tsz-chung reminded citizens to be wary of such services.
  <br>
  <br>
  “When choosing those services, people have to be careful and vigilant, and to make sure the service providers can be employed legally in Hong Kong. Otherwise, people may face criminal liability,” Leung said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's Lunar New Year fireworks display on the second day of the Year of the Snake will feature patterns of pandas, smiley faces and gold ingots, organisers said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 23-minute show, divided into nine scenes, will light up Victoria Harbour from 8pm on January 30.
  <br>
  <br>
  Organisers said 23,888 pyrotechnic shells will be launched from three barges, opening with a lucky number eight and a scene entitled "A Brand New Beginning".
  <br>
  <br>
  Wilson Mao, CEO of Pyromagic Multimedia Productions, said the eighth scene is the highlight of the show, featuring patterns of six pandas.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The six panda heads symbolise the family of pandas that are now in Hong Kong. Two of which are newborns, a very happy moment for Hong Kong, and also China has given Hong Kong two pandas. Along with the two natives that are always in Hong Kong, we have a family of six," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mao described the extravaganza here as "one of a kind".
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong has a very beautiful backdrop, and to feature a fireworks display in this beautiful backdrop is one of a kind. There's nowhere in the world that can beat this beautiful backdrop.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The fireworks in Guangzhou, they don't have a backdrop like in Hong Kong... Hong Kong is certainly world famous, the fireworks event held here is always number one."
  <br>
  <br>
  Spectators can listen to RTHK Radio 4 for synchronised music during the show.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A mainland student from the University of Hong Kong (HKU) is suspected to have lost around HK$1.8 million in a phone scam, sources said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  It is understood the woman, 22, got a phone call last August from someone pretending to be from the SAR's Immigration Department.
  <br>
  <br>
  The scammer told her she was involved in a case on the mainland and threatened to arrest her unless she opened an account at a designated bank.
  <br>
  <br>
  The victim was asked to make six money transfers to the bank account to prove that she was innocent, sources have said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Failing to contact the fraudster, she realised she had been scammed and reported the case to police.
  <br>
  <br>
  In an email to students on Sunday, HKU said that more than 60 students have been scammed in recent months, resulting in a total loss of HK$60 million.

 Less than a quarter of small to medium-sized companies in Hong Kong have taken adequate steps to make sure they don't fall foul of competition laws, a watchdog warned on Tuesday, adding that it has come up with a new website to help firms get the information they need.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Competition Commission said a survey of around 600 companies it carried out from late 2023 to 2024 found only 24 percent of SMEs had policies in place to ensure they complied with competition regulations.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The survey results suggest that the SMEs have a quite good understanding of the Competition Ordinance. At the same time, we realise they have some confusion on some details regarding the law. We found out that they may not have the necessary resources to implement compliance plans within the company," said Gary Shiu, an executive director of the commission.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shiu said larger enterprises have the resources to hire professionals to provide advice on the matter, while smaller companies that don't have the money are at a greater risk of breaking the law.
  <br>
  <br>
  The new platform, SME Hub, highlights key aspects of the ordinance and has an assessment tool for identifying potential risks with business activities.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shiu said it also includes real-life scenarios or hypothetical examples to bust common myths surrounding the ordinance.
  <br>
  <br>
  "All enterprises have some misunderstanding concerning being part of a cartel agreement or price-fixing agreements. They would always think that as long as there are no anti-competitive effects or any negative effects in the market, then why would they infringe the law?" Shiu said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The watchdog said it will also be organising talks and training for SMEs on implementing internal guidelines for the ordinance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Andrew Kwok, who chairs the Hong Kong Small and Medium Enterprises Association, said limited resources is not the only challenge when it comes to implementing relevant guidelines.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The lack of expertise, and being uncertain about the ordinance requirements make it difficult to lay out internal policies. If the details [of the law] are too complicated, SMEs may need to consult relevant lawyers for clarification," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kwok agreed that the new website can help SMEs understand the ordinance more thoroughly.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Some SMEs may have a basic understanding, but most do not fully understand the [ordinance] terms in detail and what it implies. The launch of the SME hub provides resources and guidance tailor-made for SMEs," he said.

 Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday expressed his hope for promoting positive relations with Washington after US President Donald Trump returned to office for a second term, while saying Hong Kong would also "prepare for the worst".
 <br>
  <br>
  Lee also warned any political interference would not work.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Any political interference, any inappropriate action against Hong Kong will not work. We believe what we do is for the overall good of Hong Kong," Lee said when asked if he's worried about more sanctions on the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If there is any attempt to interfere with trials in Hong Kong, or officials or people who are involved in administering justice, it won't work. We are doing it exactly in the same way in protecting our national security as other citizens in their own countries."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee said he hopes to have a good relationship with the United States, as there are many common interests between the two sides.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With the new president in office, I hope to see that there will be good efforts to promote positive relations, because cooperation and collaboration will only create overall good for the people of Hong Kong and the people of the US. And Hong Kong people and US citizens have always been friends in a lot of areas and we'll continue to work hard on that regard," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But, of course, we will always prepare for the worst, and we will ensure that the rights of our people and companies will be protected."
  <br>
  <br>
  The SAR always seeks to strengthen ties and exchanges with different countries including the United States, the chief executive said, but there should be mutual respect and understanding.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on RTHK's Backchat programme on Tuesday, Alan Lung, co-convenor of The Path of Democracy, said the SAR government may find it challenging to anticipate Trump's thinking.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our government may not be able to read Trump, and doesn't understand what they [the administration] are worried about," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ross Feingold, Head of Research at Cyrus Consulting, felt the SAR could face an uphill battle when dealing with Washington.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong is starting from a disadvantage, and we also have to keep in mind that no matter what he [Trump] says about his personal relationship with [President] Xi Jinping... Secretary of State (Marco) Rubio, who was just confirmed, the foreign policy team, these are people who don't have warm opinions towards Hong Kong."
