  <div class="itemFullText">
   The government on Sunday said the second isolated Common Squirrel Monkey from the Hong Kong Zoological and Botanical Gardens had died, taking the monkey death toll to 11.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The death of the Common Squirrel Monkey followed earlier news of a tenth death, also of a Common Squirrel Monkey. Both had been in isolation following a spate of monkey deaths at the gardens that began about a week ago.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   On Friday, the government said nine monkeys had died of sepsis after catching melioidosis, potentially because workers dug up soil near their habitat. Autopsies found a large amount of a bacteria that causes the disease in the monkeys' organs.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department will conduct necropsy to see whether the cause of death was the same as the other cases earlier.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   One monkey, a De Brazza Monkey, remains in isolation.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Officials added that the bacteria are unlikely to be transmitted from animals to humans.

    Ethnic minorities get boost in job search

  <img alt="Various government departments and firms take part in the job fair at the Sikh Temple in Wan Chai.

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   While ethnic minority job seekers said language barriers remain their biggest obstacle, some companies have improved their prospects by adding more English to training materials and lowering their Chinese language requirements.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Various government departments and firms were recruiting staff at a job fair held on Sunday by the Equal Opportunities Commission (EOC). One of them was a franchised bus company offering positions such as bus captains, technicians and customer service officers.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Citybus said all Chinese guidelines have been translated into English to accommodate ethnic minority workers. It also said the requirement for bus captains now is basic communication in Cantonese, compared with reading and writing Chinese and speaking fluent Cantonese in the past.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The firm has about 30 ethnic minority staff.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I think they are quite embedded in our whole population, our local bus captains are happy to work with them. All the people in the company, they know that the company is an inclusive employer," said Citybus general manager Roger Wong.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Rojal, who's from Nepal and has been in Hong Kong for almost a decade, submitted an application with a bank.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He said he found it hard to land a job here because of language barriers.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The employers are really looking for someone who actually can speak the language," he said. "I'm not exactly sure why that's the case, perhaps the clients want you to speak in Chinese or the documents could be in Chinese."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Another job seeker, Bharvani, echoed the sentiment.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Even though I studied here, my reading and writing skills are not that great. So it (throws out) at least half or three-fourths of the job opportunities," said the ethnic Indian who was born and raised in Hong Kong.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The head of the EOC, Linda Lam, said more should be done to create job opportunities for ethnic minorities.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "In fact, there are many young ethnic minorities with qualifications, outstanding attitude, and are [highly-skilled], and they are suitable to work in various levels of an organisation," she said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "In the future, we will be organising other activities to continue our efforts, to promote the breaking down of stereotypes, to help the ethnic minorities to have more opportunities to participate in different levels in the workforce."

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Housing minister Winnie Ho said on Sunday that the government could start prosecuting landlords of illegal subdivided flats by the end of 2026 at the earliest, with the possibility of jail terms.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In his Policy Address last week, Chief Executive John Lee announced plans to regulate subdivided units, renaming the vetted flats "basic housing units" (BHUs) and making those smaller than 86 square feet illegal.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Ho said if all goes smoothly, laws would be passed by the end of next year, and that would be followed by a period for landlords to register and a grace period for them to renovate the flats to meet the new requirements.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "[If] a one-year registration period is enough, that would take us to the end of 2026," she said on a Commercial Radio programme.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "If landlords don't register during the period and continue to operate homes that violate our regulations, then law enforcement could begin at the end of 2026, or at the start of 2027 at the earliest. That's within the term of the current administration."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Deputy Financial Secretary Michael Wong, who heads a government task force on the matter, said the timeline is not set in stone, citing an upcoming public consultation exercise and discussion with lawmakers.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Wong also said he doesn't think there'll be a significant drop in supply, pointing to the availability of more BHUs in the market in future.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He added that among tenants of current subdivided flats, 60 percent of them are eligible to apply for public housing and the rest could look for BHUs or transitional housing units, insisting everyone will have a roof over their heads.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   On a TVB programme, Lee said landlords of subdivided flats are allowed to raise rents by a maximum of 10 percent under existing rent-control laws. The CE also said tenants can move from one BHU to another in future, in the event rents go up.

    'Fair to revise allocation ratio for subsidised flats'

  <img alt="John Lee says public housing tenants should be given a chance to climb the housing ladder. File Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=90&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1775355_1_20241020125545.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Chief Executive John Lee said giving public housing tenants a greater chance to buy Home Ownership Scheme units is a step towards helping them climb the housing ladder and should not be deemed unfair to the broader public.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In his Policy Address on Wednesday, Lee announced a revision of the allocation ratio for the subsidised flats, changing it from 4:6 to 5:5 between green form, or current public housing residents, and white form applicants.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   During a TVB programme aired on Sunday, the CE was asked whether the move was intended to "pressure" the general public into pursuing private property to boost the market, given the quota for green form applicants had not been fully utilised in the past two years.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Don't resort to conspiracy theories,” Lee said in response.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “Frankly, when you're allocating housing, flexibility is crucial.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “The ratio between green and white form applicants could be different every single time. If one side doesn't use up the quota, then it could be re-allocated. There can easily be differences, and it's the role of the government to adjust these.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lee also rejected suggestions the revised allocation favours well-off public housing tenants, who are being urged to move out in accordance with government policy.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Typically we expect a duration of about 10 years for residents to make progress. Then we'll give them the opportunity to return the public housing units to those who need them. I believe this approach is reasonable,” he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Meanwhile, Lee said the relaxation of mortgage rules as announced in this year's Policy Address was based on the assessment that the private housing market is developing in a healthy manner.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Under the new policy, the maximum loan-to-value ratio for all homes has been adjusted to 70 percent, regardless of their value, and the maximum debt servicing ratio has been raised to 50 percent.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The CE said he has not detected speculation following the change, and stressed that the chances of speculative activity under present market conditions are very low.

  <img alt="Paul Chan echos the Chief Executive's idea of further developing Hong Kong's gold market. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1775354_1_20241020125513.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Financial Secretary Paul Chan said on Sunday gold trading in Hong Kong has great room for growth amid global market developments, and building up the SAR's market is of great strategic significance.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In announcing his Policy Address last week, Chief Executive John Lee spoke of the vision to turning Hong Kong into an operating centre for international commodity trading, including storage, delivery and shipping.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Chan, for his part, said commodities trading is an important part of economic activities as it could play a pivotal role in ensuring the stable supply of raw materials.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Creating a commodity trading ecosystem can become a new point of support for the development of Hong Kong as an international financial, aviation and trading hub," he wrote on his weekly blog.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The minister said this could drive the development of aviation and trading for the Greater Bay Area, and offer stability to the supply chain in the region.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The priority is to boost trade volume in the short to medium term, Chan said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The minister said as geopolitical uncertainties rise, demand for gold is expected to stay high for risk-averse investors, and some market players expect trade volume to multiply.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He said once the local infrastructure for gold storage and trading is built up, the SAR can further look into fostering closer links with the mainland gold market.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Chan said developing more risk-management and derivative products can help boost the country's global influence in the gold market in the long run.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   This, he said, has great strategic significance in raising Hong Kong's status as an international financial centre.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Deputy Chief Secretary Warner Cheuk said a new government body aimed at developing tourist hotspots will hold its first meeting next month.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Chief Executive John Lee announced in his Policy Address on Wednesday the setting up of a Working Group on Development Tourist Hotspots, which involves at least seven government departments.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Speaking on a radio programme on Sunday, Cheuk, who leads the group, said it wants to develop projects that are inventive, attractive and feasible, and it's open to suggestions from the public.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Hong Kong has a lot of resources for tourism, such as Victoria Harbour, food, films, etc. We will develop new projects involving the use of these resources," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "For example food, you can see from YouTube a lot of tourists look for food in Hong Kong. This might be familiar to us but for tourists, it is very attractive. We can think about developing night markets, or building a food city.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Hong Kong also has its film culture and natural environment. We can also consider developing new photo-taking spots."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lee said on Saturday the working group will uncover must-see destinations across Hong Kong as it hopes to unearth hidden gems beyond Victoria Harbour.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Cheuk also said consumption habits of tourists have changed since the Covid-19 pandemic, and businesses have to think of new ways to attract tourists to spend.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We cannot only complain about why tourists don't come here to spend. It's not that people don't spend money, there have to be places where they think it's worth spending money," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The official said tourists are more demanding nowadays and it is crucial to find products that are unique to Hong Kong to attract more visitors.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Separately, Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism Kevin Yeung said he's confident his bureau will announce the Blueprint for Arts and Culture and Creative Industries Development soon.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The CE said in the Policy Address that the Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau needs more time to come up with the blueprint.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We received a lot of opinions, and we made big changes due to changes in the economy. In this case, we hope to have thorough discussions with the Culture Commission, and there may be changes after that. We will also have to include good suggestions in the blueprint. We still hope to announce the blueprint as soon as possible," Yeung said.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Culture, sports and tourism minister Kevin Yeung said the government has taken sufficient preventive measures at the Zoological and Botanical Gardens on news of the death of a tenth monkey there.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The latest death involves a common squirrel monkey, which had been put under isolated surveillance since nine other animals died about a week ago.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Officials said a necropsy will be conducted to find out the cause of death.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Two other animals, a common squirrel monkey and a De Brazza's Monkey, are in isolation.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Speaking to reporters after attending a radio programme on Sunday, Yeung said there are no abnormalities among some 70 monkeys at the zoo in Central.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Because of the latest death, the relevant departments have held another meeting and we visited the gardens. Overall, we think [the preventive measures] in place are sufficient, and we'll continue with this plan," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "There are still two other monkeys in isolation, and we'll take care of them. We know their condition may go up and down, sometimes they're better and sometimes worse. If there's anything new we'll definitely update the public."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   On Friday, the government said the nine monkeys died of sepsis after catching melioidosis, potentially because workers dug up soil near their habitat.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Autopsies found a large amount of the melioidosis-inducing bacteria in the monkeys' organs.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Officials added that the bacteria are unlikely to be transmitted from animals to humans.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   The first phase of pilot projects on developing the low-altitude economy will focus on using drones for food delivery and transporting cargo with Cyberport and Science Park being in the pipeline, the government said on Saturday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In this week's Policy Address, the chief executive said the government will set up a working group that will explore how the city can benefit from the use of drones and other aerial technology to provide services such as transporting goods and people.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Deputy Financial Secretary Michael Wong, who led the working group, told a press conference that officials will work with industry partners on pilot projects, starting applications at the end of this year and launching "regulatory sandboxes" early next year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We expect that the first phase will mainly focus on aerial monitoring and some drone cargo delivery, such as delivering food and transporting lightweight goods like mail and medications," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We also hope that the pilot locations and routes can cover areas in Hong Kong with different terrains, landscapes, and densities. Some areas that could be considered include Science Park, Cyberport, outlying islands, and the Northern Metropolis."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   This plan requires amending existing laws and creating new ones, especially a regulatory framework for drones over 25 kg.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Wong said the government aims to submit a draft bill to the Legislative Council in early 2025.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He said while the mainland's low-altitude economy is growing rapidly, it's too early to estimate Hong Kong's potential revenue from this sector.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "As our work is in its initial stages, it would be somewhat unrealistic to mention many specific figures at this point or to predict future economic contributions. This is because the mainland is a bit ahead of us in this area, and their data comes from big data."

  <div class="itemFullText">
   The Secretary for Environment and Ecology Tse Chin-wan said the government's plan to reduce waste in Hong Kong remains unchanged despite the shelving of the waste charging scheme, adding that raising public awareness and increasing recycling facilities instead has achieved great results.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The government announced earlier this year that they would not implement the citywide waste charging scheme in August as originally planned, but the environment chief said at a press conference on Saturday that good recycling and waste management practice has increased immensely.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He said that the total amount of recycling has increased by more than half in the past six months.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We saw when we were advertising the waste scheme that even though public opinion was to postpone it, people were very supportive of waste reduction and recycling practices. So we are now seizing the opportunity by enhancing recycling facilities and strengthening public education to promote a good waste reduction and recycling culture in society," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We will also study how to optimise the waste charging scheme so that people can be more adaptable and accepting of waste reduction and recycling measures when implemented in the future."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Tse said that they will optimise a plan and share their progress with the Legislative Council in the middle of next year.

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Greenpeace on Saturday said more than 3,200 pieces of rubbish have been collected in its clean-up operations along two of Hong Kong's riverbanks in the past four months, with 97 percent of it being plastic.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The top items found in the Lam Tsuen and Pui O Rivers were food and beverage packaging, disposable plastic tableware, and shipping materials, the environmental group told RTHK.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Greenpeace campaigner Leanne Tam said microplastics from these sources can enter ecosystems and food chains, potentially affecting human health.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It easily get into the ecosystem because they are small, maybe eaten by animals. Or even when we drink it or we eat through the food chain, they will enter our blood system or even our brain," she said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Tam said the government should implement a HK$1 deposit system for beverage bottles, rather than the proposed 10-cent incentive, to better tackle plastic waste.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The government should add the reduction target on single-use packaging and also the reuse target for the overall package and overall beverage packaging system," she added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The advocate added that individuals and companies can also play a part by choosing packaging-free items and changing their business models to phase out single-use plastics.

    Bus parade, exhibition mark PRC's 75th anniversary

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Buses ranging from museum pieces to state-of-the-art machines on Saturday rolled through the city to mark the 75th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The parade, organised by the Transport Department and three franchised bus operators, featured retired and in-service buses.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The procession started in Victoria Park, passing along the northern shore of Hong Kong Island and finishing up at the Central Ferry Piers.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   There is also a four-day bus exhibition underway at Victoria Park.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Speaking at the departure ceremony, transport minister Lam Sai-hung said buses have long been an indispensable part of people's livelihoods.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The rapid development of new energy technologies of our country in recent years has enriched Hong Kong's choices of new energy public transport," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Numerous electric double-decker buses and hydrogen fuel cell buses introduced into Hong Kong in the past few years were China-made models."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Many bus lovers gathered to take photos of the parading buses, including Mr Lee, who purposely came from Guangzhou, to see some of the SAR's antique buses.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I have never seen these discontinued buses in a public event parading before, so I think this opportunity is very rare. I purposely came from the mainland to see them," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Another spectator, Mr Chan, was ecstatic to see history passing through the streets of Hong Kong.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I didn't think they would host a bus tour. I saw some new buses. It turns out that one of them is a new Citybus that is probably not in service yet. I couldn't believe that new buses would be featured in the parade. It’s really exciting. I hope the government will organise more parades in the future."

    Skilled technicians to come and fill manpower shortage
   </title>

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Chief Secretary Eric Chan said the government plans to bring in 10,000 skilled technicians to ease the manpower shortage, adding that they hope to attract younger workers to bring down the average working age in the industry.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Speaking on a radio programme on Saturday, he said that Hong Kong is projected to face a shortage of approximately 180,000 workers across different sectors in the future, with about 60,000 vacancies earmarked for skilled technicians.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He stressed that the remaining 50,000 spots would be reserved for locals who are interested.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "There are certain conditions for the people coming in. They must first have a licence, and secondly, they can only engage in their own industry when they come to Hong Kong. They cannot work in another field. This is the way to go," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We hope to choose younger people because we hope that they can work for a long time, and we want to make the workforce younger. That is very important for our future."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He added that labour importation schemes are short-term solutions, and that they would continue to train local workers to alleviate the problem in the coming years.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Stated in the new Policy Address, the government will build a campus for the Hong Kong Institute of Information Technology, under the Vocational Training Council, and develop its Lift and Escalator Technology Centre.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Chan said that both universities and the Vocational Training Council would also focus on the demand for high-tech talents, with institutions increasing incentives for research.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "High technology plays a huge role in the development of our future, so whether it is in our universities, or through the Vocational Training Council, there will be courses catered to this type of demand. Even in our universities, we will add more scholarships for students to do some research and study for master's and doctoral degrees," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It is mainly for the industries that we need. We will encourage them to do their best and provide them with more incentives to train and study in the future, and it's all towards high-tech development."

    New tourism working group to uncover hidden gems: CE

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   A new working group on developing tourist hotspots will uncover must-see destinations across Hong Kong and will ease the workload of the Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau, Chief Executive John Lee said on Saturday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In his third Policy Address, Lee said the working group, led by Deputy Chief Secretary Warner Cheuk, will strengthen cross departmental co-ordination and leverage community efforts in identifying and developing tourist hotspots.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Speaking on an RTHK radio programme, the CE said officials hope to unearth hidden gems beyond Victoria Harbour.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "For example, the Champs-Élysées in France... it has many unique features, and everyone goes there. Hong Kong of course has its own attractions. We already have Victoria Harbour, which we'll continue to develop," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "But we also have many other treasures. How can we showcase our Geopark? We've discussed this before. There are many various aspects. We hope to pay more attention to public opinion."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The policy blueprint also outlined plans to develop the SAR into an international tertiary education hub by creating the "Study in Hong Kong" brand and encouraging more local students to pursue advanced studies.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Asked how to attract exchange students with the city's high cost of living, Lee said Hong Kong has much to offer with its freedom, convenience, and cultural diversity.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Sometimes I like a girl because she's beautiful, sometimes because she's virtuous, and sometimes because of her knowledge. Hong Kong also appeals in many ways. Of course, we're not as big [geographically] as other big cities. That's the reality. But we still have many other appealing features," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   On another radio programme, the CE was asked if he was dissatisfied that cultural and tourism officials failed to announce its Blueprint for Arts and Culture and Creative Industries Development as scheduled.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In response, Lee said, "When you look at the 2023 Policy Address, around four to five items are behind schedule. When I set indicators, I look at whether there are reasons for the delay and if those reasons are justified. The purpose is to make sure that we accomplish what we have promised to do."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It comes as, in the Policy Address annex, Lee pointed out the bureau "requires more time to revise the draft blueprint to cater for the long‑term development of the sector".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In response to queries about the matter on Friday, cultural and tourism minister Kevin Yeung said the blueprint is "nearly complete" and he didn't feel that the CE had publicly urged him in any way.

    Melioidosis to blame for monkey deaths: officials

  <img alt="Officials say there is no need to shut down the whole zoo, as the melioidosis-causing bacteria do not easily transmit from animals to humans. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1775197_2_20241018200137.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Nine monkeys from the Hong Kong Zoological and Botanical Gardens died of sepsis after catching melioidosis, authorities revealed on Friday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Part of the zoo has been shut down since Monday after eight monkeys, including three critically-endangered cotton-top tamarins, were found dead the previous day.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   One more death was registered later, while another monkey was taken away for observation.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Subsequent autopsies found a large amount of the melioidosis-inducing bacteria in the monkeys' organs.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Culture and tourism minister Kevin Yeung offered a possible explanation of where the bacteria came from.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He said works performed at the zoo earlier this month required the digging up of soil near the monkeys' habitat. Workers were then believed to have brought contaminated soil into the cage through their shoes.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   According to the Centre for Health Protection, the bacterium is particularly common in moist clay soil. It can affect both humans and animals.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But Yeung stressed that it is not necessary to seal off the whole facility from the public.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We have taken all the cleansing and disinfection measures on the cages. With all these measures, we believe that it's now clean and free of the bacteria," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We have also cordoned off the whole mammals section for the time being, so there will be no sort of contact between normal citizens with the animals."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Protective gear has been provided to staff after the incident, and those who may have had contact with the monkeys tested negative for the bacterium.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Thomas Sit, assistant director of Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation, said operators had performed check-ups for the animals as soon as possible.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Before the animals lost appetite, they were a bit incompetent, quiet, abnormal, and the time of onset of all the clinical signs only took two days, and then there was a sudden death of the animals," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The vets already took measures to treat the monkeys. However, the affected monkeys could not make it and [we] had to perform post-mortem and isolate [them] to prevent the spread of the disease."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sit said the facility has been instructed to step up cleansing work, and staff should maintain good hygiene to avoid a repeat of the incident.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   An infectious disease expert said the bacteria usually lie deep down in the soil, meaning contact with humans and animals was unlikely.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "But if there had been work done to this soil with digging, and also if these bacteria in the deep soil had been elevated to the surface, then the animals there could have been exposed to a large number of bacteria, so that would probably have contributed to this outbreak in these monkeys," Wilson Lam told RTHK.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It would be prudent to shut down the area temporarily, the doctor said, as the bacteria may still be present in the environment.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But he played down fears of humans contracting the disease from monkeys.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Transmission from animals to human is really, really rare, so we are more worried about the presence of bacteria in the soil, and also the environment in the park at this moment."

   Cultural and tourism minister Kevin Yeung on Friday said there will be various test events at the Kai Tak Sports Park starting as early as the end of this month, to check transport facilities and crowd dispersal measures.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   With mega events such as Coldplay concerts lined up for the sports park when it opens in the first quarter of next year, there have been calls for officials to improve transport solutions.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Yeung told a press conference that such efforts are underway.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We may start with some small-scale games. For example, we have a smaller sports ground at Kai Tak with 5,000 seats. Some competitions will start to be held there," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Of course during these so-called test events, we will try out the venue and its supporting facilities, and also things like crowd dispersal to see how we can do it best."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Asked about a review of the redevelopment plan for Hong Kong Stadium – a move mentioned in this week's Policy Address – Yeung said officials need to examine how it can keep up with the city's development needs, and whether there are sufficient venues for mega events even after the Kai Tak site opens.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In the Policy Address annex, Chief Executive John Lee pointed out that the Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau failed to announce its Blueprint for Arts and Culture and Creative Industries Development as scheduled.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In response to questions about the matter, Yeung said the blueprint is nearly complete and he will follow the CE's instructions to finish it as soon as possible.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I don't think the chief executive has publicly urged me to do anything... I think everyone needs to be pragmatic. When the CE mentioned me yesterday, it was in response to questions about tourism work. He used tourism as an example. I was there yesterday too. He talked about the division of work between the relevant working groups and the bureau. I don't feel there was any urging there," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The blueprint, expected to be promulgated later this year, will outline the vision and initiatives for developing high-quality arts, cultural and creative industries.

   Hong Kong's unemployment rate remained steady at three percent in the three-month period ending in September, which is the same as the June-to-August period.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Official figures from the Census and Statistics Department on Friday showed the underemployment rate also remained unchanged at 1.2 percent.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In a statement, the Secretary for Labour and Welfare, Chris Sun, said the unemployment rates of various sectors showed diverse movements during the period, although the changes were not significant.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The overall labour market should remain tight in the near term alongside the sustained economic growth, though the employment situation may vary across sectors depending on their business performances,” he said.

    'Spirits tax cut won't burden public health system'

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Hong Kong's reduction in duty on premium spirits is not intended to encourage consumption and won't create an extra burden on the public health system, the government said on Friday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Duty on liquor with an alcohol content above 30 percent and with an import price of over HK$200 has been cut from 100 percent to 10 percent on the portion above HK$200.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Despite concerns that the move will lead to increased alcohol consumption, Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development Algernon Yau said the right balance has been struck.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We believe that a two-tier system can balance various considerations and create a more balanced measure. It reduces concerns from the medical community regarding alcohol abuse, while on the other hand aiming to boost trade in high-end spirits," he told a radio show.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Speaking on an RTHK

   </a>
   on his Policy Address, Chief Executive John Lee said the the government is very conscious about protecting public health, but is at the same time creating extra opportunities for Hong Kong.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I do see the potential here, not just because of what we learn from the cancellation of wine duty, but in fact there is a big market for high-end liquor such as whiskey, and also brandy, and also a lot of Chinese liquor," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Yau also said Health Secretary Lo Chung-mau backed the duty cut.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We have also consulted Secretary Lo. This measure has his approval and support, which is why we are able to implement it," Yau said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Also speaking on an RTHK programme, Financial Secretary Paul Chan said the duty cut won't have a huge effect on prices, noting that around 85 percent of hard liquor in the market is priced under HK$200.

  <img alt="Travel Industry Council chair Gianna Hsu says the tourism industry has to up their game to attract more high-end travellers. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=90&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1775125_2_20241018124511.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The tourism industry is eagerly seeking ways to attract more tourists from the Middle East and Asean countries, according to Travel Industry Council chairman Gianna Hsu.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Hsu said on Friday these tourists only account for a small percentage of all the city's tourists.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Speaking on a radio programme, she also hoped that the expansion of multiple-entry visas would not just be limited to Guangdong province.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The visa for Shenzhen residents, they can come to the city at any time and this would definitely increase manflow and consumption in the city. We also see the possibility for weekly visas. We hope it would not only be granted to Guangdong province, but also to cities that are further away, which require tourists to fly to Hong Kong, so they will have to stay here for two to three nights. This would help the industry to boost the economy," Hsu said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   She said Hong Kong has a lot of tourist spots and facilities to offer, but industry workers would have to do more to attract high-end tourists.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "For example, equestrian tourism has been around for years. The Jockey Club could consider improving the experience brought to tourists, such as adding photo-taking spots so tourists can take a picture with the horses if they won, or allow them to enter the paddock, or to see the horses at a closer distance," Hsu said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Separately, Hsu said the reduction in the liquor tax, which was announced in the Policy Address, would not necessarily translate into increased visitor numbers.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "When tourists come to the city, they drink wine with their meals or during evening activities. Liquor prices might be more competitive now and it may attract tourists to have a drink because the prices are more attractive, but I don't think more tourists will come here just because there's a tax reduction," she said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Hsu added that with the stabilisation of the tourism industry in recent years, those who left the sector previously would return gradually, and the industry was also seeking new talent to join by strengthening communication with hospitality schools.

   Chief Executive John Lee on Friday said innovation and technology is the way forward for Hong Kong to remain competitive and prosperous.
   <br/>
   <br/>

   </a>
   on his latest Policy Address, Lee said the good research being carried out needs to be turned into marketable products that can help society.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He said the territory has attracted a lot of I&T talent to grow the field.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We have created platforms for people to gather together and so far, we've got two platforms, which we call InnoHK. [They] have gathered altogether 2,500 very top leading researchers from different parts of the world. They gather both physically in Hong Kong and also online," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "That is some of the things that we do. We want to set up more laboratories so that there will be more possible projects to be transformable and then we want more money to be put into research."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lee added that the government cannot be the only source of investment in the field.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We're still only investing about 1.07 percent of the whole GDP of Hong Kong, but for many successful countries, you have to at least have 5 percent to talk about a level that will ensure that we can really go ahead. So we are working very hard," he said.

    'Enhanced capital scheme to attract more talent to HK'

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Friday said he was confident that improvements to the New Capital Investment Entrant Scheme would attract more talent to Hong Kong.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In his policy blueprint, the chief executive announced that successful applicants to the cash-for-residency scheme are now permitted to invest in residential property worth at least HK$50 million, with up to HK$10 million counting towards the total capital investment.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Previously, residential property investments were not allowed under the scheme.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Speaking on an RTHK programme, Chan said this change aims to lure high-net-worth individuals while still protecting the local housing market.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Our policy goal is not to prop up the property market for units worth more than HK$50 million. That's not my objective. My aim is this: when people come to Hong Kong and want to invest in property, they can. However, we don't want this to disrupt our local residential market," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The finance minister also said he hopes the government's move to ease mortgage lending restrictions would foster a more stable and positive market outlook for the property market.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Policy Address outlined that the maximum loan-to-value ratio for homes would be adjusted to 70 percent regardless of their value, while the maximum debt servicing ratio would be raised to 50 percent.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The property market is becoming more stable. Recent transaction volumes have been lower than before, which we see as a positive sign of orderly adjustment," Chan said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We hope that after the property market returns to normal in this way, everyone will have more positive expectations for its future development."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Chan stressed that property prices and transaction volumes were influenced by many factors, including economic conditions, the stock market, and the external environment.

    Abundant land supply helps keep prices in check: CE

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Chief Executive John Lee on Friday said Hong Kong has enough land alloted for housing that should prevent any acute shortages over the next few decades, and also help keep prices in check.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He was responding to a caller on an RTHK
   <a href="https://www.rthk.hk/radio/radio3/programme/ce_phonein " style="font-size: inherit; color: #1a0dab" target="_blank">
    phone-in programme
   </a>
   asking whether the government’s reserve prices for land sales effectively keeps prices largely unaffordable.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lee stressed that land is a precious asset that belongs to the people and should be valued accordingly.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He also noted that he had in his Policy Address this week introduced measures to help prospective homebuyers by increasing how much they can borrow from banks for mortgages.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   While noting that there is “still more” the government needs to do, he stressed that the government has accelerated its pace in securing land for housing, and the 7,000 hectares of land now available for residential use over the next three decades means there shouldn’t be any shortage.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “If there's more land supply, then the price of land will be suitably set according to [the actual] market situation. The big shortage that appeared previously should not happen that abruptly now,” Lee said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Chief Executive also said developers will have to keep prices tethered to reality as everyone knows there’s adequate supply.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “Everybody knows how much land and when it will be available, and the price set by the developers will have to be in accordance with the actual situation and then all the calculations can be done by even the normal citizen,” he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lee also played down the possibility that new proposed restrictions on subdivided flats could create a shortage and drive prices up, as the government is set to propose new legislation requiring all flats to be at least 86 square feet in size, have windows and an individual toilet.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He said there are clear financial incentives for people to supply small, affordable units for rent, as research shows they would earn several times more from renting out subdivided units compared to one single apartment.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “There is a strong business case for the market to develop,” he said. “Once the rules are clear, then I think it’s only natural for those who have been benefiting or who see this as a beneficial business will then develop it.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He said there should be ample time for this new supply to emerge, since the entire process of legislation and registration, along with a grace period, means the new rules would only fully be in place in “a few years.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “I think the market will ensure that the right rent is set,” Lee said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The CE also repeated his call for various business sectors here to reform and evolve to  adapt to the changing conditions.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “The economy isn't doing badly because we are still strongly in the belief that the overall economy will grow between 2.5 to 3.5 percent,” he said. “That means the macro economy is positive, but micro-economy, particularly for some sectors, they may have to think of new ways of doing things as to make themselves attractive.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   While the Chief Executive spent most of the hour-long phone-in programme explaining his new policies, he got some new ideas from callers as well, including from Jeffrey – who asked John Lee if he could do anything to pave the way for motorcyclists to ride their bikes directly across the border.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The questioned appeared to stir up the CE’s passion as a car enthusiast.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “Obviously, I enjoy driving as well,” Lee responded. “So I do look forward to the time when I do retire, then I will personally drive to different parts of the world, in particularly the GBA and other mainland cities.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “So I do understand why you want to have your own bike and drive up to the mainland – it's easy and also China being a big country you really have a lot to see, really a lot to enjoy. I can't make my promise but definitely you have made a new point which I find attractive”, he said.

   Chief Executive John Lee said it is important to promote Hong Kong's brand as a good education hub around the world to encourage more people to study in the SAR.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Speaking on an RTHK

   </a>
   on Friday, he said the territory was working on becoming a global education hub, with five of its universities in the top 100.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He said it was important to maintain a strong educational standard among all institutions.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I will introduce the law to ensure that the standard is set, to ensure the Hong Kong education standard is a standard that has been as good as always has been, so to attract more people to join the education sector and allow more students to come to satisfy their individual needs," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The whole game plan is to ensure that we grow in different areas, be attractive to students around the world, to satisfy different aspirations of students in different parts of the world, particularly Belt and Road countries."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Meanwhile, Lee said that additional support centres for ethnic minorities groups have been set up in different districts, to provide interpretation and translation services to reduce language barrier concerns for those looking for a job in the SAR.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He added that reform has been made to the Employees Retraining Board to ensure that people are equipped with the right skills and training for employment.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Instead of just training people for jobs, then we have now think that it's more appropriate to design courses to train people with skills. When we talk about skills, we need to know what kind of skills are required for employees to get good jobs in Hong Kong," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Rather than trying to learn to chase for jobs, we increase the potential and abilities for every employee, so that they have skills and they can pick the jobs."

    'People who lose subdivided flats will be rehoused'

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The government on Thursday said it is confident that its plan to get rid of poor quality subdivided flats will not leave residents homeless and there'll be plenty of public housing available for them.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In his Policy Address on Wednesday, Chief Executive John Lee said a registration system will be introduced, and subdivided units will have to be at least eight square metres in size, with a window and separate toilet.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   At a media briefing on Thursday, officials added that other requirements will include that rooms have a height of at least 2.3 metres, that the window opens into an area that isn't enclosed on all sides, and that the toilet has a ventilation system.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The units must also comply with fire safety regulations.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   About 30 percent of the city's 110,000 subdivided units are expected to fall foul of the new rules.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A 12-18 month registration period is expected to begin in the fourth quarter of next year, with owners given a grace period of up to two years following registration to comply with the new rules.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Deputy Financial Secretary Michael Wong, who leads the Task Force on Tackling the Issue of Subdivided Units, said there's an abundant supply of public housing for residents of flats that don't make the grade.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “We've looked at the current composition of the residents of subdivided units. About 60 percent will be eligible for public housing. So the key is to provide an adequate quantity of public housing units, and that's something, I will say, where we are succeeding,” he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “For the coming five years, even if we do not count the number of light public housing, we're able to provide more than 30,000 public housing units every year.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He said tenants affected could also move into transitional housing or subdivided flats that do meet the minimum standards.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Meanwhile, Permanent Secretary for Housing Rosanna Law said rewards of about HK$3,000 will be offered to people who provide tip-offs about public housing tenancy abuse.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The move will be part of the "Cherish Public Housing Resources Award Scheme" to be launched by the Housing Authority in January.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Law said people will only get a reward once a recovery notice for a flat is issued, saying the authorities are setting conditions to deter indiscriminate reporting.

    'Guangdong care homes more suited for physically fit'

  <img alt="The three-year pilot programme would allow up to 1,000 elderly people who are currently receiving CSSA to receive monthly subsidies of HK$5,000 to live in designated homes in Guangdong. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=35&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1775010_1_20241017181134.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   A professor in geriatric medicine said the new pilot scheme to subsidise elderly welfare recipients to live in special homes in Guangdong would be attractive to those who are relatively healthy and fit, but she said the option is not ideal for those who cannot care for themselves.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Jean Woo, from the Chinese University's Faculty of Medicine, made the comment after Chief Executive John Lee said in his new Policy Address on Wednesday that the three-year pilot programme would allow up to 1,000 elderly people, who are currently receiving Comprehensive Social Security Assistance (CSSA), to receive monthly subsidies of HK$5,000 to live in designated residential care homes in Guangdong.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   She told RTHK that it may be very difficult for the elderly with serious illnesses or disabilities to cope with a new environment.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "What happens as you get older and older, nobody really knows, because we don't know what the healthcare support is like. If you have various chronic diseases, how easy is it to access primary care, follow-up, and so on," she said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Healthcare vouchers could be used on the mainland and certainly in some of the hospitals there, so I think that's a great help. So when you start to decline with your brain not working too well and physically you're not moving so well, what would be the situation? What about your social network, your family? There are a lot of unknowns," she added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I suspect the plan is not to move this group, but to have an option for people who are now living in the community, but wanted to be in an environment where they don't want to cook or do housework, or they want some social activities."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Meanwhile, she said the quality and services in local residential care homes (RCHs) would go up, after the chief executive said there would be additional manpower support through the Special Scheme to Import Care Workers for RCHs.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I think we need to do something further upstream to slow down the decline into dependency by having initiatives in the community. But as I said, it's better than nothing," she said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It's a good direction to go because we are very short of people, the training and so on. But I think the salary needs to perhaps go up a bit more to attract people."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In terms of the government's plan to step up support for caregivers by extending their current service of sending community care teams to households in need to other parts of the city, Woo said care teams are great for the elderly because they are equipped with the right training.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "From a geriatrician's point of view, we're used to screening multiple domains and we've been doing this using an automatic format and we have created an app so that we can train people in terms of what to look out [for], and watch out for things," she said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "There's a lot we can do before we even get to the doctors and the nurses, and the medications."

    LME looking into listing HK as a delivery point: govt

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury Christopher Hui on Thursday said the London Metal Exchange (LME) is looking into listing Hong Kong as a delivery point.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Hui told reporters that the LME had earlier expressed a desire to set up a warehouse in the city, and it is exploring practical ways to do so.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Now the process is on their side, in terms of assessing the legal environment here, in terms of whether and how it can meet the criteria to be admitted as a delivery point by LME. I think that's the first step they need to take, before other warehouse companies can choose to locate their warehouses here," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We have been in discussion with them, at the same time through our InvestHK, to facilitate any information and any assistance that they need from the government."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Asked if a site has been chosen, Financial Secretary Paul Chan said existing warehouses could be used if suitable, and it is not essential to build new facilities.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   LME, owned by Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing, is a centre for the trading of industrial metals, with the majority of non-ferrous metal futures business transacted on its platforms.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In his Policy Address on Wednesday, Chief Executive John Lee said the government will capitalise on opportunities to establish supporting facilities for the storage and delivery of commodities.

    FS hopes for public confidence in property market

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Thursday said the government had taken into consideration factors like property prices, the supply of housing and the city's economy, before it reduced the down payment needed to buy a flat.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   As announced in the chief executive's Policy Address yesterday, the maximum loan-to-value ratio for residential properties would be adjusted to 70 percent, regardless of their value, whether the properties were for self-use or not, or were being purchased by first-time buyers.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Chan said property prices had come down and there would be sufficient housing supply, with over 108,000 first-hand units available in the next three to four years.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We should let the market forces play. We should not unduly impose measures to suppress the demand, or try to prioritise different demands. Also, taking into consideration, at the moment, our banking sector is very healthy, very well-capitalised. The [number of] negative equity cases compared to 1998, for example, is much lower," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We do feel confident to remove those restrictions so that we would be able to project a more positive expectation... about the healthy and stable development of the Hong Kong property market in the coming future."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Chan added that government revenue from land sales and stamp duties was lower than expectations, but it was too early to revise estimates on the fiscal deficit for the financial year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He expects Hong Kong to record further growth for the remainder of the year, with the start of the US Federal Reserve interest rate easing cycle giving the economy an added boost.

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Six police officers have been jailed for 25 to 41 months each for perverting the course of justice relating to an operation involving homeless people in 2020.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The officers – Leung Fei-pang, Pong Chun-sze, Lam Wah-ka, Mok Chi-shing, Wan Pak-sze and Chan Sau-yip – were convicted last month of falsely accusing a man of possessing drugs, and blocking CCTV cameras during the operation in Sham Shui Po.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   At Thursday's sentencing, District Court judge Kathie Cheung said perverting the course of justice is a serious offence, and the officers had abused their powers and undermined public confidence in the force.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lam, a sergeant and the most senior officer at the scene, was imprisoned for 41 months; Mok, Wan and Chan each received 37-month sentences; and Leung and Pong were each given 25-month jail terms.

    CE says he hopes for good news soon on mainland visas

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Chief Executive John Lee said on Thursday that he hopes the SAR government's ideas to get more mainlanders to visit Hong Kong will "materialise soon".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In his Policy Address on Wednesday, Lee said the central government is pro-actively studying suggestions including the resumption of multiple-entry visas for Shenzhen residents and expanding the number of cities that grant visas for weekly visits to the SAR.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   At a Legco question and answer session on the address, retail sector lawmaker Peter Shiu brought up the issue of visas, saying restaurants and shops are facing major challenges amid a sluggish economy.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lee said he hopes announcements can be made soon.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "In our discussions with the central authorities, we adopt a pragmatic attitude, so we only put forward measures that work. Of course, we are not at liberty to reveal the measures that we are exploring," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Meanwhile, Third Side lawmaker Tik Chi-yuen expressed concern that the wealth gap in Hong Kong is widening.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He said economic development might be hindered because "a good number of residents" don't actively participate in society and lack a sense of belonging.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In response, Lee said it's normal for there to be various views in society and there is no need to exaggerate the differences.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He stressed that he wants to build an inclusive and caring society, and said the government always keeps an open mind and is willing to listen to different views.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "There are always pointed questions or critical questions raised at press conferences and we will always try to answer those questions," Lee said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "If you come up with suggestions on ways to improve, some are well-intentioned and some are really poignant criticisms. And many of these actually become a part of the new measures in the Policy Address."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The CE also noted that Canada's Fraser Institute has ranked the SAR as the world's freest economy in its latest report, saying this means people can engage in any economic activity in Hong Kong and be afforded the greatest level of freedom under local laws.

    Quit dwelling on HK's past success, CE tells firms

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   It would be unrealistic to try to stop people from spending their free time across the border and abroad, Chief Executive John Lee said on Thursday, amid complaints from local retailers and restaurants over flagging business as more Hongkongers choose to spend their money elsewhere.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lee advised the retail industry to acknowledge the structural change in consumption patterns, and address the problem by seeking reform.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   On a joint radio phone-in programme, one day after delivering his third Policy Address, Lee said the SAR is undergoing a period of transition.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It’s time to stop dwelling on the past success, he told businesses.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Overall speaking, the retail industry isn’t doing really well. Even as we boost inbound tourism, we must first acknowledge the structural change of their consumption pattern," Lee said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Everyone needs to keep improving – not just the one in front of you or next to you. Start with yourself. Of course the government will try to help, but there will be ups and downs," he said, adding that he aims to compress this "transition period" as much as possible.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Many Hong Kong retailers and restaurants also say they are struggling to compete for customers against rivals in Shenzhen, Zhuhai and other parts of the Greater Bay Area.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Nearly one and half million Hong Kong residents left the city via various land border checkpoints over the Chung Yeung Festival long weekend, dealing a fresh blow to local businesses.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But Lee said this is only normal market behaviour, and the government will do its best to help local businesses, including looking at ways to tackle high rent and costs.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He said that being as Hong Kong’s economy is undergoing a period of change, one of the government’s roles is to look for new growth areas.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Authorities will now look into building a commodity trading ecosystem, leveraging on Hong Kong’s safe and free environment, he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A “global trader” has signalled its intention to establish a metal warehouse in Hong Kong, Lee said, describing this as the perfect starting point.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   On a separate note, the chief executive pledged to forge full speed ahead with a plan to regulate subdivided homes.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He has proposed a bill which will set a minimum size and other conditions for the units, and landlords which don't register their properties will be prosecuted.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   With an estimated 110,000 such units, Lee said one headache would be deciding how long the registration period should last.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I'm an impatient man...I said, how about 12 to 18 months? But with 110,000 units to deal with, and divided by 12 months, we have to register about 9,000 each month. Is this pragmatic? I would need to discuss this with my colleagues," he said.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   An analyst at a local think-tank has welcomed this year's Policy Address as one focused on improving the quality of people's lives, saying the increased chances for young people to attain an apartment under the Home Ownership Scheme would motivate them to climb up the housing ladder.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Jason Leung, the Head of Land and Housing at the Our Hong Kong Foundation, made the comment on RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme on Thursday after Chief Executive John Lee said the Housing Authority would allocate an extra ballot number to young families and single-person applicants aged below 40.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "In the past, if we are talking about Home Ownership Scheme flats, the numbers offered for sale each year is very low. It's about 3,000 to 4,000 a year perhaps. Now it's getting more and more and moving to about 8,000 to 9,000 per year. So it's slightly easier to get a flat in the balloting right now and especially with the new mechanism that people who previously were unsuccessful in the balloting could get you know more ballots," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Youths could get a more preferential treatment as well. So the Home Ownership Scheme flats, these are more accessible to these people right now, and I think that this will be a positive direction for people to attain home ownership."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Meanwhile, Leung said residents living in subdivided units that do not meet the minimum standards could potentially be moved to transitional housing given its flexible conditions, after Lee said the government would propose a new set of standards which include the provision of windows, an individual toilet, and a floor area of no less than eight square metres.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "If you look at the distribution of transitional housing, actually there are quite a number of them that are in the urban areas as well, and as the government constructs more light public housing and public rental housing in the coming few years, existing tenants in the transitional housing could move on to these government-run housing programmes," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The space in these transitional housing in the urban areas can then be released and hopefully used to house these people that could be affected by these subdivided units."

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Mainland authorities on Wednesday further relaxed visa rules for non-Chinese Hong Kong residents, allowing for more people to apply for multiple-entry visas that allow individual visits of up to six months.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Back in July, mainland authorities announced a five-year card for non-Chinese permanent Hong Kong residents, allowing them to travel to the mainland. The card allows stays of up to 90 days and use of the speedier e-gates at immigration.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Commissioner's Office of the Foreign Ministry in Hong Kong said that with immediate effect, both permanent and non-permanent residents of Hong Kong who are non-Chinese can apply for the visas of up to five years, with each trip lasting a maximum 180 days.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "[This is] to facilitate personnel exchanges between Hong Kong and the mainland, [and] support Hong Kong’s integration into the overall development of the country," the office said in a statement.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It said that this applies to applicants going to the mainland for business, travel, visiting family members, as well as cultural and academic exchanges.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Applicants will not need to submit a receipt for return transport tickets and hotel bookings. They also will not have to get their fingerprints recorded again if they underwent the procedure during a previous visa application.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The office added that the new policy does not apply to foreign domestic workers.

    Principal moratorium will help SMEs: chamber

  <img alt="Patrick Yeung of the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce says the measures unveiled in the Policy Address will help small and medium enterprises address their financial challenges. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1774834_1_20241016173752.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce on Wednesday welcomed the measures unveiled in the Policy Address to support small and medium enterprises (SMEs).
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I think most important to note is that the proposal to revive the mortgage moratorium, to allow the SMEs to repay the interest rather than the capital for the month borrowed for the mortgage," the chamber's CEO Patrick Yeung told RTHK.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I think it's a way to help them to address the current financial challenges."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Chief Executive John Lee announced in his policy blueprint that SMEs can apply for a principal moratorium for up to 12 months to ease their cash-flow pressure, if they borrow money under government-backed loan schemes. Authorities will also offer partial principal repayment options.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   On government plans to kick-start the city's low-altitude economy by exploring the use of aerial technology, such as drones, Yeung said officials need to overcome technical challenges if they are to make use of low-altitude airspace for economic activity.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We have to look into the infrastructure, then where will be the good place to put up a space, and where to put up charging facilities, et cetera," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "So, it's a good idea, but definitely not an easy one to tackle with all those technical challenges possible facing this low-altitude economy."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The government will set up a cross-departmental task force led by the deputy financial secretary to explore the use of technologies at the airspace within an altitude of up to 1,000 metres.

    'Liquor duty cut won't have big effect on prices'
   </title>

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The wine and spirits industry on Wednesday said Hong Kong's reduction in duty on premium spirits won't have a huge effect on the sector, or the public.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The duty on liquor with an alcohol content above 30 percent and with an import price of over HK$200 has been cut from 100 percent to 10 percent for the portion above HK$200.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Hong Kong General Chamber of Wine and Spirits welcomed the move, but said the change will only be noticed when it comes to luxury products.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I think it's not easy for the industry, also for the catering sector to slash prices at this moment. I think it only benefits those expensive items, for example, [those with a] retail price of over HK$1,000," Raymond Luk, who chairs the chamber's economic policy and social affairs committee, told RTHK.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Eric Man, general manager at Wai Shing Wine and Spirits, said only around 20 percent of customers buy spirits that are priced over HK$1,000.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We originally hoped that citizens would be able to use around HK$500 to HK$800 to buy and enjoy liquor of better quality. But the policy now... consumers will still have to increase their budget to get better spirits, it is hard to tell whether they will be willing to do that," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Man said he would like to see the HK$200 threshold for the duty cut reduced by half, so more kinds of liquor would be covered.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Luk added that such a move would increase the competitiveness of Hong Kong's liquor market.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "For the current rates under the new policy, we are still the highest in East Asia. But in the long term, I think it's possible that we'll gain an increased appeal as a high-end spirit destination due to the reduction in taxes, as well as the speeding up of the development of activities related to high-end prestige spirits like trading, distribution and auctions," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Chief Executive John Lee said officials moved to slash the tax on hard liquor because they saw market opportunities similar to the ones that followed after the duty on wine was abolished in 2008.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Speaking at a press conference, Lee said officials made the decision considering that around 85 percent of hard liquor in the market is priced under HK$200.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He said the objective was to boost the trade in high-end liquor and hoped it would have a similar effect to the abolition of wine duties.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lee noted the import and re-export value of red wine last year rose by 375 percent compared to 2007, the year before the product became tax free in Hong Kong.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Over one year after wine duty has been reduced, we saw an increase of about 350 operators of wine, and an increase of about 1,000 jobs. The income for that sector increased by about 35 percent," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lee stressed the government isn't encouraging people to drink, saying it has struck a balance between public health and the need to develop the hard liquor market.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Licensed Bar and Club Association, meanwhile, said that though bar operators support the tax cut, it might not bring immediate benefits.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The association's founding president, Ben Leung, said he thinks the measures can boost Hong Kong's competitiveness in the global liquor market in the long run, because more brands and different types of spirits would enter the local market.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "But bars cannot benefit immediately because above them [in the chain], there are importers and agents, they themselves might need some time to digest [the news] and make adjustments. They might not have room to lower prices immediately," he said in a statement.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Leung also called on the Chief Executive to review how to better promote the local night economy, saying that would "expand the room for survival" for small to medium enterprises.

  <img alt="A concern group says the government needs to think of ways to settle affected residents. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=90&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1774796_1_20241016154136.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Reactions to the government’s plan to eradicate poor quality subdivided units (SDUs) were largely supportive, although there were also calls for the administration to ensure adequate follow-up actions to support affected tenants during the transition.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The proposed new laws require each unit to be at least eight square metres, or 86 square feet in size and have its own toilet and windows.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A concern group said it estimates that 20 percent of the city's 110,000 subdivided units would be affected under the scheme.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Kenny Ng from the Concerning Grassroot Housing Rights Alliance called on the government to come up with ways to make sure affected tenants had a place to live.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “The government didn't mention how to relocate those residents who are living in subdivided flats who will be affected under this scheme."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Will they be arranged to some other housing for their relocation, or will they just let them rent other private housing themselves? If so, I think those deprived groups will rent some other subdivided flats which will be illegal,” he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Ng said the government could consider using unused public housing or transitional housing units to settle affected residents.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Meanwhile, an NGO that connects deprived groups with landlords said the government should establish a clear timeline for when the law will be in place.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lai Kin-kwok from the ComHome Social Housing Platform also called for more detailed criteria regarding the minimum living standards for subdivided units.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “We can't find the timeline, especially when the law will be established and then how long the grace period is."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “I think from the information now, we don't know whether the windows can be opened or not... And regarding the eight square metres, I think that's the minimum standard, but it depends on how many residents are inside the eight square metres,” Lai said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He anticipated that landlords of subdivided flats not affected by the proposed laws would consider increasing rents, saying he was disappointed the Policy Address did not address the need for a rent cap.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sources said a two-month consultation will take place in December, with the aim of submitting related legislative proposals to Legco next year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Speaking in a media briefing after the Policy Address, Chief Executive John Lee said it would take a few years to root out the problem.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "First of all, we'll have to pass the legislation, which I think the earliest will probably be next year. Then, we will introduce the registration period. My suggestion is either 12 months or 18 months," Lee said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Then we'll introduce the tolerance period for adjustments, structurally, to be made. That may be one year, two years, again subject to discussion by Legco."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   According to the sources, penalties for landlords who fail to make improvements after the grace period would include possible imprisonment and fines.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But for a subdivided tenant surnamed Au, the law enforcement actions might not pose a deterrent effect to her landlord.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   She pays a monthly rent of HK$2,500 for 20-square-foot room with no individual toilet and kitchen, a space that falls in the sub-standard SDU category.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “In this flat, if they combine two rooms and provide more than 90 [square] feet, I’m fine. They have a window, I’m fine. I don’t mind if there is no air conditioning. But I think my landlord will not change, he'll just pay the penalty without doing anything if the government penalises him,” Au said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “The environment I have now, if I have to be honest, what difference is there from sleeping on the streets? It’s bad that there is no air con on the streets and dust and dirt is emitted from cars, but at least you feel more comfortable and have more space,” she added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Au said she had doubts about whether the government could carry out its plan successfully and would stay in her unit until she gets allocated public housing.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “I have no idea what is going to happen tomorrow. Like if tomorrow I buy a lottery ticket, I don’t know if I will win,” she said.

    Property sector welcomes mortgage rules relaxation

  <img alt="The property sector is happy about the relaxation of mortgage restrictions, saying it will boost the property market and overall economy. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1774800_1_20241016155146.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The property sector on Wednesday welcomed the government's move to ease mortgage restrictions, saying it will significantly boost the property market and the overall economy.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In his third Policy Address, Chief Executive John Lee announced that the maximum loan-to-value (LTV) ratio for homes will be adjusted to 70 percent regardless of their value, while the maximum debt servicing ratio (DSR) will be raised to 50 percent.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Hannah Jeong, from real estate services firm CBRE, said she thinks the relaxation will boost transaction volumes, especially in the luxury market.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "This will give a better liquidity for the homebuyers, the people who are looking for the upgrading demand, or they want to enter the market [for the] first time given the good discount offering from the developers. And their down payment amount has been reduced by utilising this LTV ratio increase," she said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "So this improvement will affect, in a possible way, the luxury residential [market] more, because previously it was only 60 percent."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Joseph Tsang, chairman of real estate services company JLL, said the LTV move will boost transaction volumes for new residential projects, but it won't be strong enough to reverse the downward trend in housing prices.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The future trend of Hong Kong housing prices will largely depend on the effectiveness of economic stimulus measures introduced by the mainland government," he wrote in a statement.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Real estate and construction sector lawmaker Louis Loong also welcomed the changes, adding that he is happy to see the maximum LTV ratio and DSR limit back to pre-2009 levels.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "This sends a very positive message to the entire property market. We have always told the government that a weak property market is not beneficial for Hong Kong's overall economy," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I believe this will have a very positive effect on Hong Kong's entire property market and even on the economy as a whole."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Still, the founder and chief executive of Centaline Property Group, Shih Wing-ching, said some remained concerned about potential declines in property values despite the relaxation in mortgage rules.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "What now worries people is no longer the difficulty to get a mortgage loan. People worry about the risk of further declines in property value. So quite a lot of people now choose to rent rather to purchase. If they choose to rent, the relaxation of this ratio could not do them any good," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "This policy of course can help a little bit, but the property market is more complex. You need to also look at interest rates, supply and demand. The problem now is that people have not really established their faith in the future, so they are not willing to commit too much at this moment."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Shih added the move alone is not enough to boost developers' appetite for land because it also depends on improvements in transaction volumes and inventory levels in the primary market.

    Govt to subsidise care-home spots in Guangdong

  <div class="itemFullText">
   The government is launching a new pilot scheme to subsidise elderly welfare recipients to live in care homes in Guangdong, while it will also expand an existing subsidy programme to include more facilities in the province.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Chief Executive John Lee said in his new Policy Address that a three-year pilot programme will allow up to 1,000 elderly people who are currently receiving Comprehensive Social Security Assistance (CSSA) to receive monthly subsidies of HK$5,000 to live in designated residential care homes in Guangdong.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The existing Residential Care Services Scheme in Guangdong, meanwhile, will be expanded, with seven more residential homes joining the programme in November 2024.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The government is also providing more help to needy elderly people who want to remain in Hong Kong.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lee said there will be a 20-percent increase in the number of vouchers given out to elderly people in need of care, but are still waiting for a subsidised spot in a home.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Six-thousand vouchers will be given out to allow beneficiaries to be admitted to homes of their choice without the need to wait further.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Chief Executive also announced other poverty-alleviation measures in his Policy Address, including more than doubling the number of schools offering after-school care services for primary students to allow their parents to work; and expanding its existing “Strive and Rise” programme, where underprivileged children are matched up with mentors.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The School-based After-School Care Service Scheme will increase from 50 to over 110 schools, Lee said, and more schools will be encouraged to join, such that there’s no planned cap to the number of students who can benefit from the programme.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   An additional 100 day child care services will be provided at new child care centre, and service places under the Neighbourhood Support Child Care Project will be increased by 25 percent, to 2,500.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Chief Executive John Lee said on Wednesday that the government will step up its support for young people hoping to buy subsidised flats.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He announced in his Policy Address that the Housing Authority would allocate an extra ballot number to young families and single-person applicants aged below 40, to increase their chances of getting an apartment under the Home Ownership Scheme.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lee added that starting from the next White Form Secondary Market Scheme (WSM) exercise, the quota for those flats will increase by 1,500 -- all of which will be allocated to young family applicants and one-person applicants under the age of 40.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   And in a bid to encourage more public housing tenants to buy Home Ownership Scheme units, the government said it will revise the allocation between green form, or current public housing residents, and white form applicants from its current ratio of 4:6 to 5:5.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Meanwhile, as part of efforts to crack down on tenancy abuse, the Housing Authority will launch the "Cherish Public Housing Resources Award Scheme" in January next year, offering rewards to anyone providing intelligence that helps to identify such cases.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The CE also said the government hopes to cut the average waiting time for public rental housing from the current 5.5 years to 4.5 years in 2026-27.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   The principal moratorium scheme for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) will be relaunched as part of efforts to help businesses as Hong Kong undergoes economic restructuring.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Chief Executive John Lee said in his Policy Address on Wednesday that firms will be allowed to apply for principal moratorium for up to 12 months under the SME Financing Guarantee Scheme.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The maximum loan guarantee periods of the 80 percent and 90 percent guarantee products will be extended to 10 years and eight years respectively, while the partial principal repayment options will be offered to new loans under the two guarantee products.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Among the other measures to support SMEs include a HK$1 billion injection into the Dedicated Fund on Branding, Upgrading and Domestic Sales to help them upgrade their operations and develop new markets, as well as fresh efforts to further promote Hong Kong brands.

    Loan-to-value ratio for mortgages to be relaxed: CE

  <img alt="The loan-to-value ratio will be relaxed to 70 percent. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1774730_1_20241016122657.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   In a bid to encourage more people to purchase a home and to stimulate the city's property market, Chief Executive John Lee on Wednesday said the government would relax the maximum loan-to-value (LTV) ratios of mortgage loans.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   This would allow people to borrow more against the value of a property they want to buy.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Outlining the proposal in his Policy Address, Lee said the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) would adjust the maximum LTV ratio for homes to 70 percent, regardless of their value, whether the properties were for self-use or not, or were being purchased by first-time buyers.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The maximum debt servicing ratio (DSR) would be adjusted to 50 percent.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   For non-residential properties, the maximum LTV ratio and the maximum DSR would be adjusted to the same levels.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The HKMA said the adjustments apply to provisional sale and purchase agreements signed from Wednesday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Taking into account the latest market developments, the HKMA has decided to adjust the countercyclical macroprudential measures for property mortgage loans and revert the maximum LTV ratio and DSR limit to the pre-2009 levels before the countercyclical macroprudential measures were first introduced," HKMA chief executive Eddie Yue said in a statement.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Even with these adjustments announced today, the Hong Kong banking sector has ample buffers to cope with any challenges from a sharp correction in property prices.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I would like to remind the public that buying a property is a long-term financial commitment. Prospective buyers should carefully assess the risks involved and their ability to afford a property."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lee also announced that the government will relax a policy granting residency to people who invest a minimum of HK$30 million in different forms of assets.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Starting from Wednesday, purchases of property worth HK$50 million or more will be counted as fulfilling a third of the requirement for the New Capital Investment Entrant Scheme. The amount of real estate investment to be counted towards the total capital investment is capped at $10 million.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Speaking on a TV forum, Lee brushed off concerns that the relaxation could lead to an overheating of property prices.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Because their investment will not affect the willingness of our citizens to buy houses. We only allow them [investors] to buy properties valued over HK$50 million," he explained.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Right now, the property market is starting to stabilise. We are not worried that will result in any negative impact. I think that will attract more investment while benefiting the growth of our real estate market."

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Chief Executive John Lee on Wednesday said the government is working on a series of measures to enhance Hong Kong's status as a cultural, sports and tourism magnet.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In his Policy Address, Lee said the Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau (CSTB) will release a blueprint later this year on promoting Chinese culture, the development of arts and culture with an international perspective, fostering arts and cultural exchanges between China and the rest of the world, and driving industry development.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Meanwhile, the Cultural and Creative Industries Development Agency is incubating cultural and creative projects with a potential for industrialisation and strengthening cross-sectoral collaboration and leveraging market resources to help the sector explore business opportunities, the CE said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Turning to the West Kowloon Cultural District, Lee said the authority running the arts hub will take a leading role in building Hong Kong's strengths in arts trading and the restoration and exhibition of high-end private art collections.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He said the authority will promote the district as a prime destination for major international cultural events, while also curating arts programmes and exhibitions to be staged on the mainland and overseas.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lee said the government will continue to foster sports development by enhancing the development of athletes and coaches, and promoting sports in the community by providing more facilities, including a swimming complex suitable for international competitions and a sports arena with fencing facilities.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He said the government will develop a "host city economy" in the sports industry, so local athletes can compete in international events on home soil.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The CE noted that Kai Tak Sports Park will open in the first quarter of next year and said the site will "boost sports development and inject impetus into related industries such as recreation, entertainment and tourism and also mega-event economy".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   On tourism, Lee said the government will develop Hong Kong into a premier destination through innovative thinking and by making better use of rich and unique resources such as Victoria Harbour, the outlying islands, rural areas, cultures, cuisine, lifestyles and historic buildings.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "These elements, combined with our edges in technology, animation and comics, the performing arts, film and television culture and more will help to instil the concept of 'tourism is everywhere'", he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The CSTB will publish a blueprint for the tourism industry later this year, which among other things will cover developing eco-tourism such as "island-hopping tours", and attracting tourists from the Middle East and Asean members with measures such as information in Arabic at the airport, a list of halal restaurants, and encouraging hotels to provide worship facilities.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Other plans include the promotion of "yacht tourism", "panda tourism", "horse-racing tourism" and a gourmet guide covering all 18 districts.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A working group led by the chief secretary is also going to be set up to identify and develop tourist hotspots.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lee also said Beijing is studying SAR government proposals to enhance visas for visitors from the mainland, including the resumption of a multiple-entry arrangement for Shenzhen residents, while the criteria for multiple-entry visas will be relaxed for people from Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar.

    Govt to improve standards of subdivided units

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The chief executive said in his Policy Address on Wednesday the government would introduce legislation for a system to govern the renting of subdivided flats, with the goal of helping people improve their conditions by insisting on standards that ensure the health and safety of those that live in these types of units.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sub-divided units (SDUs) which meet the required living standards would be named as Basic Housing Units.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   John Lee said the government would propose the standards of Basic Housing Units should include the provision of windows, an individual toilet, and a floor area of no less than eight square metres.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lee said current SDUs differ significantly in standards and it was necessary to set a minimum standard to eradicate subdivided flats which are not fit to live in.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Under appropriate regulation, the market demand for SDUs would be satisfied by introducing these revamped Basic Housing Units which meet the required standards.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   SDUs that are of poor quality must be converted into Basic Housing Units that meet the required standards. Upon conversion, certified professionals must give their approval to ensure the conversion meets the minimum standards.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Owners who continue to rent out substandard SDUs under the new system would be held criminally liable, while tenants would not be held liable.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lee said the government would allow time for owners of existing SDUs to carry out the necessary renovation works to meet the new standards. A grace period would be implemented during which enforcement action would not be taken against the illegal renting of subdivided flats.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Secretary for Housing would be empowered by law to decide, upon expiry of the grace period, when to take enforcement action against sub-standard SDUs.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The deputy financial secretary and secretary for housing would announce further details and seek the views of Legco and other stakeholders for drawing up the legislative proposals and related measures.

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Chief Executive John Lee outlined plans to develop Hong Kong into an international tertiary education hub in his Policy Address with various measures such as creating the "Study in Hong Kong" brand and encouraging more local students to pursue advanced studies.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The government will encourage local post-secondary institutions to enhance collaboration with their counterparts around the world in promoting the "Study in Hong Kong" brand on a global scale, with an aim to attract more overseas students to study here.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lee added Hong Kong will strive to host international education conferences and exhibitions.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The CE also announced the setting up of the Hong Kong Future Talents Scholarship Scheme for Advanced Studies from the 2025/26 academic year, offering scholarships each year to up to 1,200 local students enrolling in designated postgraduate programmes.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   With a projected shortage of 180,000 workers across different sectors in Hong Kong in the next five years, Lee said the government will reform its talent admission schemes to try to attract more staff from overseas.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It'll add 13 top mainland and overseas universities to the list of institutions under the Top Talent Pass Scheme, raising the total to 198, and the validity period of the first visa of high-income talent will be extended from two to three years.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Among the other measures is the introduction of a new mechanism under the Quality Migrant Admission Scheme, inviting top talent to come here for development.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The government will set up a new committee – the Committee on Education, Technology and Talents – to coordinate the integrated development of those fields. It'll be led by the chief secretary.

   Duty on spirits has been reduced to help promote the liquor trade, Chief Executive John Lee announced in his Policy Address on Wednesday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The government has made reference to the successful experience of driving the wine trade through exemption of wine duty and will, starting today, reduce the duty rate for liquor with an import price of over HK$200 from 100 percent to 10 percent for the portion above HK$200," Lee said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The move applies to liquor with an alcoholic strength of more than 30 percent, and the duty on spirits with an import price of HK$200 or below remains unchanged.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In recent months, industry representatives had called for a reduction in the duty.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lee said the cut will boost the development of high value added industries including tourism and logistics and storage, as well as high-end food and beverage consumption.

    Govt sets sights on developing low-altitude economy

  <div class="itemFullText">
   The government is looking to kick-start Hong Kong’s low-altitude economy by launching a new working group that will explore how the city can benefit from the use of drones and other aerial technology to provide services from transporting goods and people, to assisting in rescue work and providing high-resolution surveys.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In his latest Policy Address, Chief Executive John Lee said “formulating a management system for low-altitude economy will help drive development in areas such as telecommunication technologies, AI and the digital industry, unlocking the low-altitude airspace as a new production factor for our economy."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The group will be led by the deputy financial secretary and focus on kick-starting projects with good prospects, as well as develop broader strategies and action plans, and work out regulatory issues and infrastructure needs.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It will be tasked with launching pilot projects to explore the best applications – including drones for delivery, surveys, building maintenance, aerial photography, performances as well as for search and rescue.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Many mainland cities have been working to develop low-altitude economies – encompassing services like delivery drones or flying taxis and other aerial vehicles within airspace below 1,000 metres – and Hong Kong has been under pressure to keep up.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Another group led by the deputy chief secretary will bring various government departments together, and leverage community efforts to identify and develop “tourist hotspots of high popularity and with strong appeal in various districts”.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Two other groups will focus on promoting the “integrated development” of education, technology and talents, and accelerate the development of the “silver industry” to help meet the daily needs of the elderly.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Chief Executive John Lee started his third Policy Address on Wednesday morning with a call to embrace change, noting Beijing’s support for Hong Kong’s development.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sporting a green tie designed by the Hong Kong Polytechnic University showcasing Hong Kong’s iconic skyline, Lee opened his speech at the Legislative Council by noting the resolution adopted at the third plenum of the Communist Party in July to further deepen reform to advance Chinese modernisation.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “The Resolution calls on Hong Kong to fully harness the institutional strengths of ‘One Country, Two Systems’ while consolidating and enhancing its status aas an international hub for high-calibre talents, to exert a greater role in our country’s opening up to the world, and to deepen collaboration within the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Greater Bay Area through better harmonisation of rules and mechanisms,” he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lee said from the time he was running for the top job, he has been emphasising the need to embrace reform, and had put in place a series of measures to tackle issues such as enhancing district services, cutting waiting times for public housing, and addressing intergenerational poverty.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “I believe that we must maintain our development momentum and self-renewal, and that we must embrace changes while staying principled, innovative and flexible in meeting challenges and opportunities.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The CE had earlier said his latest policy blueprint will focus on lifting the economy and on livelihood issues. The official theme for the address is “Reform for Enhancing Development and Building Our Future Together.”

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Organisers on Tuesday confirmed that four-time Grand Slam champion Naomi Osaka will compete in the Hong Kong Open tennis championships later in October.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Osaka, who won the Australian Open in 2019 and 2021 and the US Open in 2018 and 2020, is the first Japanese player to win a Grand Slam and the first player from Asia to hold the singles' top ranking, claiming the World No. 1 spot in January 2019, which she held for 21 weeks.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   She will be joined by Russia's Diana Shnaider and Anastasia Potapova, who is ranked 37th in the world.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Twenty-year-old Shnaider is the youngest player currently ranked in the world's top 16, and has won three titles this year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   At the 2024 Olympic Games, she partnered with Mirra Andreeva to capture the silver medal in the women's doubles.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Other international stars already confirmed to compete in the event include defending champion Leylah Fernandez of Canada, two-time Grand Slam champion and former world No. 1 Simona Halep of Romania and Britain's highest-ranked player Katie Boulter.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   China's Paris Olympic mixed doubles silver medalist Wang Xinyu, and rising stars Yuan Yue and Wang Xiyu will also feature in the field competing for a total prize purse worth US$250,000. (Xinhua)

   Police said dozens of turtles were stolen from an industrial building in Tsuen Wan on Tuesday.
   <br/>

   Officers received a report at 10am that the front door of a unit had been forced open and there were signs the interior had been ransacked.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   They estimated about 50 eastern box turtles were missing.

   Police said three men, aged in their early 40s and who reportedly wore black clothing, are suspects in the case.

    Gym chain customers urged to be wary of new deal

  <div class="itemFullText">
   The Consumer Council on Tuesday urged former members of the now-defunct gym chain Physical Fitness to think carefully before signing a new agreement with perFIT, the operator who took over the business.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The gym chain is offering former Physical Fitness members free access to reopened locations in Mong Kok and Wan Chai, along with any remaining private training sessions they had paid for, provided that they sign an agreement.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But the clauses state that the free period only lasts for up to three years and there will be a monthly fee afterwards.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The consent form also requires members to grant perFIT access to their previous contracts and personal information.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The council’s chief executive, GIlly Wong, said about 10 percent of complaints regarding the closing down of Physical Fitness involved losses exceeding HK$100,000, adding that those affected should consider their personal situation and legal rights before deciding whether to sign the consent form.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “Obviously we spotted that because of the diverse range of packages, classes, terms, expiry period of membership, the situation of every individual could be quite different. But in general, for those with shorter terms and also lesser amount, it’s more easy for them to accept the new proposal.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “On the other hand, for those customers who have a bigger amount with a much longer duration and have many private classes, that may require review on every individual,” she said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Wong said the council will continue to hold talks with perFIT and work on a mutually agreeable solution for everyone involved.

    Keep an eye out for 'shrinkflation': watchdog

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The Consumer Council on Tuesday urged consumers to stay vigilant when shopping in supermarkets, noting retailers are taking advantage of downsized products to effect price hikes.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The watchdog said it surveyed 62 supermarket products, including food, daily necessities and pet food with volume or weight changes over the past 3.5 years.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It found that nearly all of them had seen weight or volume reduction ranging from about one percent to as much as 30 percent.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Almost 40 percent of products showed a de facto price increase, with the highest reaching 26.2 percent based on the average per-unit recommended retail price, the council noted.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The council’s chief executive, Gilly Wong said while it is reasonable for retailers to seek profit-making measures, they should also be fair to consumers.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Because usually for this kind of little change, consumers may not easily spot it except you follow the product for a long, long time. You are so loyal to that, then you follow," she said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Otherwise, when there's a modest change, like this time, [a drop of] only three grams of instant noodle or maybe 20 grams of body lotion, it's really hard for consumers to keep track of that."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   She noted that while some countries, like South Korea, have implemented legislation to increase transparency regarding changes in product size, such as listing the unit price, this may not be the optimal solution for Hong Kong.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The reason is Hong Kong is a very open market. We import a lot of products worldwide. We don't have our self-production that much. So, if we ask the government to legislate according to what other markets have been doing right now, we have to consider whether it is the most effective measure," she said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The council advised consumers to pay close attention to a product's volume or weight, and compare products using unit pricing, if they want to objectively assess their expenses.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   The Consumer Council on Tuesday urged people to select beauty products carefully after it found inconsistencies in some products boasting vitamin C content.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The watchdog said it tested 17 serums and 10 of them had a lower concentration of vitamin C than the manufacturer claimed.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   While one actually had more vitamin C than advertised, another one had none whatsoever.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The council’s chief executive, Gilly Wong, said they have referred their findings to the authorities.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “We have already shared this report to the Customs and Excise Department. So if there is any alleged infringement of the Trade Descriptions Ordinance, they would take an independent enforcement action on that,” she said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The watchdog urged manufacturers to improve their labelling practices, noting that five of the products tested failed to list the vitamin C concentration.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In addition, the label for one serum didn't mention an expiry date, while six others didn't have a list of ingredients in either English or Chinese.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The council also discovered that seven of the serums contained fragrance allergens with restricted use in the EU, saying eczema sufferers or individuals with allergies could develop contact dermatitis or rashes from overexposure to the products.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Chief Executive John Lee said on Tuesday that officials need to make sure that parts of the Zoological and Botanical Gardens are properly sealed off, following the deaths of nine monkeys there.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Officials have been investigating the mysterious deaths, as they held a meeting on Monday chaired by Kevin Yeung, the culture, sports and tourism minister.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lee told reporters that officials need to focus on several things, and one of them is ensuring the affected area of the zoo doesn't expand further.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The relevant section has been closed off. Disinfection has been conducted. So we have contained the area," he said before the weekly Executive Council meeting.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The second step is to control. Apart from the cleaning and disinfection, we have to continue monitoring the situation to ensure that the problem will not spread."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lee said autopsies, tests and toxicology analyses should be completed as soon as possible so that experts can find out the reasons behind the deaths.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Workers need to wear protective gear properly, Lee added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The chief executive said Yeung is in charge of the issue, and officials will provide an update once there is a new development.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday said the number of mainland visitors during the recent Golden Week holiday showed a "good increase".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Talking to reporters ahead of the Executive Council meeting, Lee said 1.22 million visitors came to Hong Kong during the holiday period.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It was up 27 percent compared with the Golden Week last year, and it was also an increase of 13 percent compared with the Golden Week in May," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "There were... over 1,000 mainland tourist groups visiting Hong Kong. The actual figure is 1,050. Eighty percent of these tour groups actually stayed overnight."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Citing industry figures, the chief executive said restaurants saw increased turnover during the week, as they also benefited from events to celebrate the 75th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The catering business was doing quite well because the association indicated that there was about 2 billion dollars of business during Golden Week, which was a five percent increase," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "A lot of representatives of different sectors and businesses have indicated that during the Golden Week, there were larger numbers of visitors, customers, and also there was an increase in the business turnover."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lee said the National Day fireworks display attracted over 330,000 people, and about 190,000 movie-goers took advantage of half-price tickets that day, up 22 percent year-on-year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He said 60,000 people visited museums and art spaces managed by the Leisure and Cultural Services Department on October 1, when admission was free.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He added that 4.43 million people also enjoyed free or discounted journeys that day on a number of modes of transport.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Chief Executive John Lee said on Tuesday that carrying out reforms together is among the themes of this year's Policy Address, which he will deliver on Wednesday morning.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He said the cover of the blueprint's hard copy will be in green again, because this reflects the sustainability of government policies.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lee added that the colour can also mean harmony, vitality and prosperity.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I know that everybody's very keen to know about the content of the Policy Address. The theme of the Policy Address is we will reform for enhancing development and building our future together," he told reporters ahead of the weekly Executive Council meeting.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The CE added that there will be a supplement in place of a document on policies implemented in the past couple of years, which he hopes people don't overlook.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lee's predecessor, Carrie Lam, introduced supplements for her blueprint in 2019.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Meanwhile, Lee said new amendments that Beijing and local officials signed as part of the Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement (CEPA) last week didn't come easy, as he once again thanked the central government for making it happen.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He said the idea to amend the agreements, which cover various service industries, was led by the Ministry of Commerce and was backed by the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Police on Monday said they smashed a fraud syndicate which allegedly made use of deepfake technology to persuade people to invest in cryptocurrency.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Officers said they raided a premises in a Hung Hom industrial building and arrested 27 people, including core syndicate members.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Police said the total amount of losses exceeded HK$360 million.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   They said the victims were not only from Hong Kong but also the mainland, Taiwan and Singapore, among other places.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The suspects, aged between 21 and 34, were arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to defraud and possessing offensive weapon.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Senior superintendent Fang Chi-kin said the syndicate made use of deepfake technology to build relationships online.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "They got in touch with the victims on social media, and sent them photos generated by AI, shaping a character who had a very appealing appearance, personality, career and academic qualifications," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Men from different regions were among the victims... Although the victims had video calls [with the character], they falsely believed that they were dating a high-quality person."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Fang added that the syndicate hired people with high academic qualifications.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The syndicate hired graduates from local universities who majored in digital media, and used them as technology specialists. From our investigation, they also collaborated with overseas fraudsters and IT experts to build a fake cryptocurrency investment platform."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Superintendent Iu Wing-kan said the syndicate had been operating for more than a year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "They set up a performance board. The teams and members who successfully fooled the most victims were listed on the board. The one who topped the chart last month gained US$266,000," he said.

    FTU calls for govt to roll out more fast EV chargers

  <div class="itemFullText">
   The Federation of Trade Unions (FTU) on Monday called on the government to increase the number of fast chargers, to encourage motorists to switch to electric vehicles.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The federation said it surveyed over 300 electric vehicle users in July and found that about 75 percent relied on public chargers, of which there are around 5,000 in the city.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   FTU lawmaker Michael Luk said the majority of government-run chargers have a slow or medium speed and require at least a few hours to fully charge a vehicle.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It's more appropriate to set up fast chargers at government-run venues. Normally, they are for the public to use, such as when people are going to sports grounds, sports centres or town halls," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "They may only stay there for about one to two hours. If there are fast chargers, their vehicle will be fully recharged."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Luk added that the government should provide incentives for petrol stations to set up superchargers.

   The contractor linked to Sunday's fatal accident in Ho Man Tin, has been suspended from bidding for public works projects and has been required to carry out an independent safety audit.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A worker fell to his death at the construction site on Sunday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Development Bureau (DEVB) said the government attaches great importance to construction site safety.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The DEVB issued a notification to the contractor concerned today to suspend it from tendering for public works contracts in buildings category with immediate effect," a spokesperson said in a statement.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It said the contractor had to demonstrate that it had an effective safety management system before any decision to lift the suspension could be considered.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It also warned that it could extend the length of the suspension and even remove the contractor's eligibility to bid for public works contracts in future, pending the outcome of an investigation by the Labour Department.

    Govt urged to improve Strive and Rise programme

  <div class="itemFullText">
   The Alliance for Children Development Rights on Monday called for measures in the policy address to improve youth upward mobility and address intergenerational poverty.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   From August to September, the alliance polled 114 young people aged 12 to 24, with nearly 70 percent coming from families earning less than HK$20,000 a month.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Thirty percent of them were part of the Strive and Rise Programme, which pairs underprivileged pupils with volunteer mentors.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The survey found that around 70 percent of youngsters had little confidence in escaping poverty soon.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Wong Man-ling from the alliance urged the government to further improve the one-year mentorship scheme.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "So I guess the policy has its limitations because the programme only lasts for one year... We also look forward to seeing if the government will have more follow-up programmes after the Strive and Rise scheme ends," she said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "For example, when graduates join the alumni group, will there just be events? Or will there be ways to keep helping these low-income young people with government resources?"
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Jayden, an 18-year-old university student from a single-parent family, said he hopes the government will provide more support for young people to pursue their dreams.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I think the current government policies don't help us move up in society enough. They [officials] invest relatively little money for people with dreams," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The government could start a child development account to help young people save money for future businesses. They should also streamline the application process for self-financed degree programmes," he said.

    DAB launches new office to help talent settle in HK

  <img alt="The DAB says talent will also seek assistance from its office instead of only heading to relevant government departments. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=60&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1774425_1_20241014153654.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The DAB announced on Monday it would set up an office to offer more assistance to talent who have moved to Hong Kong.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Veteran DAB member Starry Lee said the office would also help the city's ambitions to attract more talented professionals from around the world.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We believe that, as a party in Hong Kong, we have a relatively wide network in our community, we can play a more active role in supporting talent. Therefore, we would like to set up a talent hub, it is a platform, not only an office," she said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lee believes getting the word out about the new office would not be difficult.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Based on my understanding, they have different WeChat groups to exchange information... I believe this information will be easily spread among their group."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Ahead of the Policy Address on Wednesday, the DAB suggested the government set up a special student visa for the children of those who have come to Hong Kong on various talent schemes.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It is among the 12 suggestions it made to make the city more attractive for global talent.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The DAB said the visas could offer a buffer for children to complete their studies even when their parents fail to get their visas renewed.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Their children are now in our Hong Kong education system. If you ask a student to leave immediately in the middle of the term, it will not be good for the talent, and it would pass a very bad message to those who want to come to Hong Kong," said Lee.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Therefore we would like to suggest at least for that term or if possible, why not for the whole year to let those students to finish their studies, and then their parents can make appropriate decisions to settle their children. Because we all know that whether or not they will stay in Hong Kong, their children's education is one of the very important concerns."

   The park said the pair's eyes have fully opened and they have started developing their hearing.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It said the female now weighs 2.7 kg and her brother weighs about 2.5 kg.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Howard Chuk, head of the park's zoological operations and conservation, said staff have been sharing the job of looking after the cubs with the pandas' mother, Ying Ying.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Although we have all the nursery facilities, including the incubator, we try to maximise the opportunities to allow Ying Ying to take care of the cubs. This benefits the behaviour, as well as the health of the cubs," Chuk said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "But... we need to ensure Ying Ying is capable, and also we are pretty sure the babies are safe after we return or rotate the cubs back to Ying Ying."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Elke Wu, an assistant curator of zoological operations, said Ying Ying is about 80 percent recovered from giving birth.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "She's a first-time mum and she's not young anymore, so her recovery is really slow and she's very picky at her appetite," she said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Our whole husbandry team spends so much time looking for food that she likes, or making food into different forms that she will be willing to take in, and we literally just feed it into her mouth sometimes."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Wu said it is still difficult to tell the twins apart but they have different characteristics, with the female having messy fur and the male having rounder dark circles around his eyes.
