<div class="itemFullText">
 Director of Immigration Benson Kwok says more officers will be deployed to verify documents submitted as part of Top Talent Pass Scheme applications, following reports of false information being provided on occasions.
 <br>
  <br>
  "We will look into each case very carefully. Since June last year, we have been carrying out verification procedures for applicants' academic qualifications," he told reporters on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If verification procedures have not been carried out before, they will be conducted when applicants renew their pass."
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Kwok also said national security risks persist in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Immigration Department will not lower its guard, and it will make coordination actively on the implementation of the national security legislation," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The department will continue to safeguard the southern gateway to our country and comprehensively block those who endanger national security from entering Hong Kong."

 A water splashing festival in Kowloon City to celebrate Songkran had to be suspended on Saturday afternoon, because of the threat of heavy rain.
 <br>
  <br>
  A thunderstorm warning prompted organisers to put the "Water Splashing with Electronic Music" event on hold.
  <br>
  <br>
  The splashing at Carpenter Road Park Basketball Courts is slated to take place on Sunday as well, weather permitting.
  <br>
  <br>
  The festival is part of a campaign to enhance Hong Kong's day and nighttime vibrancy across all 18 districts.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to the event's guidelines, organisers will suspend or cancel the event without prior notice during adverse weather conditions.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Pan Yundong, deputy commissioner of the Office of the Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Hong Kong, has called for all sectors to leverage the SAR's advantages in telling good stories about Hong Kong and the nation.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at an event on Friday, Pan said Beijing is committed to becoming a source of stability as the world undergoes unprecedented changes.
  <br>
  <br>
  He highlighted how Chinese cultural appeal had resonated worldwide, and urged all sectors to showcase the nation's credible, lovable, and respectable image.
  <br>
  <br>
  As Hong Kong transitions from stability to prosperity, Pan said the SAR government is implementing reforms with strong central government backing. He hopes everyone will adopt the can-do attitude known as the "Lion Rock Spirit".
  <br>
  <br>
  Pan also noted how new technologies like AI and big data are changing how people communicate. He said Hongkongers should embrace these changes, while helping shape a positive narrative for the city and the nation.

    Police ramp up cross-border cooperation to fight scams

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Newly appointed police commissioner Joe Chow on Saturday said officers will work more closely with police in other jurisdictions to combat cross-border scams.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a radio programme, Chow said it's becoming increasingly difficult to fight scams because many fraudsters or syndicates operate from outside Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have been working alongside other law enforcement agencies overseas, especially through the Interpol channel," he told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have two officers seconded over there in Singapore, the Singapore office of the Interpol. So on a day-to-day basis, we also continue this kind of collaboration work."
  <br>
  <br>
  Locally, Chow said many scams involve stooge accounts, and police will focus on catching those who sell them.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Friday, police arrested 139 alleged stooge account holders on suspicion of money laundering and obtaining property by deception.
  <br>
  <br>
  The police chief also said national security threats are still in place despite the SAR being generally stable.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chow said some people are using social media platforms to incite anti-government sentiment, and some shops have been printing seditious messages on receipts.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The soft resistance has never been stopped," he said. "So we have to work harder and harder, and at the same time, we would like to enhance the national security awareness of  the whole community."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chow also highlighted the use of new technology in police operations, such as plans to utilise drones in patrolling in both urban and rural areas.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Development minister Bernadette Linn says one or two sizeable Northern Metropolis land parcels should to be put up for tender this year, while one in the San Tin Technopole will be tendered in 2026.
 <br>
  <br>
  The government has received 22 submissions expressing interest to develop the three pilot areas of large-scale land disposal located in Hung Shui Kiu Ha Tsuen, Fanling North, and San Tin Technopole.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a radio programme, Linn said the submissions were made by property developers, contractors, conglomerates and logistic companies. She said 60 percent were local companies, and the others were from the mainland.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We expect to see some output in the next two years, including building or formation works. These can be rolled out gradually," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We normally give developers six to seven years in total, although there were opinions that the time was insufficient. We have to strike a balance because we want to speed up development."
  <br>
  <br>
  Linn added that the government will not rule out using a "two-envelope approach" for the tenders, which means non-premium factors will be considered.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the Development Bureau launched a two-year pilot scheme to relax the restrictions under land leases on public spaces of shopping malls, giving them more flexibility to host activities.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister said the scheme aims to boost the economy by encouraging shopping malls to make better use of their public spaces.

    Court dismisses legal challenge over San Tin tech hub

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Development Bureau on Friday welcomed the High Court’s decision to dismiss a legal challenge against the environmental impact assessment of the San Tin Technopole project.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, the government said the ruling removes uncertainties surrounding the project, and that authorities will “press ahead with this flagship project of the Northern Metropolis”.
  <br>
  <br>
  The High Court’s decision came after the applicant withdrew his judicial review application.
  <br>
  <br>
  Justice Russell Coleman allowed social worker Eddie Tse to drop his case and rejected a request to have former Sai Kung district councillor Debby Chan take over the proceedings.
  <br>
  <br>
  Coleman shot down the request in a written judgement, saying Tse and Chan did not share sufficient common interests beyond a general concern for environmental protection.
  <br>
  <br>
  He ruled that Chan only expressed interest in the case "after she learnt from the applicant that he had decided to withdraw his own challenge".
  <br>
  <br>
  The hearing for the judicial review in June has been cancelled.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the Environmental Protection Department also welcomed the ruling, saying it will continue to strictly review all environmental impact assessment reports according to statutory requirements.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than HK$27 billion and nearly 300 hectares of land have been earmarked for the innovation and technology hub in San Tin.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Australian non-permanent judge Robert French has stepped down from the Court of Final Appeal, with the government on Friday expressing regret over his resignation.
 <br>
  <br>
  The administration also extended its gratitude to the departing judge and issued assurances that the SAR's judicial work would not be affected.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The presence or absence of individual judges will not undermine the integrity of the system, nor impair the [Hong Kong SAR] government's determination in upholding the rule of law," a spokesperson said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The [Hong Kong SAR] government fully supports the judiciary in its continuous efforts to appoint and retain foreign non-permanent judges in the future, and will endeavour to capitalise on the [Hong Kong SAR's] common law system, upholding the rule of law in Hong Kong."
  <br>
  <br>
  Confirming French's departure, the judiciary said he had "affirmed his continued respect for the independence and integrity" of all judges at Hong Kong's top court.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The judiciary is grateful to Mr Justice French for his valuable contributions to the work of the [Court of Final Appeal] and his support for the rule of law in Hong Kong during his tenure," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  French, who previously served as the Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia, joined the top court as a non-permanent judge in 2017.
  <br>
  <br>
  Following his exit, there are nine non-permanent judges sitting on the Court of Final Appeal. Five of them are from the United Kingdom and Australia.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In light of its steady caseload, the operation of the [Court of Final Appeal] will not be affected by the recent change in membership of the court," the judiciary said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The judiciary will continue to identify suitable local and overseas candidates for appointment as non-permanent judges."
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the Bar Association has expressed regret over French’s resignation, adding that it is grateful for his contributions to the development of jurisprudence and the rule of law in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also noted his departure will not affect the court's judicial functions, and said that it has “every confidence in the independence of the [Court of Final Appeal]”.

    Govt pledges to review RTHK operations

 Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development Algernon Yau said on Friday the government will further review operations at RTHK after lawmakers expressed concern over the broadcaster's expenditure.
 <br>
  <br>
  At a special finance committee meeting on the budget in the legislature, lawmakers raised questions over the station's headcount and spending.
  <br>
  <br>
  Junius Ho noted that the broadcaster's forecast budget for this financial year had been set at HK$1.5 billion, around 50 percent more than that of five years ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the station cannot keep asking for more public money when the government is under financial stress.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will go back to review once again the overall operations of RTHK, its production and manpower arrangements," Yau said in response.
  <br>
  <br>
  RTHK is under the purview of the Commerce and Economic Development Bureau.
  <br>
  <br>
  New People's Party lawmaker Regina Ip noted the broadcaster is cutting four positions from its 750-strong workforce this financial year, and questioned if it could cut more jobs at the programme officer level in the TV section, since three of its five TV channels are relays of state television or broadcast acquired programmes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Director of Broadcasting Angelina Kwan said the streamlining will continue, and proposals will be submitted to the bureau later.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kwan added that RTHK has been purchasing outside programmes to provide more diverse content.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Friday announced a pilot scheme to install flood-warning systems at five flood-prone areas to prevent vehicles from being stranded during severe rainstorms.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Wading Line System will be set up at Chai Wan Road, Lung Cheung Road in Wong Tai Sin, Tsui Ping Road in Kwun Tong, Chatham Road North in Ho Man Tin and Nam Wan Road in Tai Po Market.
  <br>
  <br>
  These five low-lying road sections were heavily flooded during what were described as "once-in-500-years" deluges in September 2023, officials said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The system comes with red wavy lines painted on roads, water level markers and real-time monitoring equipment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Drainage officials will also install flood-monitoring devices at the lowest points of the road sections to collect real-time water level data.
  <br>
  <br>
  When the water level reaches 0.1 metres, staff from the Drainage Services and Highways departments will be deployed to clear blocked drains.
  <br>
  <br>
  Traffic will be diverted on site when the water level reaches 0.3 metres.
  <br>
  <br>
  If water rises above this level, it can seriously damage vehicles.
  <br>
  <br>
  When officials get a flood warning, they will send teams to the site within 15 to 30 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  With installation work starting in late April and expected to be completed by mid-May, the five pilot projects cost around HK$700,000, a government spokesperson said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials will examine the scheme's effectiveness before deciding on the next step.

 Police said on Friday 139 people have been arrested on suspicion of money laundering and obtaining property by deception, with losses to victims amounting to more than HK$130 million.
 <br>
  <br>
  Officers said the suspects, aged between 19 and 73, provided syndicates with stooge accounts.
  <br>
  <br>
  The suspects were said to be involved in phone, investment and online scams.
  <br>
  <br>
  Senior inspector Wong Yuen-yan said the Kowloon West saw about 1,700 scams in the first quarter, 10 percent more than in the same period of last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said the police will continue to crack down on syndicates and stooge account holders.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Office of the Ombudsman said on Friday it’s launching an investigation into how the Highways Department handles damage to roads, such as uneven surfaces and potholes.
 <br>
  <br>
  The watchdog added that it has also received public complaints about the department’s ineffective monitoring of contractors and delays to repair work.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ombudsman Jack Chan said it’s essential for the department to ensure roads are safe and convenient for public use.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Moreover, as sudden and exceptionally severe rainstorms brought about by extreme weather have happened from time to time in recent years, road closures due to subsidence and serious flooding also take place now and then,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “In this light, I have decided to launch a direct investigation operation to examine the Highways Department 's work on the repair and maintenance of public roads.”
  <br>
  <br>
  People are being invited to put forward any views they have on the matter by May 11.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Transport and Logistics Mable Chan said the government has come up with strategies to tackle an expected drop in Hong Kong's global trading volume as a result of the tariff war initiated by US President Donald Trump.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chan told Ming Pao newspaper that the trade war has brought continued uncertainty to the logistics, maritime and aviation sectors in Hong Kong, and the government will take a leading role by offering them more concrete guidance.
  <br>
  <br>
  One of the strategies is to help the maritime sector look for new growth areas and set up new markets outside Europe and the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan also said the bureau will be more proactive in attracting shipments to the SAR by stepping up collaboration with ports in the Greater Bay Area.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another focus, the transport minister said, is to deepen exchanges and cooperation with international ports and shippers in an attempt to expand the SAR's maritime network, and in that regard an office will be set up in the Middle East in the second half to get more ships to be registered here.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said the government is also considering streamlining customs procedures to boost transshipments.
  <br>
  <br>
  As for the aviation industry, Chan highlighted the need for the sector to upgrade and transform itself by offering diversified services.

 Tickets for next month’s friendly between Manchester United and Team Hong Kong, China, went on sale at noon on Friday, with the cheapest tickets snapped up within half an hour.
 <br>
  <br>
  Priced from HK$390 to HK$2,990, tickets for the fixture were sold exclusively via the Cityline platform.
  <br>
  <br>
  By 3.20pm, the most affordable seats – which cost HK$390, HK$690 and HK$990 each – were sold out, leaving the more expensive tickets as the only options.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pre-sale tickets for the match began earlier this week exclusively for United’s supporters club.
  <br>
  <br>
  Event organisers ProEvents didn’t disclose the percentage of tickets reserved for public sale.
  <br>
  <br>
  The exhibition match, set for May 30 at Hong Kong Stadium, will see the Red Devils’ return to the SAR after 12 years.

    Trump levy looms larger for senders of small parcels

<img alt="People sending small parcels to the US will have to pay US$100 per item from May 2 and US$200 from June 1. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&w=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fexternal-content.duckduckgo.com%2Fiu%2F%3Fu%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fi3.wp.com%252Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%252Fimages%252Fmfile_1799912_1_20250411115603.jpg&q=70">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong is continuing to see fallout from the trade war started by US President Donald Trump who raised the duty on small goods parcels from the SAR to 120 percent from the 90 percent that he had set just a day before that, and the 30 percent in his opening salvo on April 2.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump made the amendment in an executive order that went public on Thursday Hong Kong time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tariffs on parcels will go up from US$75 to US$100 from May 2 and from US$150 to US$200 from June 1.
  <br>
  <br>
  The jump in tariffs closes a trade exemption rule known de minimis that has allowed low-value packages from mainland China, Hong Kong and Macau to enter the United States free of duties.
  <br>
  <br>
  It means people wanting to send small parcels worth up to US$800, which are currently exempt from any duties, to the US from the mainland, Hong Kong or Macau will now have to pay US$100 per item posted between May 2 and before June 1 and US$200 for goods sent after June 1.
  <br>
  <br>
  The skyrocketing increase in duties comes as the number of shipments entering the US through the duty-free route has exploded in recent years, reaching nearly 1.4 billion packages last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 90 percent of these packages now enter under the de minimis rule, and of those, about 60 percent come from China, led by direct-to-consumer retailers such as Temu and Shein.
  <br>
  <br>
  The jump in duties on small goods parcels has been framed by Trump as a solution to the national emergency arising from the US trade deficits and in his starting a tit-for-tat trade war that has seen him levy a punitive 145 percent tariff on Chinese imports.
  <br>
  <br>
  China has said no one wins in a trade war and described the tariffs as protectionist.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Commerce minister Algernon Yau on Friday said the chief executive would head to the Middle East next month with representatives from mainland enterprises to seek more business opportunities.
 <br>
  <br>
  Yau made the announcement during the legislature's special finance committee meeting on the budget.
  <br>
  <br>
  The DAB's Starry Lee, who's also Hong Kong's sole delegate to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, asked how the SAR government planned to reduce its reliance on the US market amid the trade war.
  <br>
  <br>
  She pointed to the fact that Beijing had tasked Hong Kong with strengthening its global connections.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yau replied that officials like himself have been to different countries seeking new partnerships, and John Lee would also do so next month.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In May, the CE will visit the Middle East together with [those from] mainland enterprises. So amid the geo-political tensions, we seek to further development in new markets in the Middle East as well as Asean," the minister said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Among the 10 Asean countries, I've been to seven of them. Mr Lee has also led delegations to Laos, Vietnam and Cambodia. You can see the SAR government has been working proactively to connect with the world."
  <br>
  <br>
  Import and export sector lawmaker, Kennedy Wong from the DAB, asked whether the government plans to move some of its Economic and Trade Offices from Europe and the United States to new markets.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yau said in response that his bureau had been making plans to move some of the offices around, and it would submit its proposals later.
  <br>
  <br>
  Business and Professionals Alliance and industrial sector lawmaker, Jimmy Ng, meanwhile, asked for a direct communication channel with officials due to the trade war, saying the sector had been caught off-guard by the ever-changing developments.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister said in response that his bureau had held two recent meetings with the trade, saying the financial secretary could take the lead to liaise with the business sector if needed.

    HK to launch locally developed chatbot in second half

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Commissioner for Digital Policy Tony Wong said Hong Kong aims to launch a locally developed chatbot in the second half and that it may be available for use free of charge in the initial stage.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong Generative AI Research and Development Center is developing local large language models, and its generative AI document processing application HKPilot has been used by government departments since last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  In an exclusive interview with RTHK, Wong said he hopes the application can improve work efficiency and, in the long run, replace traditional jobs that require a lot of manpower.
  <br>
  <br>
  He expects HKChat's launch in the second half to bring great convenience to the people of Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For instance, Hong Kong residents may want to apply for some government services and they may not know where to find the services or what the procedures are," he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Because the chatbot is trained with data from Hong Kong and we provided it with a lot of information, it will answer you in detail the things you have to prepare and the procedures when applying for the services."
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong was speaking ahead of the annual World Internet Conference's Asia-Pacific summit at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre on Monday and Tuesday, the first time it is being hosted in the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  He expects the summit to attract more than 1,000 officials and business representatives from around the world, like the Six Little Dragons from Hangzhou which include DeepSeek and Unitree Robotics.
  <br>
  <br>
  He hopes Hong Kong can make use of its advantage of being connected with both the mainland and the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We hope we can demonstrate our strength in innovation and technology to the outside world through Hong Kong and seek more room for its development," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The World Internet Conference uses Asia-Pacific summit as its theme, hoping to connect different countries in the Asia-Pacific region and paying special attention to the development of emerging markets in the Global South."

  The commissioner said the authorities will go all out in making a success of the summit and hope it can be hosted in Hong Kong again next year.

<img alt="Paul Chan says the SAR government has formulated various response plans to help fend off financial risks.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Friday said Hong Kong is building a comprehensive financial protection network with systematic response plans and monitoring mechanisms to safeguard what he called the "southern gate" of the nation.
 <br>
  <br>
  The remarks came as trade tensions intensified further between China and the United States, with Washington confirming overnight that levies on Chinese goods now total 145 percent while Chinese duties on American products stand at 84 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  In an interview with the Wen Wei Po newspaper, Chan said the SAR has prepared response plans for different scenarios to ensure that all financial risks will be handled in a timely and effective manner.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SAR government, he added, is in close cooperation with relevant Chinese financial regulatory authorities and ministries, to fully communicate on the response plans and build a "solid barrier" to fend off systemic risks.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Under current geopolitics, if foreign forces attack Hong Kong from the financial aspect, they can be very powerful, therefore there must be strong support from the country for Hong Kong," Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The finance chief stressed the SAR must firmly safeguard financial security at the nation's "southern gate".
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan also said the authorities will take the opportunity of the 10th National Security Education Day next Tuesday to further promote national security and raise awareness, through exhibits and outreach activities in schools and the community at large.
  <br>
  <br>
  He called on financial firms and businesses to take national security into their consideration when making any decisions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan added that he noted a 10 percent increase in the number of foreign firms setting up shop here last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The entry of these foreign companies is based on the high recognition of Hong Kong's business environment, further demonstrating the SAR's attractiveness as a financial centre," he said.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lawmaker Kennedy Wong on Friday said the world had entered a new period of uncertainty and disruption because of the US tariffs.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on
  <a href="https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/news-programmes/this-episode.htm?cmsid=77" target="_blank">
   <u>
    <b>
     RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme
    </b>
   </u>
  </a>
  , Wong, who represents the import and export functional constituency, said diversifying trade links to other regions and countries would be important for local trading firms looking to survive and thrive in this new environment.
  <br>
  <br>
  "What I've learned in the past few days from a lot of our members, exporters, is basically they just need to diversify or continue to diversify... a lot of Hong Kong exporters have implemented the so-called 'China+N' strategy."
  <br>
  <br>
  "So actually, apart from mainland China manufacturers, they have, for example, another few suppliers in the Asean countries," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong said the new round of US tariffs would accelerate trade trends that had been quietly taking place over the last few years, including reaching out to new markets in Southeast Asia, the Middle East and Africa.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I've seen more and more of our members going to Asean, Southeast Asian countries, and they are establishing footholds in the Middle East, like Dubai, and the more adventurous ones are even going to Africa."

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong, China squash player Simmi Chan secured a historic silver medal at the inaugural Under-23 World Squash Championships in Pakistan.
 <br>
  <br>
  The fourth-seeded Chan launched a fierce battle in the women’s title decider against Egypt’s top seed Fayrouz Abouelkheir, stretching the opening game to a tense tie-break before narrowly conceding it 10-12 after 28 minutes of relentless rallies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Though the SAR athlete fought hard, Abouelkheir capitalised on her momentum to claim the subsequent games 11-9 and 11-6, sealing the championship victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite the defeat, Chan’s performance marked a milestone for Hong Kong, as she became the city’s first female athlete to secure a silver medal at the tournament.
  <br>
  <br>
  Her path to the final included a first-round bye followed by dominant victories over opponents from South Africa, Japan, and a hard-fought semifinal triumph against Malaysia’s Yee Xin-ying.

    HK exporters to receive extra support amid tariffs

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong authorities have offered further support to insure local small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) against pre-shipment risks amid sweeping tariffs, while announcing measures to help them tap into new markets.
 <br>
  <br>
  Taking immediate effect, the three measures introduced by the Hong Kong Export Credit Insurance Corporation came as US President Donald Trump decided to ramp up duties on Chinese goods to 125 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development Algernon Yau met on Thursday representatives of industries which were more affected by the tariffs to hear their views.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yau also hit out at Washington for "repeatedly changing its policies" and increasing tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is totally illogical and ungrounded, once again showing the US's bullying act for suppressing its competitors," Yau said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I call upon the business community to unite and face the challenges together with a view to jointly counteracting the unreasonable coercion of the US."
  <br>
  <br>
  Among the measures is the extension of free pre-shipment risk protection to "Small Business Policy" holders to June 30, 2026.
  <br>
  <br>
  The insurance policy is tailor-made for exporters with an annual turnover of less than HK$50 million, covering contracts of sale and service they have with overseas buyers and clients.
  <br>
  <br>
  Exporters not covered by the "Small Business Policy" will also receive a 50 percent discount on pre-shipment cover premiums, while the premium rates for new markets have been slashed to align with those for traditional major markets to help them tap into Asean nations.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Commerce and Economic Development Bureau pledged to maintain close liaison with the business trade to "jointly respond to the unreasonable coercion of the US" and support SMEs in financing, enhancing competitiveness and expanding into more diversified markets.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Manchester United on Thursday assured SAR fans that a “full team” including captain Bruno Fernandes will be featured in a friendly against Hong Kong, China next month.
 <br>
  <br>
  The match – set for May 30 at Hong Kong Stadium – is part of the Red Devils’ post-season Asia tour, which kicks off with a stop in Kuala Lumpur.
  <br>
  <br>
  It marks the Premier League side’s return to the SAR after 12 years. They last visited the city in 2013, when they defeated local club Kitchee 5-2.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a press event held a day before tickets went on sale, Manchester United’s Director of Tour and Friendlies Christoffer Komen said the lineup is still being finalised, but promised the team will put on a show.
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted key players are not required for international duty until June and that a “full team” should be coming to the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  “You can be confident to see our stars, of course led by our team captain Bruno, we’ve also got all the players lined up currently to join us on a plane,” Komen said.
  <br>
  <br>
  There was backlash last year over Lionel Messi’s no-show at an exhibition match in the SAR, which left local supporters frustrated.
  <br>
  <br>
  At the press event, Eric Fok, chairman of the Football Association of Hong Kong, China welcomed the Red Devils’ return, calling it an opportunity to attract football enthusiasts across Asia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Also attending the event was Ashley Westwood, head coach of the SAR football team, who said the squad would treat the friendly as preparation for their Asian Cup qualifier against India in June.
  <br>
  <br>
  ProEvents, organiser of the friendly, said there are contractual agreements in place to ensure the appearance of United's key players.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You just heard from Manchester United's executive saying that they will be coming with the full team." said its chairman, Paul Kam.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I have also seen the list and they are coming, with obviously the first one being Bruno Fernandes, the captain. Together with [Alejandro Garnacho] and other players, they're all in there."
  <br>
  <br>
  Tickets for the friendly fixture will go on sale at noon on Friday via ticketing platform Cityline. They will be priced between HK$390 to HK$2,990.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Authorities have said they will make it easier for people to cook freshly caught fish on boats, as part of a push to promote island hopping tourism.
 <br>
  <br>
  Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism Rosanna Law said in an interview with Wen Wei Po published on Thursday that the easing of fishing regulations is part of the administration's medium-term plan in boosting tourism.
  <br>
  <br>
  She pointed out that in the short run, the government will also consider increasing the number of docking spaces for yachts in Victoria Harbour, revealing that there will be docking and landing step facilities available within the year in Lei Yue Mun.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister also noted that there is interest from the business sector in Hong Kong's plan to develop island and coastline tourism, and that the government plans to play a facilitating role.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, Law told the newspaper that the director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office Xia Baolong had told her in a meeting in Beijing last week that the SAR can be innovative, especially in utilising its coastlines.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Chinese Manufacturers' Association on Thursday urged the SAR administration to roll out support measures to help enterprises with stabilising their working capital amid the global trade war.
 <br>
  <br>
  The association said manufacturers, exporters and importers globally tend to hold off on plans and suspend orders due to the present fast-changing developments.
  <br>
  <br>
  The group's president, Wingco Lo, said Hong Kong firms should be prepared for a protracted trade war and urged the government to introduce targeted measures to help them.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said firms should take the opportunity to expand their markets given the turmoil caused by the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The policies are unstable," Lo said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They are always changing very fast, so we have to be cautious.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think we will be taking the strategy of waiting to see how these things develop.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are looking for new markets, emerging markets especially, to [be] less dependent on the US market."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lo also urged the government to actively explore potential markets and expand economic and trade cooperation with countries in the Middle East and Africa.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Thursday slammed the latest US "reciprocal tariffs", which had earlier been imposed before being paused, as "fundamentally wrong" politically, economically and historically.
 <br>
  <br>
  This came after US President Donald Trump, in a stunning move, delayed the "reciprocal tariffs" against its major trading partners just hours after those tariffs took effect.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the latest reversal still leaves its trading partners facing 10 percent baseline tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  "These sweeping tariffs are disrupting global supply chains, inflating costs for both businesses and consumers, and creating significant uncertainty for cross-border investments," Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "While 'economic nuclear winter' may be an extreme term, we are certainly witnessing challenges to the global trading system unseen in a century," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Noting that the US tariffs will end with grassroot Americans bearing the brunt of increased costs for groceries and daily necessities, Chan also forecasts that three major regional trading blocs will emerge later on, with one being Asia Pacific, the second grouping India, the Middle East and Europe, and the third being the Americas.
  <br>
  <br>
  He indicated that China, as a major economy, could roll out stimulus measures to mitigate the tariffs' impact as the nation still has ample policy room and tools to cope.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our country has made its stance clear: we are open to resolving trade conflicts through dialogue based on mutual respect, not intimidation," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan again reiterated that the SAR's financial market remains resilient despite surging volatility as trading activity is robust while the local currency remains strong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "All margin calls were met on time, with no signs of stress," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "No systemic irregularities have been detected.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will remain vigilant and agile and ready to take appropriate measures, if needed."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan added that the city's de facto central bank, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, has set aside more than HK$50 billion to provide liquidity support for small and medium-sized enterprises.
  <br>
  <br>
  The city, he noted, will also continue to attract strategic enterprises to set up shop in the SAR, after helping more than 80 such firms to invest around US$60 billion here and provide some 20,000 jobs.

    Authorities doing more to tackle scams, mule accounts

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Authorities on Thursday said they are stepping up efforts to tackle scam syndicates and their use of mule accounts to launder funds.
 <br>
  <br>
  This came after the number of scam cases rose by 12 percent, to almost 45,000 last year, involving more than HK$9 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some 8,600 people were arrested on suspicion of lending their bank accounts for money laundering in 2024, a jump of 44 percent from the previous year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among the new measures, police will be sharing with banks the account and phone numbers, as well as e-mails associated with suspicious bank accounts on its Scameter database.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) said banks could flag suspicious accounts, and when money goes into them, they can consider reminding clients of risks, conduct further vetting, or ask police for help.
  <br>
  <br>
  Subject to Legco's passage of a new law, local retail banks will also seek to step up data sharing of suspicious accounts and transactions by the end of the year.
  <br>
  <br>
  An executive director of the HKMA, Raymond Chan, said authorities and the sector will take steps to protect the privacy of clients.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Banks will only be sharing client information in specific situations such as scams and money laundering. The information can only be used for detecting and preventing banned activities," Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The sharing can only take place on a designated platform. One of the platforms is the Financial Intelligence Evaluation Sharing Tool (Finest) set up by the police."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said the HKMA and the force will closely monitor the information sharing system, and it will be issuing guidelines to banks on its use.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, a police chief superintendent, Kelly Cheng, said officers had taken steps to tackle cross-border scam cases.
  <br>
  <br>
  She noted that in a joint operation spanning several months last year, mainland authorities arrested 251 people in connection with more than 500 scam cases.
  <br>
  <br>
  The arrestees – most of them from the mainland – were suspected of coming to Hong Kong to open bank accounts before going back across the border.

    'Hefty US tariffs on China are very irrational'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An industry veteran on Thursday described US President Donald Trump's decision to further raise the levy on Chinese goods to 125 percent as “very irrational”, with experts saying Hong Kong firms should rely less on the US market.
 <br>
  <br>
  The chairman of the Federation of Hong Kong Industries, Steve Chuang, told an RTHK radio programme that many federation members are adopting a wait-and-see approach, as the situation is changing every day.
  <br>
  <br>
  His remarks came less than a day after Beijing announced it would further raise tariffs on US goods to 84 percent, starting at noon on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chuang pointed out that the amount of tariffs imposed by the US does not matter anymore, as levies have already made it impossible for businesses in the SAR to trade with the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The main challenge to businesses in Hong Kong is that if they continue to manufacture the goods in China, should they go ahead with shipping?"
  <br>
  <br>
  "Would American buyers cancel the order? All of them cannot react at the moment, including US buyers, many of them don't know what to do now,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chuang revealed that some trading partners in the US have decided to either put their orders on hold or cancel them.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Billy Mak from the Hong Kong Baptist University said he believes the US wants to cut ties with China by imposing the hefty tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  The professor from the Department of Accountancy, Economics and Finance added that unless talks are held between the world's two largest economies, companies should rely less on US markets and seek to boost trade with Asean or countries along the Belt and Road.
  <br>
  <br>
  And Gary Lau, chairman of the Hong Kong Association of Freight Forwarding and Logistics told the same show that Trump's decision to triple small parcel tariffs from the mainland and SAR will hit local exports the most, as e-commerce platforms accounted for most shipments.
  <br>
  <br>
  He revealed that many platforms are trying to ship out their orders before the measure takes effect next month.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Lawmaker and executive councillor Jeffrey Lam on Thursday said China was justified in retaliating against US tariffs with trade levies of its own.
 <br>
  <br>

     RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme
    </b>
   </u>
  </a>
  , Lam said the country was only responding to what he said were America's "bullying tactics", but held out hope that a deal could eventually be worked out between Beijing and Washington.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China is always open to a fair talk, you know, sitting at the table, not by just starting something, you know, adding 10 percent, 10 percent, 34 percent and 50 percent, forcing other countries to accept [their terms]...  I think we should all sit down and talk about it."
  <br>
  <br>
  While Lam expressed confidence that Hong Kong could weather the storm, he said things could get tough if the uncertainty over trade and tariffs continued, adding he was working with the government to ensure support for local exporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I am asking the government to help. I met with HKMA the other day, first of all, I asked them to ask the banks to extend loans, loan repayment periods. So this is first very, very important and essential. And I also [asked] to extend the interest only repayment relief, which is the payment holiday for 12 more months."

 Hong Kong, China Sanda martial artist Leung Yu-hong triumphed at the 10th Sanda World Cup in Jiangyin, claiming gold in the men’s 60-kilos category.
 <br>
  <br>
  The victory adds to his historic 2023 achievement, when he secured Hong Kong’s first-ever Sanda gold at the World Wushu Championships in Texas.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sanda, also referred to as Sanshou, is a Chinese combat sport blending traditional kung fu techniques - such as strikes, kicks, throws and grappling - with modern fighting tactics.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SAR team further showcased its prowess at the biennial event, earning three additional medals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sunny Cheung secured silver in the men’s 70-kilos division, while Cai Jia-hao and Chan Tsz-ching added bronze medals to the team’s haul in the men's over 90-kilogrammes and the women's 56-kilogrammes respectively.
  <br>
  <br>
  The biennial world cup saw participation from 26 countries and regions, with nearly 170 athletes competing.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The SAR's search and rescue team on Wednesday night returned home from Myanmar, where they supported relief efforts following a devastating earthquake that struck the country last month.
 <br>
  <br>
  The government held a welcome-home ceremony for the team as they arrived at Chek Lap Kok airport at about 10 pm.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chief Executive John Lee shook hands with each member and thanked the team for its efforts, calling them a source of pride for Hong Kong people.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at the ceremony, he said the team was dispatched 61 times during the 11 days they were in Myanmar, and travelled to 57 locations for rescue and support.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The rescue operation was full of challenges. There were risks of aftershocks, and the team had to overcome traffic and communication disruptions, and severely damaged infrastructure at the disaster-stricken areas," Lee said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The local weather was also extremely hot, with temperatures above 40 degrees Celsius for many days. The areas were covered in dust and had a serious mosquito infestation. These hugely increased the difficulty for rescue."
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted that the 51-member team – made up of personnel from various departments and two search dogs – worked closely with the mainland rescue team.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two teams joined hands to rescue nine people following the 7.7-magnitude quake which killed nearly 4,000 people.
  <br>
  <br>
  Also present at the airport ceremony was the consul-general of Myanmar Han Win Naing, who expressed appreciation to the SAR government and the rescue team.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You worked tirelessly amidst the crumbling structures, aftershocks and emotional turmoil, risking your lives to save others. Your actions reflect the essence of humanity, putting others before self," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chief Secretary Eric Chan, Secretary for Security Chris Tang, along with other government officials, also attended the ceremony.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Beijing on Wednesday denounced the reintroduction of a United States bill that threatens closures of Hong Kong's Economic and Trade Offices (ETO) in the country.
 <br>
  <br>
  A spokesperson for the Commissioner's Office of China's Foreign Ministry in the Hong Kong SAR said that the ETOs' role of promoting economic and trade cooperation between the city and the US should not be challenged, Xinhua news agency reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  The office noted that the ETOs are official institutions representing the SAR in the US and that "the smearing attack" on these offices launched by certain US politicians disrupts day-to-day exchanges between the two sides.
  <br>
  <br>
  These politicians should stop interfering in Hong Kong affairs, the spokesperson said, adding that any further moves in the wrong direction will be met with countermeasures.

 Search and rescue teams from Hong Kong and the mainland returned to Beijing on Wednesday afternoon after completing their missions in quake-hit Myanmar.
 <br>
  <br>
  The teams boarded four Chinese Air Force planes at the Myanmar capital Naypyidaw and arrived in Beijing at about 4pm.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Ministry of Emergency Management held a welcoming ceremony at the Beijing Capital International Airport.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chief Secretary Eric Chan, Secretary for Security Chris Tang and the Director of Fire Services Andy Yeung were also present at the ceremony.
  <br>
  <br>
  The officials, together with the SAR team, are expected back in Hong Kong on Wednesday night.
  <br>
  <br>
  The teams rescued nine people following last month's massive quake that killed thousands.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The US tariff on small goods parcels sent from mainland China and Hong Kong has been tripled in the latest escalation by US President Donald Trump of the ongoing trade war between the world’s two biggest economies.
 <br>
  <br>
  The duty on small parcels, previously exempt from duties as part of the de diminis rule, will be increased to US$75 from the US$25 that Trump had set as part of his original opening salvo in the trade war on April 2.
  <br>
  <br>
  The new US$75 duty will take effect on parcels sent from May 2 and before June 1, which was the period when the original US$25 levy was to come into play. That US$25 levy was originally set to be increased to US$50 after June 1.
  <br>
  <br>
  An amendment to the so-called reciprocal tariffs published by the White House on Wednesday Hong Kong time said the new rate on packages priced up to US$800 will be 90 percent of their value, up from the original 30 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  With the amendment, the per postal item fee will also be tripled to US$150 from the planned US$50 that was to go into effect after June 1.
  <br>
  <br>
  The new tariff came into play as Trump made good on his punitive measure against China after it had reciprocated his 34 percent tariffs by a similar quantum.
  <br>
  <br>
  That brought his latest tariffs to 84 percent, making the total, on top of the 20 percent in levies imposed in February and March, 104 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The punitive tariffs come as around 60 percent of all de minimis packages entering the United States come from China.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SAR government, meanwhile expressed strong disapproval over the US' move.
  <br>
  <br>
  A spokesman said the US measures were unreasonable, and its ever-changing policies have caused confusion and inconvenience.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The US no longer upholds free trade, arbitrarily undermining the rules of the World Trade Organization jointly established by the international community, seriously impeding the multilateral trading system and globalisation process, and disrupting the global supply chain," the spokesman wrote in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  It pointed out that Hongkong Post will not collect any so-called tariffs on behalf of the US authorities.
  <br>
  <br>
  The statement added that, for now, Hongkong Post will maintain postal services to the US, but it will announce later the temporary suspension arrangement for postal services to the country.

    Revamped HK$2 subsidy scheme to take effect earlier

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government said changes to the HK$2 transport subsidy scheme will be in place sooner than expected.
 <br>
  <br>
  Those changes were unveiled by Financial Secretary Paul Chan in his budget address in February, and officials have said it would take about 18 months to adjust Octopus machines to accommodate the new fares.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under the plan, fares for more expensive routes will be higher than HK$2, with elderly and disabled passengers paying 20 percent of trips that cost more than HK$10.
  <br>
  <br>
  Welfare minister Chris Sun told lawmakers on Wednesday that the changes could be implemented in about 12 months' time thanks to efforts by transport operators and the Octopus Cards Limited.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We can now say with certainty that the HK$2, or 20 percent of fare, will be implemented in April 2026, which is five months earlier than the original estimate," he said at a special finance committee meeting on the budget.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sun said this would mean extra savings of HK$260 million in public coffers.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also said the move to cap the number of HK$2 subsidised trips to 240 per person each month will be in effect about two years from now.
  <br>
  <br>
  Election Committee councillor Carmen Kan asked whether officials can implement the updated scheme even quicker.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sun said the administration is already taking the least amount of time possible, because officials still have to manually adjust every single machine on vehicles.
  <br>
  <br>
  For his part, Roundtable lawmaker Michael Tien asked whether officials could bring in more measures – such as tougher penalties or new laws – to tackle abuse or misuse of the JoyYou Card for the elderly.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sun said officials had already raised the penalty for people using the card and posing as someone else, adding that some suspects were taken to court.

    Social worker jailed over riot conviction in retrial

<div class="itemFullText">
 Social worker Jackie Chen was on Wednesday handed a three-year, nine-month prison sentence after being convicted of rioting during the 2019 unrest in a retrial.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chen was accused of taking part in a riot on August 31, 2019, when protesters used debris to set up roadblocks in Wan Chai and clashed with police.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2020, a District Court judge acquitted her and ruled that she had no case to answer, before the Department of Justice lodged an appeal.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Court of Appeal later ordered a retrial of four defendants, including Chen. She was the only one out of the four to not plead guilty in the retrial.
  <br>
  <br>
  In sentencing, Deputy District Judge May Chung said the case was very serious.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chung noted that while there was no evidence showing the four defendants were leading the charge in the riot, some of them had brought gear such as masks and gloves.
  <br>
  <br>
  The judge also said Chen had voiced support for the gathering crowd at the scene and encouraged the riot – not the lowest level of participation in the protests.
  <br>
  <br>
  But she decided to reduce the jail term by 10 months for all four defendants, after noting they were under stress from the five-year-long proceedings.
  <br>
  <br>
  Three others in the case each received a jail term of two years and five months after pleading guilty.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Train services between Tung Chung and Sunny Bay will end earlier next Saturday to make way for track diversion work as part of the line's extension, MTR officials said on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  On April 19, Tung Chung Line services will conclude two hours earlier at 11pm.
  <br>
  <br>
  Free shuttle buses will be provided for people to travel between the two stations.
  <br>
  <br>
  The railway company said the last train from Tung Chung to Hong Kong station will depart at 11.01pm, while the final train from Hong Kong to Tung Chung will leave at 11:07pm.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ben Lui, MTR's chief of airport segment, said 100 extra staff will be deployed to help passengers along the line.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If there are any unexpected situations like severe weather, our team will work quickly to fix it," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If these issues might affect train services the next day, we will communicate through the news media and social media as soon as possible."
  <br>
  <br>
  The extension project, which includes building a new Tung Chung East station, is expected to finish by 2029.
  <br>
  <br>
  The MTR said foundation work for the new station has been completed and everything is progressing well.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Housing Winnie Ho said new construction technologies can speed up housing projects and that residents living in substandard subdivided flats will not go homeless amid policy changes.
 <br>
  <br>
  The government announced a plan to eradicate substandard subdivided flats last year, saying they will be replaced by basic housing units, each of which must be no less than eight square metres, or 86 square feet.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on RTHK's Overview Policy programme, Ho said residents of substandard subdivided units do not have to worry about relocations.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Let's say one third of the subdivided flats have to be redesigned," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But the supply of public housing units will increase in the future, and we will have 21,000 transitional flats and 30,000 light public flats
  <br>
  <br>
  "These flats will help to accommodate some 30,000 households in subdivided flats who have to be relocated."
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho said she believes new construction technologies can help speed up housing projects, such as the modular integrated construction method being used to build transitional housing and light public housing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho said she has had exchanges with experts on the mainland and that their new technologies could help the construction sector of the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There are more and more robotic arms being used," she pointed out.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Light public housing are structural steel projects, so welding is an important procedure.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Robotic arms are used for welding, and the efficiency, accuracy and safety are a lot better than doing it manually."

    HK exporters 'furious over Trump tariffs'

<div class="itemFullText">
 A commercial-sector lawmaker said on Wednesday US President Donald Trump's tariffs on China are an act of bullying.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump will impose an additional 50 percent tariffs on Chinese imports at around noon Hong Kong time on top of 54 percent levies, bringing the total to 104 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jeffrey Lam, who is also an executive councillor, told an RTHK radio programme that manufacturers and exporters in Hong Kong who mainly do businesses with the United States were furious about the move and felt powerless.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Many companies now face a situation where they have many batches of completed goods that cannot be shipped, and they're unable to collect payment," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Because, normally speaking, when a customer places an order, companies can only collect payment when the goods have been shipped and have a shipping order.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As they cannot collect the payment, there is a great impact on their cash flow."
  <br>
  <br>
  But he stressed that companies have to be united and not be cowed, saying that will get them through this difficult period.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lam pointed out that firms have reached a critical point, as they still have to settle operating costs, such as wages and rents amid their cash-flow struggles.
  <br>
  <br>
  The lawmaker called on the Hong Kong Monetary Authority to roll out measures to help support small and medium-sized companies.
  <br>
  <br>
  These include extending a payments moratorium on principals for 12 months and offering flexible arrangements for firms to repay loans.
  <br>
  <br>
  Even though the industry has been trading in the Middle East and Southeast Asian markets in the past two years, Lam said combined sales from the two places are still lower than US turnover.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that opening up new markets takes time and that they won't be able to replace the US market at once.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Willy Lin, chairman of Hong Kong Shippers' Council told the same programme that companies in Hong Kong cannot do much even if they have already set up factories in various places, like Southeast Asia, as many of those countries have been  hit by Trump's levies.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A senior official with the Hong Kong Trade Development Council (HKTDC) on Wednesday said the SAR would be resilient in the face of ongoing uncertainty from the new tariffs imposed by the Trump administration.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on
  <a href="https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/news-programmes/this-episode.htm?cmsid=77" target="_blank">
   <u>
    <b>
     RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme
    </b>
   </u>
  </a>
  , Irina Fan, the HKTDC's director of research, said the city had the experience of dealing with previous disruptions from US trade policies.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The good thing about Hong Kong is that this is not the first time we have faced higher US tariffs, given relatively low dependence on the US market, we are actually more resilient to the higher tariffs," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fan said local businesses were more prepared this time round, while the city had diversified its trade links substantially since the first Trump administration, with Southeast Asia, as well as the mainland, becoming more important to Hong Kong traders.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have diversified, we have our trade diversions to engage with new markets, for instance, exports to the Asean market expanded by 39 percent and Asean is now already our second largest trading partner after the mainland."
  <br>
  <br>
  "So our trade dependency [on the US] is low and we have diversified our sourcing which makes us more resilient."

 Leung Chai-yan, the elder daughter of former SAR chief executive CY Leung, has died at the age of 33.
 <br>
  <br>
  Confirming the news on social media early on Wednesday, the former SAR leader said his daughter passed away "very suddenly".
  <br>
  <br>
  Leung, a vice-chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, said Chai-yan "left without saying a word" and passed away peacefully in bed.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Thanks to police and forensic investigations, we can rule out suicide and other suspicious circumstances at the moment," Leung wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We are grateful for the concern, understanding and sympathy from all our friends during this most difficult time for our family.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Police said they received a report of a woman found unresponsive at a Shau Kei Wan serviced apartment complex on Tuesday evening.
  <br>
  <br>
  The woman was certified dead at the scene, according to the force.

    Fans delight as Coldplay kick off HK tour

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 There was fanfare at the Kai Tak Stadium on Tuesday evening as Coldplay kicked off the first of four concerts in Hong Kong on its current world tour.
 <br>
  <br>
  The show marked the British pop band’s return to the SAR after a 16-year hiatus, and the first concert held at the new stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zoe, a longtime Coldplay fan, said she's attending the band’s concert for the first time.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Because it might be the last concert they have in their career, so we're expecting just a very good concert tonight,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another fan, Judy, got the standing ticket that puts her right next to the stage.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I hope there will be fireworks tonight,” she said. “We already know the routine playlist, but I still want to hear if somebody's gonna order a song. My favourite song is ‘Every Teardrop is a Waterfall.’”
  <br>
  <br>
  She was upset about missing Coldplay’s previous world tour and said this time is a dream come true.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Actually, I used to study in London, but I think it's 2018, 2019, that’s the time they stopped the world tour. So it's such a shame that I didn't get a chance to see the tour. This time is like my dream comes true,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Organisers allowed people to bring empty reusable plastic or silicone bottles that can hold up to 600 millilitres of liquid into the stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  There were restrictions to bag size while a list of items, including professional cameras and handheld signs, are prohibited.
  <br>
  <br>
  Most fans whom RTHK spoke to, including Bertha, found the rules reasonable.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I'm aware of this and I think it's quite normal to have such restrictions. Because when I was in Taiwan and New Zealand, they didn't allow people to bring water bottles inside as well,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Once the concert got underway, the atmosphere was electric.
  <br>
  <br>
  It started with the band's vocalist, Chris Martin, greeting fans in Cantonese.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said Coldplay were delighted to be in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fans reached another frenzy when local singer Marf, from the girl group Collar, was invited as a guest to perform with the band.
  <br>
  <br>
  The band also handed out LED wristbands that lit up in different colours for each song.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police, meanwhile, said five people were arrested on suspicion of reselling tickets at inflated prices.
  <br>
  <br>
  Coldplay will put on three more sold-out shows at Kai Tak Stadium on Wednesday, Friday and Saturday.

    Tram fares to go up on May 12

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Tram fares will go up by up to 15 percent starting from May 12.
 <br>
  <br>
  The rise comes after the Executive Council approved an application from Hong Kong Tramways.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government said the new fare will be HK$3.30, or 10 percent more, for those aged 12 and above.
  <br>
  <br>
  The rise will be steeper for the elderly, as their new fare of HK$1.50 is an increase of 15 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Children aged between three and eleven will pay HK$1.60, or a rise of nearly 7 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The price for monthly tickets will stay the same at HK$260.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government said a number of factors were considered as part of the vetting process, such as rising operating costs, the quality and quantity of service provided and public acceptability.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The government considered the fare increase necessary for maintaining stable operation, and that [its] proposed level of increase is acceptable," a spokesperson said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "After the fare increase, the tramway remains the most economical means of transportation serving the northern shore of Hong Kong Island."
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials said they'll continue to work with the company and encourage it to find different sources of revenue, especially tying in with its concept of "tourism everywhere" and preserving its historical value.
  <br>
  <br>
  The last fare increase for trams was in July 2022, when different classes of charges also rose by up to around 15 percent.

<img alt="Financial Secretary Paul Chan, centre back row, says more than 80 strategic enterprises have set up in Hong Kong in the past two years. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&w=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fexternal-content.duckduckgo.com%2Fiu%2F%3Fu%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fi3.wp.com%252Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%252Fimages%252Fmfile_1799460_1_20250408181322.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan said on Tuesday the Office for Attracting Strategic Enterprises, OASES, will seek to attract cultural enterprises in the future in a way that combines innovation and technology with artistry.
 <br>
  <br>
  He made the comments at a signing ceremony between the office and 16 companies, including Ant Digital Technologies and China Mobile Innovation Research Institute.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said the creative and cultural industries hold huge power and their development is unstoppable.
  <br>
  <br>
  “This sector, enriching lives, sparking joy and preaching cultures, is among the fastest growing in the world,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "How artistic toys and animation have captivated audiences globally is simply amazing.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Through Hong Kong's platform, creative pioneers can indeed extend their reach across continents.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan also said more than 80 strategic enterprises have set up in Hong Kong in the past two years, and will bring nearly HK$50 billion worth of investment and create more than 20,000 jobs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Car company Li Auto is among the companies securing a partnership agreement with OASES.
  <br>
  <br>
  Its senior vice president, Li Guanhua, said the company is looking to invest around HK$20 billion in the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We chose to come to Hong Kong to develop a core research centre this year because we value Hong Kong’s position in the whole economic, financial and fintech aspect,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our investment in Hong Kong will be long term."
  <br>
  <br>
  Li said the Hong Kong office will serve as an offshore clearing centre, as well as a research centre for AI facilities.
  <br>
  <br>
  When asked whether US tariffs would affect company sales, Li said the firm only started developing its overseas market this year but the United States would not be its target.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another company, Enlight Medical, said Hong Kong provides a stable environment given the current chaos created by US tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The Hong Kong government said it will not follow Beijing’s decision to impose retaliatory tariffs on the US,” said co-founder Rocky Bian of the health technology company.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This helps us stabilise our global supply chain.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Hong Kong is a free port. Apart from re-export trades, the city also provides stability in importing machine components and raw materials from the US.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Bian said the company will hire around 900 workers in a few years time, spanning from researchers to quality assurance talent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The cost of operating in Hong Kong, he added, does not differ by much from mainland cities.
  <br>
  <br>
  Web 3 auditing company CertiK said it hopes to safeguard technology development in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Hong Kong is a hub of the financial supply chain and market, and the government is also promoting and encouraging business development in this area,” said its chief security officer Li Kang.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But they are also under pressure due to risks in the new area.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We are here to try to safeguard institutions against risk.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We can help make sure users make the right investments and secure their assets.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Li added that the company has already been serving one of the largest banks in Hong Kong.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A transport worker convicted of rioting and wounding with intent in Yuen Long in 2019 was jailed for seven years on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Wong Chi-wing, 60, was found guilty last week after a retrial for taking part in the violence nearly six years ago on July 21.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong's lawyer argued in mitigation last week that his client had a rather small part in the clashes.
  <br>
  <br>
  But District Court judge Eddie Yip dismissed the plea.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yip said the case was very serious.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong, he said, was among a group of white-shirted men that carried out what he described as an indiscriminate attack on others inside and near Yuen Long MTR station.
  <br>
  <br>
  The sentencing starting point for two co-defendants in the case was seven years behind bars, Yip noted, and the same was applied to Wong with no discount offered.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong had been acquitted in 2021, and a higher court ordered a retrial after the Department of Justice won an appeal.

<div class="itemFullText">
 YouTube streamer IShowSpeed's flash visit to the city last week shows that Hong Kong is safe, fun and open, according to Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism Rosanna Law.
 <br>
  <br>
  Some netizens and lawmakers have questioned the rough planning of the itinerary, saying the government missed a great opportunity to promote Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  In an interview with Ta Kung Pao and Wen Wei Po newspapers, Law said Speed's nine-and-a-half-hour citywide livestream served as an excellent promotion of the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  Law said she believes spontaneity is the streamer's selling point and that he might not have wanted to follow an official itinerary.
  <br>
  <br>
  The crowds that gathered during his MTR ride caused some disruption, which was unexpected even for Speed himself, Law added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Law also noted there have been changes in the ways tourism is promoted, adding that online influencers have become an important way for people to uncover new places.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong is a very open place. Anyone can have a great time as long as they follow the rules," she said, adding that it sent a great message in the current geopolitical climate.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The central government is well prepared and has a broad arsenal to respond to any further tariff escalation by US President Donald Trump, according to Executive Council convenor Regina Ip.
 <br>
  <br>
  She was speaking on RTHK's Backchat programme on Tuesday on Washington's recent tariff barrage launched across the world, including an additional 34 percent tariff on Chinese imports.
  <br>
  <br>
  In response, Beijing hit back with tariffs of 34 percent on all goods from the United States and added 11 US firms to its unreliable entity list.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ip, who's also the New People's Party chairwoman, said Trump is effectively ceding the role of champion of free trade and rule-based multilateral system to China.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the long term, China will be the winner, in terms of trade, technology and moral high ground," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ip stressed that if Trump does decide to retaliate further, it will only continue to plummet global markets, and that the tariff war will likely continue unless Trump's tycoon backers reign him in or Republicans get burned in the midterm elections next year.
  <br>
  <br>
  As for the likelihood of a global recession, Ip said it's likely.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The SAR government should work out a panoply of policy options to buoy the local economy pending a global recession," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  When asked about the SAR not setting any countermeasures to the US tariffs, Ip said Hong Kong will continue to be a free port, noting that the city is bound by the Basic Law, as well as its tariff commitments to the World Trade Organization.
  <br>
  <br>
  Weighing in on the same issue, Andrew Leung, China strategist and former senior Hong Kong government official, said the US was upending the very trade institutes it helped create after World War II.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the current Trump policies are a continuation of what he had started during his previous term in office, and therefore "China had been preparing for this for a long, long time."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Immediately, after Trump 1.0 President Xi was quite prescient -- shortly after Trump won the White House for the first time, he already ordered China to go full steam ahead towards self-sufficiency and self-reliance -- particularly on high technology," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Leung also said Chinese products will remain competitive globally, like BYD electric cars, because of the superior technology and price, despite the tariff headwinds.

 Chief Executive John Lee said on Tuesday Hong Kong will seize every opportunity to help social media influencers show the city to the world.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lee was speaking after YouTube megastar IShowSpeed's visit here last week.
  <br>
  <br>
  The live streamer drew crowds of fans and chaos as he made his way to Causeway Bay, Ocean Park and the Temple Street night market on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking before the weekly Executive Council meeting, Lee said the Tourism Board had reached out to the YouTuber but didn't hear back from him.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This KOL [key opinion leader] has many followers, he has many fans, so I'm sure we all take very seriously any opportunity to publicise Hong Kong," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee also called on different sectors of the community to welcome and support influencers coming to the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I see there were hotels, restaurants, public transport operators which provided Speed and other KOLs assistance in their broadcasting," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So if anyone wants to promote Hong Kong, please do our best to help them because Hong Kong is our home."
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked about his assessment of Super March, Lee said the series of mega events attracted overseas tourists and boosted the hotel and catering industries.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said more mega events are lined up for April, including the first-ever World Internet Conference Asia-Pacific Summit to be held in Hong Kong.

    HK economist expects Fed to cut rates sooner

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An economist said on Tuesday he expects the US Federal Reserve to cut interest rates sooner than expected in a bid to rescue the American economy.
 <br>
  <br>
  The prediction came a day after a global stock market rout amid concern over the ongoing trade war as seen in tit-for-tat tariff levies between the world's two largest economies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on an RTHK radio programme, Terence Chong, executive director of Chinese University's Lau Chor Tak Institute of Global Economics and Finance, said that if the US stocks continue to slump, the Fed's top priority is to save the economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I believe the chance of the Fed cutting rates due to the slump in US stocks and global stock market is high," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Because if US stocks continue to drop, it has to save the economy first.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Inflation is not its top concern."
  <br>
  <br>
  US President Donald Trump has threatened to impose an additional 50 percent tariffs on Chinese goods from Wednesday if Beijing does not retract its 34 percent counter-tariffs to the American levies imposed last week.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chong said this shows that Trump was scared of China tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  The economist pointed out that as soybean is one of China's top US imports, soybean farmers would be hit the hardest under the potential additional levy.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also said if the trade war escalates, it might give rise to smuggling and panic buying in the United States when some goods are not imported to Washington.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, Chong expects Hong Kong stocks to remain volatile in the short run and suggests investors not enter the market for now.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The MTR said it would enhance services on the Tuen Ma and East Rail lines this week to accommodate concertgoers attending Coldplay’s performances at Kai Tak Stadium.
 <br>
  <br>
  The British rock band will hold four concerts - Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday and Saturday - with shows expected to conclude after 10pm each evening.
  <br>
  <br>
  The rail operator warned that stations along the Tuen Ma Line, particularly Kai Tak and Sung Wong Toi, may experience heightened crowds, with concert entry times overlapping with the evening rush hour.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said temporary measures such as one-way directional systems and adjusted entry and exit routes would be implemented at these stations to manage passenger flow.
  <br>
  <br>
  Passengers are advised to pay attention to station announcements and follow directional signage for guidance.
  <br>
  <br>
  The MTR also reminded cross-border passengers to check the last train departure times for Lo Wu Station to ensure timely connections after the events.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said additional staff would be deployed to assist with crowd control, and the corporation emphasised ongoing coordination with relevant authorities to streamline operations.

    'Reckless' tariffs hurt global trade, says John Lee

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee has hit out at the United States for slapping "reckless" tariffs on countries and places around the world, vowing to take steps to respond to the sweeping levies through deepening international cooperation.
 <br>
  <br>
  Washington has announced an additional 34 percent tariff on Chinese goods, which also applies to Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  Coming on top of existing levies, the tariffs go up to 54 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The US no longer adheres to free trade, arbitrarily undermining the internationally established rules of world trade," Lee said ahead of Tuesday's Executive Council meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Its ruthless behaviour damages global and multilateral trade.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The reckless imposition of tariffs affects many countries and regions around the world with huge tax rate increases and covering a wide range of goods, disrupting the world's economic and trade order, bringing great risks and uncertainties to the world."
  <br>
  <br>
  Export enterprises will inevitably be affected in the short run by the tariffs, Lee added.
  <br>
  <br>
  To address the effects brought about by US tariffs, the chief executive said seizing opportunities on the mainland and integrating into national development is one of seven key areas in which the SAR government is hoping to strengthen its work.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee also pledged to boost international exchanges, strengthen global financial cooperation, and work to attract foreign investment.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Hong Kong, he said the authorities would accelerate industrial transformation, intensify efforts in the development of innovation and technology, while supporting enterprises to cope with the impacts of tariffs and external challenges.

 A modern dance drama inspired by renowned Chinese poet Su Dongpo and innovative works relating to tea are some of the highlights of an upcoming Chinese Culture Festival organised by the Leisure and Cultural Services Department (LCSD).
 <br>
  <br>
  To be held from June to September, the festival features more than 280 performing arts programmes, with art groups and artists from the SAR and around the country taking part.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among the highlights is the opening programme, "Dongpo: Life in Poems", a modern dance drama by the China Oriental Performing Arts Group and inspired by the life of Su, a poet in the 11th century in the Song dynasty.
  <br>
  <br>
  It features both modern dance and traditional crafts such as poetry writing and calligraphy "for a visually stunning and internationally accessible experience," said Ivy Ngai, a chief manager of the LCSD.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ngai said another key event of the festival is the tea culture series, which features works curated by the Ambassador for Cultural Promotion, Tan Dun, blending traditional tea culture with music and performances.
  <br>
  <br>
  In addition, "there will be exhibitions, talks and workshops which try to immerse the audience into different kinds of activities and feel the significance and culture of tea," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think innovation is a very important element, that we would like to fuse in Hong Kong elements, and how we modernise the traditional essence," Ngai added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The festival also features Peking opera, plays and films, among other works.
  <br>
  <br>
  It aims to promote Chinese culture and enhance the public's national identity and cultural confidence.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ngai also said she expects the event to be popular among visitors as well. "This year, we added on more bilingual elements so as to make the programmes more accessible to travellers."
  <br>
  <br>
  Tickets to various performances are available from April 15.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan said the Hong Kong stock market and the local currency remain robust and strong, after the US tariffs triggered the biggest single-day sell-off for the Hang Seng Index on record.
 <br>
  <br>
  The local bourse lost 3,021 points, or 13.2 percent, to close at 19,828.
  <br>
  <br>
  The percentage drop was the worst among major Asian markets on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to the press after trading ended, Chan said the plunge reflected grim global investor sentiment.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he pointed out that officials didn't see any "systemic market abnormalities" in the SAR, saying the local financial system is very sound and the Hong Kong dollar remains strong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Basically the market has been functioning orderly. There are substantial selling as well as buying interests. The spread between the two has been very tight, indicating that the buying power remains very strong," Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister noted that for some time going forward, it's unavoidable that the markets would continue to fluctuate, and investors should exercise caution and assess their risks.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said reciprocal tariffs from different counties against the United States and interest rate movements by central banks could add to market volatility.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We do not think the current volatility in the market warrants any drastic measures to be taken," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan added that officials will keep a close eye on the markets to guard against financial risks.

    HK stocks slump has retail investors seeing red

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Small-time investors in Hong Kong were left reeling on Monday as US President Donald Trump's punishing tariffs and Beijing's retaliation saw the city's stock market suffer its worst day in almost three decades.
 <br>
  <br>
  The benchmark Hang Seng Index fell by 13.2 percent – its biggest drop since 1997 during the Asian financial crisis.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a securities brokerage in Central, where more than a dozen elderly investors stared at numbers flashing red on computer screens, the mood was grim.
  <br>
  <br>
  A woman in her nineties, Tam, said she "hated" Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He cost me HK$200,000," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He's nonsensical, he says one thing and changes his mind a few minutes later... How can someone in such a lofty position act like that?"
  <br>
  <br>
  "[Trump] won't let it go, he's making a mess," said another retiree Lee.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Everyone around me is losing money."
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong resumed trading on Monday after a three-day break, which worsened the drawdown, according to Stanley Chik, head of research at Bright Smart Securities.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong's stock market had outperformed the United States since Trump took office, but Monday's rout wiped out HSI gains from the first quarter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Investors have taken a wait-and-see approach for weeks as Trump finalised his trade policies, Chik said, adding that the mood was not yet one of "despair".
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong tops the world in retail investor participation, with one 2023 survey showing that 48 percent of the respondents held or traded stocks in the preceding year.
  <br>
  <br>
  A 35-year-old man, Tsang, said his long-term investments lost around US$12,900 on Monday, but he would not consider selling yet.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I didn't expect it to get so bad," said Tsang, a bank employee.
  <br>
  <br>
  China A-shares may be more resilient, he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In this sort of fight (between China and the United States), it's hard to say who will suffer more."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lawyer Ray Chan, 30, was among those left unscathed on Monday, as he sold all his Hong Kong and US shareholdings two weeks ago, netting gains in the seven figures.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're clearly entering a bear market but I'm prepared," Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When [Trump] said there would be tariffs on April 2, I could guess where things were headed."
  <br>
  <br>
  It will take "at least a year" before he returns to the market, Chan said. (AFP)

 Nurturing talent is the "cornerstone" in innovation and technology (I&T) development, according to the city's tech chief on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Secretary for Innovation, Technology and Industry Sun Dong told a launch ceremony for the Polytechnic University's faculty of computer and mathematical sciences that SAR authorities have been taking steps to expand the pool of highly-skilled professionals and equip young people with skills needed for the future.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We firmly believe that nurturing talent is a cornerstone of innovation and technology development," Sun said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We continue to proactively promote science and mathematics education, and strengthen digital education, so as to provide talent support for developing Hong Kong into an international I&T centre."
  <br>
  <br>
  The university's newly established faculty focuses on three main disciplines: applied mathematics, computing, and data science and artificial intelligence.

    'DC members shouldn't speak just for the sake of it'

 Home affairs minister Alice Mak on Monday defended some district councillors who reportedly have not spoken during meetings for an entire year.
 <br>
  <br>
  Citing minutes, the Ming Pao newspaper reported that six appointed or ex-officio councillors never said a word at full council sessions in their first year in office.
  <br>
  <br>
  They're among 33 who reportedly didn't speak at around 80 percent of meetings.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mak said councillors might have opted not to speak for the sake of efficiency.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The councillors should definitely give their views on topics, but they don't want to repeat the same opinions," she told reporters after attending an event.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is not an efficient use of time – it'd be speaking for the sake of speaking, to hit a certain target in terms of numbers. That's definitely not what everyone wants to see."
  <br>
  <br>
  Mak noted that she herself had been a district councillor for more than 25 years before joining the government, and members were always prepared about agenda items and knew when to give their thoughts.
  <br>
  <br>
  She questioned if the public would want to see councillors give the same views hundreds of times, or better utilise their time by meeting with residents in the community.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister said the same idea applies at the legislature to avoid repetition.
  <br>
  <br>
  She also said all district councillors met their performance targets.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mak added that mobile street booths will soon be set up to further boost communication between residents and district councillors, and announcements will be made in due course.

 From Monday, airline passengers have been banned from using and charging their power banks during flights and storing portable chargers in overhead compartments.
 <br>
  <br>
  The ban by the Civil Aviation Department came after a returning Hongkong Airlines' flight on March 20 had to make an emergency landing in Fuzhou due to a fire triggered by a portable charging device.
  <br>
  <br>
  An Air Busan plane that was also bound for Hong Kong caught fire as well in January at its home airport for the same reason.
  <br>
  <br>
  A traveller surnamed Cheng told RTHK at an in-town check-in centre that the regulation would not affect her in-flight experience.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I know about the rule, and I don’t think it will affect me,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I can still put my power bank under the seat, there is sufficient space.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I saw some news of planes catching fire due to these chargers, so I think for everyone’s safety, I am not in any rush to charge my phone.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Another flyer, Gillett, said he had not heard about the new rule.
  <br>
  <br>
  “No, not a word,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "No [impact on me] at all.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I don’t have any power banks, and I charge my phone ahead of time and turn it off when I’m on the plane.
  <br>
  <br>
  This was echoed by a passenger, Stark, who also does not own a portable charger.
  <br>
  <br>
  “No [effect on me],”she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I just watch the in-flight entertainment, and I just plug [my phone cable] into the [USB port in the seat in front].

 Under Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury Joseph Chan said on Monday the government will pay close attention to the stock market and ensure that the city remains financially stable.
 <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong stocks plunged on the first trading session after Beijing hit back over the US imposition of an extra 34 percent tariffs on Chinese goods by announcing reciprocal levies of the same quantum on American goods.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hang Seng Index was down about 9 percent in early trading on Monday, with tech, solar, banking and online retailers' shares plunging.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan told lawmakers that Hong Kong has a strong financial base that can deal with any volatility in the market and that authorities will stay vigilant to market changes.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Our fundamentals are very strong, liquidity is high, and therefore, we have been fair and open in our operation," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our core and fundamentals are very strong,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The government will continue to be vigilant together with the regulators to monitor closely the market to maintain a stable financial market.” (additional reporting by Reuters)

 The Airport Authority Hong Kong board has appointed Vivian Cheung as its chief executive.
 <br>
  <br>
  Her three-year term begins on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Secretary for Transport and Logistics Mable Chan offered the new CEO a warm welcome.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I trust that under Mrs Cheung's leadership, the Airport Authority will continue to strengthen the leading position of Hong Kong International Airport as an international aviation hub and promote the long-term development of the airport," the government said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan added that the government will work closely with the authority to lead the aviation industry to new heights.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cheung, for her part, expressed gratitude to the board and government.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The global business environment is increasingly challenging, but I am full of confidence in the future of our aviation industry," she said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With staunch support from the government, chairman and the board, Airport Authority Hong Kong colleagues and our business partners, we shall further consolidate Hong Kong International Airport’s leading position and develop the airport city as a new landmark in Asia."
  <br>
  <br>
  The appointment was endorsed on March 31 by the authority's board following approval by the SAR chief executive.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cheung, previously the acting CEO and chief operating officer, joined the authority in 1992.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's justice chief has stressed that educating the public on national security is an ongoing effort, calling on people to stay vigilant against possible threats.
 <br>
  <br>
  In the run-up to the city's National Security Education Day on April 15, Secretary for Justice Paul Lam told local newspaper Sing Tao Daily that the push to raise public awareness should not be limited to certain days.
  <br>
  <br>
  For example, he said, one should not treat one's spouse well only on Valentine's Day, adding that national security education should similarly be an everyday thing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lam also warned that national security risks might still exist even though Hong Kong now has a very stable environment.
  <br>
  <br>
  One of six officials recently sanctioned by the United States, Lam said Washington's move might encourage more people to take part in work to safeguard national security.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the punitive actions would not affect him and that none of the officials placed on Washington's list left their job as a result of the sanctions.
  <br>
  <br>
  While no one would be happy to be sanctioned, Lam said, it did not mean that they had to be agitated and upset over it.
