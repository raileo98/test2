<div class="itemFullText">
 The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) has apologised over the suspected theft of files that contained the personal data of about 100 people.
 <br>
  <br>
  Officials said the incident involved two internal document files stored at the Kowloon City District Environmental Hygiene Office.
  <br>
  <br>
  The FEHD said the files contained records of public complaints against environmental nuisances in the district, including the names and contact information of about 100 complainants.
  <br>
  <br>
  The department has reported the case to the police and notified the Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data as well as affected complainants.
  <br>
  <br>
  "While the case is believed to be an isolated incident, the department will take stringent action should the investigation reveal any negligence or mishandling by any officer," a spokesman said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The FEHD will also review the current personal data security measures to ensure effective protection of the personal data it collects."

<img alt="Retail sales have declined for nine months in a row. File photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1785893_2_20250102183155.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's retail sales were down 7.3 percent in November on a year-on-year basis, according to official figures released on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  It marked the ninth consecutive month of year-on-year declines, following a 2.8 percent skid in October and 6.9 percent drop in September.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sales of motor vehicles and parts saw the most dramatic drop in November, at 34.4 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Total retail sales plunged 7.1 percent in the first 11 months of last year, compared to the same period in 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government said the declines continued because of a change in people's consumption patterns and the relatively strong Hong Kong dollar.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Nevertheless, the introduction of various measures by the Central Government to boost the mainland economy and benefit Hong Kong, including the resumption and expansion of the multiple-entry Individual Visit Scheme for Shenzhen since December, together with the SAR Government's various initiatives to boost market sentiment, as well as increasing employment earnings, would be conducive to spending by both visitors and residents in the local market," a spokesman said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The executive director of the Retail Management Association, Bond Law, said he is hopeful sales will rebound this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The resumption of multiple-entry visas for Shenzhen is a good start to drive foot traffic, and the positive impact on the market starting December will take time to take effect," he said in an online press call.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Looking forward to 2025, the positive impact of various supportive measures are expected to gradually materialise to benefit all retail categories."

<div class="itemFullText">
 The annual Toys and Games Fair, together with two other fairs, will kick off on Monday, featuring more eco-friendly products.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Toys and Games Fair, the Baby Products Fair and the International Stationery and School Supplies Fair will be held at the Convention and Exhibition Centre in Wan Chai from January 6 to 9.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong Trade Development Council (HKTDC), which is the main organiser, said the three fairs, themed “New Play for All”, attracted more than 2,500 exhibitors from different countries and regions.
  <br>
  <br>
  HKTDC’s deputy executive director Sophia Chong said the Green Toys Zone will return for a second year, featuring toys made with eco-friendly or recycled materials.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said the fair will also present the first ESG (Environment, Social and Governance) Pavilion, as going green is a global trend.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The materials, the production process and also the standard of entering these import markets outside of Hong Kong, are placing more and more importance on environmentally friendly requirements and standards,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It's not only applying in the toys and games and baby product sectors, but also across sectors in the fashion, lifestyle, as well as the electronics industry, so we think this will be a definite worldwide trend which cannot be missed.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The HKTDC said green toys include plush dog toys made using eco-friendly materials, and 3D paper puzzles made with pure wood pulp kraft paper.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chong expressed optimism about Hong Kong’s economy this year, saying the HKTDC planned to organise about 40 large-scale fairs and conventions in 2025.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Transport Department has announced that authorities are now handling up to 500 applications each working day from car owners who want to drive to the mainland via the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge, up from 400 previously.
 <br>
  <br>
  The department said the move will allow it to better cope with the number of applications being received under the Northbound Travel for Hong Kong Vehicles scheme.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The eligibility, procedures and balloting of applications of the scheme remain unchanged," a spokesman said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The governments of Guangdong and Hong Kong will continue to monitor the operation of Northbound Travel for Hong Kong Vehicles and maintain close liaison with relevant departments to review and enhance the arrangements of the scheme in a timely manner."
  <br>
  <br>
  The scheme began in June 2023 and more than 60,000 applications had been submitted by the middle of last year.

    Cage homes won't be under new regulations: Winnie Ho

<img alt="Winnie Ho said officials would implement new regulations over future basic housing units with care. File photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1785862_1_20250102132347.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Housing minister Winnie Ho on Thursday said the government was not including cage homes and cubicle units under the planned new regulatory regime for subdivided flats, because those are already subject to an existing licensing system.
 <br>
  <br>
  There have been calls for the government to put these so-called bed space units under the future basic housing unit regime, which would subject flats to requirements such as a minimum size.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the housing chief said there's a public misconception about this.
  <br>
  <br>
  "'Bed space' units in various forms – including 'cage homes', 'coffin homes' and 'space capsule' units – are already regulated by the licensing regime under the Bedspace Apartments Ordinance," Ho wrote in an SCMP opinion piece.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Regulation under the regime for basic housing units would only duplicate regulations and is therefore unnecessary."
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho said the government estimates that around 80,000 basic housing units would still be available in the market after the new laws are introduced.
  <br>
  <br>
  Coupled with the fact that more public housing will be available in the coming years, she said there shouldn't be much room for rents to rise significantly for subdivided flats.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho added that as tackling subdivided flats is her bureau's top priority, the government is striving to pass legal changes by the end of the year and would then implement new regulations in a gradual and careful manner.
  <br>
  <br>
  Landlords would be given up to a year and a half to register the flats, followed by a grace period of up to two years for working things out with tenants before flat conversion.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister said after the completion of registration, officials would decide on the time frame for law enforcement.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said enforcement would be carried out in an orderly manner, to avoid displacing affected households.

    HK breast milk bank to commence operations on Jan 6

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The city's first breast milk bank – located at the Hong Kong Children's Hospital in Kowloon Bay – will start services on January 6, the Hospital Authority said.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on an RTHK programme on Thursday, the director of the Hong Kong Breast Milk Bank, Rosanna Wong, said the facility aims to collect 50 to 100 litres of breast milk in its first stage of service, so it can start supplying the milk to premature or critically-ill newborns in nine public hospitals in March when the second stage begins.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We will ensure the quality of the breast milk. We will conduct checks including screening, microbiological testing, pasteurisation, and nutritional analysis, all under precise temperature control. The processed breast milk will then be eligible to supply to the newborns,” Wong said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong said breast milk is easier for premature newborns to digest, and can reduce the chance of them developing complications due to their early birth.
  <br>
  <br>
  She hoped the bank could collect around 1,000 litres of breast milk a year in future, benefiting 450 to 600 newborns.
  <br>
  <br>
  To donate breast milk, Wong said the donor must be healthy, must not smoke nor drink alcohol, and is currently breastfeeding a baby under one year old.
  <br>
  <br>
  The donor will also have to take a blood test once every three months.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong said the facility will provide milk bottles and pouches to the donors.
  <br>
  <br>
  Donors can store their breast milk in a refrigerator at home before a courier arranged by the facility collects the milk.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong Breastfeeding Mothers’ Association welcomed the launch of the facility, with chairwoman Jacy Chan calling it "a good start".
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's very helpful for premature or critically-ill newborns because often mothers cannot breastfeed them because of the separation, so having donated breast milk to help these babies would be very good to help with their recovery," she told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan also said many women are interested in donating breast milk, so it's important to make things easier for prospective donors.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For mothers who are giving birth or have given birth at private hospitals, they have to go to the Children's Hospital in Kai Tak, so it's a little bit inconvenient sometimes for these mothers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Also, the questionnaire and the blood test used to be done from Monday to Thursday during working hours, which means I think for mothers on maternity leave it may not be as difficult, but for mothers who have returned to work it would mean they have to take a day off to go to the place specifically for this.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If they can have a bit more different points for which the mothers can do the blood test, that would be helpful."

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Transport and Logistics Mable Chan said on Thursday that imported talent can help with maintenance of the C919 aircraft in the SAR.
 <br>
  <br>
  China Eastern is now using the domestically made jet on flights between Hong Kong and Shanghai.
  <br>
  <br>
  On a radio programme, Chan was asked whether Hong Kong has a sufficient number of engineers able to carry out maintenance work on the aircraft.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Civil Aviation Department has been participating in the certification work of the C919 on the mainland since 2012, and the department has also deployed workers to the mainland to join related training courses," Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If we need more people to offer short-term support, we can also make use of existing schemes to import talents, as well as work visas to cater for the need."
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the transport chief also said flight movements at the airport returned to pre-pandemic levels over Christmas, with a daily peak of about 1,150.
  <br>
  <br>
  The average daily number of passengers exceeded 180,000 during the holiday, with a peak of 190,000 on December 21, Chan said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A man who has been charged with murder and attempted robbery, in connection with an incident in Sham Shui Po more than three decades ago, appeared in Eastern Court on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Wen Wenye, 59, was arrested last November when he entered Hong Kong via the Shenzhen Bay Port.
  <br>
  <br>
  He is alleged to be one of three people who robbed a second-hand watch store on Pei Ho Street before fleeing in a car in 1991.
  <br>
  <br>
  A 56-year-old male shopkeeper died after being shot in the head.
  <br>
  <br>

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Experts have called for more support measures to cope with the rising trend of single-person households in Hong Kong, with reviews on existing policies to better cater for their needs.
 <br>
  <br>
  The proportion of one-person households in the SAR rose from around 13 percent in 2000 to 20 percent in 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vivian Lou, professor of social work and social administration at the University of Hong Kong, said society had generally become more accepting towards those living alone.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Some of our policies, programmes, and economic activities are not biased towards multi-persons families. If you are single, you can still enjoy, participate and contribute," she said on the sidelines of the Asian Family Summit 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For part of the policies or care systems, we do need to critically review and identify the blocks; what blocks the one-person households from enjoying, asserting their choices, and participating wholly in society."
  <br>
  <br>
  Srinivas Tata, the social development division director of the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, said single-person households mostly consisted of two groups of people – young people and elderly individuals.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said support was needed to prevent singletons, in particular those from the older generation, suffering from emotional distress.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Sometimes the prescriptions are social prescriptions. It means more interactions, it means more emotional support, it means having the opportunity to interact with people," Tata said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Promoting intergenerational interactions and government policies for children to support parents are key to strengthening support for those living alone, Tata added.

    Hong Kong brings back 3pc hotel accommodation tax

<img alt="The Hotel Accommodation Tax had been suspended since 2008. Photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1785775_1_20250101180654.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong on Wednesday brought back the three percent accommodation tax which had been suspended since July 2008.
 <br>
  <br>
  While some tourists called the tax rate acceptable, others were unhappy that the extra charge wasn't clearly stipulated on booking websites.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a hotel in Wan Chai, a mainland tourist who's checking in said he finds the tax rate acceptable.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's fine, I respect your system here. The platform shows the tax added to the price and reminds you. For overseas consumption, we always pay tax in advance," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  But another tourist told RTHK that the tax wasn't clearly indicated on some online booking platforms.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think the platforms should show the tax amount in brackets, or show the prices with and without tax, then consumers would know," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The executive director of the Hong Kong Tourism Association, Timothy Chui, said the key is to make the tax collection process as straightforward as possible.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The government hasn't specified how to collect it. Some hotels want to save costs, so they collect at the front desk. We need to decide whether to make it more complex by collecting at the front desk or collect it all through online travel agents," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chui also hopes the government will consider lowering the tax rate when public finances improve.

    'Arrangements at border control points were smooth'

<img alt="The Lo Wu Control Point, which usually closes at midnight, operated until 2am on Wednesday. Photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1785753_1_20250101125820.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Security Chris Tang said arrangements at border control points were smooth, as travellers returned to the mainland in the early hours of January 1 following countdown celebrations.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Shenzhen Bay Control Point operated overnight; and the Lo Wu Control Point, which usually closes at midnight, extended its service hours to 2am. The operation of the East Rail line was also extended.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government said 400,000 people watched the fireworks display over Victoria Harbour. It added that between midnight and 6:30am, around 25,000 mainland visitors departed Hong Kong via land boundary control points.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some of the tourists RTHK spoke to said they were satisfied with the transport arrangements.
  <br>
  <br>
  Unlike last year when many visitors were left stranded after trains stopped running, one said everything was a lot smoother this time around.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We were stuck here last year... for four to five hours. We also celebrated the New Year [in Hong Kong] last year. It's more convenient this year," she told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another traveller said thanks to the extension of service hours on the East Rail line and the Lo Wu Control Point, he could return to the mainland easily.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If not, I would have to go to Mong Kok to take the overnight bus, so I saved about an hour," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The security chief, who earlier inspected the Lo Wu crossing, said he was pleased that visitors were able to cross the border smoothly and quickly.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked whether MTR lines and control points can further extend their service hours in future, Tang said the authorities have to consider different factors.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's impossible for all border control points to operate overnight. We have to look at the necessity, and how we utilise our resources," he said.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The inaugural flights of the domestically-produced C919 aircraft between Shanghai and Hong Kong have opened a "new chapter" for the SAR as an international aviation hub, transport and logistics chief Mable Chan said on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The first flight that took off from Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport arrived in the SAR shortly before 11am.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a welcoming ceremony at the Hong Kong International Airport, Chan said she feels honoured to witness the historic moment on New Year's Day.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong is the first city beyond the other mainland cities to have this kind of commercial flight. So we are especially happy to see this flight materialise on the first day of 2025," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We hope that through this commercial flight, we can bring this historical innovation breakthrough in the mainland's production of civil aviation aircraft to our Hong Kong citizens, as well as to the international visitors coming to Hong Kong."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan added that the SAR has what it takes to shine as an aviation engineering hub.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong International Airport has rich experience and comprehensive facilities to fully support the maintenance of domestically produced aircraft in Hong Kong and overseas," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Secondly, the Hong Kong International Aviation Academy is an important aviation talent training base in the Asia region. The academy is planning to expand training to cover C919 aircraft, which will help domestically-produced planes enter overseas markets."
  <br>
  <br>
  The transport chief also said the government is looking to further develop the aircraft leasing market by rolling out various tax incentives, to help homegrown aircraft go global.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A domestically-produced C919 aircraft has completed its first commercial flight to Hong Kong amid much fanfare.
 <br>
  <br>
  The homegrown passenger jet, operated by China Eastern airlines and carrying around 160 passengers, took off from Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport at 8.15am on Wednesday and landed in the SAR about two and a half hours later.
  <br>
  <br>
  Passengers were treated to an exceptional travel experience, with each of them receiving a special framed boarding pass – printed with the flight number, date, as well as the letters “C919” - as a souvenir.
  <br>
  <br>
  One of those on-board the full flight was Ryan, who flew on the C919 aircraft for the first time.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I’m also a citizen of Hong Kong. It feels really special. Shanghai is my hometown and Hong Kong is like my second hometown. It’s really special to be able to experience the Chinese manufactured C919 on this flight,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ryan described the flight experience as being “impressively good.”
  <br>
  <br>
  “I am quite fortunate to get the bulkhead seat. It has plenty of leg room which is nice on a narrow-body jet. Looking back, the leg room is also big [for other seats] and the tray table is pretty nice,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  13-year-old Joe, a flying enthusiast, flew solo.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I think the control of noise is very nice. Because it’s the first aircraft of China and in some ways it’s even better than Boeing and Airbus. The seats… are really comfortable,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The meal was really good... We had this sort of Shanghai cake and another cake that had C919 letters on it and it was very delicious.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Other passengers like Gin and his son Harrison, who just happened to be on this maiden flight, said they were impressed with the flight experience.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I thought it would be very loud but the noise wasn’t big at all. The seats were quite spacious,” six-year-old Harrison said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the captain of the inaugural flight, Shang Feng, told RTHK that he's honoured and excited to take passengers to Hong Kong on board the C919.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Hong Kong is our ninth destination with C919. Over the last two years, C919 has been flying to major airports in mainland cities and it fully showcases its ability to adapt and operate smoothly in different locations. I believe future regular flights to Hong Kong will be smooth,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  China Eastern said it will be using the C919 jet for one round-trip flight between Shanghai and Hong Kong per day, with the return trip scheduled for departure at 12.55pm.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Wednesday said the government will focus on reforming and improving people's livelihoods in 2025.
 <br>
  <br>
  Delivering his New Year message through a video, Lee described 2024 as a historical year for Hong Kong, with many good things happening, including the completion of the national security legislation under Article 23 of the Basic Law.
  <br>
  <br>
  He highlighted new momentum for the economy, such as the two giant pandas gifted by the central authorities, the resumption of multi-entry visas for Shenzhen residents, and the commencement of the three-runway system at the Hong Kong International Airport.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee pointed out that his administration also worked on building more flats, came up with a plan to eradicate substandard subdivided units, and set up community living rooms to cater for the needs of the grassroots community.
  <br>
  <br>
  Going forward, the CE said his government has several main goals this year -- reform and embrace changes, strengthen the SAR's connectivity with the mainland and the world; as well as improve people's livelihoods and foster harmony.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Facing drastic changes both in the external and internal environments, Hong Kong must understand, respond to and embrace them, while taking the initiative to align with national development strategies," Lee said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "At the same time, we will strengthen our exchanges and cooperation with the world, open up to new markets, strengthen regional cooperation, and continue to boost our international influence."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee said the Hong Kong Park of the Hetao Co-operation Zone will start operating this year, marking a milestone for the SAR as an international I&T centre.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also noted that 9,500 light public housing units and three more community living rooms will be made available this year, while Hong Kong's first Chinese medicine hospital will commence operation in phases this year.

 Three men died after a taxi collided with a private car in the early hours of Wednesday morning.
 <br>
  <br>
  Shortly before 2 am, both cars were travelling along the West Kowloon Highway towards the Western Harbour Crossing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Near Olympic MTR Station the taxi reportedly swerved into the other vehicle's lane and hit it, causing it to go out of control, ram a concrete divider, and smash into a moving taxi and three stationary vehicles.
  <br>
  <br>
  The car driver was certified dead at the scene, while two of his four male passengers were certified dead at Princess Margaret Hospital about an hour later.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two other car passengers, along with the two in the taxi, were sent to hospital for treatment for a variety of injuries.
  <br>
  <br>
  The taxi driver was arrested on suspicion of dangerous driving causing death.

 Hong Kong welcomed 2025 with a colourful fireworks display over Victoria Harbour as hundreds of thousands around the city celebrated the arrival of the new year.
 <br>
  <br>
  Themed "The Symphony of Happiness", the 12-minute show was in five parts. It kicked off with bright red fireworks, symbolising a fiery passion for life and dreams.
  <br>
  <br>
  The second section used pyrotechnic technology, creating the effect of flowers blooming one after another. This was followed by green and gold fireworks, showing an evergreen tree representing the spirit of strong perseverance, hard work and quiet cultivation.
  <br>
  <br>
  The fourth part was named the "Golden Waterfall". It took the form of golden fireworks cascading down the sky.
  <br>
  <br>
  The final section - "Propitious Clouds" - was making its debut in Hong Kong. It took the form of rainbow-coloured smoke with silver fireworks.

 Crowds of citizens and tourists gathered along Victoria Harbour on Tuesday for the New Year's Eve fireworks display.
 <br>
  <br>
  Crowd control measures were in place with a number of exits at Tsim Sha Tsui and East Tsim Sha Tsui MTR stations temporarily closed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some mainland tourists were excited for the fireworks display. They also found the countdown celebrations in Hong Kong “lively”.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 12-minute show will cover a distance of 1,300 metres from Central to North Point. The fireworks will be launched at different heights and angles by five barges and 16 pontoons, arranged in two rows on the harbour.
  <br>
  <br>
  Service hours at the Lo Wu Control Point will be extended to 2am, while the Shenzhen Bay Control Point will stay open throughout the night, to facilitate tourist flows.

    Safeguarding security among key duties: customs chief

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The new commissioner for customs and excise, Chan Tsz-tat, said on Tuesday that safeguarding national security is among the key areas of work for his team.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chan, 54, was appointed by the State Council in the morning to take over from Louise Ho who is retiring.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said officers are well-trained to be able to detect materials at the border that are suspected of violating security laws, and they can then pass on cases to relevant bodies for follow-up action.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters, he also said targeting the newly popular drug, space oil, is another important focus for officers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are fully aware of this new drug, which has become more popular in the market. So we have stepped up our enforcement on all fronts," Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Up to December 22, we have arrested 12 persons, with seizures which will be able to produce as much as over 70,000 capsules for smoking by electronic devices."
  <br>
  <br>
  The new commissioner also said that so far this year, officers have dealt with some 19,000 cases of illicit cigarette smuggling at the border, nearly double the figure from a year ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  "By intercepting passengers who bring in excessive cigarettes, it's a very effective means to protect government revenue," Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And of course we're currently working against syndicate crimes. We'll put more resources into the detection and investigation of major smuggling syndicates."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said other major areas of work include facilitating trade and convenient border-crossing, as well as cooperation with international customs bodies so the SAR can have a bigger say in international customs affairs.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said he will work on internal team building and has already met seven staff-side unions.
  <br>
  <br>
  The commissioner said he was very honoured to be recommended for the post by Chief Executive John Lee and appointed by Beijing, adding that he cherishes the opportunity to lead the department.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Tourism chief Rosanna Law has stressed that any operator is welcome to take part in a tendering exercise next year for the management of Kai Tak Cruise Terminal, adding that the existing firm would have to bring something new to the table if it wanted to stay on.
 <br>
  <br>
  In announcing the latest blueprint for the industry, officials said they will put managing rights of the terminal up for tender three years before the existing contract expires.
  <br>
  <br>
  They will also review the terms and conditions of the tenancy agreement to make the cruise terminal more attractive and competitive.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If the existing operator wants to join the tendering exercise, we'll review its performance over the years. We'll also look at whether the operator can adapt to the current situation, and offer new insights and suggestions," Law said on an RTHK programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As for who will end up winning the bid, we're keeping an open mind."
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister stressed it would be too late to launch a tender exercise in 2027 being as the current agreement ends in May 2028, saying authorities have to give the new operator sufficient preparation time before taking over.

 The State Council on Tuesday appointed Chan Tsz-tat as the Commissioner of Customs and Excise, replacing Louise Ho.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chan joined the department as an inspector in 1994. He became an assistant commissioner in 2020, and was promoted to deputy commissioner two years later, responsible for the force's management and strategic development.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chief Executive John Lee expressed confidence in Chan's ability to lead Customs.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Mr Chan has served in the Customs and Excise Department for 30 years and has extensive experience in departmental operations. He possesses solid management and leadership skills," he said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee also conveyed his appreciation to Ho for her contributions to the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho, 57, has proceeded on pre-retirement leave.
  <br>
  <br>
  She joined Customs in 1991, and became Hong Kong's first female Customs chief in 2021.

    'C919 can help HK grow into aviation engineering hub'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A mainland aviation specialist says using the domestically-produced C919 aircraft for daily flights in Hong Kong will help the SAR become an aviation engineering hub.
 <br>
  <br>
  China Eastern Airlines is deploying the narrow-body passenger jet on a direct route between Hong Kong and Shanghai, with the first set of flights due to take off on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the past 50 or 60 years, Hong Kong has worked as an [aviation hub], but due to the lack of a local aircraft manufacturer, it is not an aircraft or aviation engineering hub," Jason Li told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted that Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC), the Shanghai-based manufacturer of the C919, was increasing its engineering investment in the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Now, as you can see... COMAC is putting more China-produced C919 into Hong Kong. They are building an engineering team in Hong Kong," said Li.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You can see that aviation [requires] a comprehensive engineering team. There are so many different parts; mechanical, electronic etc. So there will be much more career opportunities for local young people," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the choice of Hong Kong as the C919's first destination outside mainland China shows the city's important role in advancing the national aviation sector.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China is encouraging and letting more enterprises demonstrate their newest technology and the business in Hong Kong," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that Hong Kong's status as an international city meant the C919 would have more exposure to overseas clientele, such as those from Southeast Asia, the United States, and Europe.
  <br>
  <br>
  Li said he expected more C919 jets flying into Hong Kong in the next couple of years.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China Eastern Airlines currently has 10 C919s... I expect that in 2025, when they reach about 15 or 20, there will be an extra pair from Shanghai to Hong Kong," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And for other carriers, for example Air China or China Southern Airlines - if they reach about five or 10 C919s - there will be flights from Beijing to Hong Kong."

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong should urgently address its ageing population as well as issues that come with demographic changes, according to family experts.
 <br>
  <br>
  On the sidelines of the Asian Family Summit 2024, the experts also issued a warning about how declining fertility rates and rising life expectancies would affect the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Rapid ageing is impacting all continents, especially Asia, where longevity has increased dramatically. And that's impacting care systems ... and investments have to be made," said Renata Kaczmarska, a social affairs officer at the United Nations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Demographic changes was one of four "megatrends" that the three-day conference looked at. The others were new technologies, urbanisation and migration, as well as climate change.
  <br>
  <br>
  Patricia Chu, co-chairperson of the summit, said the four were not standalone issues and that Hong Kong had to deal with an ageing society.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[An] ageing population and demographic changes are the top priority... I think the government is aware of this and they are beginning to do more
  <br>
  ... on this front," said Chu, who also chairs the Consortium of Institutes on Family in the Asian Region.
  <br>
  <br>
  "How [to] prepare and help the older generation to make the best use of [information and communication technology] is also another issue, which is integrated with the ageing population," she added.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The government said on Monday that it has lodged an appeal against the High Court’s recent ruling that overturned the government's approval of an environmental study into plans to build public flats on part of the Fanling Golf Course.
 <br>
  <br>
  At the start of the month, the court ruled in favour of the Golf Club and ordered the administration to relaunch a public consultation on the project’s impact on the environment, citing flaws in its environmental impact assessment (EIA) report.
  <br>
  <br>
  Now, both the Environmental Protection Department (EPD) and Civil Engineering and Development Department (CEDD) are appealing against the ruling.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The ruling would have significant systemic impacts on ongoing and future environmental impact assessments, in particular, it may lead to serious delays in development, operation and execution of the development proposals," the EPD said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Development Bureau, for its part, noted that while officials had already secured enough land to meet the housing supply target for the next decade, an appeal is crucial because the ruling has far-reaching implications.
  <br>
  <br>
  “This appeal is not solely for the proposed housing project but, more importantly, for seeking clarifications from the Court of Appeal on important subjects concerning the principles and legal issues of the EIA framework. The government policy is to strike a balance between environmental protection and development for the overall benefit of Hong Kong,” it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government had originally planned to build 12,000 public housing units at the site.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Monday said it wants to nurture and develop tourism by focusing on culture, sports, ecotourism and mega-events, with a view to boost the economy by HK$120 billion and create hundreds of thousands of jobs in five years.
 <br>
  <br>
  In announcing the latest blueprint for the industry, officials said they would promote smart tourism - such as introducing virtual reality elements at tourism attractions - to improve the experience of visitors.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another strategy would be to strengthen the city's appeal in traditional markets like the mainland, while attracting more travellers from the Middle East and Asean countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government also wants to attract more visitors who stay overnight instead of only making day trips to the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  In five years, officials want a near 60 percent rise in the value the tourism sector adds to the economy, from last year’s base, to HK$120 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tourism minister Rosanna Law said there was a need to highlight the unique elements of the SAR, such as emphasising the city’s East-meets-West culture to promote tourism.
  <br>
  <br>
  With Hong Kong’s beautiful shoreline, she said, officials would actively look into developing resort projects in the outlying islands.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We will use our different routes to bring more tourists to our coastal landforms, our ecoparks, and also our beautiful seashore area in Sai Kung, and also on Lamma [Island] and Cheung Chau, all these areas, on Lantau," the minister told a press conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We will explore with other departments, the possibility of developing larger-scale ecotourism facilities such as hotels, spas or other facilities."
  <br>
  <br>
  Law also said the government plans to promote horse-racing and cruise tourism while enriching some of the city's famous urban walking routes.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said in five years' time, the government expects the sector to have created 210,000 jobs, a more than 40 percent rise from last year's figure.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister added that regulators would look into changing the tour guide licensing regime, with a view to attract more new talent to the industry.
  <br>
  <br>
  Currently, guides need to obtain a full licence by passing different tests on areas like ecotourism or history, but officials are now considering offering partial licences to aspiring guides.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I’m pleased to hear that the [Travel Industry Authority] is considering a partial licence, so that people with a specific interest could actually focus on their areas of interest. By then, I hope that we’ll be able to attract and facilitate more people joining the tourism workforce," Law said.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said the government would otherwise import workers to the trade through existing labour schemes.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Medical experts are calling on the public to maintain good hygiene and get flu jabs, after clinics reported a surge in infections.
 <br>
  <br>
  The president of the Hong Kong Medical Association, Cheng Chi-man, said on a RTHK programme on Monday that clinics have seen a significant increase in patients in the last two weeks.
  <br>
  <br>
  University of Hong Kong microbiologist Dr Ho Pak-leung said the SAR may see a more serious flu outbreak if temperatures drop.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Winter in Hong Kong is generally mild. This Lunar New Year in January, the flu outbreak could be less serious as long as the weather isn't that cold and temperatures just fall to between 10 and 15 degrees" he said on a radio programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But if temperatures dip below 10 degrees, the outbreak could happen quickly and it could be more serious than in the past.”

    Govt to shift focus to talent retention: Chris Sun

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Labour and welfare minister Chris Sun says the government will shift its focus from luring talent to retaining talent in the SAR, adding the talent hunt will continue beyond international sports stars.
 <br>
  <br>
  In an exclusive interview with the Wen Wei Po newspaper, Sun also said there are no plans to expand labour importation schemes to cover more sectors other than construction, transport and care homes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Recently, snooker stars Judd Trump and Ronnie O'Sullivan both became Hong Kong residents through the Quality Migrant Admission Scheme.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sun said the fact that international sports stars come to Hong Kong via various talent admission schemes shows how attractive the city is.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They are internationally renowned sports stars and foreigners. They have many choices, but they chose Hong Kong. I believe this is the best way to show the world Hong Kong's appeal. It speaks louder than words," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will continue our talent search, not limited to sports stars. Through our talent schemes, we are searching for some world-class talent."
  <br>
  <br>
  Since late 2022, around 175,000 people have come to Hong Kong through various talent admission schemes, adding around 350,000 to the city's population along with their families.
  <br>
  <br>
  The labour chief added there are no plans to provide housing allowances for imported professionals as the government makes housing a priority for local permanent residents.

    TDC hopes Jakarta trip will boost trade with Indonesia

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Trade Development Council (TDC) says it will lead a delegation to Indonesia next month to try to drum up business with Asean's largest economy.
 <br>
  <br>
  Around 100 people, including senior executives and start-up bosses, will join the trip to Jakarta, visiting companies and taking part in networking events.
  <br>
  <br>
  TDC research director Irina Fan on Monday said Hong Kong is Indonesia's second largest investor, but the country is only the SAR's sixth largest trading partner when it comes to Asean members.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Many of the enterprises that invest in Indonesia through Hong Kong are mainland subsidiaries or branches in the SAR. Their parent company is on the mainland, but they enter the Indonesian market through Hong Kong," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fan said figures from Indonesian officials show the SAR invested a total of US$18.5 billion in over 8,400 projects in the country between 2018 and 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  She added that Indonesia has been participating in the TDC's exhibitions, with products such as clothing, electronics and toys, showing that firms there are very much interested in reaching out to buyers from the mainland and elsewhere.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A driver involved in a fatal crash in Jordan was arrested on suspicion of dangerous driving causing death, police said on Monday, after one person was killed and two other pedestrians were injured when the car he was driving mounted a pavement in Jordan.
 <br>
  <br>
  Officers said they were notified at around 10am of the incident near Luen Tak Building on Jordan Road.
  <br>
  <br>
  The vehicle was reportedly travelling westbound on the road before ploughing into pedestrians.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When approaching the junction of Jordan Road and Shanghai Street, the private car reportedly went out of control and knocked down three pedestrians after running onto the pavement," a police statement read.
  <br>
  <br>
  The three were rushed to Queen Elizabeth Hospital.
  <br>
  <br>
  One of them, an elderly person who was found unconscious, was pronounced dead after sustaining multiple serious injuries.
  <br>
  <br>
  The driver, 42, reported feeling unwell and was sent to Kwong Wah Hospital, officers added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police have classified the crash as a fatal traffic accident.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Transport Department said the accident resulted in a stretch of Jordan Road to be closed to traffic.

    Hong Kong Food Festival sees dip in footfall

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Vendors at the Hong Kong Food Festival have remained conservative on sales with some finding less visitors this year than before.
 <br>
  <br>
  The five-day event ending Sunday began on Christmas Day at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre in Wan Chai.
  <br>
  <br>
  One merchant, surnamed Lok, said the weeks-long Hong Kong Brands and Products Expo in Causeway Bay has pulled away potential customers.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It's obviously because the Brands and Products Expo is being held at Victoria Park at the same time. It opened a day earlier than us. Its admission fee is HK$10, and here, it is HK$30. Admissions are free there after 7pm, but people still need to pay here," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "From the perspective of consumers, I think they will go to the expo and check out local brands."
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite the drop in footfall, vendor Wong said his business saw a 15 to 20 percent jump from last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This year, people are relatively more willing to spend. It's true that there are fewer people than previously, but the purchasing power is stronger," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  A resident, surnamed Mak, said he spent around HK$1,000 at the festival.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I don't normally buy this much. I bought more than usual because of the variety and promotions," he said. “There were less people this year, it was more crowded last year. It could be because some left Hong Kong to spend elsewhere."
  <br>
  <br>
  This year's food festival was held alongside several other shopping events, with around 1,000 booths participating in total.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Security Chris Tang has described the successful enactment of the national security legislation under Article 23 of the Basic Law this year as the most formidable challenge of his career.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a video shared on his social media platform on Sunday, he said he and his team fearlessly hit back at smears and refuted false accusations along the way.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that he managed to put up with a number of physical ailments as he and his colleagues worked on the legislation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I remember the time when I suffered from inflamed eyes due to a lack of sleep. My frozen shoulder and gout also relapsed. However, witnessing all my colleagues tirelessly working day and night, I forgot about these minor inconveniences. At that time, none of us could even keep track of how many takeaway meals we had," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We were driven by a determination to face challenges head-on, so we persevered. Eventually, the legislation was passed unanimously, allowing me to feel truly honoured to have completed this historic mission hand in hand with my comrades. Upholding national security is our mission. Promoting national security and patriotic education is also our duty."
  <br>
  <br>
  Tang also highlighted changes in immigration policies for the SAR this year, such as bringing back multiple-entry visas for Shenzhen residents and introducing mainland travel cards for non-Chinese Hong Kong residents.
  <br>
  <br>
  Looking ahead, the security chief said he and his colleagues will continue to push ahead with various stress tests at Kai Tak Sports Park to ensure the smooth opening of the facility.

 Respiratory health expert David Hui on Sunday called on people to get vaccinated as soon as possible, saying there’s been a rise in influenza cases in the city.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a TV programme, the professor of respiratory medicine at Chinese University said both public hospitals and private clinics have reported an increase in patients with flu symptoms.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hui said he’s expecting the flu season to peak next month, as people wrap up their holidays and return from places which saw outbreaks of H1N1 flu like the mainland, Japan, and Taiwan.
  <br>
  <br>
  The expert reminded high risk groups, including the elderly, children and those who’re overweight, to stay vigilant and get their flu jabs if they haven't already done so.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Labour Department (LD) said it is deeply concerned about a fatal accident at a construction site in Yau Ma Tei, in which a 53-year-old worker was killed on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Officials said the male worker was struck by a falling glass panel while it was being lifted with a set of lifting equipment.
  <br>
  <br>
  It's understood the accident happened at a site above the Hong Kong West Kowloon Station.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We commenced an immediate on-site investigation as soon as we were notified of the accident and issued suspension notices to the contractors concerned, suspending all curtain wall installation work of the construction site, including lifting and handling of glass panels. The contractors cannot resume the work process until the LD is satisfied that measures to abate the relevant risks have been taken," a department spokesperson said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will complete the investigation as soon as possible to identify the cause of the accident, ascertain the liability of the duty holders and recommend improvement measures. We will take actions pursuant to the law if there is any violation of the work safety legislation."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Association for the Rights of Industrial Accident Victims also said on Sunday that it is saddened and very concerned about the accident, and called on the Labour Department to be transparent with its findings.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said it will provide the worker’s family with support and assistance.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan said on Sunday that Hong Kong's economy remains strong and resilient, despite potential market volatility stemming from uncertainties like geopolitics and high interest rates by 2025.
 <br>
  <br>
  Writing in his weekly blog, Chan said Hong Kong's asset market has shown substantial improvement, with the local stock market rising by about 18 percent this year and the Hang Seng Index rebounding to 20,000 points.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Trading volume has also significantly increased, reaching a historical high of over HK$600 billion in a single day in October. This year, the average daily trading volume exceeds HK$132 billion, up more than 25 percent from last year," he wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The initial public offering (IPO) market has also become more active, with fundraising from new listings exceeding HK$80 billion, ranking fourth globally."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said family office businesses are also thriving, with about 2,700 single family offices now operating in the SAR. Additionally, the number of companies from the mainland and overseas in Hong Kong has nearly reached 10,000, including around 4,700 start-ups.
  <br>
  <br>
  The finance chief also pointed out that authorities are actively working to attract more professionals to Hong Kong, having received approximately 410,000 applications through various talent schemes over the past two years, and approving around 260,000 of them.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan acknowledged that the retail and dining sectors continue to face challenges, but he believes that the reintroduction of multiple-entry visas for Shenzhen residents, along with the holiday season, will bring in more visitors and give the industry a much needed boost.
  <br>
  <br>
  Looking ahead to the new year, he stressed that Hong Kong will continue to capitalise on its unique advantages, enhance systematic investment in local innovation and technology, and solidify the SAR's position as an international financial, trade, and shipping hub.

    'Mainland tourists' spending power is normalising'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The chairman of the Quality Tourism Services Association on Saturday reassured the catering and retail sectors that they will still have business as long as they grasp the new consumption habits of mainland tourists.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a television programme, Simon Wong pointed out that the industries should not expect mainland visitors to fork out as much as they used to.
  <br>
  <br>
  He revealed that compared to the peak of pre-Covid times, the spend for each mainland tourist who stays overnight has reduced by HK$3,000 in retail, which is the greatest among all sectors.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong said this might not be due to weaker consumption power among mainlanders.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The catering and retail industries should start to accept that the so-called weakening spending power of tourists from the mainland might only be them normalising their spending," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Maybe we should not fantasise that their spending will be doubled within a short period of time, to be as high as in the past. It might be because their consumption power was particularly strong at that time, and it is only now normalising."
  <br>
  <br>
  While the market will not be booming, he said there will still be business for the catering and retail industries if they recognise such changes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, Wong estimated that businesses have surged up to 20 percent month-on-month during the Christmas holidays.
  <br>
  <br>
  But it has dropped by 10 percent compared to a year ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that the resumption of the multi-entry visa scheme for Shenzhen residents has also boosted the economy.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Invest Hong Kong (InvestHK) said it will expand its overseas network in search for more investment opportunities.
 <br>
  <br>
  Startups in Hong Kong employed about 18-thousand people this year, according to the agency, which was a seven percent growth year-on-year, making a substantial contribution to the labour market.
  <br>
  <br>
  InvestHK's director-general, Alpha Lau, said on Saturday that the government spent a lot of effort in promoting emerging sectors and companies.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The 2024 startup survey shows that we have got a remarkable growth in the total number of startups. Now we have 4,700, up 10 percent from last year," she said in an interview with the Information Services Department.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This year we have seen some new sectors emerging, indicating that the Hong Kong government’s effort to promote industries in this area has now seen a very good result."
  <br>
  <br>
  CEO of a local fintech startup, Ben Wong, said Hong Kong's well-established financial structure was vital for his company's development.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We want to be an international company and Hong Kong provides us with that base on the strategic location. In just a four-hour ride we are able to go into Southeast Asia," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The talent in Hong Kong to me, when it comes to being able to support a financial business, is one of the best in the world. They are highly skilled, and also highly knowledgeable, in helping us grow our business. At the same time, we have been able to also attract international talent."
  <br>
  <br>
  InvestHK said it will particularly focus on countries along the Belt and Road Initiative, and that a new office will be established in Turkey in the first quarter of next year.

    International driving permit kiosks to be launched

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Self-service kiosks where the public can apply for international driving permits will soon be up and running at two locations in Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Transport Department said they can be found at two licensing offices, in Admiralty and Cheung Sha Wan, from January 13, 2025.
  <br>
  <br>
  There will be a daily quota of around 32 applications per kiosk, and  drivers can make reservations from Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The department's CEO of licensing, Chow Wai, said the application process will now be easier for the public with the two kiosks.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They can get their permit within the same day or within an hour after submitting the application. If they use the non-counter means - [applying] online, [via] drop-in box, or by post, usually it would take up to ten working days to send the permit to the applicants," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "One of the benefits of using the kiosk is that they can save waiting time to get the permit."
  <br>
  <br>
  The department said drivers need an iAM Smart+ account, with a digital signing function of a valid personal digital certificate, to use the kiosks.
  <br>
  <br>
  It added that authorities will look into whether more licensing offices can introduce self-service kiosks.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Technology minister Sun Dong said that the business community has a key role to play in Hong Kong's pursuit of becoming an innovation and technology hub.
 <br>
  <br>
  He told an RTHK radio programme on Saturday that I&T is crucial in attaining economic growth.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In terms of the development of the I&T sector, it is without a doubt that the government will play an important leading role, but the government alone is not enough. The whole of society has to participate," Sun said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Therefore, the government's major challenge ahead is how to unite all sectors, particularly business, to boost the development of I&T in the coming five to ten years."
  <br>
  <br>
  He also revealed that the government will roll out land preferential measures to attract businesses to set up production lines in the region.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sun said the Innovation, Technology and Industry Bureau has been conducting talks with relevant organisations, such as the Science Park, and he hopes the policies can be introduced in the near future.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The measures will focus on attracting strategic enterprises to set up factories, production lines as well as actual production facilities and links that can create value to Hong Kong's economic growth," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Of course, apart from providing them land at an attractive price, we will also require these companies to have a certain value of output and return to society within a certain period."
  <br>
  <br>
  Sun also pointed out that the first three buildings of the Hong Kong section of the Hetao Shenzhen-Hong Kong Science and Technology Innovation Cooperation Zone, are expected to be launched next year, adding that leasing arrangements are underway.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tech zone that spans across the Shenzhen River consists of 87-hectare Hong Kong Park, and 300-hectare Shenzhen Park.

 The government said it plans to build some 180,000 flats in two new towns in northern New Territories near the border, under the final stages of the wider Northern Metropolis project.
 <br>
  <br>
  One of the sites is the New Territories North New Town, which covers more than 1,400 hectares and stretches from the Heung Yuen Wai and Man Kam To border points to near Lo Wu.
  <br>
  <br>
  The land area accounts for about one-third of the entire Northern Metropolis.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Development Bureau said on Friday there will be about 170,000 flats in the new town, housing half a million people.
  <br>
  <br>
  About 200 hectares would be considered a priority zone for development, which includes the University Town – an idea that was floated earlier – an enterprise park in Heung Yuen Wai and a commercial and residential zone near the border.
  <br>
  <br>
  Outside the priority area, officials said the plot could house new industries such as advanced construction and manufacturing. There will also be sites earmarked for sports and culture.
  <br>
  <br>
  The other new town is Ma Tso Lung.
  <br>
  <br>
  It's smaller in size, covering about 55 hectares, and could house around 10,000 units.
  <br>
  <br>
  A Development Bureau spokesperson said officials have scaled back the size of the Ma Tso Lung project, so it won't touch on wetland conservation zones or buffer areas.
  <br>
  <br>
  The spokesperson added the plan is to build mostly private flats in both new towns, noting that the government's target of building 300,000 public flats over a decade is met by plots elsewhere.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Excluding New Territories North and Ma Tso Lung, the government has already found land that can build 410,000 public flats," the spokesperson said. "So from this point of view, it seems we shouldn't give public flats priority when developing these two places."
  <br>
  <br>
  Another spokesperson said the two new towns could be attractive for residents who often travel across the border.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials also said the development scheme would result in the eviction of 13 non-indigenous villages, three of which are in Ma Tso Lung.
  <br>
  <br>
  Construction work for the Ma Tso Lung project will begin in 2027 and that of the priority area in the New Territories North New Town is expected to start a year later.
  <br>
  <br>
  The first batch of residents could move in seven years afterwards.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials will launch a two-month public consultation exercise on the preliminary plans in the middle of next month.

 Officials have called on tourists to stay in Hong Kong overnight after the New Year countdown next week.
 <br>
  <br>
  Authorities announced earlier on Friday that service hours at two border crossings will be extended on January 1, with the Shenzhen Bay Control Point operating throughout the early morning hours and the Lo Wu Control Point staying open until 2am, two hours longer than normal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials from the Transport Department said visitors could consider staying in the city after the fireworks display
  <br>
  <br>
  "We encourage mainland tourists to consider staying one more day in Hong Kong after the countdown, so they can fully immerse themselves in the diverse tourism experience in Hong Kong," Principal Transport Officer for the New Territories, Ken Wong, said at a press briefing.
  <br>
  <br>
  There will be a 12-minute fireworks display at Victoria Harbour to usher in 2025.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Acting Superintendent for Kowloon West Traffic, Ho Chun-hin, called on people to use public transport and not to go to the Hung Hom Promenade.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the past, some people would go to the promenade in Hung Hom to watch the fireworks. However, due to ongoing construction work there, it cannot be used as a viewing area this time. We kindly ask members of the public to choose other places," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police also said they will cordon off some roads in Central, Wan Chai, Eastern District and Tsim Sha Tsui in the evening on December 31.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Cantonese opera enthusiasts are making the most of the iconic Sunbeam Theatre before it closes down in March after more than 50 years.
 <br>
  <br>
  The theatre in North Point is to be transformed into a church.
  <br>
  <br>
  Veteran Cantonese opera singer Joyce Koi on Friday described the theatre as her second home and the place where she built her fame in the industry.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said she will enjoy the remaining days performing in the theatre, adding that she hopes to see more theatre spaces open up for shows.
  <br>
  <br>
  A woman surnamed Ngai, 76, said she witnessed the history of Sunbeam Theatre, recalling fond memories of going there with her mother. Ngai said she will try to watch as many shows as she can before the theatre closes on March 3.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's like coming home. I usually come here with my friends and family. It makes me very happy because we watch the performance and then go out for dinner. Sometimes we watch a show in the morning, go to dim sum, then another in the afternoon followed by a dinner with ten to twenty people," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a press conference about her upcoming show, Cantonese opera singer Angel Leung, who will perform during the theatre's final days, said the venue holds many memories.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think most Cantonese opera actors and actresses have a lot of memories here at Sunbeam Theatre because most of us would have been audience members sitting down there at the auditorium, and then gradually we became performers performing on this stage, and we have acted many different roles and characters on this stage, so I think every one of us [will] actually miss this place very much," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As for future plans, although this venue will not be used in the future, it will be used for other religious purposes. However we still have other venues such as the West Kowloon Xiqu Centre and also some other government venues such as Ko Shan Theatre, we will still have a lot of performances there."
  <br>
  <br>
  Leung added that she hopes to see Cantonese opera continue to grow in the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There are many things that we can do, especially focusing on promoting this art form to our next generation and also promoting it to the international audience groups," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think it's actually a very iconic culture in Hong Kong that represents this place because Cantonese opera in Hong Kong has its own style. I think it's really a very good way of promoting this city to foreigners."
  <br>
  <br>
  The theatre will be taken over by the Island Evangelical Community Church, with the sale spanning the ground floor through to the sixth floor, and also the rooftop of Kiu Fai Mansion.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Service hours at two border checkpoints will be extended in the early hours of New Year's Day, the government said on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Shenzhen Bay Control Point, which usually closes at midnight, will stay open throughout the night, while Lo Wu Control Point will stay open an extra two hours longer than normal until 2am.
  <br>
  <br>
  East Rail Line services will be extended, with the last train to Lo Wu leaving Admiralty at 00.56am.
  <br>
  <br>
  Private cars, other than those with permits for the Lok Ma Chau checkpoint, will be able to cross the border via the Shenzhen Bay port, a statement said.
  <br>
  <br>
  An emergency transport coordination centre will operate round-the-clock to monitor traffic conditions and public transport services, and will carry out contingency measures when necessary to meet service demands.
  <br>
  <br>
  A government spokesman thanked mainland authorities for making the special arrangements.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The full support and co-ordination of the leaders and relevant departments of Guangdong Province and Shenzhen Municipality are crucial to the implementation of the special boundary-crossing arrangements, reflecting the effective and close co-operation between Hong Kong and Shenzhen," he said.

    'Multi-entry visa scheme should be expanded'

<div class="itemFullText">
 National People's Congress Standing Committee member Starry Lee on Friday said she hopes the newly restored multi-entry visa scheme for Shenzhen residents can be extended to cover more cities in the Greater Bay Area (GBA).
 <br>
  <br>
  Lee said the SAR saw more mainland visitors over Christmas, which benefited the retail, catering and hospitality sectors.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We believe that with the close monitoring of the implementation, more and more cities in the GBA in particular can have more relaxed visa application procedures so that more people from different cities in the Guangdong area can come to Hong Kong to visit and we can exchange more," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee earlier attended a standing committee meeting in Beijing where she said 10 bills were discussed and some, involving value-added tax, the Supervision Law and the Science and Technology Popularisation Law, were passed.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 14th National People's Congress will open its third annual session in the capital on March 5, and Lee described 2025 as a "critical year", saying Hong Kong should play a more active role in inviting foreign investment and attracting talent.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Friday said the well-being of families is deeply valued by his administration, and that it strives to build a harmonious society for all.
 <br>
  <br>
  Giving the opening address for the Asian Family Summit 2024, the CE underscored the government's commitment to working with different stakeholders to cultivate a pro-family environment.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Our latest initiatives, in partnership with the Family Council, include supporting the community in launching family education projects of an extended scope. We will also organise the Hong Kong Excellence Family Awards next year to promote good family values among the general public,” he said in a video message.
  <br>
  <br>
  “As announced in my Policy Address this October, we will strengthen parental education by setting up new community parents and children centres in different parts of the city.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The chief executive added that the Social Welfare Department’s care teams are also well-trained to identify and reach out to households in need.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee stressed that building a more caring and inclusive society for all families requires the effort of not only the government, but also all sectors of the community.
  <br>
  <br>
  He thanked organisers of the summit for assembling people who are dedicated to the healthy development of families.
  <br>
  <br>
  The summit runs until Sunday, bringing together some 700 participants from professional groups, academia, NGOs and the public to discuss challenges faced by families and review existing policies.

    Airport to expand use of unmanned vehicles

<div class="itemFullText">
 Passengers will be able to ride on the new unmanned shuttle between the Hong Kong port of Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge and 11 SKIES shopping mall at Chek Lap Kok from the end of next year, Airport Authority executive director Steven Yiu said.
 <br>
  <br>
  With the shopping mall located near Terminal 2, the shuttle service is expected to boost travel between the mega bridge and the airport, and facilitate shoppers.
  <br>
  <br>
  The journey between the port and 11 SKIES will only take three minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yiu said 26 vehicles will be put into use in the initial stage and can carry 500 passengers an hour, with the capacity set to double later.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the 16 seaters boast state-of-the-art features.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Every car, we equip with different positioning systems. We have cameras. They are equipped with all the video and analytic functions, so they can detect any abnormality on the road,” Yiu said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The second is GPS. It’s not one GPS. We have four different GPS, supplied by China, the US, Russia and Europe. We have 10 radars to detect all the motions on the road so the vehicles can react.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Yiu also said the authority plans to launch an unmanned vehicle link between the port and Tung Chung in 2028.
  <br>
  <br>
  A fleet of 100 vehicles can carry 5,000 people per hour, and the capacity would be raised to 8,000 later.
  <br>
  <br>
  A designated road will be built in Tung Chung for the unmanned vehicles.
  <br>
  <br>
  The authority also plans to expand the pooling service fleet for airport staff within the airport restricted area by using unmanned vehicles within two years.

  "The move hopefully will allow more SAR residents a chance to step on the C919 and experience the remarkable achievements of the nation's aviation development. International travellers can also know more about the technological advances of China's aviation development," the post read.
  <br>
  <br>
  "By assigning the C919 to a regular route between Hong Kong and Shanghai Hongqiao airports, it reflects the importance of the SAR as a global aviation hub."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said she has already instructed the Civil Aviation Department and the Airport Authority to provide comprehensive assistance, ensure the best experience for passengers and promote the nation's aviation achievements.
  <br>
  <br>
  She earlier met representatives of Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China, or COMAC, and thanked the company for setting up an office in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong can provide assistance on many fronts, including aircraft maintenance, personnel training, as well as leasing and sale of aircraft," Chan wrote.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The SAR government on Thursday expressed its strong disapproval towards the extension of US sanctions under the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, accusing Washington of double standards and political grandstanding.
 <br>
  <br>
  The act was first signed into law in 2019. It was extended for another five years on Monday after US President Joe Biden passed the National Defence Authorisation Act, which includes a wide range of provisions.
  <br>
  <br>
  That means the US government will continue to impose sanctions on mainland and Hong Kong officials involved in the enactment of laws safeguarding national security.
  <br>
  <br>
  The act also demanded an annual review of Hong Kong's political situation and decide whether the SAR should continue to enjoy favourable treatment on trade relations.
  <br>
  <br>
  A Hong Kong government spokesperson said Washington was merely trying to intimidate SAR officials who safeguard national security according to the Hong Kong National Security Law and the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The HKSAR Government strongly condemns its [US government] political grandstanding rife with ill intentions, which have been seen through by all. The HKSAR despises the so-called 'sanctions' and will not be intimidated by such a despicable behaviour," the spokesperson said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The spokesperson reminded the US that it substantial economic interest in Hong Kong, citing a trade surplus of about US$270 billion over the past decade, while nearly 1,400 American companies operate in the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  The spokesperson reiterated that foreign governments and legislatures should not interfere in Hong Kong's internal affairs.

    Greenpeace laments HK's waste reduction progress

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A Greenpeace campaigner on Thursday said Hong Kong saw a drop in the volume of rubbish dumped at landfills last year, but the improvement is marginal and far from satisfactory.
 <br>
  <br>
  According to statistics published by the Environmental Protection Department last week, the city's municipal solid waste dropped by 2.2 percent to 10,111 tonnes per day in 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on an RTHK programme, Leanne Tam said the data showed little progress was made on waste reduction over the past decade.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Looking at the data, the reduction is not significant. Ten years ago, the government set many different waste reduction targets, such as increasing recycling rates to around 50 percent," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Compared to 10 years ago, our current daily municipal solid waste volume remains high at nearly 11,000 tonnes, which really isn't much of a difference."
  <br>
  <br>
  Tam added that while recycling rates increased, the improvement was minimal. She pointed out that the volume of recycled plastics went up by 7,300 tonnes last year, which is equivalent to only three days' worth of plastic waste generated.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The increase in recycling is actually not significant. And in recent years, recycling has cost hundreds of millions in public funds annually for community recycling facilities, but this only resulted in a one percent increase this year. We believe this shows poor cost-effectiveness and efficiency," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The advocate said the focus should shift more towards reducing waste at source rather than just recycling, including implementing reusable tableware systems and encouraging people to bring their own containers through incentives.

    Catering business merry this Christmas

<img alt="" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1785032_1_20241226131102.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A catering representative said business was up 8 percent compared to last year during Christmas, despite residents travelling out of Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  That's partly attributed to the resumption of the multi-entry visa for Shenzhen residents as well as the SAR hosting activities such as a pyrotechnics show across the harbour.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on an RTHK programme on Thursday, Simon Wong, president of the Hong Kong Federation of Restaurants and Related Trades, says the industry has also adopted new promotion tactics to attract tourists.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We see a lot of hotels and different eateries rolling out new ideas, like using the panda theme, putting up panda decorations, and introducing new dishes. These attract mainland tourists to come to Hong Kong to spend Christmas apart from just seeing the show, as the city has a more festive atmosphere than the mainland," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong pointed out that quite a number of mainland tourists stayed in the city for a couple more days, rather than heading home immediately after a day trip.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that hotels offering buffets benefited the most among all eateries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Lau Hak-bun, the chief supervisor of The Kowloon Pearls, Precious Stones, Jade, Gold and Silver Ornament Merchants Association, told the same programme that business in his sector this Christmas was more or less the same as last year's.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The people flow this Christmas was much higher than last year's, more than a 10 percent increase. But this did not help much with our sales. The performance was almost the same as last year," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With the resumption of the multi-entry visa two weeks ago, the number of mainland customers continued to increase, and sales these two days are quite good. We expect a slight increase in business by New Year's Eve," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lau also said he expects gold sales to improve before the Lunar New Year as people tend to buy gold accessories to prepare for the festival, despite the price of gold having increased by around 20 percent compared to early 2024.

    O'Sullivan to move to HK, hails city's snooker scene

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Snooker star Ronnie O'Sullivan, who recently obtained residency in Hong Kong, said he will try to ramp up his form ahead of a major tournament scheduled in Kai Tak in March next year.
 <br>
  <br>
  The seven-time world champion became an SAR resident in October through the Quality Migrant Admission Scheme. Fellow snooker star Judd Trump followed suit earlier this week.
  <br>
  <br>
  O'Sullivan explained what drove the decision during an exclusive interview with RTHK in Macau, where he's headlining an invitational tournament.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I always enjoyed playing in Hong Kong, with a fantastic venue and good promoters," O'Sullivan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Rocket", as he's often referred to, is also looking forward to the World Grand Prix at the Kai Tak Sports Park, the first snooker ranking event in the city in more than three decades.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I need to play some more tournaments to be ready, I think. My aim is to play more tournaments in the new year … I need to maybe make a bit more of an effort," he admitted.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 49-year-old Englishman said he'll consider "year by year" whether to wrap up his professional career.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he already revealed plans to set up a number of snooker clubs around the world, including in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Everybody loves snooker, and everyone loves to watch snooker. Snooker is the hardest out of all the cue sports. It's very popular here in Hong Kong," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think [Hong Kong] needs a good academy, good training centre for young players to come and learn and get good coaching, and help them develop their own game."
  <br>
  <br>
  He also confirmed plans to relocate to the city, and is now looking for an apartment with a view of Victoria Harbour.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked about Trump's decision to follow in his footsteps, O'Sullivan said it was "not out of surprise".
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think it makes sense since [Trump's] girlfriend is from Hong Kong. He likes being here more than the UK, it makes complete sense for him," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked whether he will be open to collaboration, O'Sullivan gave a more reserved answer.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I don't really align myself with other players. I like to be my own boss, do my own thing. I think it's better if we both do our own career, our own stuff away from snooker," O'Sullivan replied.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Wednesday expressed strong dissatisfaction and opposition against slanderous remarks made by Western countries and the United States, following the SAR's decision to cancel the passports of seven national security suspects.
 <br>
  <br>
  Seven suspects wanted here, including former lawmakers Ted Hui and Dennis Kwok, have been stripped of their SAR passports, as announced by the authorities on Tuesday, and six more people living overseas were placed on the national security wanted list.
  <br>
  <br>
  A government spokesman said it was necessary to take measures to strike a "strong blow" to combat and deter the acts of abscondment, and procure their return to face law enforcement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Foreign government officials and politicians, as well as anti-China organisations, deliberately smeared and spread irresponsible remarks on the measures and actions taken by the SAR government in accordance with the law in an attempt to mislead the public," it wrote in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In fact, all specified measures including the cancellation of SAR passports and eligibility for application align with human rights requirements, and quite a number of countries including the United States, the United Kingdom and Canada would also impose such measures on wanted criminals."
  <br>
  <br>
  The spokesman said absconders should not think they could evade criminal liability by absconding from Hong Kong, and that they would be sanctioned by the law ultimately.
  <br>
  <br>
  Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning, also expressed strong dissatisfaction to the remarks at a regular press conference in Beijing on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We strongly disapprove and firmly reject countries which blatantly attack and smear Hong Kong police taking enforcement actions. The mentioned people absconded overseas, have long been engaged in interfering in Hong Kong affairs and supporting anti-China," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They attempted to interfere and undermine Hong Kong's development and social stability, seriously endangering national security and damaging Hong Kong's fundamental interests, crossing the bottom line of the 'One Country, Two Systems' principle."
  <br>
  <br>
  She stressed that Hong Kong matters are purely China's internal affairs, and no external forces should intervene in the matters.

    Annual food festival opens at HKCEC in Wan Chai

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Food Festival kicked off at the Convention and Exhibition Centre in Wan Chai on Wednesday, with mixed feelings on business sentiment among vendors.
 <br>
  <br>
  The event runs until Sunday with over 1,000 booths offering a variety of food and drinks, including wine, bakery goods, local snacks to New Year delicacies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lin Heung Lau, a famous Chinese restaurant located in Central, is one of the vendors. They put up neon signs at their booth and decorated it with their signature menu paper for dim sum.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The restaurant re-opened on April the 1st and we hope to use this chance to promote our business at the food festival. This is our first time participating, and we’re trying to bring dim sum and yum cha culture to the exhibition,” its representative said.
  <br>
  <br>
  One vendor from Taiwan said she wants to promote its handmade ginger and brown sugar tea to the locals, and that sales were looking good on the first day.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said her brand has been kept away from Hong Kong exhibitions for years because of the pandemic.
  <br>
  <br>
  But another vendor said people appeared to be spending less compared to previous years and that most big spenders were locals.
  <br>
  <br>
  A senior couple said they spent HK$3,000 on everyday items, such as canned food, alcohol and rice.
  <br>
  <br>
  The products are a little bit cheaper than outside, but the main thing is to experience the atmosphere and to support the local economy, they said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Entry tickets for the exhibition are priced at HK$30 each. Children aged 3 or below, seniors aged 65 or above, as well as non-local tourists can enjoy free admission.

 Snooker star Judd Trump said he is looking forward to playing in a major tournament at Kai Tak next March as a Hong Kong resident.
 <br>
  <br>
  For the first time in 35 years, the SAR will stage a ranking event as the World Snooker Tour announced earlier that the World Grand Prix will take place at the brand new Kai Tak Sports Park between March 4 and 9, 2025.

  Trump, who just obtained a Hong Kong passport through the Quality Migrant Admission Scheme, was speaking to reporters on Wednesday ahead of a match in Macau.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said he hopes to inspire the younger generation in the city to take up snooker along with local stars Marco Fu and Ng On-yee.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I hope to really inspire the next generation because there are already so many younger players coming through in Hong Kong,” Trump said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Marco Fu is doing such a good job to inspire, and in the women’s game, [we have] On-yee, I really hope that I can promote snooker to everyone in Hong Kong and make it as cool as possible, and get younger kids away from different sports and enjoy snooker,” he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said he is open to promoting the sport in the city along with Ronnie O’Sullivan, who also became a Hong Kong resident two months ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  The snooker star also shared that he loved the vibrant life Hong Kong has to offer.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Hong Kong has a fast-paced lifestyle, everyone is always on the move, and there is also so much to do, as you are so close to everyone and if you drive 15 minutes, you’re already at the beaches, somewhere more relaxing,” Trump said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “For me, it’s perfect for what I do, as sometimes I like to feel the hustle and bustle around everybody, and sometimes I want to get away and do more relaxing stuff,” he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said he lives in the city for at least six months of the year, and that his girlfriend was a major reason why he decided to move to the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  “At the moment, I only spend time in the UK for tournaments and my priority is to be as happy as possible off the table. I’m much happier living in Hong Kong,” he said.

    Hong Kong to tap drone use in healthcare

 Hong Kong has the potential to make use of drones in healthcare and draw experience from the mainland, according to an industry leader.
 <br>
  <br>
  Sources say the Hospital Authority (HA) plans to test drone medication deliveries in rural parts of Hong Kong, like flying drones from Tseung Kwan O Hospital to Po Toi O Chuen, a village about 10 kilometres away, as well as from Northern District Hospital to nearby villages.
  <br>
  <br>
  The HA earlier said they were committed to the government's plan for a low-altitude economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Andy Yeung, chairman of the DNT FPV Drone Association Hong Kong, China, spoke on an RTHK radio programme on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Hong Kong has the potential for development, but in the beginning we might need to rely on existing mainland technology. We can adapt their well-developed system to fit our needs later on,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Each area has different application environments, networks, interference, and regulations. If we take cues from the mainland’s success, like field arrangement, work distribution, and problem-solving in real scenarios, it will make things easier for Hong Kong.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeung said it’s wise to start testing in less populated areas because it’s easier to demonstrate to the public how they work and help ease their worries about safety and privacy.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said that drones weighing between 5 to 10 kilogrammes should be sufficient for delivering medications.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that ionospheric scintillation - which disrupted satellite signals and led to the cancellation of the drone show on October 1 - wouldn’t affect the deliveries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeung explained that a drones performance involves hundreds of drones and any slight deviation could result in collision, but that’s not the case for medication delivery.
  <br>
  <br>
  “When you're up in the air with a drone, a shift of five centimetres to one or two metres usually just results in slower speeds. Also, when planning routes, you would avoid crowded spots and won’t fly between buildings, so minor deviations aren’t a major issue,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the same programme, Sai Kung District Councilor Christine Fong stressed that there’s a real need for drug delivery, noting that many elderly people in Po Toi O Chuen have to tackle a steep road whenever they go out, with the wait time for minibuses sometimes exceeding half an hour.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said the fee for drone delivery should not exceed the HK$65 per prescription charged by HA for its current medication delivery service, and that subsidies should be granted to low income families.

    'Spending pattern shifting in Lan Kwai Fong'

 A bar industry representative on Wednesday said the sector is confident in making a strong showing over the holiday period, with reservations through New Year’s Eve reaching over 80 percent.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on an RTHK programme, the director of the Lan Kwai Fong Association, Anthea Cheung, said business during Christmas Eve was better than last year, and that there's a noticeable change in spending pattern.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Lan Kwai Fong has always been a high-spending area. We still see customers are eager to spend, whether they’re from the mainland, local, or abroad. For example, those who book rooms show strong spending,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “But this year, to appeal to a broader audience, we’ve rolled out more affordable packages, including all-you-can-eat deals, which weren’t common in Central restaurants before. Clearly, customer consumption habits are shifting.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Cheung pointed out that the big spenders remain expats and foreigners, who account for 40 percent of visitors.
  <br>
  <br>
  She also said she noticed more people with suitcases in the area.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It's quite rare to see people travelling with suitcases in Lan Kwai Fong because it’s mainly for catering and entertainment, not shopping,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We didn't interview them, but maybe it's because multi-entry visas for Shenzhen residents have been brought back. Their suitcases weren't too big, so they might have just come for a meal or a drink, to experience the atmosphere without spending a night in Hong Kong.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Cheung added that the industry can't rest on laurels and needs to continue to improve and aim to retain inbound travellers.
