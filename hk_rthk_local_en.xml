<div class="itemFullText">
 Nearly 17,000 runners took part in this year's Hong Kong Streetathon on Sunday, but some unintentionally went further than the standard distance during one of the races.
 <br>
  <br>
  The full marathon around Victoria Harbour kicked off the races early this morning under chilly weather, as temperatures dipped to their lowest so far this winter at 16 degrees Celsius.
  <br>
  <br>
  The day also featured a cross-harbour half marathon and a 10km race from Tseung Kwan O to Kwun Tong.
  <br>
  <br>
  For the first time, local delicacies were dished out to runners as part of what's being dubbed a "Five-senses Marathon".
  <br>
  <br>
  Music and fragrance diffusers also featured along parts of the route.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tiffany, a 10km race participant, said she was delighted there was poon choi, a communal dish of foods served in layers which is often eaten on festive occasions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There was a band performing along the way to cheer us up, and someone gave me a high-five. There was also something to eat – poon choi with mushrooms. That could give runners a boost," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  For Patsy, a runner who's visually impaired, the route this time around was a bit different than last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I wanted to challenge myself and see what I was capable of. The most important thing was that I had a guide who took good care of me and encouraged me," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the 21-kilometre half marathon saw some runners go an extra nine kilometres due to unclear instructions.
  <br>
  <br>
  James, who was among those who ran the additional stretch, said he was unable to see where to go during part of the route.
  <br>
  <br>
  “There were traffic cones and a bunch of staff members. We couldn't see any of the signs at all," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If only one or two runners could not see the signs, then it could be their problem. But when you had more than 10 people go the wrong way, would it be an issue with the organisers?"
  <br>
  <br>
  Organisers said they were looking into the incident to see whether there was human error involved.
  <br>
  <br>
  Almost all of the runners who showed up finished the race, organisers said, with more than 3,000 coming from overseas.
  <br>
  <br>
  Four participants were hospitalised, while 110 others suffered minor injuries.

    Hong Kong corals in healthy condition: AFCD

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) on Sunday said Hong Kong's coral reefs are generally healthy, although bleaching was observed during summer this year.
 <br>
  <br>
  The department, along with the non-profit Reef Check Foundation, conducted its five-month review of local corals from June at 33 sites of ecological importance, which included nine marine parks.
  <br>
  <br>
  It found that coral coverage at the sites ranged from 12.8 percent to 75.1 percent, with the highest coverage recorded at Hoi Ha Wan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eleven sites had more than 50 percent coral coverage, in which five of them were marine parks.
  <br>
  <br>
  The average health index of corals across all sites was 3.95, which is above the general average of three.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the AFCD said large-scale coral bleaching reappeared after it last occurred in 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The department has engaged a group of local coral and marine science experts to consult with and gather their views on conserving corals in Hong Kong, and to explore future directions of relevant research and conservation work, such as identification and enhancement of monitoring for the key environmental factors associated with coral bleaching as well as devising research projects for alleviating the impact of coral bleaching in the local environment," an AFCD spokesman said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said corals which saw the most bleaching were recovering due to the influx of cooler waters from last month.
  <br>
  <br>
  The results also indicated there were no signs destructive fishing practices, but abandoned nets were found at 12 sites.
  <br>
  <br>
  The department said the impact was low and the netting would be removed.

    Officials optimistic about tourism sector this month

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Tourism officials on Sunday expressed optimism the industry would enjoy a merry festive period this year, in part because of the boost by the resumption of the multi-entry permit scheme for Shenzhen residents.
 <br>
  <br>
  The new tourism minister, Rosanna Law, said Saturday saw some 145,000 visitor arrivals from the mainland, nearly 30 percent more than the daily average for November.
  <br>
  <br>
  Law believed this was due to last Sunday's resumption of multi-entry permits for Shenzhen residents, saying various sectors should seize the opportunities brought by these visitors.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have so many tourists coming in so let's work together and show a smile," Law told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We've heard mainland travellers saying in interviews that we are smiling more and that our Mandarin has improved. I hope this will continue. It's important to keep an open mind and think of ways to make good use of business opportunities."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Travel Industry Council, meanwhile, said it expects overall tourist arrivals year-on-year to rise by five to 10 percent this month, citing the visa scheme change and a series of upcoming events.
  <br>
  <br>
  "December is also our peak tourist season, with many winter promotional events organised by the Tourism Board taking place. We are very confident there'll be more visitors this December, compared to previous [years]," the council's chairwoman, Gianna Hsu, told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The launch of the Kai Tak Sports Park, the commencement of the airport's three-runway system, and the official debut of giant pandas, also encourages more tourists to come and see the cityscape of Hong Kong."
  <br>
  <br>
  The council and a number of tourism sector groups called on the industry to reinforce Hong Kong's brand as a hospitable destination.

    People flock to Ocean Park for An An and Ke Ke debut

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Panda enthusiasts gathered at Ocean Park on Sunday to get a sight of An An and Ke Ke, as the two pandas gifted by Beijing made their public debut today.
 <br>
  <br>
  Kamy Yeung, who has been following the news about the animals, told RTHK that it is a great day to give the pandas a big welcome.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I happen to be seeing them eating breakfast in the morning... and it’s quite nice to see them being lively and smiley. It’s nice to see all the enthusiasm from everyone around the world to celebrate the joy at the park,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Singapore tourist Rachel Wang spent around HK$1,100 on panda souvenirs. She said she finds An An adorable.
  <br>
  <br>
  “He’s so active, but having seen the pandas, I think Ke Ke is very demure and very loveable. I’m really excited and I love pandas to start with... actually I want to be a panda as well after seeing them,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Anthony Mezzatesta from the United States said he woke up early just to see the pandas.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I like the girl panda a little bit more, she seemed a little bit more shy, very cute to see her get all nervous seeing a bunch of people. We queued up at around 9am. I was very excited to see the pandas. I woke up at six in the morning ready to go to Ocean Park to see the pandas,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The theme park has implemented dispersion measures, in which around 100 tickets are given out every 15 minutes. Each visitor is only allowed to stay in the area for 10 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Following the debut of An An and Ke Ke, the new panda twins will greet the public in the first quarter next year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Also on Sunday, the new tourism minister, Rosanna Law, said the panda naming competition had allowed the public to participate in a meaningful way.
  <br>
  <br>
  Law said the winner of the competition, which received some 20,000 entries, had given good reasons why the original names should be kept.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister described the names as approachable adding it was good there was no need to change them.

    'No worries over undersubscribed bonds'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The finance chief on Sunday said there is no need for concern after the latest offering of retail infrastructure bonds, totalling HK$20 billion, fell short of its target.
 <br>
  <br>
  Around 128,000 investors signed up for the bonds during the offering period that ended on Friday, with the final issuance size expected to be around HK$17.8 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  On a Commercial Radio programme on Sunday, Financial Secretary Paul Chan said people should not worry about the undersubscription of the latest round of bonds.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Institutional investors have oversubscribed for the bonds by three or four times, so we don't have to worry about the amount raised from bonds this year," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Currently there are many investment options. We can also see that in future, many high-quality companies will come to Hong Kong to list, so the investment market will be vibrant."
  <br>
  <br>
  The government previously told lawmakers that it had doubled its estimated deficit for the current financial year to around HK$100 billion, from its forecast of a little more than HK$48 billion announced in February's budget.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said it might take some time for the government to achieve a fiscal balance, but cautioned the process should not be done too quickly.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We believe it will take several years to achieve a fiscal balance," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We've spoken to credit rating agencies and they agreed that major economies have been experiencing financial deficits during the pandemic. They're against achieving a fiscal balance aggressively and within a short period of time, such as one or two years, by significantly cutting spending. This would not only hurt people's livelihoods, but would also cause the economy to contract, which is counterproductive."
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, the finance chief said on his weekly blog that the government is committed to coordinating different mega events to "achieve maximum synergy".
  <br>
  <br>
  Over the past two weeks, Hong Kong has held a number of fashion and design events.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said designers and entrepreneurs from all over the world that have come to Hong Kong for large-scale international arts and culture galas "highly recognised" the capability of the SAR in curating and coordinating such events.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added these events allowed people in the arts and creative industries to more easily reach out to potential partners.

    Govt mulls rewards for exposing future poor SDUs

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Housing chief Winnie Ho said officials could reward informants who alert authorities to poor quality sub-divided units (SDUs), when the flats are subject to a future regulatory regime.
 <br>
  <br>
  The government is now collecting public views on its proposal to require each SDU to be no less than less than eight square metres in size, or 86 square feet, as well as having features like at least one window and an individual toilet.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials propose that landlords who violate the requirements in future could be subject to a maximum three-year jail term.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho said the reward system might be needed to dig out "hidden" sub-standard flats, but she stressed officials are also gauging public views over the matter.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister said the public has seen the proposed standards and finds them reasonable, and she described the penalty as rather heavy.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We hope that everyone won't have to wait until informant and reward systems - that everyone agrees to follow the new rules, register the flats," she said on a TVB programme that aired on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We'll see how effective the new system is - and we'll see if we need to offer rewards, in addition to the regular reporting system."
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho added that the Rating and Valuation Department has received two complaints so far from sub-divided flat tenants who said they were forced out by landlords because of the proposed regime, and officials will handle different complaints regarding rental issues.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The two giant pandas gifted to Hong Kong by the central government will retain their original names, An An and Ke Ke, which symbolise peace, stability, and endless possibilities for the future of the SAR.
 <br>
  <br>
  The government and Ocean Park organised a naming competition in October for these national treasures, and received over 22,600 suggestions.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a greeting ceremony at Ocean Park on Saturday, it was announced that the judges had selected the suggestion to keep the original names of the five-year-old pandas, as the Chinese pronunciation of "An" and "Ke" together resembles the word "encore," symbolising ongoing good fortune for Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think it is so meaningful. There is more of a sense of belonging by keeping their original names," said a woman surnamed To.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another woman surnamed Li said she fears people might confuse the new An An with the previous panda of the same name, who passed away in 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think it's fine, but some people might think of the old An An. That An An lived in Hong Kong for a very long time, so we were really sad when he passed away. It should be fine to reuse the name because the new panda is used to this name anyway. It should help him adjust a lot easier," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  During his speech at the ceremony, Chief Executive John Lee said he is ecstatic for the pair to officially meet the public on Sunday, adding that the pandas will serve as tourism ambassadors for both the nation and Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This initiative aims to create a panda craze across the city and bring giant pandas to different corners of Hong Kong," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The government will continue to seize the opportunities presented by the giant pandas, actively collaborating with various sectors to organise more related activities and launch locally themed panda products, providing visitors with a unique panda experience and boosting Hong Kong's tourism and retail industries."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee also said that the giant pandas exemplify the nation's successful conservation efforts, and he affirmed that the SAR is dedicated to collaborating with experts from the mainland to advance panda conservation initiatives.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The government will work with Ocean Park to advance panda conservation and outreach efforts. Various educational activities will be organised to allow more friends from both local and international communities to learn about the achievements and strengths of the nation and Hong Kong in conservation, reversing the trends of species extinction, and promoting biodiversity," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee added that Hong Kong is home to the largest number of giant pandas outside the mainland, with a total of six, including also Ying Ying, Le Le and their newborn twins.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, many people also gathered in Tsim Sha Tsui to take photos with the 2,500 giant panda sculptures in the first stop of the "Panda Go! Fest HK" exhibition.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 New transport chief Mable Chan said on Saturday that further fee reductions at the Tai Lam Tunnel are not possible, as additional vehicle flow will lead to congestion during peak hours.
 <br>
  <br>
  Writing on her blog, she said the bureau is actively improving transport facilities that connect to the tunnel, to ensure the takeover can be executed smoothly.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government announced on Thursday it plans to charge time-varying tolls for the Tai Lam Tunnel after it takes control of the infrastructure in the New Territories on May 31 next year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Instead of the present fixed toll of HK$58, private vehicles would pay HK$45 during peak hours, HK$30 during normal hours, and HK$18 during non-peak hours.
  <br>
  <br>
  As for commercial vehicles – tolls are down from current level of between HK$64 and HK$79 to HK$43 throughout the day.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said the time-varying tolls, in which vehicles will pay different fees according to "peak", "normal" and "non-peak" hours, mean the fees for all vehicle types will be largely reduced, with "non-peak" hour fees set at the lowest possible price.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Road pricing is an important transport management measure to regulate vehicular flow. Tai Lam Tunnel, including its control areas, is 10 kilometres long, which is the length of five Tsing Ma Bridges. The maintenance cost is not low," she wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Tunnels are an important asset of the government. We have to abide by our strict fiscal discipline, and uphold the users pay principle," she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said the plans will help the tunnel reach its full capacity.

    Pokémon Go trainers embark on city safari in HK

<div class="itemFullText">
 Pokémon enthusiasts from around the world are in Hong Kong for the city's inaugural "Pokémon Go City Safari" event, where the popular mobile app will take users to landmarks and historic places in the SAR.
 <br>
  <br>
  Niantic, the game's creators, said the two-day event that started on Saturday is meant to immerse both locals and tourists in the city's rich culture and architecture, while enjoying the augmented reality game.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lisa Broadwell, from Sweden, has been playing the game since 2019, and she said these events are ideal for those who enjoy discovering new cities in unique and innovative ways.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I like the walk and catch aspect of Pokémon Go so this event seemed perfect to able to walk around, see things and just be walking and catching and seeing the sites as I go along. It fits my style of playing," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're still a bit jet-lagged. We came from America, came from Las Vegas. It was a 15 and a half hours flight, so we're still trying to get our bearings of where we are or what we are doing," said Jim Haughey, who often travels for these events.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elaine Hui, director of APAC regional marketing at Niantic, said Hong Kong's unique qualities made it stand out when they were selecting a venue.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We need to find a city that is really easy to travel, and I think Hong Kong has that quality. On the other hand, we want to have something special for this city, and Hong Kong has that quality, too," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They have East and West. They have very new, tall buildings, very iconic buildings, but they also have neighbourhoods, which are a little bit older, but with a lot of history. That's why we think Hong Kong is a good place."

    Subdivided tenants' rights protected by law: minister

<img alt="Housing minister Winnie Ho stressed that the basic housing unit policy is not yet finalised. Photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1782497_1_20241207130131.jpg&q=40">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Housing minister Winnie Ho said on Saturday the Rating and Valuation Department has received two complaints of landlords forcing tenants of subdivided units to move out so they can be renovated to meet government requirements.
 <br>
  <br>
  In his policy address in October, Chief Executive John Lee outlined plans to replace substandard subdivided units with so-called "basic housing units". These must be no less than 8 square metres, or 86 square feet, and have an individual toilet and at least one window.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on an RTHK programme, Ho said tenants' rights are protected under the law.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Tenant's security of tenure is protected. The tenancy contract is regulated for two years plus an additional two years. If water and electricity bills are separate, landlords are not allowed to overcharge for them. The tenant's fees for these services cannot be higher than the service charges that the landlord pays to water and electricity companies," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho stressed that the basic housing unit policy is still under consultation, and further adjustments may be made before the bill is tabled at the Legislative Council.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, Ho said the decision to have the South Island Line (West) adopt the smart transit system cut six years from the construction time, allowing the government to advance the redevelopment of Wah Fu public housing estate.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government announced on Friday that the estate's last remaining residents now have to leave by 2034/35, six years ahead of schedule.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Yesterday the transport chief announced that the railway will use the Smart and Green Mass Transit System, rather than an underground heavy rail system. The green system, which runs above ground, will save almost six years," Ho said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We originally set aside land in the estate for an underground station... and could only move residents after the station was built. But now that land is freed up, and we can put up buildings immediately, speeding up the redevelopment," she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government announcement also laid out clearance and rehousing arrangements for the first phase of the redevelopment of Choi Hung Estate. Residents of Pik Hoi House, Kam Pik House and Tan Fung House will need to move out before April 2029.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho said redevelopment decisions are made according to the condition of the estate and its urgency.
  <br>
  <br>
  She added that the government is yet to discuss building heights, plot ratios and road networks of the redeveloped Choi Hung estate.

    Stress tests to tweak Kai Tak transport links

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The SAR's new transport minister vowed on Saturday to ensure that the new Kai Tak Sports Park's transport links is capable of meeting every possible eventuality.
 <br>
  <br>
  The arena and sports ground will host a stress test involving 12,000 people on Sunday as the bureau assesses the facility's readiness for large events.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters after attending a radio programme, Mable Chan, who took office on Thursday, said the tests are intended to ensure that the preparation work at the park is completed.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Apart from us, the various transport operators including the MTR, buses, and taxis will be involved. We hope that through the various stress tests, we will step up our mobilisation, our preparation, and make ourselves better prepared for different scenarios," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So when the sports park is commissioned, we will have a better and holistic preparation to cater for different scenarios, and give our best to make this (a) success and give the best service to locals and visitors," she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Chan said the bureau will adopt a two-pronged approach to meet the public's expectations.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said it would adopt new technologies and would also strive to have an innovative mindset.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said the contractor for the Northern Link project will be finalised next year - depending on the final arrangements and designs.
  <br>
  <br>
  As for the "smart and green" mass transit system to be used in Kai Tak and East Kowloon, Chan said the bureau had received more than 30 expressions of interest from local, mainland and overseas companies.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said the government will hold a tender next year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan stressed that the new system can serve as a medium capacity transport linking the public with conventional rail systems, even though it won't have the passenger capacity of traditional heavy networks.
  <br>
  <br>
  She also said the government will monitor fare levels for the new systems.

    Aberdeen blaze put out after almost five hours

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The No. 3 alarm fire in Aberdeen was put out at 8.55pm on Friday, almost five hours after it started.
 <br>
  <br>
  Officials said the blaze broke out at a shipyard on Shum Wan Road at 4.11pm, and was upgraded to a No. 3 alarm around 30 minutes later.
  <br>
  <br>
  Firefighters pointed out that because many of the vessels under repair at the shipyard were fibreglass boats, that exacerbated the spread of the fire.
  <br>
  <br>
  They added that the sheer size of the shipyard also made it difficult to bring the fire under control.
  <br>
  <br>
  Over 220 firefighters and rescue workers were brought in to fight the blaze.
  <br>
  <br>
  Four fire boat monitors, four jets and breathing apparatus teams were also deployed.
  <br>
  <br>
  61 people had to be evacuated, but no injuries were reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  A woman surnamed Lau, who owns a shipyard in the area, said she suffered major losses as a result of the fire.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Of course I am very sad. How would you feel if you lost everything in less than an hour? How would you feel?"
  <br>
  <br>
  A man surnamed Cheung, whose shipyard was unscathed, said the situation could’ve been worse if the fire broke out at night.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The only positive thing is that the fire broke out in the afternoon. If it had been now, at night… this place wouldn't be saved in time," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "At night time, everybody would have left the shipyard, and it would be too late to call the police."
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials said they're still probing the cause of the fire.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Customs officers on Friday issued a warning about a stress-relieving toy that comes with a syringe, urging shops to remove the item from their shelves immediately.
 <br>
  <br>
  Officers said the toy could hurt children and parents should stop their kids from playing with it right away.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, authorities said they inspected toy shops across Hong Kong after receiving a complaint, but have not found anything so far.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Customs will continue to closely monitor the market situation and step up patrols. If found, the department will take resolute enforcement action," the statement read.
  <br>
  <br>
  A video circulating online shows a person using a syringe to inflate a mini baby doll, creating a bubble effect.

 The Chief Executive has appointed Kennedy Wong as the chairman of the Council of the Baptist University (HKBU), and Michael Ngai as the head of the City University (CityU) Council.

  <br>
  <br>
  "The new appointees are all prominent leaders in society. They have been dedicated to serving the community in different fields over the years. They possess outstanding capabilities and rich experience, and have made remarkable contributions to Hong Kong's education sector."

  The fire broke out at a shipyard on Shum Wan Road at around 4.10pm, and was upgraded to a No 3 alarm half an hour later.
  <br>
  <br>
  At least three jets as well as two breathing apparatus teams were deployed to the scene.
  <br>
  <br>
  Videos circulating online showed large plumes of thick smoke billowing into the sky.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Members of the public who are being affected by the smoke and an unusual odour carried by the wind are advised to close their doors and windows and stay calm," the Fire Services Department said.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The High Court on Friday rejected a bid by an inmate jailed for inciting secession to challenge the authorities' decision denying him early release under the city's homegrown national security law.
 <br>
  <br>
  Ma Chun-man, also known as “Captain America 2.0” for dressing up as the comic book character at anti-government protests in 2019, was jailed for five years for promoting “Hong Kong independence”.
  <br>
  <br>
  After serving two-thirds of his sentence in March, Ma was denied an early release normally granted for good behaviour in prison, in line with the provisions of Article 23 national security legislation.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Commissioner of Correctional Services made the decision two days after the new security law took effect, saying he was "not satisfied that an early release of the prisoner will not be contrary to the interests of national security".
  <br>
  <br>
  Ma filed a judicial review, arguing it was unfair and that the commissioner should have taken into account his “legitimate expectation” for early release.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a written judgement handed down on Friday, judge Alex Lee ruled that the commissioner's decision was a "holistic, predictive and evaluative exercise based on a consideration of all the relevant factors".
  <br>
  <br>
  Ma also failed to explain how his "legitimate expectation" of an early release would affect the national security assessment, the judge added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I am unable to see how the fact that a prisoner based on the past practice of the CSD [Correctional Services Department] has a 'legitimate expectation' for early release may either increase or reduce the national security risk that might arise from his or her early release," Lee wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ruling means Ma will need to serve his full term until November next year.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The last remaining residents of the Wah Fu public housing estate in Pok Fu Lam that is set to be redeveloped will have to leave their homes several years earlier than envisaged, with officials planning to bring forward the third and final clearance and rehousing phase of the project.
 <br>
  <br>
  Tenants of Wah Chui House and Wah King House were originally expected to have vacated their homes by 2040/41, but the new plan announced on Friday is for these units to be empty by 2034/35.
  <br>
  <br>
  The residents involved will be able to move into the first buildings finished at the new Wah Fu Estate, Housing Authority officials said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The first clearance phase, involving five other blocks, is still set to take place between 2026 and 2030 at the latest and the second phase, covering 11 blocks, is to be carried out by 2030/31.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials said they can bring the third phase forward thanks to the government’s decision to use a "smart and green mass transit system" for the future South Island Line (West), instead of the heavy rail project originally planned. This change will allow sites at the estate to be freed up sooner.
  <br>
  <br>
  The estate, next to Waterfall Bay, was built in 1967 and the 18 blocks are home to some 9,000 households.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, officials also announced clearance and rehousing arrangements for the first phase of the redevelopment of Choi Hung Estate.
  <br>
  <br>
  They said residents of Pik Hoi House, Kam Pik House and Tan Fung House will need to move out before April 2029.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elderly tenants affected can apply to live in blocks scheduled for redevelopment in the second or third phase of the project, officials said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Choi Hung Estate, with its 11 blocks, was built in the 1960s. It is home to about 17,500 people.

    More subsidised dental services on the way
   </title>

<img alt="" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1782399_1_20241206163049.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Friday said it will roll out a series of projects to help people access dental services, with a focus on those most in need.
 <br>
  <br>
  This came after the Working Group on Oral Health and Dental Care suggested in a report that the administration should strengthen dental care for grassroots residents.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under the Primary Dental Co-care Pilot Scheme to be implemented in the first quarter of next year, the government will provide a subsidy of HK$200 for those aged 13 to 17 to access services such as teeth assessment and scaling in the private sector.
  <br>
  <br>
  Clinics can set their own fees, but these must be transparent. Around 370,000 teenagers are predicted to benefit from the scheme each year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, from the second quarter of next year, people with financial difficulties can enrol in the Community Dental Support Programme to get subsidised services such as check-ups, fillings, tooth extraction and painkillers from non-profit organisations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Those who do not have to pay for medical expenses will be fully subsidised by the government.
  <br>
  <br>
  Patients approved by the Hospital Authority to have their medical fees partly waived, living allowance recipients aged 65 to 74, and people with a referral from social workers will only have to pay around 10 percent of the fees involved.
  <br>
  <br>
  At least 40,000 quotas will be available under the scheme.
  <br>
  <br>
  Deputy Secretary for Health Eddie Lee said the government is working with NGOs to enable more underprivileged people to see a dentist.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have rounds of meetings with all relevant NGOs in Hong Kong, and most of them express very keen interest in collaborating with the government, but at the same time they do express some constraints such as manpower," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Upon knowing that we are going to have more supply of dental health professionals, they [NGOs] are more ready and feel more comfortable to work with us."
  <br>
  <br>
  An online queuing system for general public sessions at Department of Health dental clinics will also be available from December 30.

    Giant red ball popping up across Hong Kong

<div class="itemFullText">
 A huge bright red ball is popping up in various places in Hong Kong from Friday until next Sunday as part of "the world’s longest-running street artwork".
 <br>
  <br>
  Since its debut in 2001, the enormous sphere has criss-crossed the globe, visiting cities including Paris, Chicago, London and Tokyo.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong marks its 48th stop and it will make appearances at 10 spots across the SAR, starting with the Central Piers and ending on The Peak.
  <br>
  <br>
  It has already drawn curious spectators for selfies, but Anna preferred to sketch it.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's just a one-off opportunity to come and draw it. I draw, I sketch all across Hong Kong, so I love to capture scenes in Hong Kong and this is just a rare opportunity to do something different. It's only here today," she told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's always interesting. I think any art project anywhere is interesting and it's always good to support the arts and you want more to come here."
  <br>
  <br>
  American artist Kurt Perschke, the creator of the RedBall project, said he was happy to have the art work showcased in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The project has been in Europe, in the US, all over in Sydney. I think one of the things that I've been excited about to bring it to Hong Kong is to see how the Hong Kong people respond to the piece and to see how we can explore and have fun with the city of Hong Kong, which is such a dynamic and amazing city. I've wanted to bring it here for a long time," he said.

    'New HK Island transit line could be 40pc cheaper'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Transport and Logistics Mable Chan on Friday said construction cost for the South Island Line (West) is expected to be 40 percent less than first thought.
 <br>
  <br>
  Rather than a heavy rail system proposed earlier, officials said they plan to build a "smart and green" mass transit system using viaducts, along with a tunnel through the hilly terrain between Queen Mary Hospital and the University of Hong Kong, according to a paper submitted to Legco earlier this week.
  <br>
  <br>
  The proposed transit line will span about 7.5 kilometres and link HKU and Wong Chuk Hang MTR stations. Officials hope to start the planning and design process next year, with construction set to begin in 2027.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a Legco subcommittee meeting, lawmakers generally expressed support for the project, saying it has been a longstanding priority for Southern District residents.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said the government opted for the smart and green model after taking into consideration issues such as technical capabilities and financing.
  <br>
  <br>
  The transport minister said the new plan could be much cheaper than the original one.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the potential visual impact and noise issues for residents, Chan said authorities would seek residents' feedback before construction work begins.
  <br>
  <br>
  “As far as visual impact and noise are concerned, if we are using the smart and green mass transit system with rubber wheels, the noise levels generated will be less than for heavy rail systems, and it will take up less space,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Principal Government Engineer Eddie Leung said he believes the new transit line will be able to cater to the needs of Southern District.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials have said it will serve 130,000 residents and 50,000 people working there.
  <br>
  <br>
  As for a new mass transit system for Kai Tak, Chan said the objective is to award the contract in 2026 and have it completed within three years after construction starts.

    Tourists satisfied with cruise terminal transport

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Asia's largest cruise ship, the Spectrum of the Seas, docked at Kai Tak Cruise Terminal on Friday morning, with passengers saying they were satisfied with the onward transport arrangements.
 <br>
  <br>
  The ship, which had departed from Shanghai, was carrying about 5,000 passengers.
  <br>
  <br>
  The authorities strengthened transport services at the terminal, which included additional bus routes and shuttle services to various MTR stations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two passengers from Germany said they were satisfied with the arrangements.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It's very organised here and everybody can help you,” they told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We stay two days in Hong Kong and then we fly home. It's a short stay. We bookmarked on the Victoria Peak or so, and then SoHo.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Staff were seen giving out LPG coupons to taxi drivers who picked up passengers at the terminal.
  <br>
  <br>
  There was a short queue at the taxi stop, but a traveller from Australia said this wasn’t a problem.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It's okay so far. It’s been quite smooth. We're staying at the Disneyland Resort, so there'll be quite a bit of time spent there. Our daughter and grandson will be meeting us,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  But a British tourist said she did not know that most taxis only accept cash for payment.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We’re going to take a taxi to the train station, and it’s got to be Hong Kong dollars… doesn’t say that anywhere, and there’s no ATM to get money, so it’s not really good at all,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officiating at a welcoming ceremony for the cruise ship, Deputy Financial Secretary Michael Wong said the authorities wanted the transport arrangements to be as smooth as possible.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This morning, these arrangements have proven to be rather effective. So well done. I'm so happy, and my thanks to everyone who contributed to us making this possible. Of course, we will continue to monitor the situation and fine-tune and improve those arrangements as we move along," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong added that he expects Hong Kong to attract more tourists in 2025 with different policies, including the resumption of the multi-entry visa scheme for Shenzhen residents.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Benjamin Bouldin, president of Royal Caribbean China, said sailing from Hong Kong allows cruises to have a diverse pool of tourists.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong has always been a gateway for international travel and it's great to be able to get it back to that place. We know we get a slightly different guest mix from Hong Kong and that's one we're looking forward to reuniting with this winter," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ship is scheduled to depart for Japan on Friday afternoon.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong will be the vessel's seasonal home port, and the cruise line is expected to double its home port sailings to 10 next year.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Nearly 200 people were led to safety after the Hong Kong Observation Wheel at the Central Harbourfront malfunctioned on Thursday afternoon, with the ride remaining stationary for 40 minutes.
 <br>
  <br>
  Police and firefighters were called to the scene just after 5pm, after receiving calls for assistance.
  <br>
  <br>
  The wheel's operator revealed the attraction had experienced a technical failure in its "secondary system", which triggered a temporary stoppage as part of safety procedures.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, the company said operation resumed at 5.30pm, and all 190 passengers disembarked safely 15 minutes later.
  <br>
  <br>
  The attraction was shut down for the rest of Thursday evening to facilitate safety checks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some tourists were left disappointed, including Meizi and John from the Philippines.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're kind of disappointed ... we're upset because we actually just [came] here to experience. Now it's closed, we're not sure why. We'll go somewhere else, I think," they said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Development Bureau, meanwhile, has requested an investigation report from the operator as soon as possible.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bureau noted the operator has maintained a solid record in running the attraction over the years, and was confident it can learn from the experience and avoid a repeat of the incident.
  <br>
  <br>
  The existing operator, the Entertainment Corporation Limited, was awarded a tender in June to manage the wheel until 2029.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The authorities will hold their first test event at the Kai Tak Arena within the sports park on Saturday, with two basketball games in the afternoon.
 <br>
  <br>
  Gates will open for the 2,000 spectators from 1.30pm, with the games tipping off at 3pm and 5pm.
  <br>
  <br>
  Spectators are advised to use the MTR to get there. No tickets will be sold at the venue.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sports Commissioner George Tsoi said officials will set up six to eight security check counters for the drill.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Long umbrellas and food and beverages, including empty bottles, are not allowed. If you do not have a bag, you can [go through] a dedicated corridor to speed up the security checking," he told reporters on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tsoi added that the arena will host a concert on December 20 and test events for the 50,000-seater Kai Tak Stadium will begin next month.
  <br>
  <br>
  The park's director, Tang King-shing, said the arena is an international-level multi-purpose venue with 10,000 seats.
  <br>
  <br>
  When there are no special events, he said, the arena will be open to the public, noting that it can house up to 40 badminton courts at one time.
  <br>
  <br>
  There will be another stress test for the arena and the youth sports ground next to it on Sunday afternoon, involving 12,000 participants.
  <br>
  <br>
  The authorities said those taking part will include Kai Tak residents, youth uniformed group members and civil servants.
  <br>
  <br>
  As part of the drill, officials will arrange dozens of buses and taxis to take participants to a drop-off area at Sung Wong Toi MTR Station.
  <br>
  <br>
  There will also be a fire drill at the youth sports ground.

    New appointments will improve governance: Lau Siu-kai

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A senior member of a leading national think tank on Thursday said he thinks the reshuffle of the SAR cabinet will serve as a stimulus for better governance.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lau Siu-kai, a consultant to the Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macau Studies, told RTHK that he's not surprised by the new appointments.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Under the principal officials' accountability system, it is quite normal for the chief executive to replace ministers from time to time so that he can get his job done better, get his government more popular, and to be seen as accountable to the public," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The replacements will also push existing officials to do a better job to "avoid being replaced by new ministers" and to improve overall government performance, Lau added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I would say the public... expect them to do a much better job than their predecessors, given their two predecessors have done something which has been quite controversial before. The new ministers should be able to elicit new expectations from the public or the government."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lau said the new culture and transport chiefs are expected to outperform their predecessors, and ensure smooth sailing of important projects like the Kai Tak Sports Park and next year's National Games.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the next couple of years, the chief executive must be very concerned that the Kai Tak Sports Park and the national sports event will be held very successfully, and no mistake will be committed.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If that is the case, it is not surprising that he is going to replace two officials. He will be more comfortable with the new ministers and be confident that they can get the job done and to enhance the popularity and the authority of the government."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lau added that he thinks the two new ministers are hardworking and willing to face the media, and will work closely with professionals in their bureaus.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Newly appointed Secretary for Transport and Logistics Mable Chan on Thursday said she was confident she could bring impetus to the bureau and lead her team to push forward various transport policies and plans.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chan replaces Lam Sai-hung who vacated his position in the first cabinet reshuffle of Chief Executive John Lee.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters, Chan said the government was working on different railway projects, including the Tung Chung Line Extension, Tuen Mun South Extension and the Northern Link.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Transport and railway development is pivotal to the economic development of Hong Kong. We have promulgated a transport and traffic blueprint which lists out a number of railway and road projects," Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the coming years, I will be leading my bureau in taking forward, steadfastly, in order to make sure that these projects are implemented and constructed on time, within budget."
  <br>
  <br>
  She added that with the implementation of the three-runway system, the government would continue to work on raising Hong Kong's status as an international aviation hub.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked about bus fare hikes, Chan said authorities must consider what the public could afford, but pointed out the importance of bus operators having a stable financial situation, in order to ensure their quality of services.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan had previously served as the commissioner for transport, before becoming the permanent secretary for transport and logistics in 2020.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Newly appointed Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism Rosanna Law on Thursday said her bureau will be well prepared for the official opening of Kai Tak Sports Park and for the 15th National Games next year.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Opportunities are everywhere. And so my priority would be to learn the latest development of my bureau's work and then to meet old friends, make new friends, have candid, useful, constructive discussions with all stakeholders, with a view of bringing culture, sports and tourism to new heights," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meeting reporters for the first time after stepping into her new role, Law said she is confident in her new position, saying her experience in various bureaus has helped her learn fast and adapt to changes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Well, no one knows everything. I have been an administrative officer and what is unique for this job is that every few years I change to a new field, I take up a new post. But as always, we do our best in getting our hands on a job as quickly as possible," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I remember about 16 months ago, I was deployed to the Housing Bureau. Although I did not have any experience in housing, I became the director of housing and I just learned what I had to do as quickly as possible. And I'm sure that my colleagues will continue to give me the best support they can."
  <br>
  <br>
  Law said she would not comment on the work of her predecessor, Kevin Yeung, saying her colleagues have been making an all-out effort and working tirelessly.
  <br>
  <br>
  She joined the government in 1989 and had held various positions, including deputy commissioner for tourism, deputy secretary for constitutional and mainland affairs and commissioner for transport, before becoming permanent secretary for housing and director of housing last year.

<div class="itemFullText">
 New People's Party lawmaker Regina Ip said it's an appropriate time for the government to appoint two "young and energetic" ministers, saying the bureaus they head serve important roles.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a reshuffle announced by the government on Thursday, Mable Chan, formerly the Permanent Secretary for Transport and Logistics, is succeeding Lam Sai-hung as transport minister, and Director of Housing Rosanna Law has replaced Kevin Yeung as Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ip said both the Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau and the Transport and Logistics Bureau have a lot of work ahead.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Tourism promotion is a priority for this administration. Moreover, we are launching the Kai Tak sports complex, we will be hosting the National Games, and the blueprint for tourism, recreation and sport has just been unveiled. So there's a lot of work to be done," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The same with the Transport and Logistics Bureau. We are launching the third runway, we need to strengthen and broaden our aviation network and set up a new maritime services and harbour development board."
  <br>
  <br>
  The DAB also welcomed the appointment of the two new ministers, hoping that they will strive to make breakthroughs in their respective policy portfolios.
  <br>
  <br>
  Roundtable lawmaker Michael Tien said he has high expectations for Law, saying she has demonstrated her vision for the future while working as the commissioner for transport and director of housing in the past.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If you look at the Cross-Harbour Tunnel today, it's basically an exercise from bottom-up. They ran years and years of modelling, looked at all the possible scenarios and then came up with something and that's it. It turned out quite well.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Her stint at the Housing Department... there was a lot of abuse of public housing privileges, and she responded very aggressively to our Roundtable demand to clamp down on the abuse."
  <br>
  <br>
  The lawmaker representing the sports and culture sector, Kenneth Fok, said he is looking forward to working with Law, saying that the government has been highly concerned about sports and cultural development.

    New tolls to drive Tai Lam Tunnel capacity: official
   </title>

<img alt="Leung Sai-ho says Tai Lam Tunnel is heavily used by truck and van drivers. File photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1782188_1_20241205104029.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Plans to impose time-varying tolls at Tai Lam Tunnel could help it reach full capacity, an official said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on an RTHK programme, the Transport Department’s Assistant Commissioner Leung Sai-ho noted that if the tolls for the tunnel connecting Ting Kau and Yuen Long stay at their current levels, there would still be about 15 percent capacity untapped by 2026.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said authorities hope the adjusted tolls would attract drivers to use the tunnel and help disperse traffic flow on alternative routes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We were thinking about how we might utilise remaining capacity and help spread traffic for different routes. People may be familiar with Tuen Mun Road and Tolo Highway. If we adjust the tolls, we hope to attract more drivers to use the Tai Lam Tunnel, which is the most crucial factor in our consideration," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The proposed changes will include three tiers of charges for “peak”, “normal” and “non-peak” hours, similar to the system used for the cross-harbour tunnels.
  <br>
  <br>
  Instead of the present fixed toll of HK$58, private vehicles would pay HK$45 during peak hours, HK$30 during normal hours, and HK$18 during non-peak hours.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked whether there was room to further lower the charges during peak hours, Leung said authorities had been very careful in setting toll levels, warning that if tolls are lowered again congestion may occur.
  <br>
  <br>
  The official also mentioned that the fall in tolls for commercial vehicles - down from current level of between HK$64 and HK$79 to HK$43 throughout the day - is quite high.
  <br>
  <br>
  He stressed that data shows that Tai Lam Tunnel is heavily used by vans and trucks, indicating that the logistics industry relies on it to travel between the northwestern New Territories and urban areas.

    CE replaces Lam Sai-hung, Kevin Yeung as ministers

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Thursday made his first cabinet reshuffle at the mid-point of his five-year term, replacing transport minister Lam Sai-hung and tourism chief Kevin Yeung.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lam was replaced by the former Permanent Secretary for Transport and Logistics Mable Chan, while Rosanna Law moves on from her former position as housing director to take up the culture, sports and tourism portfolio.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I appreciate the leadership the articulation skill, and also the proactiveness of Ms Chan and Ms Law because this is exactly what I need in the years to come to ensure that we will reap the best results and also to ensure good governance,” Lee told a press conference unveiling his new ministers.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said while he believes the majority of the community largely agrees with his administration’s policy aims and strategies, Hong Kong has “lost time” due both to the Covid pandemic and the 2019 riots, and he wants to “chase back the results and time.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan and Law, the CE said, will help him realise his policy objectives, work closely with him and unite to further improve governance and serve the best interests of Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I am pleased with the team I have now with the two newly appointed secretaries joining us,” Lee said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “All the team members now are able people who will be implementing my governance philosophies and aims and are willing to take up challenges, make tough decisions, build the teams, and lead the officials to do what will be in alignment with my governance philosophy and aims.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee did not say where the two former ministers were found wanting, and expressed his appreciation for their past efforts.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I really think that they have contributed their best [and have given] their best efforts for Hong Kong. So I thank them sincerely and I hope that they will have a good life, happy life after their departure,” Lee said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “But I want to do more in these two and a half years. I want to get the people who will fit my criteria in building more results and ensuring the community understand and appreciate government policies. And I think I've got the best choices,” the CE added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The new ministers vowed to work hard to bring the best results to the people of Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said she was determined to cement Hong Kong's status as a transport and logistics hub.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I am honoured to be nominated by the chief executive and the appointment of the central people's government to become the Secretary for Transport and Logistics," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I will lead my bureau and four departments to strive for opportunities to change and take forward various infrastructure projects."
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Law said culture and tourism were important to the fabric of the city and were essential to many people's livelihoods.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is my honour and I feel there is a lot of responsibility on my shoulder. I thank the chief executive for his trust in me. I am going to be fully dedicated to supporting the chief executive and I will also stay united with principal officials, as well as the civil service."
  <br>
  <br>
  Law said top of her agenda would be to prepare for the introduction of the pandas to the public at Ocean Park, ensuring the smooth implementation of the multi-entry visa scheme for Shenzhen residents and preparing for next year's National Games.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, Lam described serving various government positions in his 40-year public service career as "the greatest honour of my life".
  <br>
  <br>
  He said he's grateful for the trust of the central government, the support of the CE as well as help from his government colleagues and friends in the industry over the years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeung thanked his colleagues at the Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau for working alongside with him.
  <br>
  <br>
  He believes his successor will continue to work towards the betterment and improvement of Hong Kong's future.

<img alt="Authorities held a meeting on Tuesday to discuss transportation arrangements ahead of the arrival of the Spectrum of the Seas.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Wednesday has announced a series of measures to boost public transport capacity to and from the Kai Tak cruise terminal this weekend, when a major cruise ship is set to sail into Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Spectrum of the Seas, the largest cruise liner in Asia, will make eight port calls in the SAR in December and January. The first call is happening this Friday, when the ship arrives from Shanghai with about 4,900 passengers.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The government welcomes the ship to choose Hong Kong as its homeport, and looks forward to working with the trade to better prepare to receive cruise passengers,” a government statement read.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau confirmed that two new express bus routes will be ready to take visitors to the nearby Kai Tak MTR station, and West Kowloon high speed rail station via Tsim Sha Tsui.
  <br>
  <br>
  The cruise passengers can also opt for free and paid shuttle buses to various tourist hotspots.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Transport Department has communicated with the taxi trade on the possible demand surge on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The cruise terminal will provide HK$100 gas coupons to each taxi which picks up passengers, if an “exceptionally strong demand” is anticipated.
  <br>
  <br>
  That’s double the previous offer of HK$50 voucher per taxi.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tourism Commissioner Angelina Cheung hoped the arrangements can offer cruise passengers with a better travelling experience, and consolidate Hong Kong's position as a major homeport in Asia and attract more ship calls.

<img alt="Professor Hau Kit-tai, who led the research in Hong Kong, said local students have remained stable in terms of their competitiveness in maths and science.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong pupils remain competitive among their worldwide peers in mathematical and scientific literacy, finishing among the top 10 in a major international research which is conducted every four years.
 <br>
  <br>
  The latest results for the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study, or TIMSS, was released on Wednesday. The study aims to help jurisdictions identify strengths in their education systems, as well as areas for improvement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Education Bureau commissioned the Chinese University of Hong Kong for the citywide assessment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Around 8,600 students from more than 270 primary and secondary schools took part in computer-based tests from May to July last year
  <br>
  <br>
  Primary four pupils came back fourth out of 58 economies in maths, down from second in the previous survey in 2019. But the cohort jumped six places to ninth in science.
  <br>
  <br>
  Secondary two students, meanwhile, retained fifth place among 44 economies in maths. There was a significant improvement in science, as they improved from 17th to eighth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Singapore topped the chart in all four categories.
  <br>
  <br>
  "From the previous few cycles starting from 1997, Hong Kong students’ math performance has been quite outstanding, which is within the first few economies among some 50 or 40 participating economies,” said Professor Hau Kit-tai, who coordinated the research in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But for science, our improvement is slightly on a broad trend but not so obvious. In terms of ranking, as compared to the last cycle in 2019, we have improved quite a lot," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Education Bureau has recently amended the primary curriculum so that science will become an independent subject, instead of being part of general studies.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We don’t know if that is a direct effect of such action that led to the improvement in science results as compared to last cycle," Hau said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He predicted schools will continue to place more emphasis on science, which in turn could attract more science graduates into the education sector and improve teaching quality.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hau also noted the performance gap between boys and girls is shrinking, with girls gradually catching up with their peers in recent cycles.
  <br>
  <br>
  The only exception is the primary four cohort, in which boys outperformed girls by 14 points in maths, and 10 points in science.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Biodiversity Expert Group on Wednesday called on the government and developers to minimise the impact of development on the city's wildlife.
 <br>
  <br>
  The group said the authorities' approach of prioritising development and then attempting to mitigate environmental damage has been ineffective in protecting marine and terrestrial ecosystems.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a press briefing, Simon Ng, a member of the group and the CEO of the Business Environment Council, urged the government to give a policy signal to the business sector, as it has recognised the importance of wildlife conservation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They see nature and biodiversity potentially as a risk management issue. So, on the one hand, some business operations actually rely [on] and are dependent on ecological services and nature, providing resources and support," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But on the other hand, biodiversity loss actually will cost the business sector dearly in terms of their operations, in terms of the supply chain."
  <br>
  <br>
  The group also recommended the government start large-scale restoration of terrestrial and marine ecosystems, as well as strengthen protection for Hong Kong's most endangered species.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Outward Bound Hong Kong on Wednesday said a survey it's carried out suggests most children in Hong Kong lack confidence in their resilience and are unsure how to develop this skill.
 <br>
  <br>
  The outdoor education provider surveyed more than 700 parents and students between May and June, finding that both groups consider resilience a crucial life skill.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, 80 percent of the 337 young people polled said they find it difficult to get resilience training at school.
  <br>
  <br>
  Announcing the findings at a forum, the group's executive director Nick Cotton said it's important for youngsters to learn from failure.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We need to be prepared to let young people fail. Because through failure you learn, and through learning that's where you develop that resilience because you know that failing is not the end of the world,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “And that process then of reflecting and thinking how you can improve, that's what resilience really is. Because next time you're faced with a challenge, you're able to tackle it head on.”
  <br>
  <br>
  At the same event, Paralympic boccia gold medallist Ho Yuen-kei encouraged young people to pursue their dreams and never give up.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The study said that nowadays youngsters lack resilience. But I suggest try to do something you like and join the activity in our community. You can try something that you may not be familiar with. Don't be afraid of being unsuccessful," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jack Wong, who chairs Clearwater Bay Golf and Country Club, said it's a reality that less resourceful students may have less opportunity to access resilience training.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong added that his organisation is working with NGOs to empower youngsters through sports tournaments.

 A French cultural and educational organisation is launching an immersive augmented reality experience of Notre-Dame de Paris in Hong Kong on Sunday, coinciding with the cathedral's reopening after its devastating fire in 2019.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lydie Blandeau, co-founder and CEO of Visionairs, said the exhibition at the West Kowloon cultural hub aims to showcase the cathedral's 850-year history through innovative technology and artefacts, fostering cultural exchange between France and Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  She also said the AR exhibition will enable people of all ages to explore the iconic landmark without the need for travel.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This experience, it's a mix of history and what has happened in the 21st century when the cathedral was on fire, so they will enjoy the new constructions, but all of these new constructions are based on real strong work from people, we can say like craftsmanship people, who rebuilt the cathedral to what it was, including by using the stone they used 800 years," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's a very interesting combination of 360 degrees of augmented reality, so you can turn around and you can see from the bottom to the top different aspects and visuals of the cathedral."
  <br>
  <br>
  Visitors will receive a portable touch-screen tablet that guides them on an interactive tour of grand historical events, including the wedding of King Henry IV, Napoleon Bonaparte's coronation, and the construction of Viollet-le-Duc's spire in the 19th century.
  <br>
  <br>
  This exhibition has travelled the globe, from Paris to Dubai and Montreal to Shanghai, attracting over 750,000 visitors across 19 locations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Blandeau said she hopes to create a similar exhibition showcasing Hong Kong's landmarks for a global audience in the future.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We hope we can work with different Hong Kong museums and especially culture here because Hong Kong, it's really a place in Asia where everything comes true regarding arts and culture. I think Hong Kong people, they appreciate art and history," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We hope we can create more content from here to exhibit also in our next venue we want to do in Paris and Arab countries where we have different offers to enlarge different locations like this."

    Significant rise in airplane theft cases in 2024: govt

<img alt="The Security Bureau said there's been a significant increase in theft cases on board Hong Kong-bound flights this year. File photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1782061_1_20241204143235.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government said the number of thefts on board Hong Kong-bound aircraft for the first 10 months of the year reached a seven-year high, involving property worth more than HK$4.3 million.
 <br>
  <br>
  Security minister Chris Tang on Wednesday said there were 169 such cases recorded through October, with most of them involving short-haul flights from Southeast Asia.
  <br>
  <br>
  The figure compares to 147 cases for the whole of 2019, and 103 the year before that.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a written reply to the legislature, the minister described the rise in the number of cases as significant, saying items stolen included cash, credit cards, jewellery and watches.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[The increase] might be due to the fact that the police have stepped up publicity to encourage more people to report crimes, or the overall economic situation," he wrote in response to DAB lawmaker Kennedy Wong.
  <br>
  <br>
  Four people have been arrested - one of them on remand pending trial, with another released on bail.
  <br>
  <br>
  Charges for two others were dropped because of a lack of evidence, or because witnesses refused to come to Hong Kong to testify.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister said the government had no plans to install surveillance cameras or arrange security personal in airplane cabins for now, citing privacy reasons, manpower and the principle of proportionality.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Currently, there are no international policies regulating the installation of CCTV or arrangements of security staff on duty inside cabins, nor are these common practices generally adopted by airlines," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Tang said officials would work with airlines to engage in more educational and publicity campaigns.

<img alt="Frankie Yick backed the decision not to allow toll-free journeys during non-peak hours. File photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1782050_1_20241204132256.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government’s plan to charge time-varying tolls for the Tai Lam Tunnel has been welcomed by transport sector lawmaker Frankie Yick who describes the proposed new tolls as “acceptable”.
 <br>
  <br>
  Yick told RTHK on Wednesday that he understands people want to see lower tolls, but they have to realise the priority is to ease traffic congestion.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Well, of course, I think everybody wants the government to lower down the toll to make it even more affordable. But I think we have to look at the numbers. So, if we believe the numbers are correct, I think the most important thing is after the introduction of the new toll, we have to make sure the Tai Lam Tunnel will not be congested. Otherwise, it will defeat the whole purpose,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yick also backed the decision not to allow toll-free journeys during non-peak hours, saying the charges are affordable and it is reasonable to make people pay for the maintenance costs.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I think I would agree that we should maintain some charges, but of course the most important thing is whether it's affordable by the driving public. If you look at the non-peak hours fee right now at HK$18 [for private cars], I think it's quite reasonable in a sense.”
  <br>
  <br>
  “And of course the government, after taking over the management of the tunnel, they do have the maintenance costs and future investment costs, upgrade of services, that sort of stuff. I think they still need money to do that,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  DAB lawmaker Ben Chan, the chairman of Legco's panel on transport, expressed hope that the government would consider further reducing the tolls for taxis and commercial vehicles.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The government has provided us data and told us it hopes to avoid congestion in the tunnel. This is also in the public's interest. We hope that if the new toll system is implemented, there will be a review after about a year to assess the actual transport situation and see if these tolls are necessary,” he said.

  <br>
  Federation of Trade Unions lawmaker Michael Luk, meanwhile, said he thinks the charges during peak hours will still be high, urging authorities to shorten the peak hours period and further reduce fees during other times of day.

    Govt reviewing scheme to help traffic accident victims

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Labour and welfare minister Chris Sun on Wednesday said officials were looking at lowering the maximum amount of sick leave allowed under a subsidy scheme for people involved in traffic accidents.
 <br>
  <br>
  Last month, the police said they had arrested 275 people on suspicion of "staging" accidents to obtain the allowance.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister told lawmakers the scheme currently allows for 180 days of leave, and officials are inclined to cut that down.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Currently, the maximum sick leave allowed is roughly half a year. We think this should be subject to review. We'll see if we should give so much, and whether we should lower the number.....and by how much? We will have a look," Sun said at a Legislative Council meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Another thing is that there are quite a number of subsidy items on offer. One is for those injured, another is for those who cannot go to work. We think there are too many forms of subsidies. The aim is mainly to weather the storm for the recipient. So we'll think of ways to consolidate these, to simplify things."
  <br>
  <br>
  Sun said officials also have to implement the scheme under the principle of keeping expenditures within the limits of revenues.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added the money for the subsidies comes from transport-related fees such as licensing and vehicle registration.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister hoped the review could be completed before the end of the year, for tabling the proposed changes to the legislature for discussion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sun also said following the arrests, social welfare officials have reviewed their workflow, and made extra efforts to check the documents submitted by subsidy applicants, especially those who were making repeated claims.

    CUHK invents non-invasive way to find bowel disease

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chinese University researchers on Wednesday said they have invented non-invasive technology to identify bowel disease, reducing the need for endoscopies.
 <br>
  <br>
  The university made use of faecal samples from about 6,000 people from different regions, and found about 20 types of bacteria associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).
  <br>
  <br>
  Francis Chan, professor of medicine and therapeutics, said droplet digital PCR technology can be used to test stool samples and determine whether a patient has IBD or a different gut disorder.
  <br>
  <br>
  “IBD, at least early stage, their symptoms are no different from our common functional gut problems like irritable bowel syndrome,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “That's the reason why when many patients present with these recurrent symptoms related to the gut, they go to see the doctor, and then they have no choice but to undergo endoscopy, just to make sure that they are not suffering from IBD.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said traditionally, it takes up to 12 months for a patient with IBD to be diagnosed, and delayed treatment can lead to serious complications like bleeding and bowel cancer.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said results from the stool test are available in a week, allowing for earlier diagnosis.
  <br>
  <br>
  Researchers said the technology can also assess the risk of bowel cancer among IBD patients, adding that the test is expected to be ready for clinical use in Hong Kong in 2027.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Wednesday said it is important to uphold the Constitution when making legislative and policy changes, to ensure reform is in the right direction.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a seminar on Constitution Day, Lee said the Constitution is the country's supreme law and provides the legal framework for policy formulation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In further deepening reform comprehensively, we must regard the Constitution as our country's fundamental law by upholding and implementing the Constitution's requirements, principles, and spirit," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Only then can we ensure our reform stays on the right track and proceeds in the right way at a steady pace."
  <br>
  <br>
  The CE added that constitutional education and implementation must go hand in hand to ensure that people respect and comply with the law.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is because a solid grasp of the Constitution's substance and spirit among the entire populace is crucial to a healthy atmosphere of respect for the law and compliance," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee said Hong Kong can play its role by maximising its unique strengths under the "One Country, Two Systems" framework.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zheng Yanxiong, director of the liaison office, told the same seminar that the SAR should continue to pursue high-quality development and deepen reform under the rule of law.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We must also embark on innovations. We have accumulated new experience, and we have also designated a Constitution Day and other measures. So all these have been taken under our new innovative spirit, and this is a result of the rule of law and reform," he said.

    Govt urges HK residents to be careful in South Korea

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong tourists heading to South Korea on Wednesday said they were not fazed about the short-lived martial law in the country as the government called on residents to remain cautious.
 <br>
  <br>
  South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol ended martial law hours after the declaration last night.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Hong Kong, flights for South Korea were operating as usual.
  <br>
  <br>
  A woman surnamed Wong was heading to South Korea alone.
  <br>
  <br>
  She admitted she was a bit worried when martial law was declared, but noted that it was short-lived.
  <br>
  <br>
  She believed the situation in the country should be fine.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I plan to check the news before I head out," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I will also try to avoid places with crowds, as my friends told me that if I see people gathering, I should not get close."
  <br>
  <br>
  A woman surnamed Cheung told RTHK that she's not too concerned about the situation, adding that whatever happens, happens.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another Hongkonger, surnamed Law, believed she will be safe as long as she stays away from protests.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said if anything happens, she will stay in the hotel.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some Koreans in the SAR said they were shocked about the declaration of martial law.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mr Park, who's in the region with a friend for a taekwondo competition, said he and his pal were sceptical about the news when it broke.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We [thought] that it's not real situation. [We thought] it's fake. We talked to each other that it's fake news. But it's a real situation. So we are very surprised. About 40 years ago, you know that Korea is under the military government, but Korea is very developed economically and politically," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And democracy, we Korean people made democracy. So we believe that this kind of situation cannot be real and cannot stay [for long]. So we are very happy to see that the situation is over."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Travel Industry Council said around 400 people from 26 tours groups are in South Korea.
  <br>
  <br>
  Their trips have not been affected and there are no plans for them to return to Hong Kong earlier than scheduled.
  <br>
  <br>
  The council has not received any requests for assistance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Still, the SAR government urged Hong Kong residents who are in the country or plan to go to South Korea to remain cautious.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[They should] monitor the situation, exercise caution, attend to personal safety, avoid large gatherings of people and pay attention to local announcements on the latest situation."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Security Bureau said social order in South Korea is normal for now, and it would closely monitor the situation.
  <br>
  <br>
  So far, no one has asked for assistance from the Immigration Department.

    Time-varying tolls proposed for Tai Lam Tunnel
   </title>
   <link>

<img alt="The morning rush hour at the Tai Lam Tunnel will be from 7.15am to 9.45am, while the evening peak period will be from 5.15pm to 7pm. File photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1782036_1_20241204122011.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government says it plans to charge time-varying tolls for the Tai Lam Tunnel after it takes control of the infrastructure in the New Territories on May 31 next year.
 <br>
  <br>
  Currently, private car and taxi drivers pay HK$58, while commercial vehicle drivers pay between HK$64 and HK$79 for using the tunnel connecting Ting Kau and Yuen Long.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under the new tolling system, there will be three levels of charges for “peak”, “general” and “non-peak” hours, similar to the system used for the cross-harbour tunnels.
  <br>
  <br>
  The morning rush hour will be from 7.15am to 9.45am, while the evening peak period will be from 5.15pm to 7pm.
  <br>
  <br>
  For private cars, the proposed toll during peak hours is HK$45, HK$30 for normal periods of the day, and HK$18 for non-peak hours.
  <br>
  <br>
  Motorcyclists will pay HK$18 during peak hours, HK$12 during normal periods and HK$7.2 at non-peak hours.
  <br>
  <br>
  Taxis will be charged a fixed toll of HK$28 and commercial vehicles HK$43 throughout the day.
  <br>
  <br>
  A fixed charging scheme will apply to all vehicles on Sundays and public holidays.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government also explained that it hasn't considered toll-free journeys in non-peak hours because it believes the best approach is to have users cover the infrastructure costs, emphasising this has nothing to do with the higher-than-expected government deficit this fiscal year.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said the scheme will ease traffic on alternative routes such as Tuen Mun Road and the Tolo Highway.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tuen Mun Road is expected to see 300 fewer private cars during the busiest hour of the day.
  <br>
  <br>
  There will be a mechanism in place to adjust the tolls, with any changes capped at no more than HK$3.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government said it plans to table a bill on the plans to Legco for a first reading next Wednesday, and hopes to see it passed in the first quarter of next year.

    Charity hopes OSC funding can help educate refugees

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A charity group which helps the refugee community is seeking support to boost its efforts to educate the needy, particularly to make recipients more tech-savvy.
 <br>
  <br>
  Grassroots Future is among 11 beneficiaries of this year's Operation Santa Claus (OSC). It was founded four years ago during the pandemic to help refugees and asylum seekers in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  The charity now focuses on helping the recipients with their education, mental well-being and community building.
  <br>
  <br>
  Its director, Tegan Smyth, said with many things getting more expensive, such as textbooks, one of her group's initiatives is to relieve the financial stress of parents.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's called TE(A)CH at the Grassroots and it's covering an IT program for refugee and asylum seeker children and their parents over a two-year basis. It's also covering textbook expenses, which is a really pressing need for the community," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Smyth said education is a major barrier for refugee children in the SAR, because their parents are unable to work, making it hard for them to pay upfront for textbooks and other school expenses.
  <br>
  <br>
  She added that her charity has been helping around 30 children a year, and she hopes the number will keep rising.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jointly organised by RTHK and South China Morning Post, OSC funds charitable projects that focus on children and youth, the elderly, the community, those with physical and mental disabilities, medical projects, and those concerning the environment.

    HK must reform amid economic transformation: CE

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee said the time is ripe for various sectors in Hong Kong to speed up reform, and there is no exception for the government especially after the country adopted a resolution on further deepening reform to advance Chinese modernisation.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a new season of the RTHK programme
  <i>
   Overview Policy
  </i>
  , Lee said he has been trying to push for reform since he took office in 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  "At that time, I used milder words, such as 'change'. That's because everybody will interpret the reform differently," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CE said reform is never easy, as it often affects people with vested interests or forces people to leave their comfort zone, so it's necessary to convince the public why reform is necessary.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Some of the elements of success Hong Kong rode on in the past may not work anymore... Mainland cities are improving very quickly, with new technologies and systems. They have a stronger social basis and are more receptive to reform."
  <br>
  <br>
  He said businesses must adapt amid the city's economic transformation and changes in consumption patterns for locals and visitors alike.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If [businesses] don't carry out reform, they'll be phased out," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The chief executive said society has reached a consensus on the need for reform.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Now, we only have to tell people the disadvantages of not carrying out reform and the advantages of reform. Society already knows about it."
  <br>
  <br>
  The CE said the government needs to embrace reform as well, and that he's told senior staff to be more proactive.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You have to strike first. Before a problem surfaces, it's best that you foresee the problem and correct it... if there are ambiguous situations, just step in, instead of wasting time to debate who should take responsibility," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee also said principal officials have been ordered to face the public more by disseminating messages regularly on social media, so the public knows the government is tackling problems whenever they arise.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Justice Secretary Paul Lam on Wednesday said the Constitution provides the fundamental legal protection for the "One Country, Two Systems" framework, and people should start learning about the Constitution from a young age.
 <br>
  <br>
  Addressing the flag-raising ceremony on Constitution Day, Lam said the event was established to promote constitutional spirit and the rule of law.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Given the fundamental importance of the Constitution in implementing 'One Country, Two Systems' in Hong Kong, we must strengthen constitutional awareness. The prerequisite is to deepen public understanding and knowledge of the Constitution," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The activities on Constitution Day serve to promote and propagate the Constitution. It's also a good opportunity to promote rule of law awareness through public education."
  <br>
  <br>
  The SAR should make full use of the unique advantages under "One Country, Two Systems" and safeguard national sovereignty, security and development interests, Lam added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The justice chief also called it an "important mission" to teach youngsters about what the Constitution is and why it matters, adding that disciplinary services officers should stand at the forefront as guardians of the Constitution.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 100 members of the disciplined services took part in the flag-raising ceremony led by the Security Bureau at the Hong Kong Customs College.

    Ideas for Ocean Park to cut costs and raise revenues

<img alt="Lawmakers looked at ways Ocean Park could cut costs and raise revenues during a Legco panel meeting on Tuesday. File photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1781940_1_20241203204442.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lawmakers on Tuesday discussed ways to help Ocean Park improve its finances after it posted a deficit of more than HK$71 million for the financial year ending in June, despite revenue and visitor numbers hitting five-year highs.
 <br>
  <br>
  At a Legco panel meeting on economic development, the theme park disclosed that its water park, or Water World, lost over HK$200 million last financial year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ocean Park chairman Paulo Pong explained Water World had only been running for two years and was still in its growth phase, promising lawmakers the theme park would work hard to reduce losses.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lawmakers voiced concerns Ocean Park might struggle to stay financially sustainable, urging it to use the opportunities created by its six pandas.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tourism sector lawmaker Perry Yiu noted that following the resumption of multiple-entry visas for Shenzhen residents, Ocean Park could consider giving them more discounts to boost visitor numbers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Benson Luk from the Business and Professionals Alliance, suggested Ocean Park lease out its outdoor areas to host major events to increase revenue.
  <br>
  <br>
  Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism Kevin Yeung noted Ocean Park has been thinking of different ways to find more sources of income.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Ocean Park will make use of the resources available to try to increase revenue, for example concerts can be held in the park. This will also help solve the problem of not having enough venues in Hong Kong,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Roundtable lawmaker Michael Tien suggested the Leisure and Cultural Services Department (LCSD) take over the water park's operations to reduce losses.
  <br>
  <br>
  “[Ocean Park’s] current loss last year is strictly due to one project, which is the water park. The loss of the water park, which is in excess of HK$200 million, is about the same as the government subsidy,” he said
  <br>
  <br>
  “So basically, the government is not subsidising the other activities of Ocean Park, and that is unfair to Ocean Park and is tying up the hands of the entire team. So my suggestion is to spin off the water park, and give it to LCSD,” he said.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A new study shows that most schoolchildren in Hong Kong are not doing the 60 minutes of moderate to vigorous exercise each day recommended by the World Health Organisation.
 <br>
  <br>
  Professor Patrick Ip from the University of Hong Kong’s department of paediatrics said research he carried out for the InspiringHK Sports Foundation found less than eight percent of more than 1,000 primary and secondary students studied met the exercise standard over the past year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ip blamed this on poor habits developed during the Covid pandemic.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We have observed a very alarming situation that during non-school days and public holidays, children actually did not go out with their friends, their family members to play sports or do any activities under the sunshine,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “This turns out to be a very bad habit. If that habit continues, our next generation will be at a much worse physical activity level, as well as having a poor shape in both physical and mental health.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The foundation said it hopes that by 2030, 16 percent of Hong Kong schoolchildren will reach the 60 minutes per day recommendation, adding that it will launch a scheme next year aimed at promoting physical activity among schoolchildren.

<img alt="Security chief Chris Tang says authorities have received 23 requests for assistance so far this year of Hongkongers allegedly being detained in Southeast Asia to work illegally." src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1781904_1_20241203162256.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Security minister Chris Tang has warned against a resurgence of cases involving Hong Kong residents allegedly being held captive in Southeast Asia to work illegally.
 <br>
  <br>
  A number of Hongkongers fell for employment scams and were detained in various Southeast Asian countries in 2022, prompting the government to set up a task force to coordinate follow-up actions.
  <br>
  <br>
  So far this year, authorities received 23 requests for assistance. Eleven of them returned to the SAR, while the others were discovered safe even though their movements were reportedly restricted.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Since the second quarter of 2024, there have been signs of a resurgence of cases of Hong Kong residents being suspected to have been lured to Southeast Asian countries and detained to engage in illegal work," Tang told a Legislative Council panel on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister said immigration officials have been following up on the cases through foreign ministry representatives in Hong Kong as well as diplomatic and consular missions elsewhere.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked if the government had learned about what happened from those who had returned to Hong Kong, Tang said none of the Hongkongers suspected to be detained against their will were taken away while on holiday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For each case, once the citizen has returned to Hong Kong, we would interview them, ask them why they were lured overseas and how they were released," Tang told lawmakers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But let me say this, most of the individuals went voluntarily and then they were detained there illegally. There was never a case that an individual was abducted."
  <br>
  <br>
  The security chief said authorities would continue to monitor online communications and strengthen cooperation with their international counterparts, while stepping up calls for people to be more alert to job scams.

    'HKU community pharmacy for education, research use'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The University of Hong Kong (HKU) on Tuesday said its community pharmacy merged pharmaceutical services with education and research, which is different from other medical dispensaries in the city.
 <br>
  <br>
  Located at the medical school's campus in Pok Fu Lam, the community pharmacy opened its doors in November, serving mainly Queen Mary Hospital patients as well as HKU staff and students.
  <br>
  <br>
  The medical facility, which is the city's first teaching community pharmacy on a university campus, offers a number of prescription-only medications and drugs for minor ailments.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jovan Chow, a third year pharmacy student at HKU, said he was able to learn by observing how pharmacists interact with patients.
  <br>
  <br>
  "My biggest takeaway from [working at] the community pharmacy is actually the soft skills I acquired during my time here... I have more opportunities to have a glance of how community pharmacies operate," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ian Wong, professor of pharmacology and pharmacy at the university's medical faculty, said the facility goes beyond serving those seeking help.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The main duties and core functions of a university are teaching, research, and knowledge transfer," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our pharmacy's mission is also to [give] the best education to our students, and secondly, is to make use of this pharmacy to conduct research, so that we can help our patients and citizens to optimise the use of medicine. And finally, providing services is actually a knowledge transfer, so that we make use of our knowledge to treat our patients."

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday said he believes the Northern Metropolis project will bring a good return on investment and the public will be able to share the fruits of the development.
 <br>
  <br>
  Last week, more than 80 enterprises and developers signed an expression of interest for the development, along with separate agreements for projects worth some HK$100 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are very confident that the Northern Metropolis development plan will invite and attract a lot of interest," Lee told reporters before heading into the weekly Executive Council meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will be also developing the San Tin Technopole. There will also be a university city and different pockets of land, and all these will add together to create extra value for Hong Kong. All these projects will bring a good return on investment."
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked whether there will be penalties for enterprises that sign agreements but don't invest, Lee said he believes these investments will pay off well in the long run.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Of course, we have to look very far ahead in the future. Some investment periods may be as long as five to 15 years," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CE added that he hopes to find innovative ways to ensure regular citizens also benefit from these investments.

    Cut education spending to reduce deficit: economist

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A local economist on Tuesday suggested the government reduce spending on education to save money.
 <br>
  <br>
  Financial Secretary Paul Chan earlier revised the estimated government deficit for the current financial year, doubling it to around HK$100 billion due to poor performance in the asset markets.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on an RTHK radio programme, Terence Chong, executive director of Chinese University's Lau Chor Tak Institute of Global Economics and Finance, said the government could link education spending to the student population.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If the number of students drops, there's no reason for the government to increase education expenditure," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Should we think about reforming education spending and pegging it against the student population? If student numbers fall, shouldn't we reduce spending?"
  <br>
  <br>
  He said it would be difficult for the government to save money by cutting civil servant pay or reducing the civil service establishment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chong said such a move would only lead to government workers opting to work in the private sector instead, with public services affected as a result.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, lawmaker Wendy Hong said the government could consider recovering education costs from non-local university students.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong, who's a member of Legco's financial affairs panel, said such students are only charged HK$150,000 to HK$180,000, even though the annual cost of their education is HK$300,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is a gradual process. Of course, with the increased cost, their interest to come and study in Hong Kong might be reduced. We can offer scholarships at the same time to attract those in the top-tier," she said.

    Golf club ruling won't affect housing supply: CE

<div class="itemFullText">
 A court ruling overturning the approval of an environmental study on building flats on Fanling golf course won't significantly affect Hong Kong's public housing supply over the next decade, Chief Executive John Lee said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a decision handed down on Monday, the High Court called on the authorities to consult the public again on plans to build public flats on 9.5 hectares of the century-old course.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee said while overall housing goals over the next 10 years won't change, the ruling will affect how many homes they can build at the golf course and how long it will take.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Following the judgment, in terms of the number of public housing units, the density and the delay in the housing production, we are seeing a significant impact. And that means the government will have to conduct a holistic assessment," he said before the weekly Executive Council meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CE told reporters that officials have secured land to produce more than 308,000 public housing units in the next 10 years.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The change in relation to the public housing development on Fanling golf course should not pose a major change to the public housing production target," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee said the government will conduct analyses before deciding the way forward, including whether to launch an appeal.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee said on Tuesday that the government will introduce different measures to spur economic growth amid a larger-than-expected budget deficit, describing the central government's move to allow Shenzhen residents to visit Hong Kong more often as coming at just the right time.
 <br>
  <br>
  On Monday, the financial secretary changed the deficit forecast for the current financial year from HK$48.1 billion to around HK$100 billion, citing lower revenue due to poor asset market performances and a drop in profits tax.
  <br>
  <br>
  For his part, Lee stressed that officials will cut spending and formulate measures to increase revenue -- but they'll be cautious with the measures so as to reduce the impact on the public.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the visa rule change for Shenzhen residents is among many measures exemplifying the country's strong backing for the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There are also new growth points, for example, the third runway system, which has been commissioned. Next year, Kai Tak Sports Park will also be commissioned. A lot of international major events will take place in Hong Kong," Lee told reporters ahead of the weekly Executive Council meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  "All these will stimulate our economy and increase government revenue. The government, meanwhile, also continues to consolidate our status as an international financial trade and shipping centre."
  <br>
  <br>
  The CE said he will hold a Q&A session in the legislature next Thursday, and one of the topics will be economic growth and expanding Hong Kong's international network.
  <br>
  <br>
  On tourism, Lee said operations have been smooth since Beijing restored multi-entry visas for Shenzhen residents on Sunday, and many people, he said, look forward to visiting the SAR "whenever they want".
  <br>
  <br>
  The CE noted that some trade representatives have expressed optimism that the measure will inject life into the local economy, noting that there are "waves of activities" coming up over the Christmas period.
  <br>
  <br>
  These, Lee said, include Hong Kong WinterFest, international horse races, panda carnivals and a real-life gathering and adventure for an online mobile game this weekend.
  <br>
  <br>
  The chief executive also said law enforcement agencies are determined to stop the return of parallel goods trading in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said consumption patterns of mainland residents have changed, and nowadays they can find many quality and cheap products through online stores.

 The Office of the Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Monday said it hopes Hong Kong youngsters can have a greater understanding of the nation's foreign affairs through an annual knowledge contest.
 <br>
  <br>
  The theme of the 17th edition of the Hong Kong Cup Diplomatic Knowledge Contest is "Love Diplomacy, Love the World".
  <br>
  <br>
  The contest is jointly organised by the commissioner's office, the Education Bureau and the Better Hong Kong Foundation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at the kick-off ceremony, Deputy Commissioner Li Yongsheng said the contest is an important platform for students to learn more about China's foreign policy.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The year of 2025 marks the 80th anniversary of the founding of the United Nations and the 70th anniversary of the Bandung Conference. These two events are of great significance in the history of diplomacy," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The contest aims to encourage Hong Kong youth to further understand major-country diplomacy with Chinese characteristics, and think of how to make greater and more contributions to the country's foreign affairs."
  <br>
  <br>
  A study tour to Beijing and Gansu Province was held in July for the winning teams of the 16th edition.
  <br>
  <br>
  Director of Broadcasting Eddie Cheung said RTHK produced three episodes of the tour, to be aired on three Thursdays starting this week.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I believe students who joined the tour were able to combine the knowledge in their textbooks with their insight from the study tour, integrating their love for the country and Hong Kong, and tell good stories of our country," Cheung said.
  <br>
  <br>
  A Form three student from St. Paul's College said he will be participating in the upcoming contest and hopes he can do better this time round.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I read more about the news in the world and I also read books about the diplomatic policies of China," he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Last year, I didn't go to the final competition, so this year, I wish I can get a better result in the online quiz and can get the chance to attend the final competition."
  <br>
  <br>
  Applications will open on December 9. The first round of the contest will be held in March next year, and the final will take place in May.

    Court halts Fanling golf course flats plan

<img alt="The High Court says overturning the administration's decision can lead to re-conducting the public consultation and seeking comments from environmental advisers. File photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1781778_2_20241202200228.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The High Court has overturned the government's approval of an environmental study into plans to build public flats on part of the Fanling Golf Course, calling on authorities to consult the public on the matter again.
 <br>
  <br>
  Judge Russell Coleman on Monday handed down the judgement after the Hong Kong Golf Club filed a legal challenge against an environmental impact assessment (EIA) report that would set the stage for building public housing units on 9.5 hectares of the century-old course.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said overturning the administration's decision could lead to re-conducting the public consultation and seeking comments from environmental advisers "with the benefits of the fruits of that re-consultation".
  <br>
  <br>
  The club had argued that a public consultation exercise had not been carried out properly or fairly, saying authorities had been allowed to submit additional information during the assessment but people's responses to the submissions were not taken into account.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As a matter of fact, the public were only consulted on part of the EIA report in its final form. That is contrary to the requirement of the EIA Ordinance," Coleman wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In short, I find that the fairness and integrity of the process, set out in the EIA Ordinance properly construed, demanded re-consultation once the additional information was produced to form part of the EIA report."
  <br>
  <br>
  The director of environmental protection gave conditional approval to the assessment in May last year, before the Town Planning Board rezoned the site from "residential" to "undetermined" use temporarily.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials had attached a number of conditions to the assessment's approval, including having the Civil Engineering and Development Department revise its layout plan to preserve about 0.4 hectares of woodland "as far as practicable".
  <br>
  <br>
  The judge said imposing such a condition “subject to the caveat of practicability” was problematic.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Until the exercise of revision is actually performed, it cannot be known whether the stated current plan [can] be maintained," he wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the High Court judge also rejected part of the club's contention, including an argument that the approval was unlawful because it failed to require the project proponent to carry out mitigation measures identified in the assessment report.
  <br>
  <br>
  The court earlier suspended the environmental review on an interim basis until the judicial challenge was resolved.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong Golf Club said it welcomed the judgement, saying the Fanling site is an internationally renowned and world-class venue with significant ecological and cultural value.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The three championship courses – which include the old course – are integral parts of the Fanling site, which is an irreplaceable sports facility and is key to Hong Kong’s ability to attract major golf tournaments," the club said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  It added the course will host a series of events next year, such as the LIV golf tournament and golf competitions for the National Games, which "play a critical role" in driving the city's sports scene.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Moving forward, the club will utilise the three championship courses to the best of their potential with a view to supporting the government policy that advocates the 'shaping of tourism with sports' and the further development of Hong Kong's mega-event economy," the club said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Environmental Protection Department said it will study the judgement and announce whether it would appeal "at an appropriate time".

    Consultation on subdivided flats plan begins

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A two-month consultation exercise on proposed regulations aimed at ridding the city of poor quality subdivided flats began on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  At a housing panel meeting, several lawmakers said they were concerned landlords might start renovations ahead of the new legislation, leaving existing tenants homeless.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lawmaker Gary Zhang, a panel member, said the government needs to take the opportunity to hear what the public thinks about the policy.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We roll out this policy out of a very good will to ensure the basic humanity level at our housing situation. But if we cannot manage the transition, well I'm afraid ultimately we might cause some people to lose their homes, lose their residences,” he told RTHK after the meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  Deputy Financial Secretary Michael Wong, who leads the Task Force on Tackling the Issue of Subdivided Units, said he doesn't think such evictions will be a big problem.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We have talked to different parties earlier and heard about such sayings. But we haven't found any signs of a widespread issue. Also we have emphasised multiple times that under the existing landlord and tenant ordinance, the protection for tenants is still here. If any landlords break the rules and evict their tenants please let us know, we will address that seriously,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to the proposed policy, subdivided flats will have to have a floor area of at least eight square metres and a minimum ceiling height of at least 2.3 metres.
  <br>
  <br>
  Landlords caught renting out substandard flats would face jail terms of up to three years, as well as a maximum fine of HK$300,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials told lawmakers that they will consult the public on how long the grace period should be for landlords to modify their flats to meet the new requirements.
  <br>
  <br>
  During the meeting, some lawmakers said they were worried people might simply switch to renting beds or guest rooms instead, which could be even more cramped than subdivided flats.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong said the government will look into other relevant policies to address potential issues.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A local creative studio is hosting an exhibition called "Panda Go! Fest HK" showcasing 2,500 panda sculptures at various iconic locations across the SAR on weekends in December and during Christmas.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a welcoming ceremony, SK Lam, founder of All Rights Reserved, said the exhibition will be held at the Avenue of Stars, Ngong Ping 360, Ocean Park and Sun Yat Sen Memorial Park.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Based on our past 10 years of experience and also the recent experience we had with [Doraemon], we think these are the more accessible areas that the public can go and visit," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lam also said the team has created six new panda characters inspired by the Ocean Park panda family, consisting of Ying Ying and Le Le, new arrivals currently named An An and Ke Ke, as well as the newborn twins.
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted that the company introduced a giant panda installation a decade ago, featuring 1,600 panda sculptures to symbolise the existing panda population at that time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lam added that thanks to global conservation efforts, the giant panda population has since increased to over 2,500, encompassing both wild and captive pandas.

    HK Island to get 'smart and green' transit line

<img alt="The Transport and Logistics Bureau says the 'smart and green mass transit system' it has opted for is more cost effective than a heavy rail project.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Transport officials say they hope to kick-start construction projects for a transit line linking HKU and Wong Chuk Hang MTR stations in 2027.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a paper submitted to Legco, the Transport and Logistics Bureau said rather than the heavy rail originally proposed, the new plan for the South Island Line (West) is to build a "smart and green mass transit system" using viaducts, along with a tunnel through the hilly terrain between Queen Mary Hospital and HKU.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 7.5-kilometre line will also pass through Aberdeen, Tin Wan, Wah Fu and Cyberport and will serve 130,000 residents and 50,000 people working in the areas, officials said.
  <br>
  <br>
  No expected completion date was given.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bureau said it hopes to begin detailed planning and design for the project next year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lawmaker Gary Zhang, who's a former railway engineer, said he expects construction work to be completed within five to six years' time.
  <br>
  <br>
  He pointed out that the capacity of the mass transit system is much lower than the original.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The new smart [and] green system - capacity could reach around 8,000. But normally the optimal capacity could be something around 5,000," he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So the capacity, yes, would be a disadvantage. But construction costs would be much much lower."

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Monday said Hong Kong would continue to leverage its advantages under the One Country, Two Systems framework and use its global network to become an international education hub.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lee made his remarks while addressing the Global University Presidents and Leaders Summit, where attendees included leaders and presidents from more than 50 global universities.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Our unique advantages spring from One Country, Two Systems. Thanks to this unique principle, we enjoy unwavering support from our country together with global connectivity," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Hong Kong attracts students from more than 100 countries. Over half of the academic staff in our institutions comes from outside Hong Kong. And we are building on that solid foundation, the Hong Kong SAR government endeavors to develop Hong Kong into an international post-secondary education hub,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CE noted the SAR has five universities among the world's top 100, and three in Asia's top 10.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added the government would continue to promote the “study in Hong Kong brand” as well as encourage local universities to seek more collaboration with overseas and mainland institutions, especially with other cities in the Greater Bay Area.
