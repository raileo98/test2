<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Civil Service Secretary Ingrid Yeung on Sunday said most civil servants understood the need for a pay freeze given the government’s deficit.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a Commercial Radio programme, Yeung said she had been told the move would not affect morale.
  <br>
  <br>
  “During the discussions, I approached many civil service colleagues and most of them told me they understood the situation. Some even said it had been expected. Before the budget announcement, some union representatives had said that it would not affect morale,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Financial Secretary Paul Chan also announced in his budget speech on Wednesday that two percent of the civil service would be cut between the 2026/27 and 2027/28 financial years, and about 10,000 civil service posts were expected to be slashed by April 1, 2027.
  <br>
  <br>
  To reduce recurrent government expenditure by two percent, Yeung said the two percent cut was a minimum requirement, and departments could reduce more posts if they wanted.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, Yeung said some vacancies had to be filled such as firemen and teachers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeung also said around 40 percent of civil servants could still enjoy a pay rise every year under the incremental pay scale, while directorate-level civil servants advance one increment every two years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeung added these increments were dependent on performance appraisals.

    'Taxing boundary-crossing drivers won't affect many'

<img alt="Paul Chan said on TVB that around 15 percent of people head to the mainland in private vehicles, and taxing them would not affect a great amount of people." src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1793870_1_20250302124329.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Sunday said officials plan to go ahead with a proposed land departure tax for private cars, saying this represented a wealthier demographic in society.
 <br>
  <br>
  The proposal announced in the budget last week met some opposition, with some lawmakers saying it wouldn't help Hong Kong's integration into the Greater Bay Area.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Chan said these drivers amount to about 15 percent of the some 100 million departures annually, so there wouldn't be too many people affected.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Because we spent much on these border facilities in terms of construction, and there are also maintenance costs," he said on a TVB programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  "From a user's pay perspective, we ought to get some money back. We don't want to bother the general public."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan stressed the government was still open to ideas and welcomed discussions.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister said there were many ways for people to cross the border, adding the government would not consider charging passengers who take the express rail.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the administration plans to raise more than HK$150 billion worth of bonds every year for the coming five fiscal years, in part to finance infrastructure projects.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said the government would mainly issue short-term bonds, but added it has also received local market feedback expressing interest in longer term, Hong Kong dollar bonds that could be considered stable investment tools.

    Technology chief pledges to foster AI development

<div class="itemFullText">
 Technology and innovation chief Sun Dong on Sunday said policies related to artificial intelligence (AI) mentioned in last month's budget show the government’s commitment to high-quality development.
 <br>
  <br>
  Financial Secretary Paul Chan described AI as a “core industry” as he delivered the budget for the 2025-26 financial year, and said the government would support research and development efforts in the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also announced that HK$1 billion would be earmarked for the establishment of the Hong Kong AI Research and Development Institute.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a Commercial Radio programme, Sun said the founding of the institute could benefit society in many ways, including applications in areas like government services, law, finance, healthcare and education.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think that with AI advancing to its current level, every country and region needs to achieve breakthroughs in important areas, particularly in applications. Of course this involves some free exploration. Therefore while we want to encourage different research teams to explore AI freely, we also need to combine our limited resources to focus on development. That’s part of why we’re establishing the institute," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The technology chief also noted there were 4,700 start-ups in the city at the end of last year, describing them as important pillars for Hong Kong’s future development.
  <br>
  <br>
  “This is four times what it was before the pandemic and over a 10 percent increase from the year before. The number is expected to go up again this year,” he said
  <br>
  <br>
  “Start-ups are looking at Hong Kong's innovation scene, government policies, the overall resources availability, and whether the business environment is good. When start-ups come here, talent will follow."
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong has to have its own “star start-up” as it works its way to become an international I&T centre, the minister said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sun will lead a delegation, including representatives from the I&T sector, to Spain and Portugal on Sunday evening, to strengthen ties and cooperation between Hong Kong and the two countries in the field.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) says people should make sure they are fully vaccinated against measles before travelling, after a man was hospitalised with the disease following a trip to Vietnam. The 38-year-old, who travelled to the country in early February, is now stable at Queen Elizabeth Hospital.
 <br>
  <br>
  Although the CHP has classified the case as imported, the man stayed at the Hong Kong Sports Institute and visited its cafeteria while he was infectious.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CHP has set up a hotline on 2125 2372 for those who may have been exposed. It will operate until Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Measles cases are rising in some countries due to low vaccination rates. While Hong Kong's vaccination coverage exceeds 95 percent, international travel poses a risk.
  <br>
  <br>
  CHP controller Dr Edwin Tsui said anyone unsure of their vaccination status, especially travellers, should consult a doctor.

<img alt="O'Sullivan had been looking forward to playing in front of a home crowd in Hong Kong, after becoming an SAR resident last October. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1793832_1_20250301225306.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ronnie O'Sullivan has withdrawn from the World Snooker Grand Prix 2025 scheduled at Kai Tak Arena next week, citing health reasons.
 <br>
  <br>
  "I am very disappointed not to be competing. I had been eager to make my comeback in Hong Kong and have put in my utmost effort, but unfortunately must consider my health. I wish to sincerely thank the organisers and all the Hong Kong fans for their support," the 49-year-old star said in a statement on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Rocket, as he's nicknamed, will be replaced by world number 33 Hossein Vafaei.
  <br>
  <br>
  The event will be the first ranking tournament in the SAR since 1989.
  <br>
  <br>
  World number one Judd Trump, who -- like O'Sullivan -- became a Hong Kong resident through the Quality Migrant Admission Scheme, will now headline the competition from March 4 to 9.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other big names include Mark Williams, Mark Selby and Ding Junhui.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A fencing duel between movie star Donnie Yen and Olympic gold medallist Vivian Kong, a medley performance by celebrity couple George Lam and Sally Yeh, and a surprise appearance by singer and actor Andy Lau were some of the highlights for the opening ceremony of Kai Tak Sports Park on Saturday night.
 <br>
  <br>
  The show, which went on until 8:35pm, half an hour longer than scheduled, was capped by a brief fireworks display.
  <br>
  <br>
  Spectators said they were dazzled by the overall experience. Jimmy and Dhillon said they were super excited to see Donnie Yen.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They had a fencing demonstration just now, mixing kung fu and fencing. Donnie Yen fencing against Vivian Kong, the Hong Kong champion. It looks like we are in the Olympics," they said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another attendee, Gary, was pleased with his clear view to the stage, even he sat in the upper section.
  <br>
  <br>
  "My seat is the top (row) one. So my sight is all the stadium and very huge. It makes me feel great. I’m very proud that Hong Kong has this (stadium)," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alan, who went with his girlfriend, praised the facilities inside the stadium, although he felt the sound quality can be improved.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The number of toilets is beyond my expectations… Just [every] few steps there's a toilet," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also hoped spectators can bring their own food or drinks in the future.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We did not buy any drinks or food inside - just the price consideration. We wanted to buy the popcorn but that is not the fresh popcorn, just pre-prepared food," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  A woman from Zhuhai was overjoyed to see Andy Lau in person.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Everyone was hoping to see the four heavenly kings," Zhang said, referring to 1990s Hong Kong pop idols Andy Lau, Aaron Kwok, Jacky Cheung and Leon Lai.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was awesome enough to see one of them show up."
  <br>
  <br>
  The event also drew in Jeffery and Arnold, both engineers involved in the sports park project.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For me, it's like what you said, our baby. So it feels like we accomplished something because of our hardships and all the struggles that we faced here during the construction. Yeah, all the tears, the sweat," Jeffrey said.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The brand new Kai Tak Sports Park will help Hong Kong soar to new heights, the chief executive told the crowd during the opening ceremony on Saturday night.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking in Cantonese, Putonghua and English, John Lee also underlined his vision for the city’s newest landmark, built on the site vacated by the old airport.
  <br>
  <br>
  “From the first successful trial flight 100 years ago to the establishment of an airport, today we have created Kai Tak Sports Park … a brand new stage for sports, culture and arts facing the world,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CE added that the park will be the perfect venue to kick off “Hong Kong Super March,” outlining a list of mega-events scheduled for the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Like this very stadium's retractable roof, the sky is the limit. From snooker, the Hong Kong Rugby Sevens to football, the upcoming sports events are sure to delight all - on and off the pitch,” he declared.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee was then joined onstage by political and business leaders for the launching ceremony. They included the director of the central government's liaison office, Zheng Yanxiong, as well as Henry Cheng, chairman of New World Development, which built the park.
  <br>
  <br>
  The crowd of 33,000 or so were treated to a Chinese drum performance and lion dance before the speech.
  <br>
  <br>
  The media were allowed to stream roughly the first half an hour of the show, until 7 pm.
  <br>
  <br>
  The rest of the ceremony – including performances by singers Joey Yung, and demonstrations by national athletes – was kept under wraps until 9.30 pm, when four free-to-air TV channels will broadcast the event in full.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Jubilant and excited crowds arrived at Kai Tak Sports Park ahead of the opening ceremony on Saturday night, but some were left confused by the rules of admission.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 90-minute ceremony will begin at 6:30pm, featuring celebrities including Donnie Yen, Gin Lee, MC Cheung, Joey Yung, as well as SAR athletes Vivian Kong and Jordan Tang.
  <br>
  <br>
  One spectator, Edward, arrived two hours in advance. He said he couldn’t wait to see the stars and check out their performances.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Of course Joey, MC - those are the perfect performances that I want to look at. Also I know some of the sports stars will be joining. I'm looking forward to it," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another man, surnamed Wong, said his daughter helped him buy a ticket. The 67-year-old said he has never been to a big stadium before and called this an "once-in-a-lifetime opportunity."
  <br>
  <br>
  The ceremony will welcome 33,600 spectators, including 8,500 lucky ones who managed to purchase tickets online.
  <br>
  <br>
  But to get in, they had to show up with electronic vouchers and identity documents to redeem a physical ticket by 3pm.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bosco and his girlfriend arrived half an hour before the deadline. He said the arrangement was a bit of a hassle but described the redemption process as smooth.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think it'll be better if the seats are arranged when I buy the tickets ... It's a bit troublesome to come here a few times," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For us it's quite smooth because ... not many people are here. The process takes about five minutes."
  <br>
  <br>
  But a number of others showed up after 3pm, including Alsen, who travelled from Shenzhen.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said he was thankful to get the ticket, but felt that signage directing spectators could be improved.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There are many instructions that I can't identify. There's information but it still feels a bit hard for me to find the right place. I asked some police and others," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Spectators were allowed to enter the main stadium from 4:30pm, after passing security checks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some of them were unaware of the list of items prohibited inside the venue. These include long umbrellas, plastic, glass or metal food containers, water bottles and so on.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's kind of odd. Maybe it's for safety reasons, but kids need their own water bottles. It means we need to spend money inside," said Mavis, who attended the gala with her two daughters and husband.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ceremony will not be broadcast live, but four local TV channels, including RTHK, will carry the show at 9.30pm.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Five taxi companies which were awarded licences to operate taxi fleets will roll out the long-awaited service next week, according to the secretary for transport and logistics.
 <br>
  <br>
  Writing on her blog, Mable Chan added the fleets will serve customers with a range of new electric vehicles. She and the fleet operators will meet the press in an official launch ceremony on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The taxi fleet regime was introduced last year as part of the government’s efforts to improve the sector's service quality.
  <br>
  <br>
  The scheme drew keen interest with 15 applicants. Three of them did not meet the prescribed requirements, such as having a driver monitoring system and the provision of online hailing services.
  <br>
  <br>
  The remaining applicants were then vetted by an assessment panel, and five who emerged as winners were each granted a five-year licence.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan also gave updates on the government’s push to adopt new energy vehicles.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said the Transport Department has approved 152 domestic and 409 international electric vehicle models as of the end of 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier amendments to the Road Traffic Regulation meant to enable certain features of these vehicles also took effect today.
  <br>
  <br>
  They include remote parking, which Chan expects to be well-received by many drivers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong's land resources are precious, with many parking spaces being quite compact. You may have seen videos showing skillful parking manoeuvres ... sometimes drivers even need to exit through the sunroof," she wrote.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong-based singer songwriter Khalil Fong has died at the age of 41, his music label revealed on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, Fu Music said Fong passed away gently and gracefully on February 21 after battling a "relentless illness" for five years.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The music and graphic novels he gifted to the world remain an eternal testament to his luminous spirit, a timeless treasure for generations to come," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Born in Hawaii and having debuted in 2005, Fong was known for his soul and R&B music.
  <br>
  <br>
  After releasing his ninth studio album "Journey to the West" in 2016, Fong took a break from his engagements due to health reasons.
  <br>
  <br>
  He made a comeback last October with his final album "The Dreamer", and said back then he was on the road to recovery.

    'Pay freezes show govt serious in tackling deficit'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Saturday said his proposal to freeze civil servant pay aims to show the government's determination in achieving a fiscal balance.
 <br>
  <br>
  In his budget speech on Wednesday, he proposed cutting recurrent government expenditure by two per cent for the coming financial year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some lawmakers and political parties suggested deeper cuts of five to 10 per cent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan told an RTHK programme that salaries were the government's biggest expense, and it was best to take a cautious approach to any cuts.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We need to make some adjustments in this area, while maintaining the level of public services. Even when training staff to use technology, it takes time," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We believe that reducing recurrent expenditure by two per cent annually is more appropriate. If we move too quickly, haste makes waste and the results may not be as good."
  <br>
  <br>
  The finance chief reiterated that he didn't want to rely too heavily on land income, citing the tremendous financial pressure on residents when land and property prices soared in the past.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We don't want housing to be as expensive as it was during times of short supply. So we'll continue our work on land supply. As for releasing prepared land, we can be flexible and take market conditions into consideration."
  <br>
  <br>
  On plans to roll out eight residential plots in the coming year, Chan said land sale plans shouldn't be linked to land premium income and this year's housing supply shouldn't be excessive.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on another radio programme, Chan said the government would expedite the development of the Northern Metropolis, adding that many mainland enterprises had expressed an interest in its development.
  <br>
  <br>
  Infrastructure investment for the Northern Metropolis has increased from HK$90 billion to HK$120 billion annually.

    Card readers will be updated to allow for HK$2 tweaks

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Users will be able to check the remaining number of discounted trips using an Octopus card reader when changes to the HK$2 elderly transport subsidy take effect, the labour and welfare chief Chris Sun said on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The government announced in the latest Financial Budget that there would be a cap of 240 trips per month.
  <br>
  <br>
  After that, while the flat rate of HK$2 remains for rides costing HK$10 or less, the government will only shoulder 80 percent of the cost if the standard fare exceeds HK$10.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a Commercial Radio programme, Sun noted that all 17,000 Octopus card readers in the SAR only allowed users to check the last 40 transactions and the remaining value.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think it's important for them to check whenever they want to check it - how many trips are remaining for that month. Right now, for the Octopus card they are holding, this is not a function with it. So we have to create that function for them to check it out," he told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And also, they have to go to... most likely one of the machines installed in most of the MTR stations where they can check their balance and also the recent transactions. So through that, what we call 'an Octopus card checker', when they just tap the card, they can check how many trips are still remaining for that month."
  <br>
  <br>
  While the government aims to put the changes in place no later than September next year, Sun emphasised that he hopes the amendment can take effect as soon as possible.
  <br>
  <br>
  He says he believes the new measures will help tackle the issue of commuters taking long-haul rides for only short trips.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister emphasised that the government would reach out to elderly in, what he called, a "very, very extensive way", to ensure they were aware of the tweaks.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also reiterated that the impact brought by the changes would be minimal, as 75 percent of the beneficiaries take rides costing less than HK$10.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Sources said the Hong Kong Jockey Club is hopeful that legislation clearing the way for basketball betting will be passed by lawmakers by September this year.
 <br>
  <br>
  The government revealed in its latest budget that it is looking into regulating basketball betting, and will invite the Jockey Club to submit a proposal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sources said that the club has already submitted a proposal framework and met with government officials on Friday morning.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Jockey Club has suggested that legalising basketball betting could take reference to football betting, which means it will charge a 50 percent duty from net betting revenue.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is expected that after legalising basketball betting, the club could draw 30 to 40 percent of the city's illegal betting turnover to the tune of HK$30 billion a year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sources said that HK$1 billion to HK$2 billion has to be invested in infrastructure, such as the development of a new computer system that would be rolled out in 2026/27.
  <br>
  <br>
  It's also expected that HK$1.5 billion in tax revenue could be generated for the government after four years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sources said the club will step up public education on basketball betting.
  <br>
  <br>
  The club will contribute HK$50 million a year to the Ping Wo Fund that aims to help those with a gambling addiction.

    'Not enough separation for planes after take-off'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An unspecified number of air traffic control staff have been suspended over an incident involving two cargo planes that triggered an alert after take-off.
 <br>
  <br>
  According to the Civil Aviation Department (CAD), the two aircraft were cleared to take off from Hong Kong International Airport on Thursday morning, heading to Turkmenistan and Azerbaijan.
  <br>
  <br>
  One of the cargo planes was told by air traffic control to climb to 5,000 feet, and the other to 3,000 feet, to maintain separation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "However, as the climbing rates of the two cargo flights varied from what the (air traffic control) officers had anticipated, the desired vertical separation was not achieved," a government statement read.
  <br>
  <br>
  "During this time, both cargo flights followed standard departure procedures and maintained visual contact with each other."
  <br>
  <br>
  The second plane then descended to 2,500 feet after its traffic collision avoidance system issued an alert to its crew.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both aircraft continued to their destinations according to their flight plans.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CAD said preliminary information showed the incident might be due to air traffic control staff failing to abide by take-off protocols, and those involved have been temporarily removed from frontline duties.
  <br>
  <br>
  Secretary for Transport and Logistics Mable Chan on Friday said the department has been ordered to submit a report on the case.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The report has to include, for example, procedures and staff related to the incident. I hope it can help prevent similar incidents in the future and allow us to do better," she said.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Transport and Logistics Bureau is aiming to complete a review on the fixed penalties for traffic-related offences and various fees and tolls this year, its chief said on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  In the latest financial budget, the government revealed that it is hoping to increase revenue by HK$2 billion annually by doing so.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a press conference, Mable Chan said the bureau will focus on traffic charges that have not gone up for years.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Take parking meters as an example, [the charge] has not been adjusted for more than 30 years. And for fixed penalties for traffic-related offences such as parking [illegally], those too have not been adjusted for almost 30 years," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Therefore, our intention, apart from adhering to the principle of exercising fiscal prudence, is also to pay attention to traffic management, as well as road safety."
  <br>
  <br>
  The transport minister said officials hope "an appropriate adjustment" can serve as a deterrent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan noted that drivers have to pay tolls at eight out of 18 government tunnels.
  <br>
  <br>
  She assured the public that the government will also consider people's affordability when carrying out the review.

 Hong Kong's fencing king and two-time Olympic gold medallist Edgar Cheung has encouraged students to never give up in the face of adversity.
 <br>
  <br>
  He was attending a student-sharing session after receiving an outstanding athlete award worth HK$3.375 million from his alma mater, Lam Tai Fai College.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cheung, who captured gold in the individual foil event in Tokyo in 2021 and in Paris last year, told students that it's not all glamorous for athletes.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The government said on Friday that eight residential plots it plans to roll out in the coming financial year can house around 4,450 flats, more than a fifth less than the figure from the current fiscal year.
 <br>
  <br>
  Development Secretary Bernadette Linn said none of the plots in the coming land sale programme are able to accommodate more than a thousand units.
  <br>
  <br>
  Five of the sites are in urban areas, in Tsuen Wan, Shau Kei Wan, Jordan Valley, Ngau Tau Kok and Ta Kwu Ling.
  <br>
  <br>
  The others are in Tung Chung, Stanley and Tuen Mun, whose Hoi Chu Road plot for around 500 homes will be introduced in the next quarter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Linn said officials want to roll out sites in urban areas because there are signs the property market is recovering and these plots should be quite attractive.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said some of them used to be school campuses, wet markets or planned community sites and officials decided to rezone them for housing because they were no longer needed for their original purpose.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Some of the government sites that have been developed in the past are not put to gainful use. Perhaps they have a lower development density, and after review we think that those sites can be put to better use," she told a press conference about the latest budget.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So given that this is an ongoing task, I would not rule out the possibility of more of such sites being rezoned for residential or commercial uses in future years."
  <br>
  <br>
  Linn said officials will study the market situation before deciding which of the rest of the plots to put up and when.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister added that the government decided not to keep three plots from this year in the next land sale programme, because of market conditions.
  <br>
  <br>
  She noted that one piece of land is in Kai Tak and said that has been removed because of abundant housing supply in the area. The other two plots to go are in Tuen Mun and Cheung Sha on Lantau.

    Govt seeking clarifications over latest US tariffs

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development Algernon Yau on Friday said authorities are seeking clarifications as to whether new additional tariffs on Chinese imports announced by the US also cover goods from Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  US president Donald Trump announced on his social media overnight that he will slap extra 10 percent tariffs on Chinese imports from March 4, on top of additional 10 percent levies imposed earlier this month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters at a press briefing, the commerce chief said the US tariffs are "unreasonable", reiterating that SAR authorities are filing an official complaint to the World Trade Organisation (WTO) over the earlier tariffs move.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have to understand better the details of this [latest] imposition, whether the Hong Kong production and products are included or excluded, so we are making assessments for the time being and seeking clarification," Yau said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Actually the volumes of Hong Kong products trading with the US are very minimal, accounting for only 0.1 percent of the total exports of Hong Kong, so the impact is not very significant at the moment," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  US officials earlier confirmed that the first set of additional tariffs applies to Hong Kong, to which the SAR government responded by saying the US ignored the fact that Hong Kong is a separate customs territory as stated in Article 116 of the Basic Law and recognised by the World Trade Organisation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, Yau noted that Hong Kong is in discussions with Malaysia and Saudi Arabia on setting up economic and trade offices in the two countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that Hong Kong is exploring investment agreements with Saudi Arabia, Bangladesh, Egypt and Peru, while actively seeking to join the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP).
  <br>
  <br>
  On another note, the commerce chief said Hong Kong remains a major investment hub as 10,000 overseas companies had settled in the SAR by the end of last year, a 10 percent rise on the number at the end of 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yau said while about one fifth of those firms come from the mainland, 1,400 are from Japan and another 1,400 are from the US.
  <br>
  <br>
  There are also about 720 firms from the UK and 520 from Singapore, which indicates that the city is attractive to foreign investors from various regions, he said.

    Ethnic minority advocacy group Unison to wind up

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong Unison, a group advocating the rights of the city's ethnic minorities, on Friday announced it was starting its dissolution process, saying its “historical mission has been successfully accomplished.”
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters after an executive committee meeting, committee chair Alice Chong said winding up the group was not an abrupt decision and it had started discussions around two or three years ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said 16 out of 17 members with voting rights supported the disband motion, adding it had nothing to do with political or financial matters.
  <br>
  <br>
  “There are already more than 30 NGOs and groups that are now providing services and support in education, welfare, job and health to ethnic minority people. We are sure that they will be in good hands. We are also happy to [see] the government [has made] ethnic minority people as one of their priorities,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chong said the decision was backed by most former board members.
  <br>
  <br>
  She also noted the group had about HK$4 million in assets and after covering staff severance and long-term service pay, the rest of the money would be donated to other charity groups with similar goals.
  <br>
  <br>
  The organisation’s former executive director, John Tse, said he had not been consulted and called the move to disband “irresponsible”.
  <br>
  <br>
  “How can we say that we’ve accomplished what we set out for? No one would say that, because look at the Hong Kong society, racism, discrimination against ethnic minorities, they’re so common,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tse also noted the process of planning for winding up started back in September, but he was only instructed to stop receiving donations in late January.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added he and two other former staff members were planning to start a new group to continue their work helping ethnic minorities.
  <br>
  <br>
  Former project officer Javria Khalid said she was let go a month ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I’m so hurt, I feel like that we have let our ethnic community down,” she said. “I'm so speechless right now. I don't even know how to tell the parents, the students, the awardees, everyone that Unison is shut down.”
  <br>
  <br>
  She said about 100 people, as well as over 10 ongoing projects, which include Chinese classes and mental health counselling sessions, would be affected.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong Unison was founded in 2001 and was registered as a charitable organisation four years later.
  <br>
  <br>
  It advocated for various policy changes to improve ethnic minority rights in Hong Kong, including the promotion of teaching of Chinese as a second language as well as getting the Race Discrimination Ordinance to come into effect in 2009.

    'Preparations for sports park opening in final stage'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Cultural, Sports and Tourism Secretary Rosanna Law on Friday said the opening of the Kai Tak Sports Park is only the beginning of many mega events in March, adding that preparations are in the final stage.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a press conference, Law said there will be a simple but grand ceremony on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The preparation for the opening of Kai Tak Sports Park is of course, at its final stage and a very intensive stage. Of course, rehearsals are ongoing, and then we are making final preparations for all the logistic arrangements," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked about reports that Singapore will host concerts this year by American singer Lady Gaga, Law said Hong Kong will host Asian superstars and singers who haven't performed here for a long time.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are doing all we can with the Kai Tak Sports Park, the Tourism Board and other relevant bodies to try to attract and invite as many as possible international mega events to Hong Kong. It may or may not necessarily be just popular concerts."
  <br>
  <br>
  In his budget speech on Wednesday, Financial Secretary Paul Chan said the government will earmark HK$1.2 billion for the Tourism Board, lower than the HK$1.5 billion in the current fiscal year.
  <br>
  <br>
  In response to this, Law said the Tourism Board has enough reserves and she hopes the board will use its resources prudently.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Each year, HKTB will be monitoring very closely and announcing the tourist spending and the tourist duration of stay, both for overnight visitors and for same-day visitors. These will obviously be some of the KPIs that we will be looking for," she said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The government says people attending the opening ceremony for Kai Tak Sports Park on Saturday evening must get their tickets by 3pm on the day.
 <br>
  <br>
  Some 8,000 people received vouchers which have to be exchanged in person for the tickets they bought.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sports Commissioner George Choi said on Friday morning that so far, nearly half of the buyers have collected their tickets.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said while the ceremony will begin at 6.30pm, the 3pm cut-off time for ticket exchanges is necessary for the sake of crowd control.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our gates will open at 4.30pm for the opening ceremony," Choi said at a press conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If there are many people queuing for ticket exchange at the last minute, we don't want so many people colliding, going in different directions at the same time."
  <br>
  <br>
  In total, more than 30,000 people are expected to attend the ceremony in the Kai Tak Stadium, with officials urging them to travel to the venue by public transport.
  <br>
  <br>
  Choi said no parking will be available at the Kai Tak Mall inside the sports park on Saturday, a restriction that will also be in place for future large-scale events there.
  <br>
  <br>
  There will be a special pick-up and drop-off zone on Sung Wong Toi Road for those arriving by private car or taxi.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials noted that no professional cameras, long umbrellas or water bottles will be allowed in the stadium, also reminding people that ticket scalping is not permitted.

    Home prices drop to almost 8.5-year low

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong home prices retreated to their lowest level in nearly eight and a half years in January.
 <br>
  <br>
  Figures from the Rating and Valuation Department on Friday showed that the city's home price index dropped to 287.6, from 288.9 in December.
  <br>
  <br>
  That marked a 0.4 percent decline on a monthly basis and a 6.5 percent retreat from a year before.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prices had risen in October and November after cheaper borrowing costs attracted buyers to take the plunge.
  <br>
  <br>
  Commenting on the latest data, Eddie Kwok, executive director of valuation and advisory services at consultancy CBRE Hong Kong, said January was low season for the property market due to the Lunar New Year holiday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kwok also partially attributed the declines to developers rolling out new residential projects while also pushing existing inventories.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he said he expects a rebound later this year, noting that home prices are highly correlated with the city's stock market performances.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If the Hang Seng Index remains at its current level or continue to increase, we expect residential prices for the secondary market to stabilise and potentially pick up going forward," he said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rental prices continued to edge up in January, with the official key gauge rising to its highest level in four months to stand at 192.9.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Friday said overseas firms were still keen on the mainland market and on Hong Kong's position as a gateway to that, a day after US President Donald Trump said a further 10 percent levies on China would be going ahead.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chan was commenting on Friday during an RTHK radio phone-in programme on his 2025-26 budget that he unveiled on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We try to reinforce the relationships and trading relationships with developed economies, US, Europe, because for them, in our contact with them, many of their businesses are still very interested in the mainland market, and Hong Kong will be the natural landing platform for them, using this platform to access the mainland market and to expand in the region," said Chan.
  <br>
  <br>
  He stressed the importance of Hong Kong re-aligning itself as a high value-added supply chain management centre, as well as opening up new capital markets in the Middle East and Southeast Asia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan's budget on Wednesday announced cuts to thousands of civil service jobs and a boost in spending in artificial intelligence as it seeks to tackle a deficit of HK$87 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  One caller, Ng, noted that a number of projects that were issued grants under the Innovation and Technology Fund were related to medical and healthcare, yet the government focused on AI and new industrialisation in his speech.
  <br>
  <br>
  He asked: "Is it because the government has evaluated these [healthcare] projects? They have granted the subsidies and they are useless?"
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said the government would continue to invest heavily in medical and healthcare, and continue to give grants to universities but would shift the focus to the private sector and industry-led research.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Lok Ma Chau Loop between the border of Hong Kong and Shenzhen will be a major area for these companies to be located. And also we think perhaps it would be wiser not just using government's money, but also using market resources. That is why we put up a scheme on a matching basis to co-invest with general partners, which are fund managers in these areas," said Chan.
  <br>
  <br>
  The finance minister also stressed how technology could take away some of the burden of civil servants to ensure public services are not affected, as the administration gradually reduces its headcount.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have set aside resources and provided training to help our various [departments] to use technology tools to enhance their work efficiency and also take the opportunity to streamline, to review their operational model and procedures, to see how this could be further rationalised and optimised."
  <br>
  <br>
  Another caller, Steven, expressed disappointment that the non-means-tested one-off student grant of HK$2,500 would not be continued, and asked whether the government cared about the city's birthrate and providing support to parents.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said the budget allocation for education continued to exceed HK$100 billion a year, which he described as "a very substantial investment."
  <br>
  <br>
  He went on to say that the Education Bureau considered that student grant, being non-means-tested, was not targeted to help those in need.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The SAR government has condemned members of the US Senate Committee on Foreign Affairs, accusing them of making baseless allegations against Hong Kong's national security law.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, the government dismissed what it described as a so-called resolution criticising Hong Kong's autonomy and its national security law, labelling it "political manoeuvring and reckless clamoring".
  <br>
  <br>
  It called on the US to stop undermining Hong Kong's international reputation and interfering in Hong Kong matters.
  <br>
  <br>
  A government spokesman said US politicians had time and again made skewed remarks about Hong Kong's situation and advocated imposing "sanctions" on the SAR to undermine its rule of law and its prosperity and stability.
  <br>
  <br>
  "National security is the foundation for prosperity and stability in society, as well as the well-being of the people," the spokesperson said, highlighting the success of the law in restoring order after the 2019 unrest and fostering Hong Kong's economic recovery.
  <br>
  <br>
  The spokesperson also criticised the US for its double standards, noting that it has at least 21 pieces of laws safeguarding national security.
  <br>
  <br>
  The spokesperson added that the national security law complies with international human rights standards, reaffirming that Hong Kong's legal system ensures freedom and protection under the Basic Law.
  <br>
  <br>
  On ongoing legal cases, the spokesperson emphasised that all proceedings are based on evidence and the rule of law.

    'Private sector growth high on Two Sessions agenda'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Support for private businesses is a very important area that will be addressed during the upcoming "Two Sessions" meetings in Beijing, according to Hong Kong's sole delegate to the country's top legislature.
 <br>
  <br>
  In the first of our series previewing this year's National People's Congress (NPC) and Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) meetings, NPC Standing Committee member Starry Lee said there is an urgency to attract more private investment to China amid the current geopolitical situation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing has moved to introduce the private economy promotion law, which is designed to ensure private firms receive clear legal protections and create a fairer business environment.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bill includes provisions prohibiting arbitrary fees and fines on private enterprises, and requiring the State Council and local governments at or above the county level to provide regular reports on their progress.
  <br>
  <br>
  It's "set to become China's first fundamental law dedicated to the private sector," according to Xinhua News Agency.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee attended an NPC Standing Committee meeting in the capital this week examining the bill's second draft, ahead of the opening of the NPC session next Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I believe some of the initiatives will be mentioned in the government report... to further invite and encourage private investment," she said in an interview with RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee said the SAR has a role to play in trying to shore up support for the private sector.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With the current geopolitical situation, there is always an urgency to have more private investment to invest in our country, not only from Hong Kong, but from different parts of the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Being one of the most international cities in our country, we have our responsibility to attract more talent, enterprises and technology to come to Hong Kong to help to build further our financial market and also the technology side."
  <br>
  <br>
  This year marks the end of the 14th Five-Year Plan, and Lee said people have high expectations for the next blueprint for 2026-2030 which she believes would be related to the resolution adopted in the third party plenary session last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The NPC Standing Committee member added that the SAR, the Hetao Shenzhen-Hong Kong Science and Technology Innovation Co-operation Zone, as well as the Northern Metropolis will be "key stakeholders" to contribute to the country's development.

    'SAR debt still at very manageable level'

<img alt="Christopher Hui says the ratio of government debt to GDP is less than 17 percent. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1793524_1_20250227181644.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury Christopher Hui said the SAR's debt is still "at a very manageable level", and that the government has maintained close contact with global credit rating agencies relating to its financial position.
 <br>
  <br>
  Hui's remarks came after Financial Secretary Paul Chan announced in his budget that the government plans to issue about HK$150 billion to HK$195 billion worth of bonds annually over the next five years to support infrastructure projects such as the Northern Metropolis.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In fact, we have long been in close contact with some relevant rating agencies and we have very regular communications, so that we'll ensure they know about the specific [financial] situation of Hong Kong, our bond issuance plans, as well as the reasoning on how we manage our finances," Hui said in a press conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're actually maintaining our debts at a very manageable level right now. As you can see, compared with some other economies, the share of our bond issuance to our overall gross domestic product is less than 17 percent. This is actually very manageable level compared with the international level."
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, the financial services and treasury chief noted that authorities hope to improve the city's financial markets by conducting reforms of the stock trading and company listing mechanisms.
  <br>
  <br>
  Measures include the gradual introduction of a new function by the end of the year to enable most stock transactions to settle one business day after the trade date, in what's called the "T+1" settlement cycle.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hui said that the new settlement cycle will help improve the quality of the city's stock trading, as the current "T+2" settlement cycle is lagging behind other international peers, such as the US, Canada, and Mexico.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's a global trend, really, in terms of increasing capital deployment efficiency, and allow capital to be returned to the investors sooner, so that they can utilise it further," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other reform measures include the establishment of a "technology enterprises channel" by the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing to help specialist technology and biotechnology companies, especially those listed on the mainland, seek listings in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hui said that the new channel will provide "tailor-made" assistance and guidance for those firms to prepare better before they submit their IPO applications.

    'Govt needs time to get ready for HK$2 subsidy tweaks'

<img alt="Chris Sun says only 360 people were found to have taken more than 240 trips a month under the HK$2 transport subsidy scheme. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1793531_1_20250227185519.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Labour and welfare chief Chris Sun on Thursday said it will take time for the authorities to prepare for changes to the HK$2 transport subsidy scheme, which will be implemented no later than September next year.
 <br>
  <br>
  As outlined in the budget delivered by Financial Secretary Paul Chan the day before, instead of a flat HK$2 fare, eligible commuters will have to pay 20 percent of any standard fare surpassing HK$10.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a press briefing, Sun said the government wants to ensure all 17,000 Octopus readers in the city are properly set up for the "HK$2 flat rate cum 80 per cent discount" scheme, which will take time.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the machines are spread out on the MTR, buses, minibuses and resident coaches, and adjustments can only be made one-by-one at the end of the day.
  <br>
  <br>
  The welfare minister also said changes to the subsidy scheme were made after careful discussions among officials.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We believe we have struck a right balance between, first of all, to preserve as far as possible the very reasons of introducing a HK$2 concession fare scheme, which is to encourage our elderly and the disabled to go out and to see for themselves the beauty of the outside world and also to remain socially connected, and secondly, to make sure the concession fare scheme will be fiscally sustainable into the future,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  As for the proposed monthly cap of 240 trips, Sun said only 360 people were found to have exceeded that number each month between August and November, amounting to less than 1 percent of all such users, so most other elderly and disabled travellers won't be affected.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, Sun said his bureau has invited the 177 non-profit organisations (NGOs) that receive government funding for a meeting next Monday to discuss a proposed 7 percent cut in recurrent government spending through the 2027-28 financial year.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We’ll let them know [how] exactly we’re going to work together to achieve the efficiency gains and yet at the same time providing more flexibility to our NGOs,” he said. "Right now I'm not in a position to provide you with a detailed breakdown."

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Former lawmaker Lam Cheuk-ting and six others were on Thursday sentenced to between 25 and 37 months behind bars each, after earlier being found guilty of rioting in Yuen Long in 2019.
 <br>
  <br>
  The District Court handed down the longest term to Lam.
  <br>
  <br>
  In handing down the 37-month sentence, judge Stanley Chan said Lam showed no remorse and had played a different role than the other defendants in the riot on July 21, 2019.
  <br>
  <br>
  The judge said Lam was well-known and his visit to Yuen Long on the day in question had a “different impact” and had worsened confrontations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan rejected the defence's claim that the defendant had intended to resolve conflicts between two rival groups of people, saying he had “fanned the flames” and failed to ask people to stay calm.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lam will serve three months of his jail term concurrently with the six years and nine months he received earlier for conspiring to commit subversion.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Education Secretary Christine Choi on Thursday said there is "never a good time" to scrap the HK$2,500 student grant but the current financial situation makes it necessary.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a press conference, Choi said the cancellation is expected to save around HK$2 billion annually, which is around two percent of the total education expenditure.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For when to remove the HK$2,500 [student grant] will be the right time, I think there's never a good time to do that, but we are still considering the present financial situation. We have to make a decision," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The education chief said measures are still in place to address the plight of underprivileged pupils and parents.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have different student financial assistance schemes and different resources from the working family financial assistance scheme. We are also considering increasing the flexibility of using different allowances or grants in the schools."
  <br>
  <br>
  Education sector lawmaker Chu Kwok-keung said in a statement that he was not consulted over discontinuing the subsidy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked who was consulted on the measure, Choi said officials don't share specific details about the budget with individual lawmakers.
  <br>
  <br>
  She added that officials talked to different stakeholders about which measures they wanted to keep if spending cuts were needed.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Innovation, Technology and Industry Sun Dong on Thursday said a new Hong Kong AI Research and Development Institute could commence operation as early as next year.
 <br>
  <br>
  Financial Secretary Paul Chan announced in his budget speech on Wednesday that the government will earmark HK$1 billion for the institute's establishment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters, Sun said the institute will not only advance AI research, but also promote its application across various sectors, including innovation and technology, finance, healthcare and government services.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the goal is for the institute to take a leadership role in these areas, and generate business opportunities for the local industry.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The institute will focus on facilitating upstream R&D, midstream and downstream transformation of R&D outcomes and expanding application scenarios. So in terms of the goal and the scale, this AI R&D institute is different from the current InnoHK centre, HKGAI (Hong Kong Generative AI Research and Development Center)," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The AI institute will be established based on the existing HKGAI centre. In the future, we will gradually integrate the InnoHK centre, HKGAI, into the newly established AI research institute."
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, in response to suggestions from lawmakers that Hong Kong should attract the mainland AI company DeepSeek to the city, Sun said all domestic and international AI companies are welcome.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that the recently launched large language model HKGAI V1, the SAR's first locally developed generative artificial intelligence, already incorporates DeepSeek-related technology.

    Govt won't rely on land sales for revenue: Paul Chan

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan said on Thursday that the government no longer wants to rely heavily on land sales as a main source of revenue.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chan made the comment when lawmaker Chow Man-kwong asked him whether officials can come up with measures to boost the market so that it isn't "overly cold".
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a Legco Finance Committee meeting discussing the new budget, Chan said officials hope that homes will be more affordable for the people.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the past, land sales were one of the main sources of government revenue that supported other kinds of development. This led to a surge in property prices because of a lack of supply," the minister said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We no longer want to see the SAR over-rely on land sales revenue. We need to develop the economy so that salaries and profits taxes and other forms of revenue are more important."
  <br>
  <br>
  New People's Party lawmaker Dominic Lee asked whether the Kau Yi Chau Artificial Islands project, previously known as Lantau Tomorrow Vision, is "dead", being as there is no mention of it in the budget.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said officials are prioritising the Northern Metropolis project, while stressing that ongoing studies relating to the artificial islands will continue.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We want to focus on the Northern Metropolis, putting in every effort to speed up that project. Lantau Tomorrow is ranked behind the metropolis for sure," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Business and Professionals Alliance lawmaker Jeffrey Lam, meanwhile, said businesspeople he has spoken to think the proposed HK$200 airport departure tax is too expensive, saying flight tickets to some nearby cities only cost that much.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lam was also among several councillors who questioned whether a land departure tax for private cars is necessary, arguing that it would go against the desire for Hong Kong to integrate further with other Greater Bay Area cities.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said the HK$80 increase in the airport departure tax is only minor.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also said transport officials have received various feedback on the land departure tax, and the government does not have a finalised plan at this moment.

    HKU and CUHK to get 60 more medical training places

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Education Bureau said that medical schools at Chinese University (CUHK) and the University of Hong Kong (HKU) would have 60 more training places in the next academic year.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a paper submitted to the Legislative Council, the bureau said 50 places would be reserved for CUHK and HKU to introduce a new entry track for bachelor’s degree holders who want to pursue medicine as their second degree.
  <br>
  <br>
  It added the remaining 10 places would be allocated to the universities’ existing medicine programmes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The document also stated the number of first-year undergraduates for the eight publicly-funded universities would remain at 15,000 for each year in the 2025-28 triennium.
  <br>
  <br>
  In response to questions from RTHK, CUHK said it would announce details for the “second degree entry track” in due course.
  <br>
  <br>
  Financial Secretary Paul Chan announced in his budget address on Wednesday that the number of medical training places would increase to 650 in total in the 2025-26 academic year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Medical sector lawmaker David Lam said the increase was in line with his expectations, noting it was part of the bureau's ongoing plan to raise medical student intake.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lam said while there was a need for more doctors in view of an ageing population, medical schools cannot increase the number of training places drastically in the short run.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We need to step up the teaching facilities in the universities and maintain a good number of teaching staff. Students also have to learn the clinical skills at the bedside on patients, which means we need enough hospitals to teach our students, and we need enough doctors, clinicians to mentor our students," he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "All these takes time to prepare. That's why the increase has to be gradual."

    FS shoots down levy for all outbound travellers
   </title>

<img alt="" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1793462_2_20250227135507.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Thursday said a proposed levy on private cars departing Hong Kong is aimed at clawing back government spending on cross-boundary facilities, while dismissing the idea of a fee for all outbound travellers over the potential impact on the public.
 <br>
  <br>
  During a radio phone-in programme, Chan fielded questions from callers on a wide range of cost-cutting measures detailed in his budget, including tweaks to the HK$2 transport subsidy scheme for the over 60s and the phasing-out of a HK$2,500 student grant.
  <br>
  <br>
  A caller surnamed Wong said he was confused about the plan to charge private car drivers HK$200 to cross the border, a move the government says should raise about HK$1 billion a year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "What kind of private cars will be levied? If you’re talking about cross-boundary vehicles with closed road permits, usually they have companies set up on the mainland and travel for business purposes," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If you wish to boost revenue, why not tax travellers who leave the city via land border control points?"
  <br>
  <br>
  In response, Chan said quite a lot of money has been spent on cross-boundary facilities, including the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Can we recover some of those costs? That is one of our considerations. Currently we're still in the research stage, and everyone can give their views so the Transport and Logistics Bureau and the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau will consider them," he replied.
  <br>
  <br>
  As for a departure tax for all travellers at land crossings, Chan said such a move would have quite a large impact on the general public, and this should be "avoided as much as possible".
  <br>
  <br>
  Another caller was upset with the scrapping of the HK$2,500 student grant, which has been given out annually to the parents of children in kindergartens and primary or secondary schools since 2019.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Didn't the government tell people to have more children? You cancelled this subsidy, but at the same time provide half a month of extra payment to recipients of social security and Old Age Allowance … What are the middle class like us supposed to do?” asked a woman surnamed Chan.
  <br>
  <br>
  The financial chief acknowledged her concerns, but stressed that public resources should go to those most in need.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Right now, this HK$2,500 does not require any means test and everyone is eligible … so we think if we were to cut down on expenditure, it has to come from these areas," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, proposed tweaks to the HK$2 transport scheme for the over 60s also drew a lot of feedback.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Why cap the number of trips at 240 per month, instead of raising the concessionary fare to HK$3 or HK$4?" asked a man surnamed Leung.
  <br>
  <br>
  In response, the FS said he wanted to keep the cheapest discounted fares at HK$2 because the scheme is widely recognised by society and encourages the elderly to go out more often.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But by capping the number of trips at 240 [per month], we can limit the future expenditure growth. In the short term, we can even save money when the adjustments are implemented in 2027 or 2028," he said.

 Abraham Ancer is gearing up to defend his LIV Golf Hong Kong title this March, eager to relive the unforgettable moments from last year’s tournament.
 <br>
  <br>
  Ancer secured his first individual victory on the LIV Golf tour in a dramatic playoff against Australia’s Cameron Smith and England’s Paul Casey at the Hong Kong Golf Club.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Mexican golfer said that playing in Fanling is not only enjoyable but steeped in rich history.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's really fun and you have to be extremely accurate, not necessarily hitting it very far, but it's like playing chess, you really have to pick your battles and know when to attack and when to hold back," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I like that kind of golf where you have to think about what you're going to do off the tee, so [Hong Kong] will always be a super special place for me."
  <br>
  <br>
  Bryson DeChambeau, the 2024 US Open champion, is also eager to return to Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  As captain of Crushers GC, he aims to lead his team in defending their title from last season, and deliver an exciting performance for the fans in the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong loves their golf, and they thrive around golf. It was cool to see that last year, how much they embraced all of us and really wanted us to be there and just loved every second of it," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It’s going to be a lot of fun going back there, being the US Open champion, hopefully [we will be] showing some fireworks and winning. I want to win this year."
  <br>
  <br>
  The tournament at the Hong Kong Golf Club will be the third event of the League's 2025 season taking place from March 7 to 9.

 An Executive Councillor on Thursday said most of Hong Kong's senior citizens will not be affected by changes to the city's fare concessionary scheme for the over 60s.
 <br>
  <br>
  As announced in Wednesday's budget, instead of a flat fare of HK$2, eligible commuters will have to pay 20 percent of any standard fare exceeding HK$10.
  <br>
  <br>
  The scheme will also be capped at 240 trips per month, which works out at an average of roughly eight per day.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lam Ching-choi, who formerly chaired the Elderly Commission, was speaking to RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Only a small percentage of them, they might travel quite a lot because actually, we set the limit quite liberally, I don't think it will affect most individuals who are just trying to visit their grandchildren, or going to work" he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "On average, I believe 99 percent of individuals won't exceed the limit," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Wednesday said this fine-tuned proposal preserves the government's policy intent while striking a balance between enhancing the sustainability of the scheme and minimising the impacts to beneficiaries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Government sources said the new arrangements are expected to come into force in September 2026.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The sailing industry on Thursday said they welcomed Financial Secretary Paul Chan’s plan to build a new waterfront landmark in Hung Hom, with a yacht club mooted there.
 <br>
  <br>
  Delivering his budget speech the day before, Chan said the MTR Corporation has been asked to conduct a study to develop an area south of Hung Hom Station, as well as nearby pier sites.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is definitely good news to promote yachting and yachting tourism in Hong Kong," the Commodore of the Royal Hong Kong Yacht Club Adrian Pang told
  <a href="https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/news-programmes/this-episode.htm?cmsid=77" target="_blank">
   RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme
  </a>
  .
  <br>
  <br>
  Pang said that currently, Hong Kong lacks berths and moorings for boats that want to visit the SAR, adding that authorities can do more to provide land for yachting.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also pointed out the city’s geography means there is a lot of potential in developing the sailing industry.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If you look at Hong Kong, we are unique in a sense that if you look at the Greater Bay Area, we have the most beautiful coastline, we have all the ecoparks."
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities want the Hung Hom landmark to also include "iconic commercial and residential developments, retail, dining and entertainment facilities".
  <br>
  <br>
  "I welcome the government to do more studies and hopefully we can develop more sites," Pang added.

    Universities 'fully prepared' for funding cut

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Several public universities on Wednesday said they understood the public finance challenges faced by the government, and are fully prepared for a funding cut.
 <br>
  <br>
  This follows Financial Secretary Paul Chan's announcement in his budget speech that publicly-financed universities will see funding slashed by two percent. The reduction will be compounded over three years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said the move will result in savings of HK$2.8 billion between 2025-28.
  <br>
  <br>
  The University Grants Committee also revealed in a subsequent statement that universities need to return HK$4 billion from their General and Development Reserve Fund to the government in a one-off special arrangement.
  <br>
  <br>
  In response to the development, Chinese University said it understood the need for all sectors to work together during tough times, adding that it will carefully study the potential impact on its operations, and minimise disruption to teaching and research.
  <br>
  <br>
  The sentiment was shared by City University, which said in a statement that it will actively explore diverse income sources and seek additional research funding.
  <br>
  <br>
  Polytechnic University also echoed the views, saying it will find ways to optimise its fiscal resources by controlling its expenditure and increasing revenue.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the University of Hong Kong said it'll work through tough times as part of the society, but hoped the administration will review university funding policies when the economy gradually recovers.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The government’s move to pause the sale of commercial land in the upcoming fiscal year has drawn mixed views from analysts – some say it will ease a supply glut of office space while others felt it will have limited impact to the market.
 <br>
  <br>
  The vacancy rate of Grade-A offices reached a record 17 percent in January, according to commercial real estate agency Colliers.
  <br>
  <br>
  That translates to 14 million square feet of empty floor space, while another 5.5 million square feet will be rolled out this year and 2026.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kathy Lee, head of research and retail consultancy at Colliers, said rental value of prime office space plunged 40 percent over the past three years.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think the government is very wise to stop selling any commercial land, [so as] to let the market to have some time to digest and absorb the existing available stocks," she told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee added the decision to halt the sale of commercial land was not out of the blue, citing the example of the Queensway Plaza redevelopment which was put on ice amid a market downturn.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Hannah Jeong, head of valuation and advisory services at CBRE, warned the current supply glut will take as long as 10 years to be fully absorbed.
  <br>
  <br>
  On a separate note, the government also extended the $100 concessionary stamp duty to all properties priced at HK$4 million or below, up from HK$3 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee from Colliers welcomed the adjustment, saying it will ease the burden for homebuyers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The interest rates remain at a high level, so a lot of homebuyers might still find it difficult to meet their mortgage duties. I think this will help boost demand for smaller-sized units," she explained.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, JLL Hong Kong chairman Joseph Tsang was less optimistic.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Budget doesn't focus much on the property market. And this measure has no stimulating effect on the housing market but will instead affect government revenue," he said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With the high inventory of residential properties, housing prices are likely to continue falling."

<img alt="Ho Lok-sang says the government has good intentions in trying to cut costs, but that the cap won't offer a major boost to the public coffers. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1793286_1_20250226145154.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An economics professor on Wednesday said he supports proposed changes to the HK$2 transport subsidy scheme but questioned whether capping the number of journeys would offer a significant boost to the public coffers.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 240 monthly maximum number of trips mentioned by Financial Secretary Paul Chan in his budget works out at around eight per day on average in future.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho Lok-sang, adjunct professor of Lingnan University’s Department of Economics, said the government has good intentions in trying to cut costs.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he also said very few over 60s make that many journeys, so the move won't save much for the government.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I don't think capping the number of trips for the elderly makes sense. It's not going to make much effect on the revenue anyway because there are relatively few people who will travel so many times,” he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I think there's really no point in making that kind of provision, because it makes people feel bad and it also tarnishes the government's image in terms of caring for the benefit of the well-being of the elderly.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho added that a small number of people could be affected by the cap, such as those who need to make a lot of transfers.
  <br>
  <br>
  New People's Party chairwoman Regina Ip, for her part, said she welcomes the changes to the fare scheme, which include offering an 80 percent discount for journeys that cost regular passengers more than HK$10, rather than the current HK$2 flat rate subsidised trip.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think the government measures introduced to make it sustainable are fairly moderate," said Ip, who's also convenor of the Executive Council.
  <br>
  <br>
  "(There is) no impact on the qualifying age of those benefiting from this concession, but it would help to solve the problem of paying very little fare for very long journeys."
  <br>
  <br>
  DAB party vice-chairman Holden Chow also supports the changes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We believe the scheme unveiled by the (financial secretary) today is acceptable. It strikes a balance between the [need for] financial sustainability, but at the same time, will look after the needs of the elderly," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The people who live further away from the city centre, including people in Tuen Mun or Tung Chung, they may actually be affected. I think going forward, we will try to explore with the government and see whether there's anything we could do to alleviate the pain of these people."

 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Wednesday said he hopes the public understand that everyone has to play their part when it comes to the city's "belt-tightening", given the tough financial situation.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chan said his budget puts forward a "reinforced version" of the fiscal consolidation programme, which includes a cumulative reduction of government recurrent expenditure by seven percent from now through 2027-28.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to the press, he said the government is moving in the right direction to achieve a fiscal balance.
  <br>
  <br>
  "On the one hand, we try our best to diversify and grow our economy, but at the same time it is a belt-tightening budget, so everybody in the community would need to contribute to this effort," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are trying to do the best we can in minimising the impact on our people, but at the same time, unavoidably, everyone has to chip in a little bit."
  <br>
  <br>
  The finance chief said the government has no plans at present to introduce any new taxes, such as a goods and services tax.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have to pay regard to the following considerations. One is the competitiveness of Hong Kong, in terms of attracting investment and talent. Secondly, if we are to increase revenue, we try to minimise the impact on the average citizen," Chan said.

    University funding cuts 'acceptable': lawmaker

<img alt="Universities will have to return HK$4 billion from their reserves to the government. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1793324_1_20250226165659.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lawmaker and Lingnan University's associate vice president Lau Chi-pang on Wednesday said he believed universities could cope with the proposed funding cuts which he described as "mild and acceptable".
 <br>
  <br>
  In his budget speech, Financial Secretary Paul Chan said he would set aside HK$68.1 billion for government-funded universities over the next three years, which reflect a two percent reduction each year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government said the funding cut could save around HK$2.8 billion for the 2025-28 triennium.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lau told RTHK that universities had been preparing for the reduction and could absorb it without scaling down teaching or administrative staff.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is acceptable in a way that we do have reserves for research, development, and other expenses. So this two percent, if it's only a triennium cut, I would say that the university community can absorb that," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, he noted the city's universities were expanding and competing globally, which requires substantial funding.
  <br>
  <br>
  Universities will also have to return HK$4 billion from their General and Development Reserve Fund to the government on a one-off basis, the University Grants Committee said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lau said while this is not good news, institutions were developing income sources including self-funded postgraduate programmes to help balance the funding cuts.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Of course, we don't welcome any cut because universities are expanding our scope and we are competing with other world-class universities in the ranking, and we are helping our country to build up an even stronger higher education community," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the scrapping of the HK$2,500 student grant from the 2025-26 academic year, Lau believed the impact on low-income pupils would be minimal.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That HK$2,500 was given to students when most students were having these online classes and they require a lot more assistance, but now we are back to a normal situation. So I don't think this is a kind of financial aid that we need to continue," he said.

    'Public sector pay freeze is the best choice'

<div class="itemFullText">
 Executive Council convenor Regina Ip on Wednesday said she supported the government's decision to freeze public servants' pay.
 <br>
  <br>
  This includes civil servants, executive authorities, members of the judiciary, legislators and district councillors.
  <br>
  <br>
  She noted it would be up to the chief executive to decide whether or not to cut the salary of fellow Exco members, or even donate their salary.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think freezing public servants' pay, including our pay, legislators' pay, is the best option forward in the present circumstances," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Cut backs will have ripple effects on the private sector and it will affect the labour sector as well."
  <br>
  <br>
  Financial Secretary Paul Chan announced in his budget that two percent of the civil service would be cut annually between the 2026/27 and 2027/28 financial years, but Ip believes the move will not affect government efficiency.
  <br>
  <br>
  Felix Yip, associate director of the centre for human resources strategy and development at Baptist University, said slashing 10,000 civil service posts by April 2027 is reasonable, given advances in AI.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I guess those jobs may be coming from those administrative positions... We are not talking about effectiveness, but talking about efficiency. They can gain a lot from the application of AI," Yip said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So in that regard, to a certain extent, the cost can be minimal."

    Dose of sweeteners in budget despite belt-tightening

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Efforts to contain government spending didn't stop Financial Secretary Paul Chan from sprinkling some sweeteners into the budget announced on Wednesday, but his offerings were slimmed down this time around.
 <br>
  <br>
  The familiar 100 percent reduction in salaries tax or tax under personal assessment will be provided once again, but this time with a cap of HK$1,500. That's half last year's HK$3,000 ceiling, which itself was half the previous year's HK$6,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  There's also a reduction in profits tax for the current financial year but the cap is being halved as well, also to HK$1,500.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said more than 2.1 million taxpayers and over 165,000 businesses will benefit from these two relief measures which will take a HK$3.1 billion bite out of government revenue.
  <br>
  <br>
  Homeowners, meanwhile, will get a rates concession of up to HK$500 for the first quarter of 2025/26, as will owners of non-domestic properties. Last time, it was HK$1,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  An extra dose of cash for social security recipients has also survived the budget constraints and is unchanged from last year, with an additional half-month payment of regular allowances, including Comprehensive Social Security Assistance payments, Old Age Allowance, Disability Allowance and Working Family Allowance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan also had some good news for people planning to buy property.
  <br>
  <br>
  "To ease the burden on buyers of residential and non‑residential properties at lower values, I announce that the maximum value of properties chargeable to a stamp duty of HK$100 will be raised from HK$3 million to HK$4 million with immediate effect," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  This year's budget sweeteners amount to HK$8.3 billion in total, down from HK$11.5 billion last year.

    Airport departure tax, govt fees to go up

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan proposed in his budget blueprint on Wednesday an increase in air passenger departure tax and certain government fees and charges to help generate revenue, amid a budget deficit.
 <br>
  <br>
  The departure tax for air passengers will go up from HK$120 to HK$200 from the third quarter of the 2025-26 financial year, with Chan saying "the impact on air passengers is expected to be minimal".
  <br>
  <br>
  This will generate HK$1.6 billion in revenue to the government each year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The finance chief also said transport officials will review the tolls of tunnels and major expressways in the city, and explore charging private vehicles travelling via land boundary control points.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The government has cancelled the tolls of some major tunnels and strategic routes three years ago and the tolls of some government tunnels have not been adjusted for over 30 years," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Private vehicles departing the land borders may be subject to a levy, which Chan expects to generate HK$1 billion each year, assuming a fee of HK$200 per car.
  <br>
  <br>
  In addition, the Transport and Logistics Bureau will review annual licence fees for electric vehicles, parking metre charges and fixed penalties for traffic offences.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan also said there'll be a HK$600 application fee for various talent and capital investor admission schemes with immediate effect.
  <br>
  <br>
  The visa fees will be raised to HK$600 or HK$1,300 "based on the duration of limit of stay", and expected to generate HK$620 million each year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For some time in the past, some government fees and charges have not been adjusted in accordance with the established mechanisms. As a result, these fees and charges are not pegged to their costs and fail to reflect the 'user pays' principle," he said.

    Pay freezes, job and spending cuts to tackle deficit

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan said containing government spending would be a top priority for the administration in the coming years as he outlined plans for job cuts, pay freezes and reducing expenditure.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chan said he had instructed all bureaux and departments to review their resource allocation and work priorities, and provide public services in a more cost-effective manner by consolidating internal resources, streamlining procedures and leveraging technology.
  <br>
  <br>
  These moves would lay a "sustainable fiscal foundation for future development", he said, with the government facing a deficit of HK$87.2 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  The finance chief said that in the coming financial year, the government would implement pay freezes for civil servants, executive authorities, members of the judiciary as well as those serving in the legislative and district councils.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among the cost cutting measures, Chan proposed the rate of reduction of recurrent government expenditure would be increased from the original one percent to two percent in the 2025‑26 financial year.
  <br>
  <br>
  This arrangement would be extended for two more years to the 2027‑28 financial year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Taking into account the one percent cut unveiled for the current financial year, the cumulative rate of reduction would be seven percent in total.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said this would deliver a saving in recurrent government expenditure of around HK$62 billion in the coming financial years up to 2028.
  <br>
  <br>
  The financial secretary also said the civil service would be reduced by two percent annually between the 2026-27 and 2027-28 financial years, resulting in about 10,000 jobs cut by April 1, 2027.
  <br>
  <br>
  The cuts in spending will also affect the education sector.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said the government would provide HK$68.1 billion to University Grants Committee-funded universities in the coming three years.
  <br>
  <br>
  This funding has reflected a two percent reduction target each year, which was in line with the magnitude of government's recurrent expenditure cut.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government will not sell any commercial sites in the coming year due to a sluggish commercial property market.
 <br>
  <br>
  "In view of the high vacancy rates of offices in recent years and the relatively ample supply in the next few years, the government will not roll out any commercial site for sale in the coming year to allow the market to absorb the existing supply," Financial Secretary Paul Chan said in his budget speech on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  As for residential sites, Chan said the 2025-26 land sale list comprises eight plots.
  <br>
  <br>
  Along with other property projects, it's expected to generate about 13,700 units.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The government will closely monitor market situation and development, and roll out sites in a paced and orderly manner," Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that the government will prepare land for the production of 80,000 private units in the next five years, with about 65 percent of the plots coming from the Northern Metropolis and Tung Chung New Town Extension.
  <br>
  <br>
  On public housing supply, Chan said the government has identified enough land to meet the supply target of 308,000 flats over the next 10 years.

    FS confirms new limits on HK$2 trips

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Wednesday confirmed that changes are planned to the city's subsidised public transport fares for the over 60s, dubbing the new arrangement "HK$2 flat rate cum 80 percent discount".
 <br>
  <br>
  Journeys will still cost HK$2 in many cases, but for standard fares which exceed HK$10, only a discount of 80 percent will be provided.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another change means the number of subsidised trips per month will be capped at 240, which works out at an average of roughly eight per day.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This fine-tuned proposal preserves our policy intent while striking a balance between enhancing the sustainability of the scheme and minimising the impacts to the beneficiaries," Chan said in his budget address.
  <br>
  <br>
  Government sources said the new arrangements are expected to come into force in September 2026.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the city's Public Transport Fare Subsidy Scheme – which covers people of all ages – is also being made less generous.
  <br>
  <br>
  Instead of people getting back a third of their monthly travel expenses above HK$400, from June the subsidy will only kick in from HK$500. The subsidy cap will remain at HK$400 per month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said the changes to the two schemes will save the taxpayer HK$6.2 billion in the coming five years.

    Govt to regulate basketball betting

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government said it will explore regulating basketball betting activities and invite the Hong Kong Jockey Club to submit a proposal on the matter.
 <br>
  <br>
  Financial Secretary Paul Chan said in his budget speech on Wednesday that there have been public concerns about illegal basketball betting in the city in recent years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said according to the latest Jockey Club assessment, turnover of illegal basketball betting reached HK$70 billion to HK$90 billion last year, and he stressed the need to combat illegal betting activities in an effective manner.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong Jockey Club said in a statement that it would submit a detailed proposal to the government, adding it is eager to collaborate on this important policy initiative.
  <br>
  <br>
  The club said the move is essential for addressing the surge in illegal basketball betting, which has contributed to social issues such as loan sharking and underage gambling.
  <br>
  <br>
  It added that regulating basketball betting would not only combat illegal betting activities, but also enhance the club's ability to make charitable contributions and generate tax revenues.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sports sector lawmaker Kenneth Fok welcomed the move, noting that this approach would not only tackle illegal gambling, but also channel related revenues back to the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  The proposal is projected to generate an additional HK$1.5 billion to HK$2 billion in gambling tax revenue annually for Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I would urge the government on one hand to discuss and also legalise the basketball gambling activities, but on the other hand increase its effort into educating the public through different institutions to make the public aware of the dangers of over gambling or gambling addiction," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[The] NBA also would have more activities in this region, not just in Hong Kong but in our neighbouring Macau. They are planning a lot of new activities which will bring in more fans. This is also maybe a result of such attention on basketball."
  <br>
  <br>
  Fok hopes the Jockey Club can launch related betting projects before the start of the next NBA season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Professor Patrick Lau from the department of sport, physical education and health at Baptist University said that while regulating basketball betting might provide a temporary solution to curbing illegal activities, the long-term consequences could be harmful.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For the long term, the underground betting is still there. The controversial discussion about gambling in sports, ethically I see it's a problem. When we look at the research studies, the findings tell us that whenever those people spend HK$1 on gambling, the government at the end needs to spend HK$4 to treat [addicted] gamblers. So for the long term, we will suffer," he said.

    HK$300m earmarked for enhanced EV charging network

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government will increase its support for electric vehicles (EVs) by launching a HK$300 million subsidy scheme in the middle of the year for a citywide charging network.
 <br>
  <br>
  Paul Chan said it is expected the scheme would provide impetus for the industry to install 3,000 fast chargers for EVs across Hong Kong by 2030.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan noted the need for more charging stations given there are more than 100,000 EVs in Hong Kong, about eight times compared with five years ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  The financial secretary also announced new initiatives to enhance waste reduction at source.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the government would allocate additional funding of HK$180 million for increasing the number of residential food waste smart recycling bins and food waste collection facilities across the city, as well as expanding the city's recycling network and increasing waste recovery.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Tourism Board (HKTB) will get HK$1.2 billion from the government in the coming year to fund its efforts to attract visitors to the city and pursue the concept of "tourism is everywhere".
 <br>
  <br>
  Panda tourism, horse-racing tourism and eco-tourism will be among the products to be promoted, Financial Secretary Paul Chan announced his budget address on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The HKTB will collaborate with more international brands to tell the good stories of Hong Kong's tourism," Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[The board] will continue to support the staging of more meetings, incentive travels, conventions and exhibitions in Hong Kong, which are expected to bring about 183,000 additional visitor arrivals and spending of about HK$1.4 billion."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said he has earmarked money to be spent on encouraging cruise ships to make more calls to Hong Kong and use the city as their home port.
  <br>
  <br>
  The financial chief noted that officials are making an effort to attract more people to take in the sights along Victoria Harbour, adding that new refreshment stalls are planned in various locations "to enrich visitor experience".
  <br>
  <br>
  The government has also asked MTR bosses to look into whether the waterfront and former pier sites south of Hung Hom Station can be used for commercial and residential developments, including a yacht club, Chan said.

 Artificial intelligence will be at the heart of the government's efforts to turn the city into an Innovation and Technology (I&T) and science centre for Asia, according to the financial secretary.
 <br>
  <br>
  As he delivered the budget for 2025-26, Paul Chan pledged the government would support Hong Kong's R&D efforts as well as the industrial application of AI.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said the government would set aside HK$1 billion for the establishment of the Hong Kong AI Research and Development Institute.
  <br>
  <br>
  The finance chief also said the city would enter the Low Earth Orbit satellite sector, calling it the "new trend in global satellite development".
  <br>
  <br>
  The Commerce and Economic Development Bureau and the Office of the Communications Authority would explore a set of streamlined procedures for vetting licence applications for operating Low Earth Orbit satellites, with the relevant work to be completed by this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Additionally, the government would draw up a medium- to long‑term development plan for new industrialisation in Hong Kong, with a HK$10 billion I&T Industry‑Oriented Fund to channel more capital to invest in emerging and future industries of strategic importance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said the government would invite relevant organisations show their interest in the plans and will to seek funding approval from Legco in the middle of this year.

    Paul Chan delivers 2025-26 budget

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Wednesday delivered his 2025-26 budget to the Legislative Council.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chan started the speech for his financial blueprint – which aims to tackle an estimated HK$100 billion deficit – by saying that Hong Kong needs to reform, innovate and relentlessly improve.
  <br>
  <br>
  He pointed out that though counter-cyclical measures launched in the past few years to counter the pandemic have stabilised the economy and eased people’s burden, it has resulted in a fiscal deficit.
  <br>
  <br>
  “In this budget, I propose a reinforced version of the fiscal consolidation programme, including a cumulative reduction of government recurrent expenditure by seven percent from now through 2027-28," he told lawmakers at Legco.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Strictly containing public expenditure is a must, but we should proceed in a steady and prudent manner, and be careful to find a balance among the various impacts that may arise in the process.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The finance minister also said the “approach represents our all-out effort to minimise the impact on public services and people's livelihood”, adding that "it gives us a clear pathway towards the goal of restoring fiscal balance”.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the SAR's economic growth, Chan said authorities forecast that Hong Kong's gross domestic product will continue to grow moderately this year, rising two to three percent in real terms.
  <br>
  <br>
  The economy grew by 2.5 percent in 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also forecast that the economy will grow, on average, by 2.9 percent a year in real terms from 2026 to 2029, with underlying inflation expected to be at an average of 2.5 percent a year.

    FS mulls ways to cut spending, boost revenue in budget

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 With the government facing a budget shortfall of almost HK$100 billion, all eyes will be on how the financial secretary plans to cut spending and increase revenue when he delivers his budget speech on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Paul Chan is expected to address civil service pay and announce possible reductions in expenditure in some areas.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some people see freezing or even reducing civil service pay as a way to help rein in the deficit and achieve fiscal stability.
  <br>
  <br>
  But others argued that such a move could have a knock-on effect for the wider workforce, as many private firms refer to government salaries in making their own wage decisions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lawmaker Ronick Chan, representing the finance constituency, has said freezing or cutting civil service pay would affect millions of workers in the city, and may cause changes in people's consumption patterns, leading to a vicious cycle.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials may also try to save money by cutting spending in other areas, with the financial secretary having cited healthcare and education earlier.
  <br>
  <br>
  Health minister Lo Chung-mau has said putting public resources to good use is everyone's responsibility. "Nobody should be wasteful... It should be everyone in Hong Kong, and all government departments... We hope our patients make good use of healthcare resources and don't waste medicine. Like they take extra and just keep them at home, or even throw them away."
  <br>
  <br>
  The chairman of the Hospital Authority, Henry Fan, said the authority will fully cooperate with government policies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Paul Chan stressed the government will propose an enhanced fiscal-consolidation strategy to control public expenditure stringently, while using other public resources to speed up the city's development.
  <br>
  <br>
  On ways to boost revenue, he has highlighted the user-pays principle, meaning those who can afford to should pay more and at the same time minimising the impact to the average people.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Taxation Institute said the government could consider raising the standard salaries tax rate for high-income earners from 16 percent to 17 percent, to help boost the public coffers.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the financial secretary has also said the administration will have to tread carefully when considering tax reforms, and many factors have to be taken into consideration.

 A man on Tuesday was sentenced to 14 months in prison for trafficking in a dangerous drug last year.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 24-year-old man was arrested in November as he was leaving Hong Kong from the Lok Ma Chau Spur Line Control Point.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officers seized about 0.3 grammes of cocaine under the insole of his sneaker.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was sentenced at the Fanling Magistrates' Courts in contravention of the Dangerous Drugs Ordinance.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Customs and Excise Department welcomed the deterrent sentence, saying it duly reflected the gravity of the offence.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under the law, the maximum penalty for dangerous drug trafficking upon conviction is a fine of HK$5 million and life imprisonment.

    Three arrested 'for claiming to sell Kai Tak tickets'

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police have arrested three people for allegedly claiming they had spare tickets on sale for the opening ceremony of the Kai Tak Sports Park on Saturday, with tickets reportedly being offered at marked up prices.
 <br>
  <br>
  A total of 8,500 tickets for the opening ceremony on March 1 were available at HK$10 each and were snapped up within around half an hour of being available on February 21.
  <br>
  <br>
  As many as 33,600 spectators are expected to attend the star-studded event.
  <br>
  <br>
  Those who successfully made a purchase online via a real-name registration system will first receive electronic vouchers to exchange for the real tickets at a later date.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a press conference on Tuesday, police officers accused the trio of jacking up the prices and intending to sell the tickets online at a range between HK$100 and HK$2,000 each.
  <br>
  <br>
  Preliminary investigations showed two of the suspects did not hold the vouchers and the force has yet to ascertain whether the coupon held by the remaining person was authentic.
  <br>
  <br>
  The force added it has not ruled out making further arrests.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sports commissioner George Tsoi said successful buyers can only get the actual tickets from Thursday, two days before the opening ceremony.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When the exchange takes place, we will check the voucher holder's identity. If the identity does not match, no tickets will be issued, and the person will not be able to enter the venue," he said.

 The Cross-Harbour Tunnel was forced to shut partially for more than an hour on Tuesday after a piece of concrete fell from the ceiling and hit a vehicle.
 <br>
  <br>
  Police said they received a report shortly after 1pm of a car travelling through the tunnel being hit by a concrete slab that measured about 50cm by 50cm.
  <br>
  <br>
  No one was hurt in the incident.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong Island-bound fast lane was closed for emergency repair works, leading to congestion. It was reopened to traffic at 2.48pm.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong Disneyland on Tuesday said it enjoyed its strongest ever business performance in the last fiscal year, with a record net profit of more than HK$830 million and highest ever attendance figure of 7.7 million.
 <br>
  <br>
  The theme park said its revenue grew by more than 50 percent year-on-year to HK$8.8 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Managing director Michael Moriarty said the park will be celebrating its 20th anniversary from June onwards.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Hong Kong Disneyland's 20th anniversary is going to be one of the top mega events for the town to rally around. We're working with other partners as well who are just as excited,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I think with our combined effort, this can be a major draw for Hong Kong arrivals, giving reasons for people to come back, not to just to Hong Kong Disneyland, but to Hong Kong.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Moriarty said the celebrations will include the park's largest ever parade called “Friendtastic!”, and a special edition of the night show “Momentous”.
  <br>
  <br>
  The park will also expand its Marvel-themed section and create a Pixar entertainment experience, with construction work to begin this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The theme park also announced a pay rise of 3.6 to 5 percent for eligible cast members, backdated to the beginning of this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said eligible full-time staff will also be awarded discretionary bonuses equivalent to 1.8 to 2.4 months' worth of their base salary.

    Drug warehouse raid finds HK$430m of cocaine

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police arrested two men following a raid on a drug warehouse, where officers seized approximately 520 kilogrammes of suspected cocaine, valued at over HK$430 million.
 <br>
  <br>
  Officers intercepted the men at a residential building in Tseung Kwan O on Sunday, discovering two kilos of cocaine in one man's bag, along with an additional 518 kilos in their unit.
  <br>
  <br>
  Senior Inspector Tong Wai-kwok, from the Narcotics Bureau, said the cocaine was suspected to have been smuggled into the city from South America via shipping freight.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The drug trafficking group simultaneously rented a unit in Kwai Chung, where they used legitimate logistics companies to transport drugs arriving in Hong Kong to the Kwai Chung unit for processing," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There, over 1,500 boxes of frozen goods were inspected, and some cocaine concealed within was extracted, repackaged, and disguised as regular cargo. The drugs were then transferred to a private residential unit for storage and distribution."
  <br>
  <br>
  Tong said the group frequently changed locations through different logistics and transport companies to evade detection.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chief Superintendent Ng Kwok-Cheung said the two men, aged 22 and 23, were unemployed and likely committed these crimes to make money quickly.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two men were arrested for drug trafficking, and the case will be brought to the Kwun Tong Magistrates' Courts on Wednesday.

    'Child car seats wouldn't work on public transport'

<div class="itemFullText">
 A new law requiring child car seats or other extra restraints to be fitted in private vehicles carrying children would be too difficult to implement on public transport, the government said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  From November, child restraining devices must be used in private cars for children under eight, unless they are at least 1.35 metres tall.
  <br>
  <br>
  A chief engineer at the Transport Department, Eddy Wu, said half of traffic accidents affecting under eights involve private cars.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that it would be difficult for public transport operators to install restraining devices to suit all child passengers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Children of different ages require different kinds of restraints. For example, older children only need a booster seat, while infants need a baby car seat," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If public transport operators also had to offer suitable devices for children of different ages, or offer a certain quantity, it might create obstacles for their daily operations."
  <br>
  <br>
  Wu also explained why children at least 1.35 metres tall will not need extra restraints. He said this is because their feet will touch the floor and an adult seatbelt would not cut into their necks.
