    HA looking to use AI to identify high-risk patients

<div class="itemFullText">
 Public hospitals hope that artificial intelligence will help them identify and treat high risk patients at an earlier stage.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Hospital Authority's head of information technology and health informatics, Dr Cheung Ngai-tseung, said the authority was looking to incorporate AI into the existing clinical management system, which contains more than 10 million patients' records, to create automated tools to tailor individual treatments.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hospital services have been digitalised, including having paperless patient records that allow for real-time information updates on the authority's HA Go app, which enhances patients' self-care abilities.
  <br>
  <br>
  AI could be used to remind patients of specific prescriptions and laboratory results in the form of a blue elf on the screen.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dr Cheung spoke about future plans to further develop the system.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So the general capabilities as described is perhaps things like, more use of AI, more use of personalisation, more communication techniques, that sort of thing. Plus specific targeted interventions that will be maybe disease-specific or specific workflows that exist in today's hospitals," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dr Cheung added that more work was needed on specific cases and they were working on a fifth generation of the system.

    OSC funding helps promote inclusiveness in hiking

<div class="itemFullText">
 A charity advocating for the conservation of the city's countryside through connecting the public with nature is one of the beneficiaries of this year's Operation Santa Claus (OSC).
 <br>
  <br>
  Accessible Trails - a programme dedicated to promoting the benefits of nature to all walks of life - was started in 2017 by Parks and Trails Limited. The charity was founded in 2014 as a mobile application TrailWatch, which gives hikers a platform to track their hikes and report incidents of damage to trails.
  <br>
  <br>
  Its head of communications, Kwong Sum-yin, said the project also helped wheelchair users enjoy greater access to the countryside.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In Hong Kong, the countryside is actually very convenient. But for some groups of people, it is not as accessible as we think, especially those with disabilities," Kwong said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The project comprises two parts; first it identifies suitable hiking trails for wheelchair users and then it brings participants, their family members and volunteers to the field.
  <br>
  <br>
  17 hiking trails have been verified, and more than 180 wheelchair users and their carers have benefited from the programme since it started.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Some of the participants tell us that they've never been to the countryside of Hong Kong, or even the New Territories, because it is very inconvenient for them. [Through the programme], they say they can actually enjoy the environment. They feel peaceful and are very happy about that," Kwong said.
  <br>
  <br>
  But she said limited resources had prevented the programme from organising larger-scale activities.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hiking season in Hong Kong depends on the weather, so it may not be that long. For example, there was one particular trip - we wanted to see the Autumn village - and we have a time concern there as well. Given the limited resources, we cannot organise enough [activities]," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Sometimes, wheelchair users tell us it is very difficult to get into the programme, so they can't really go. We really want to expand this programme and have more resources to let more people to enjoy [the nature]," Kwong added.
  <br>
  <br>
  She also said the funding would be used not only to recruit more wheelchair users, but also volunteers to understand the difficulties of those with disabilities and contribute to create an inclusive experience.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jointly organised by RTHK and South China Morning Post, OSC funds charitable projects that focus on children and youth, the elderly, the community, those with physical and mental disabilities, medical projects, and those concerning the environment.

    Carbon monoxide poisoning leads to government warnings

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) on Sunday said people should only use gas water heaters in well-ventilated areas. It made the comment after a 56-year-old man, and two of his family members, were hospitalised on Saturday with carbon monoxide poisoning after he took a shower.
 <br>
  <br>
  All three were sent to Yan Chai Hospital. The man was later transferred to Pamela Youde Nethersole Eastern Hospital. His two family members, including a 13-year-old, were discharged.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Electrical and Mechanical Services Department (EMSD) also reminded people to only use gas water heaters which have a 'GU' mark, meaning they have been approved by the department.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, the government said all windows in the apartment were shut and the exhaust fan had not been turned on. An on-site inspection conducted by the Electrical and Mechanical Services Department showed that the flueless gas water heater at the home was not suitable to be used in bathrooms. The heater model also lacked approval from the EMSD.
  <br>
  <br>
  The EMSD has seized the gas water heater. It will investigate whether any person has contravened the Gas Safety Ordinance.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CHP said that carbon monoxide is a colourless, odourless and tasteless gas which is a by-product from incomplete combustion of any fuel which contains carbon, such as wood, natural gas and gasoline.
  <br>
  <br>
  Exposure to a low concentration of carbon monoxide can lead to a range of symptoms such as dizziness, headache, tiredness and nausea. Exposure to a high concentration of carbon monoxide can lead to impaired vision, disturbed co-ordination, unconsciousness, brain damage or even death.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 American golfer Patrick Reed has won the Hong Kong open in style, shooting a 22-under overall to clinch the title on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The overnight leader entered the final day with a three-shot lead, after notching a 59, an 18-hole record at the historic Fanling course.
  <br>
  <br>
  The PGA Tour professional ended up edging defending champion, Ben Campbell from New Zealand by the same margin.
  <br>
  <br>
  This was Reed's fifth time playing in Hong Kong, and he told reporters that he was glad to have finally triumphed.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's awesome playing this golf course, to come out and learn from the mistakes from the past on this place, and to go out and really feel like I was in command and control around a golf course," he told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I was able to hit quality golf shots after quality golf shots, which has always been a tough thing around here for me in the past."
  <br>
  <br>
  Local sensation Taichi Kho finished six shots behind Reed, good for a tied-sixth overall.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said he didn't have the best of starts on the final day, but he felt he bounced back well and there were still plenty of positive takeaways.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think I was just really focused out there and I was able to let myself play golf. You know, towards the start of it, I wasn't too comfortable to swing, so I was aiming away, aiming at the middle of the greens," the Hong Kong, China golfer said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But once I felt like I'd gone in the groove of it, I was able to aim at flags a bit more and get a bit more aggressive."
  <br>
  <br>
  Thousands of spectators were on hand for the tournament at the Fanling Golf Course, with many families bringing their children for a nice day out.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among them was Queenie, a mother of two who managed to share a photo moment with Kho.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I’m so excited, I got an autograph, a photograph with him. He’s so nice, very friendly,” she told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tournament was also a test event for next year’s National Games, when golf will be one of eight sports Hong Kong will be hosting while other events take place in Macau and Guangdong.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong Golf Club captain Andy Kwok said both local and mainland officials have been at the site in the past few days to gauge the operation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They assess various aspects of the tournament. My feeling is I think they are quite happy with what the club and the organisers have put forward in this tournament," Kwok told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hopefully we can carry this momentum forward to the national games next year and put together a very good show for both Hong Kong and spectators from afar."

    'Volunteering scheme aims to motivate CSSA recipients'

<img alt="Secretary for labour and welfare Chris Sun says 16,000 CSSA recipients are healthy and can take up volunteering work. Photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1780622_1_20241124164405.jpg&q=70">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for labour and welfare Chris Sun on Sunday defended plans to mandate certain government subsidy recipients to do voluntary work, saying it is a way of helping them integrate into society.
 <br>
  <br>
  Sun was referring to a new Social Welfare Department pilot scheme, which will make it compulsory for unemployed Comprehensive Social Security Assistance (CSSA) recipients aged 15 to 59 to take up at least one hour of unpaid work each week.
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted 16,000 CSSA recipients are healthy adults capable of working, and hoped that the scheme can motivate them to start looking for a job.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We don't want CSSA recipients to feel like they are out of touch ... We think the most viable way is to ask them to do volunteering work. This is achievable and there's a great social need for this kind of work," Sun told reporters after attending a charity event.
  <br>
  <br>
  On a separate note, the labour chief also expressed great concern regarding two fatal industrial accidents on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  One case involved an 18-year-old apprentice, who fell into an escalator shaft in Central.
  <br>
  <br>
  The other fatality was a 57-year-old painter, who died after being trapped on a spider lift platform while working at a Tung Chung public housing construction site.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Labour Department has issued suspension notices to the contractors involved, and is investigating the accidents.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The probe will focus on whether the two sites complied with the necessary work procedures. Everyone knows there are clear guidelines for both escalator maintenance and the use of lift platforms," Sun commented.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also stressed the need to step up promotion and education efforts.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We hope that whenever an accident occurs, other workers in the trade can raise their safety awareness and sense of responsibility ... The government, employers, employees and relevant stakeholders should all work towards this goal."

<img alt="Caption: HKFYG's Employment and Economy Group convenor Tony Lau (centre) says young people still treat Hong Kong as their home. Photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1780628_1_20241124172139.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Five in six young adults in Hong Kong believe the city needs to undergo economic transformation, but only two in 10 of them have considered a career pivot, according to a think tank.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong Federation of Youth Groups urged the government to do more to help fresh graduates and early career professionals plan ahead, as well as boost their confidence towards the city’s future.
  <br>
  <br>
  The group conducted face-to-face interviews of 600 people aged 18 to 34 between
  <br>
  September and October.
  <br>
  <br>
  Less than 40 per cent of respondents agreed that Hong Kong has a positive economic outlook.
  <br>
  <br>
  Around 60 percent of them expressed concerns about various issues, including a potential pay cut and a perceived lack of skills to stay competitive.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite the pessimism, the vast majority still planned on developing their career in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Young people still treat Hong Kong as their home. They are willing to contribute to the economy," said Tony Lau, convenor of the federation's employment and economy group.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is important for the Hong Kong government to cultivate local talent, and they should roll out their utmost measures to retain them and provide training," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Researchers also explained that the majority of respondents had not considered a career transition because of a “lack of clarity” in their direction.
  <br>
  <br>
  Many said they were unsure which industry they could switch to, while others admitted they lacked the skills and knowledge to make a move, or were simply not interested in the openings on the market.
  <br>
  <br>
  The federation suggested young people learn more about the development plans in the Greater Bay Area or Belt and Road countries, and explore opportunities in new markets.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another way to start, researchers said, is to study manpower projection reports, which predict a labour shortage in aviation and innovative technology industries.

    Police arrest 11 over online shopping scams

<img alt='Police seized a batch of so-called "practice" banknotes which are not meant to be used as genuine currency. Photo: RTHK' src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1780603_1_20241124151228.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Sunday said they arrested 11 people, including a student, after busting a local fraud syndicate allegedly behind three online shopping scams involving HK$640,000.
 <br>
  <br>
  Detectives said the scammers, aged 20 to 50, reached out to sellers of luxury spirits and watches.
  <br>
  <br>
  The fraudsters would then ask to meet at an office under a short-term lease. To gain the sellers' trust, the suspects posing as buyers even meticulously inspected the products and spoke industry jargon.
  <br>
  <br>
  The transactions were then settled in cash, or "practice banknotes". The tools are used by bank staff to learn how to manually count currency, and usually bear the words "not for circulation".
  <br>
  <br>
  "The meeting room was carefully set up, and the counterfeit banknotes closely resembled genuine HK$500 notes in size, shape, colour, and texture," said Chau Ho-haung, an inspector with the Wan Chai district crime squad.
  <br>
  <br>
  The scammers even placed real banknotes at the top and bottom of the stack of fake notes, he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  When the sellers eventually realised they had been duped, the suspects had already made off with the goods.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police offered some tips for people conducting face-to-face trades.
  <br>
  <br>
  The money and the goods should change hands simultaneously, detectives said, and sellers should never hand over items before receiving payment.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the case of bank transfers, the seller must also verify the payment has been cleared.

 Two women, aged 38 and 44, have been charged with one count of trafficking in dangerous drugs.
 <br>
  <br>
  Customs arrested them on Saturday, after officers found about 10 kilos of suspected cannabis buds inside their check-in suitcases.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two women had arrived in Hong Kong on a flight from Bangkok.
  <br>
  <br>
  Customs estimate the suspected drugs have a street value of about HK$2.3 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  The case will be brought up at the West Kowloon Magistrates' Courts on Monday.

<img alt="Some travellers were left frustrated by the closure of Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge. Photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1780609_2_20241124141606.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A cross-border road cycling race which doubled as a test event for the National Games held in the Greater Bay Area next year went ahead smoothly on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  A total of 67 cyclists set off from Zhuhai at 9am for the men's individual 230-kilometres event.
  <br>
  <br>
  The peloton arrived in Hong Kong about 90 minutes later via the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge. The cyclists continued east along the North Lantau Highway, and headed back to the mainland after passing Hong Kong Disneyland in Sunny Bay.
  <br>
  <br>
  The race offered authorities a chance to gauge disruption to traffic. Lanes in both directions on the cross-border bridge were closed in staggered intervals to allow the cyclists to pass through.
  <br>
  <br>
  Traffic fully resumed shortly after 12:30pm.
  <br>
  <br>
  But some Hong Kong travellers arriving the border checkpoint were unaware of the temporary arrangements.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I didn't know the roads were closed today. If I'd known, I wouldn't have come. I plan to go home, and return this afternoon," Mr Fong said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Maybe I wasn't paying attention, but there wasn't much information available. I'm really frustrated because I have no idea how to get to Zhuhai," another man bemoaned.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think they should definitely issue more information or reminders on the MTR. There should be announcements at every station. If I'd known in advance, I could have made alternative plans," said another traveller.
  <br>
  <br>
  The unique nature of the race drew a lot of interest from locals.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I saw the news yesterday, so I wanted to come here and take pictures. I used to take part in road cycling races ... I hope Zhuhai will continue to develop this sport and hold similar events every year,” a Zhuhai resident said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another man said he came all the way from Zhongshan to support his former teammates who participated in the race.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I arrived in Zhuhai two days ago because my former teammates also arrived early to acclimatise to the environment. I came here to cycle with them. It really brought back memories of us training together," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sports minister Kevin Yeung said his colleagues would review the arrangements with their mainland and Macau counterparts, and seek further improvements.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said as a result of the road closures, travellers to and from the airport spent 20 to 25 minutes longer on average this morning.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That was already less than what we forecast at the beginning. So I think overall, the test event has been carried out very smoothly,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeung noted three cyclists had to abandon the Hong Kong section of the race, although there were no accidents.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Yeung Tak-keung, the head of the National Games Coordination Office, revealed the General Administration of Sport of China has not decided how many cyclists can sign up for the actual race next year.

    Govt-market integration key for Hetao: Sun Dong

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Secretary for Innovation, Technology and Industry on Sunday said government backing and an efficient market are both necessary, if plans to expand a Shenzhen-Hong Kong tech zone were to succeed.
 <br>
  <br>
  Sun Dong's comments came days after officials unveiled the development outline for the SAR section of the Hetao Shenzhen-Hong Kong Science and Technology Innovation Cooperation Zone.
  <br>
  <br>
  The first phase of the development now covers twice the gross floor area compared to the original scheme.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a radio programme, Sun said he explained to his friends in Shanghai what Hetao is really about.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I told them today's Northern Metropolis is like Shanghai's Pudong district in the old days, and that Hetao is equivalent to Pudong's Oriental Pearl," he recalled.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They immediately understood that this is extremely important for Hong Kong's future development."
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister added mainland officials faced similar challenges when they developed Pudong in the 1990s. But they made it happen, even with a limited budget, he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked about US president-elect Donald Trump's tech restrictions on China and how it might affect Hong Kong, Sun said the city should work more closely with the mainland and strengthen its own technology infrastructure to cope with the complex global environment.
  <br>
  <br>
  The innovation chief also called on local tech companies to procure supplies and equipment from different sources, instead of relying too much on a single market.

    Mixed reactions to third stress test in Kai Tak

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The police on Saturday evening said a test event at Kai Tak had gone smoothly, and the results were satisfactory. They added that they think the venue they used is ready to host more events.
 <br>
  <br>
  But there were mixed responses to the third stress test at the Kai Tak Youth Sports Ground, which was aiming to test communication and trust levels between various departments through scenario-based exercises.
  <br>
  <br>
  The test involved 4,500 civil servants and 500 members of the public.
  <br>
  <br>
  Unlike previous trials, designated seating was adopted this time.
  <br>
  <br>
  The test kicked off at 3.30 pm and was expected to run until 8:45 pm.
  <br>
  <br>
  A man surnamed Wong attending the event, said the trial would finish too late.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They said it will end at around 8:45 pm, but restaurants will already be closing by then. Many places will have called last orders already, so you can't really go out and enjoy dinner. You can only head home directly after the test," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong revealed that he was only told on Monday that he had to attend the event, and he had to reschedule his birthday celebration for it.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another participant surnamed Cheung headed to the sports ground from Sung Wong Toi station.
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted that there are some canopies along the way, but said that it would be better if there were more.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cheung also told RTHK that he appreciated the signage from the MTR station to the venue, adding that the walk took less than 10 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There are a lot of signs and staff. Everything is very clear. We definitely didn't take an unnecessarily long route."
  <br>
  <br>
  But a man surnamed Au said his journey from the Sung Wong Toi area had many zig zag routes, which may take time for the public to familiarise with.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police chief Raymond Siu revealed that officers from the tactical unit were deployed to the stress test.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lawmakers can start moving into new offices on Saturday, with the renovation works for the first phase of the expansion project at the Legislative Council Complex completed ahead of schedule.
 <br>
  <br>
  Writing on his social media, the council's president, Andrew Leung, said that the early move is a testament to the unity and cooperation of all members and staff involved in the project, adding that lawmakers can finally "get to the next level under one roof".
  <br>
  <br>
  The renovation included the addition of four storeys to accommodate offices for the 20 extra lawmakers who joined Legco as part of electoral reforms in 2021, taking the total from 70 to 90 members.
  <br>
  <br>
  Leung said that the relocation will allow all members currently using the nearby CITIC Tower as a temporary office to return to the complex, while also moving members already in the building to higher levels.
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted that some finishing touches are still needed, such as waterproofing the exterior walls, clean up, and interior design, adding that the Secretariat, together with the Architectural Services Department and contractor, would follow up with the matter. He encouraged lawmakers to share their suggestions for improvements.
  <br>
  <br>
  Looking ahead, Leung said that the second phase of the expansion project would start as soon as possible, including the construction of a new conference room and public education facilities.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said he hopes that all expansion projects will be completed before October of next year.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hongkongers were out bright and early on Saturday to celebrate the twin panda cubs' 100 days at Ocean Park.
 <br>
  <br>
  Many donned panda headbands and costumes, while others carried panda toys as they waited to glimpse a broadcast of the cubs on giant LED screens.
  <br>
  <br>
  The older club, weighing 5.3 kilogrammes, was seen lying peacefully in bed, while her little brother, weighing 5.5 kilogrammes, was more lively, patting his sister from time to time.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I am very happy because Ying Ying and Le Le have been in Hong Kong for a while now and they finally have children, so its a joyous occasion," said a woman surnamed Shum.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another woman surnamed Law, who carried a large stuffed panda, said she's been looking forward to today.
  <br>
  <br>
  "My daughters and I love pandas because they're so pure and well-behaved. That's why I take this stuffed panda with me everywhere I go. I even bring it to dim sum. I love taking photos of pandas," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  People were also excited by the reopening of the Giant Panda Adventure facility after two months, which houses the cubs' father, Le Le.
  <br>
  <br>
  Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism Kevin Yeung said a lot of publicity has been done in the SAR to promote the pandas.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The new pandas will be Hong Kong's new tourism ambassadors...in hopes that they will attract more tourists to come," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Visitors also received red eggs and pork knuckle ginger stew with vinegar at the event - dishes served to celebrate the birth of a baby.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ocean Park also said that people can look forward to meeting the two new giant pandas gifted by the Central Government next month.

    Police plan to use test strips to detect 'space oil'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police commissioner Raymond Siu revealed on Saturday that the force made over 90 arrests for offenses related to "space oil" in the first 10 months of this year.
 <br>
  <br>
  Space oil is an emerging drug that is usually inhaled through vapes. It often contains etomidate - a part 1 poison that has to be prescribed by a doctor.
  <br>
  <br>
  Siu told reporters after a passing-out parade that the force is looking to use test strips for detection.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the future, when patrolling officers find someone who's suspicious, let's say the person is suspected of taking space oil, we could immediately use test strips to check. We hope that this could have a deterrent effect," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The police chief pointed out that in an operation carried out in Kwai Tsing district related to space oil, all but four of the 17 arrestees were students.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that the police will step up education by inviting people who used to take the drug, as well as medical workers, to share the hazards of space oil.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government is aiming to list space oil as a dangerous drug next year.

    'Two years suitable to comply with new standards'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Sports sector lawmaker Kenneth Fok said that a two-year time frame is suitable for sports bodies to comply with new standards, adding that the National Sports Associations responded positively to the review report and governance code.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Sports Federation & Olympic Committee (SF&OC) of Hong Kong, China had earlier reviewed the operations and governance of 77 member associations across six key areas - board governance, integrity management, selection of athletes, management of coaches and umpires, administration of membership, and general administration - totalling 243 governance items.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on an RTHK programme on Saturday, Fok, who is also vice-president of SF&OC, noted that nearly 60 percent of these items have been fully or partially implemented.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said that when it comes to selecting athletes, the criteria must be fair, just and open.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think past performance or potential should account for the vast majority of the selection process for all athletes. The responsibility of the National Sports Associations is to write down clear requirements. For each competition, what goals do I hope to achieve and what athletes do I hope to select? Performance may account for 60 percent, and there may be other indicators that account for the rest of the percentage," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The most important principle is that the athlete's performance cannot be buried and cannot be prevented by other factors or institutional factors from being able to perform to the best of their abilities."
  <br>
  <br>
  Fok also said that the code of governance recommends that sports bodies implement a maximum tenure and length of term of office an individual may serve on the Board of Directors, adding that the age should not exceed 70 or 75 years old.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Each sports association faces different situations. Their initial establishment or stage of development and the level of talent participation in their industry or sports field are different. If there's a hard-and-fast age set, it may not necessarily be the best for the development of the sport so it's important to leave room for flexibility," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SF&OC initiated a review of its governance and operations following a 2020 audit report.
  <br>
  <br>
  The body had said that member associations failing to meet the new governance and operational standards in the two-year time frame may face penalties, including reductions in subsidies.

    'Senior staff held more accountable increases morale'

<div class="itemFullText">
 The head of the Hospital Authority emphasised that its plan to hold senior staff more accountable when medical blunders occur will not demoralise workers.
 <br>
  <br>
  The HA announced earlier that it will set up a high-level reform committee to review the responsibility of staff of all ranks.
  <br>
  <br>
  It comes after a review committee, which was set up months ago after a series of incidents, found that the duties of staff are not clearly defined.
  <br>
  <br>
  HA chairman Henry Fan told reporters on Saturday after a Commercial Radio programme that he believes the move will not dispirit senior staff.
  <br>
  <br>
  "What we're trying to do is to actually build up a more proper governance system and management structure, which will in fact assist our colleagues in performing better for the well-being of our patients, which is what the HA is about. We want to provide the best service and have the confidence of the people of Hong Kong. So, I don't think it will be demoralising," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "On the contrary, we would do it properly in a sense that we will have consultation before we reach any decision. I think it will, in fact, increase morale."
  <br>
  <br>
  Under the reform, the HA officially plans to roll out a reward-and-penalty system.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fan has more ideas that he believes could be beneficial, such as giving staff a warning letter for a minor medical blunder. If they are involved in two or more incidents, then they would not get a pay rise for a year - but he stressed that these are just his personal views and have not been discussed by the committee yet.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think this is one way to hold colleagues accountable. Because we cannot say any time you make a mistake, you're suspended. Nor can we say every time you make a mistake, you only get a letter or a warning."
  <br>
  <br>
  Fan added that the HA is also considering setting up channels for staff to voice their opinions confidentially.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Holding senior managers at public hospitals accountable for blunders means they have the responsibility to try to prevent them from happening, medical sector lawmaker David Lam said on Friday, after the Hospital Authority vowed to improve its governance and accountability.
 <br>
  <br>
  A review committee put forward more than 30 recommendations to the Hospital Authority, including enhancing top-level oversight for quality and safety issues, as well as defining the roles, responsibilities and authority at various levels.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lam, a member of the review committee, said strengthening accountability at a higher level meant it won't just be frontline staff taking the blame whenever a medical incident happens.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That puts a responsibility on the senior management that they have to maintain a low complication rate or a low incident rate in their department. And a way to do so is to make sure the staff are adequately trained and adequately staffed," Lam told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  The lawmaker added it's important to build up a "good portal of communication" among all levels of hospital staff, with the review noting junior employees not always willing to speak up even when they spotted problems.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The senior staff should start the ball rolling, and encourage the frontline staff or the junior staff to talk to them whenever necessary," he said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Two men died in separate industrial accidents in Central and Tung Chung on Friday, sparking fresh calls to protect workers' safety.
 <br>
  <br>
  In one of the cases, an 18-year-old apprentice fell into an escalator shaft during repairs at the Euro Trade Centre on Des Voeux Road Central.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was rescued by firefighters and rushed to Ruttonjee Hospital, where he was later pronounced dead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another fatal work accident occurred at a public housing construction site in Tung Chung, where a 57-year-old painter was believed to be trapped on a spider lift platform.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was declared dead at North Lantau Hospital.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Labour Department said it's investigating both tragedies.
  <br>
  <br>
  A workers' rights representative said the occurrence of more industrial accidents serves as a warning.
  <br>
  <br>
  Siu Sin-man from the Association for the Rights of Industrial Accident Victims said both government and industry need to do more to prevent future incidents.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are heartbroken to hear that workers have passed away. It has only been a little over a week since three workers died from work accidents in five days. This is a huge wake-up call," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "People from the industry and government departments need to help think of ways to solve this problem.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If it is an equipment problem, please improve it immediately. If it involves insufficient training, please strengthen mandatory training as soon as possible."

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lawmakers have approved HK$33.5 billion in funding to help with the abolition of the Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF) offsetting mechanism.
 <br>
  <br>
  The mechanism will be scrapped from May 1 next year, and a 25-year subsidy scheme will provide for employers as they adapt to the policy change by sharing the costs associated with severance and long service payments during the transition period.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lawmakers endorsed the funding request at a Legco Finance Committee meeting on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Secretary for Labour and Welfare Chris Sun said the government plans to engage a processing agent to assist in the implementation of the subsidy scheme, by facilitating, vetting and approving applications.
  <br>
  <br>
  Federation of Trade Unions (FTU) lawmaker Bill Tang, for his part, said he's concerned that some people may not understand the arrangements well.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There may be some cases in future because we know that maybe some employers or even some employees do not understand the arrangement of the cancelling offsetting mechanism... We can foresee some disputes between employees and employers, so the FTU is very concerned about it," Tang said.

    Improving governance and accountability a priority: HA

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's hospital bosses have vowed to clarify the responsibility of staff of all ranks and strengthen accountability of senior management when it comes to medical incidents, after a review committee found the roles of workers are not clearly established.
 <br>
  <br>
  Instructed by the administration following a string of medial blunders, the Hospital Authority (HA) set up a review committee a few months ago to look into the operations and management of public hospitals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among 31 recommendations put forward to the authority, the review committee suggested public hospitals enhance top-level oversight for quality and safety issues, as well as define the roles, responsibilities and authority at various levels.
  <br>
  <br>
  The HA said it would look into introducing a reward-and-penalty system when assessing staff.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think it's important to more clearly delineate the roles and responsibilities of each of the staff at different levels," said HA chief executive Tony Ko on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The committee also recommend that in terms of the performance assessment of individual staff, we have to put into elements of quality and safety. So we'll be more explicit in terms of the performance assessment of the individual staff to see how they can reflect in part of the performance and obviously subsequently will be related to the accountability issues."
  <br>
  <br>
  The review committee noted that junior hospital staff often have a strong sense of hierarchy, stopping them from speaking up even when they spotted problems before incidents eventually happened.
  <br>
  <br>
  Younger and less experienced staff members lacked enough training and were not too familiar with safety culture, it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  A high-level reform committee, to be led by HA chairman Henry Fan, will be formed. The permanent secretary for health and the under secretary will join the committee, to give timely policy directions and guidance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fan said the group will focus solely on improving governance and accountability, while other issues would be worked on as quickly as possible.
  <br>
  <br>
  "However, having said that, there are some issues, for example the recommendation that we should change the culture of HA, which would probably take some time," Fan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Culture, by definition, is deep-rooted, and we can't expect to change that overnight. So we will do our best. But what we want is to try to make changes as quickly as possible."
  <br>
  <br>
  Other recommendations include strengthening clinical mentorship and supervision, and encouraging staff to report incidents.

    Bus fare increase requests opposed by lawmakers

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Some lawmakers attending a Legco transport panel meeting on Friday voiced their opposition to fare increase applications made by franchised bus operators.
 <br>
  <br>
  Kowloon Motor Bus (KMB) and New Lantao Bus want to put fares up by 6.5 percent, while Citybus is seeking 9.5 percent increases.
  <br>
  <br>
  KMB told lawmakers it needs to charge more because the expansion of the MTR network is having an "irreversible" impact on its finances.
  <br>
  <br>
  The firm's finance director, Joseph Leung, said average daily passenger numbers are down nine percent compared to 2019.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is due to changes in economic cycle, ageing population, as well as a change in people's commuting patterns, and people are going out less during weekends and at night," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are also seeing an expansion of the railway system, including the Tuen Ma Line as well as the East Rail Line. We see a loss of 130,000 passengers every day. The further expansion of the railway system will hit the bus operators and these conditions are irreversible."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lawmaker Gary Zhang was among those criticising the fare increase applications. But he backed a Citybus plan to roll out a loyalty programme for customers.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said he hopes it will cover journeys between Tin Shui Wai and Hong Kong Island as bus fares are more expensive than the MTR.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For example for journeys from Tin Shui Wai North to Hong Kong Island, actually Citybus has the advantage. Because compared to the railway, Citybus routes are faster and more convenient," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But the problem is that these routes are too expensive even when passengers interchange to trains. Therefore, if there are such loyalty programmes, I believe it will encourage commuters to choose to take buses."

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Super Sixes, a lacrosse tournament, will be held in Hong Kong for the second time in December, with local players seeing it as an opportunity to train themselves up for the 2028 Olympics.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Super Sixes will be held from December 13 to 15 at the Wong Chuk Hang Recreation Ground and the Aberdeen Sports Ground, featuring five men’s and five women’s teams, from countries including China, Japan, Germany and the Philippines.
  <br>
  <br>
  Raymond Fong, CEO of the Hong Kong, China Lacrosse Association, said the tournament will allow the SAR’s players to gain practical experience.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Hong Kong is very small. It's not like China, it's not like Japan. Without all these tournaments, all they can do is just play among their own players in Hong Kong,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “They are already top in Hong Kong, so they’re really not challenging themselves too much. This tournament would be basically bringing the overseas teams to challenge them.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The lacrosse sixes is a new and faster-paced version of the sport, and it will be added to the Los Angeles Olympics in 2028.
  <br>
  <br>
  The leader of the men’s team, Wing Cheung, said they will be using different strategies from last year, and he is confident they will perform better.
  <br>
  <br>
  “This year, we focus more on conditioning because last year it showed that the sixes format requires lots of running,” Cheung said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We have been playing box lacrosse in this summer, and it helps with our stick skills and overall skills, so I think this year may be a good year for us.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Lacrosse player Samuel Chow said the competition will be an opportunity for them to learn more about the other teams.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The sixes tournament will be a very important step for us to see how we’re going to perform in the international stage in this new format, and we’re going to see how we might be able to compete into the 2028 Olympics,” he said.

  Speaking at a forum on wealth management, Chan highlighted Hong Kong's status as a well-established international financial hub.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong's fundamentals as an international financial centre have remained as strong as ever. Recently, Hong Kong returned to the top three global financial centres, along with New York and London," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Yet from time to time, we come across reports about Hong Kong, such as those on the outflow of funds. A few important facts will illustrate that international investors remain highly confident in Hong Kong."
  <br>
  <br>
  The finance minister said Hong Kong's stock market has continued to grow, raising about HK$70 billion through initial public offerings (IPOs).
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan added that asset and wealth management companies have been expanding their businesses in Hong Kong, increasing office space rentals and relocating senior executives to the city.

 The Hospital Authority (HA) is to set up a committee to reform its governance and structure after the government ordered a review of its management following a spate of medical blunders.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Health Bureau said on Friday that the committee, to be formed under the HA's board, will be chaired by the authority's chairman, Henry Fan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials had been vetting a review report submitted over "systemic management issues" at the authority.
  <br>
  <br>
  Health chief Lo Chung-mau said his bureau agreed with the directions set out in 31 recommendations for enhancing the HA's governance and structure to provide better and safer healthcare services.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Henry Fan, being the reform committee chairman, is to steer the implementation of recommendations made in the review report regarding governance, accountability and distribution of responsibilities, and relevant reform work," the bureau said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said the permanent secretary for health and the under secretary will join the committee, to give timely policy directions and guidance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lo added that the HA will have to submit regular progress reports to the government to ensure that enhancement measures are implemented in a timely and effective manner.

 Residents and tourists gathered at China Merchant Wharf  in Western on Friday to get a view of the People's Liberation Army Navy's assault ship the Hainan.
 <br>
  <br>
  The vessel, along with the Changsha destroyer which was docked at Stonecutters Island, arrived in the city on Thursday morning for a five-day visit.
  <br>
  <br>
  One of the spectators told RTHK he was stunned by the Hainan's size.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I’ve got time, and the ships are here, so I just came to see the country’s strengths. I think the country being strong can help balance the world,” Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  A tourist from Guangdong said she decided to visit the city after hearing news about the two vessels.
  <br>
  <br>
  “These ships are great. They don’t come here often, and this time it is staying for five days, so I came to Hong Kong just to see the ship. Just looking at the ship is enough,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  A series of activities will be held during the ships’ stay, including tours, cultural exchanges and talks on national defence.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chief Executive John Lee said earlier that people will be able to understand the nation’s achievements in defence and military modernisation if they join the activities.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Cyberport CEO Rocky Cheng said on Thursday that the park was well-positioned for low-altitude flying trials with its ample space and a pier, adding that there were plans to set up a landing port for test flights.
 <br>
  <br>
  As a venue partner for sandbox pilot projects for developing low-altitude economy, Cyberport will provide suitable locations and supporting facilities for drones and other aerial technology.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to RTHK on the sidelines of the World Internet Conference in Wuzhen, Cheng said the park had what it takes for low-altitude flight tests.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Cyberport's geographical environment is very suitable for conducting low-altitude economy trials. The new Phase 5 building, set to open in the third quarter of next year, offers a stunning sea view. There is also a 150-metre-long pier adjacent to the ocean, and ample space within Cyberport,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cheng outlined plans to set up a landing port at the pier and organise exhibitions on drones to educate the public.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the AI supercomputing centre due to start operation at the end of this year, Cheng said it was progressing well with some computing power already available for use.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cheng said the centre hoped to start off by providing 1,300 petaflops of computing power, before bringing it up to 1,700 by next year.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The government wants to develop and promote AI to help various industries in Hong Kong surpass other advanced economies, so this computing power serves as crucial infrastructure. We should see gradual increases in computing capacity in the future. I believe it will quickly exceed 10,000 petaflops,” he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hendrick Sin, who chairs the committee on a HK$3 billion subsidy scheme to help AI researchers and companies make the best use of Cyberport's computing power, said the project marked the start of a new era.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I personally believe this is the opening of the AI era… So I think if more investment and more initiatives are provided by the government, I think that will give Hong Kong a further push to give more experts, professionals, to have more chance to exercise what they want to show to innovate and to benefit Hong Kong,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sin added that the scheme, which opened for application in October, will favour firms that have expertise in research and development, and present innovative ideas that benefit the SAR.

 The MTR Corporation said on Friday that normal services are resuming on the East Rail line after an equipment fault on a train near University Station caused delays.
 <br>
  <br>
  It said the train had been moved and services were returning to normal.
  <br>
  <br>
  The problem caused delays of up to fifteen minutes on the East Rail line between Admiralty and Lo Wu/Lok Ma Chau.

 Chief Executive John Lee has extended a warm welcome to two of the country’s navy vessels - a destroyer and an amphibious assault ship - that are making a port visit to the SAR.
 <br>
  <br>
  Earlier on Thursday, the arrival of The Changsha and The Hainan was greeted by boats from the Fire Services Department.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a welcoming ceremony, Lee said a slew of activities have been arranged during their five-day visit.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said he hopes Hongkongers can take the opportunity to experience the country’s achievements in national defence and military modernisation.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Crew members will take part in activities with local people and the SAR garrison. I believe this will raise awareness here of the nation's achievements in naval construction and development, while strengthening a sense of national identity and pride, especially among the younger generation,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  A number of mainland officials were also present at the welcoming ceremony, including Vice Admiral Wei Wenhui, deputy commander of the Southern Theater Command of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, as well as director of the liaison office, Zheng Yanxiong.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Consumer prices rose 1.4 percent year-on-year in October, according to the official figure released on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  It was the smallest increase in five months, after the city recorded a rate of 2.2 percent in September.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alcoholic drinks and tobacco saw the biggest increases at 21.8 percent, followed by electricity, gas and water at 8.5 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, the government said food prices continued to record mild increases, while energy-related items saw a slow-down in price declines.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Looking ahead, overall inflation should stay mild in the near term," a government spokesman said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Domestic costs may see some mild upward pressures as the Hong Kong economy continues to grow. External price pressures should ease further, though uncertainties from the external environment remain."

<div class="itemFullText">
 The MTR Corporation on Thursday said its has finished installing platform screen doors at nine stations along the East Rail Line.
 <br>
  <br>
  The rail operator said it expects to finish putting doors in at three more stations, Lo Wu, Mong Kok East and University Station, next year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chief engineering manager for system integration Maggie Chan said the gap between trains and the platform is relatively wide at these three stations.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said the rail operator will reduce the gap when the automatic platform gates (APG) are installed, to ensure passenger safety.
  <br>
  <br>
  "At the platform edge, there are the platform gap fillers. We will also widen the platform gap fillers to reduce the platform gap," Chan told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will also have extra, additional broadcasting, so as to remind the passengers they have to pay attention to the platform gap after the APG opens."

<div class="itemFullText">
 An index measuring local enterprises' ability to respond to cybersecurity attacks has recorded the biggest jump to date, up by 5.8 points from last year to 52.8.
 <br>
  <br>
  442 companies were measured under the "Hong Kong Enterprise Cyber Security Readiness Index" compiled by the Hong Kong Productivity Council (HKPC) and the Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data (PCPD).
  <br>
  <br>
  Among the four areas covered in the index, "Human Awareness Building" has the most urgent need for improvement, the bodies said. The category refers to how aware and cautious employees are regarding potential cyber attacks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Privacy Commissioner Ada Chung said this awareness has remained relatively low over the years.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We also encourage enterprises to conduct training regularly, and this will include for example cyber security drill exercises as well," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chung said many hackers have been using AI to carry out their attacks, and deepfake videos used to fake identities can be made in under 20 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alex Chan, General Manager of Digital Transformation at the HKPC, said enterprises are encouraged to adopt AI for defence, such as detecting the voice prints of videos to check if they show a real person.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will always say that AI is a double-edged sword. So that means attackers or bad actors are using AI to do attack, at the same time we should also use AI to uplift our defence," Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  To help enterprises better equip themselves against cyber attacks, the PCPD and the HKPC will be introducing a series of training packages, including a "data security training series for Small-and-Medium Enterprises" in 2025 and one on "Phishing Defence Services".

<div class="itemFullText">
 Under Secretary for Innovation, Technology and Industry Lillian Cheong on Thursday said Hong Kong has a big role to play in the innovation development of the Greater Bay Area.
 <br>
  <br>
  Addressing a panel at the World Internet Conference in Wuzhen, Cheong said the SAR can act as a hub for global innovative resources and a data port.
  <br>
  <br>
  “For us to seek new developments, we should rely on the interaction and usage of data. Hong Kong has unique advantages. It can be the hub for global innovative resources,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It can connect both mainland data and overseas data. It can be a data port. Hong Kong can also allow the orderly flow of data and facilitate the overall development of the Greater Bay Area.”
  <br>
  <br>
  She added that the administration has signed a cross-border data flow MOU with the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC).
  <br>
  <br>
  Sun Weimin, chief engineer of the CAC, told the same forum that the digital economy has become a crucial force reshaping the world’s innovation landscape.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sun called for innovation-led and secure development to create a bright future for the GBA’s internet industry.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The Greater Bay Area has a highly developed economy and a high degree of digitalisation, facing more urgent security threats. It is necessary to strengthen cooperation in aspects such as information sharing and incident handling,” she said.

    Rental bikes blocking paths 'common': Ombudsman

<img alt='The Ombudsman says the LCSD should take "decisive enforcement action" against any violations. Photo courtesy of the Office of the Ombudsman' src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1780238_1_20241121155817.jpg&q=30">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An investigation by the city's Ombudsman has found it is common for rental bike service operators to leave their bicycles where they block paths, saying the situation "invites doubts" as to whether the Leisure and Cultural Services Department (LCSD) has taken action against offenders.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Office of the Ombudsman on Thursday said business permits issued by the department to the operators explicitly forbid them from allowing rental bicycles to take up space outside designated areas.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Operators placing their bicycles outside the permit area in violation of regulations not only causes an obstruction to passageways and affects members of the public to access and use recreational facilities, but may also pose safety hazards," said Ombudsman Jack Chan.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our multiple site inspections found that it seems to be a common practice for operators to leave bicycles lying around in contravention of the regulations, and this has invited doubts as to whether the LCSD had reminded the operators of the irregularities or has taken enforcement action against them in the past."
  <br>
  <br>
  The office noted that LCSD staff issue reminders or warning letters depending on the severity of a situation, and can consider suspending an operator's business or terminating the contract if there's no evident improvement after a third warning.
  <br>
  <br>
  But guidelines do not clearly stipulate the number of verbal and written reminders to warrant a warning, the office said, or whether the notices have any validity period.
  <br>
  <br>
  The office said the department should take "decisive enforcement action" if any operator violates the contract terms, and look into enhancing the current enforcement regime and guidelines, among other suggestions.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Ombudsman added that the LCSD has accepted all of its recommendations.

 Two of the nation's navy battleships, a destroyer and an amphibious assault ship,  arrived in Hong Kong on Thursday for a five-day visit.
 <br>
  <br>
  Members of the public can board the vessels for a look around.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Changsha and the Hainan were greeted by boats from the Fire Services Department, with the Hainan moored at China Merchants Wharf in Western.
  <br>
  <br>
  Soldiers on board raised the national flag and waved to people on shore.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Ministry of Defence said the visit was approved by the Central Military Commission and is part of an annual plan.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said the visit is aimed at demonstrating the People's Liberation Army's determination and ability to defend the country's sovereignty and safety.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[The visit also] further enhances the national identity and pride for compatriots in Hong Kong and Macau, and for them to learn more about national defence and the achievements of the army's modernisation," the ministry said.
  <br>
  <br>
  It added that the vessels will be open to the public and soldiers based in the two SARs, and there will be seminars on national defence as well as cultural exchange activities.

    SAR has larger role in Belt and Road: Beijing official

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A senior Beijing official has stressed that Hong Kong is playing a larger part in the Belt and Road Initiative, saying the city's dispute resolution mechanism and an abundance of legal professionals provide services under the country's infrastructure development plan.
 <br>
  <br>
  Liu Guangyuan, a deputy director of Beijing's liaison office, on Thursday said the SAR is "standing at the forefront" of the nation's opening up as an important functional platform for the initiative.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a Belt and Road conference in Hong Kong, the official said the One Country, Two Systems principle makes the territory a bridge connecting the mainland with the rest of the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is the only jurisdiction in the world with a bilingual common law system, and has a bigger role to play in facilitating Belt and Road cooperation," Liu said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong has a complete dispute resolution mechanism, and serves as a preferred seat for resolving disputes among countries along the Belt and Road... The abundant legal talent reservoir in the city may be further tapped into to provide legal services under the Belt and Road Initiative."
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that stability is a "prerequisite" for prosperity in Hong Kong and a safeguard for the city's role in the development initiative.
  <br>
  <br>
  Secretary for Justice Paul Lam, for his part, said at the same conference that Hong Kong has a special role.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong is renowned for having a sound and mature legal system, supported by the independent exercise of judicial power by our courts and a strong rule of law tradition. Hong Kong is uniquely positioned to bridge the gaps between different jurisdictions along the Belt and Road," Lam said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As a super-connector and a super value-adder, Hong Kong provides world-class legal services that facilitate business between China and the rest of the world."
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong has a lot of legal professionals "with a strong Chinese legal and business background" as well as expertise in international law and practice, Lam added.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the government will proactively integrate into the nation's development, maintain a free and open business environment, and serve as a springboard to attract and support enterprises.

    'Provide flexibility for sports bodies to improve'

<img alt="Duncan Chiu (left), chairman of the Squash Association of Hong Kong, China, has welcomed the establishment of a code of practice. Photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1780200_1_20241121112245.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The SAR's squash association on Thursday urged the Sports Federation and Olympic Committee (SF&OC) of Hong Kong, China to provide flexibility for the sector over the introduction of a code of practice.
 <br>
  <br>
  The SF&OC on Wednesday held a briefing for its member associations about the new code, which provides guidelines on corporate governance.
  <br>
  <br>
  It states that the term of office for directors of the associations should have a maximum length and recommends they stay for 16 years at most, along with an age limit of 75.
  <br>
  <br>
  Duncan Chiu, chairman of the Squash Association of Hong Kong, China, welcomed the introduction of the code but said he hopes compromises can be made.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There are not too many people participating in squash activities, and our committee consists of about 20 people. It's not easy to find people who can constantly help us... We hope they can provide some flexibility on this," he told an RTHK radio programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  The code also states that sports associations should establish a fair and transparent mechanism for the selection of athletes, to ensure equal opportunities for all those qualified.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chiu, who's also a lawmaker, said his association would follow all the procedures, but he hopes people understand that different sports have different selection criteria.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For running or swimming, it's easier because the standard is based on the time for finishing the race. But it may be more subjective for team sports, like football and basketball, the team chemistry among players is important too. So there are more criteria when selecting athletes," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  New People's Party lawmaker Adrian Ho told the same programme that at next year's National Games, people will be able to see whether sports associations are being fair and transparent when selecting players.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SF&OC will review the implementation of the code after two years, and any sports associations that fail to follow it will face penalties including cuts to government subsidies.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong government on Wednesday said it strongly condemns and opposes some Western governments, anti-China groups and politicians, as well as foreign media for smearing and maliciously attacking the SAR.
 <br>
  <br>
  The SAR’s statement was in response to foreign criticism of court sentences handed down to 45 people on Tuesday in Hong Kong's largest national security trial thus far.
  <br>
  <br>
  A government spokesman stressed the court made the decision following 118 days of open trial, and after going through an extensive amount of evidence presented by both the prosecution and defense.
  <br>
  <br>
  The spokesman added that all of the legal considerations were laid out in an 82-page judgement, which can be downloaded by members of the public.
  <br>
  <br>
  He stressed the case had nothing to do with advocating democracy or freedoms, saying the offenders had engaged in acts that endanger national security.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government stressed it will continue to do all it takes to safeguard national security.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The proposed imposition of the so-called 'visa restrictions' on HKSAR officials by the US Government smack of despicable political manipulation to intimidate People's Republic of China and HKSAR officials who resolutely safeguard national security," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The HKSAR despises such threats and will not be intimidated by such despicable behaviour. The HKSAR will continue to resolutely continue to discharge the duty of safeguarding national security."

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Former media tycoon Jimmy Lai on Wednesday began testifying in his national security trial.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lai said he had made donations to local and overseas groups, including think-tanks and religious organisations in the United States amounting to up to US$50,000 a year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Apple Daily founder added that he donated £20,000 to the UK-based group Hong Kong Watch.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lai also said he asked former top US officials to “voice out” for Hong Kong five years ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  He told the High Court that he met then vice-president Mike Pence and then secretary of state Mike Pompeo during his trip to Washington in July 2019.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lai said he asked Pence to voice support for Hong Kong, adding that it would be “beyond” him to ask Pence to take any concrete action.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lai also acknowledged that he had directed Apple Daily to use news of a meeting between former chief secretary Anson Chan and Pence in 2019 to its “maximum effect”.
  <br>
  <br>
  The former media tycoon has pleaded not guilty to three conspiracy charges relating to collusion with foreign forces and sedition.
  <br>
  <br>
  The questioning is estimated to take 15 days, according to the defence.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Sports Federation & Olympic Committee (SF&OC) of Hong Kong, China on Wednesday said member associations that fail to meet new standards in terms of governance and operation may face penalties such as subsidy cuts.
 <br>
  <br>
  The body launched a review of the governance and operation of 77 sports associations following a 2020 audit report. It said the review has now been completed and it will hand in a report to the government.
  <br>
  <br>
  Edgar Yang, honorary secretary general of the SF&OC, said associations will be given two years to make improvements set out in the report.
  <br>
  <br>
  The consequences for failing to do so will include cuts to government subsidies, he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “That will be the worst scenario, that we have to step in. In the coming 24 months, we believe that we will be able to lead and offer guidance to the NSAs (national sports associations) where we see there are matters that we need to rectify or enhance,” Yang said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The certificate of compliance will be the last resort. Basically, there will be [different] levels of punishment that we will consider.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Sports minister Kevin Yeung attended a briefing for associations conducted by the SF&OC on Wednesday and said the review marks the start of improvements for the sports sector.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It’s a very important step forward for the further enhancement of our whole sports development in the future. We are positive and we will work with the SF&OC and all the NSAs to make sure that we are all going towards the right direction,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Member associations of the SF&OC expressed support for the report, with chairman of the Hong Kong, China Ice Hockey Association, Sherman Chan, saying it is reasonable for those who fail to comply with the requirements to be hit with penalties.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I think this is quite fair. If any of the NSAs could not meet the requirements, nor try to improve, and their [subsidies] were cut, I think that’s fair,” he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  The report covers areas such as the associations’ board governance, selection of athletes, and management of coaches and umpires.

<img alt="Paul Chan says Hong Kong will continue to thrive despite the challenges posed by a fragmented world.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan says Hong Kong must remain agile and innovative amid evolving global dynamics, adding that countries and businesses are still adapting and transforming to thrive in a changing environment.
 <br>
  <br>
  Giving a speech at the Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit, Chan said there is no reason for pessimism, despite the market bracing for potential headwinds from a changing geopolitical landscape and a new US administration.
  <br>
  <br>
  “China, for example, has been undergoing remarkable economic transformation, marked by a shift towards high-quality economic growth, supported by domestic consumption, technological innovation, green investment, advanced manufacturing and many more. Chinese enterprises are also expanding their global industry and supply chain footprint in response to shifting geopolitics,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “For Hong Kong, our strategy is to continue to engage with traditional markets like the US and Europe, focusing on co-operation in areas of common interests and mutual benefits.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan also said there is still potential and ample room for cooperation across various sectors, including urban planning, infrastructure, ESG (environmental, social and governance) standards and efforts to combat climate change, despite the influence of geopolitics.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the Belt and Road countries, along with the Global South as a whole, offer vast and untapped business opportunities.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The Global South now contributes to about 60 percent of global GDP in terms of purchasing power parity, and accounts for over 40 percent of global imports and exports. If we just look at Asean (Association of Southeast Asian Nations), it is collectively on track to become the fourth largest economy in the world by 2030,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “What characterise these markets are rapid economic growth, young populations and an expanding middle class. And above all, they all share a strong aspiration for progress by pursuing investments in infrastructure, green transformation and technologies.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Amid challenging global landscape, they are also seeking to diversify their investments and asset allocation. We are making significant strides to capitalise on the opportunities presented by the growth of these emerging markets.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said Hong Kong continues to be an attractive partner for investors and businesses globally, given the city’s international outlook and commitment to innovation.

    Phase 1 of Shenzhen-HK tech zone plan expanded

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Wednesday unveiled the development outline for the Hong Kong section of the Hetao Shenzhen-Hong Kong Science and Technology Innovation Cooperation Zone, with the gross floor area in phase one doubling from what was initially planned.
 <br>
  <br>
  The tech zone stretches across the Shenzhen River, covering 302 hectares in Shenzhen and 87 hectares in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SAR section will be developed in two five-year phases, with phase one covering 1 million square metres.
  <br>
  <br>
  "After reviewing the future development, in particular the high demand from the market for the Hetao Hong Kong Park, we decided to greatly increase the floor area. And after the hard work and also discussions with the other bureaus and departments, eventually we are able to offer about 1 million square metres for the phase one development," Secretary for Innovation, Technology and Industry Sun Dong said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tech zone will feature three main areas, focusing on life and health technology, artificial intelligence and data science, and advanced manufacturing and new technology.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than two-thirds of the space in phase one is planned for laboratories and research areas, while there will be land set aside for accommodation, visitor lodges and commercial spaces.
  <br>
  <br>
  In addition, a contact-less clearance process will be implemented to link the parks in Shenzhen and Hong Kong to facilitate personnel flow, and to allow people crossing the border to travel to other parts of the SAR as well.
  <br>
  <br>
  Deputy Secretary for Innovation, Technology and Industry Carrie Chang said the government will discuss details with mainland authorities.
  <br>
  <br>
  "At this point in time, our thinking is that those people would have to be pre-registered. In terms of who they are, they should be the employees of the tenants of the two parks (because) they do have the need to commute between the two parks frequently," Chang said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And then the list should be accepted by both authorities because after all, it's cross-boundary travel. When we have further details, after further discussions with the mainland authorities, we will inform the members of the public suitably."
  <br>
  <br>
  The government added that there are plans to build footbridges over the Shenzhen River to link the Shenzhen and Hong Kong parks as well, but details are still being discussed.

    'Let students play a part in fighting climate change'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 UNICEF Hong Kong on Wednesday said everyone should play a part in living sustainably through environmental protection.
 <br>
  <br>
  This came as it surveyed 256 secondary school students from June to August this year to find out their awareness of environmental policies in the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  It found that almost 80 percent of students value environmental protection, but almost half were unaware of relevant plans by their schools and in the community.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Most of the students would like to learn more about global crises, what is affecting their life, and they want to be more participating, not only to just become a beneficial party, but also involved in voicing out their needs, questions and concerns, and influencing policy making to build a better future,” the organisation’s chair, Judy Chen, said.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 90 percent of the students surveyed had a clear understanding of how to save water and electricity at home, such as turning off unnecessary lights and maintaining air conditioner temperatures at 24 degrees or above.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the school setting, their participation in green activities dropped to 50 percent, and mainly involved helping out with waste recycling and using water dispensers.
  <br>
  <br>
  The participation rate further dropped to around 20 percent in the community, as students were unaware of activities taking place.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chen said schools should expand their policies and arrangements for saving the planet to align with the government’s sustainability goals.
  <br>
  <br>
  “A lot of schools are already very well-established, so their environmental planning may not be that up to date. It would be a good opportunity for schools to work with students, to allow them to feel they are fighting climate change as well,” Chen said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “But this issue is not just limited to schools and students. All stakeholders in the community should also pay attention and be more aware of how to build a more environmentally friendly place for our children,” she added.

    HK$2 transport subsidy age eligibility to remain

<img alt="Chris Sun said while officials are reviewing the HK$2 elderly transport scheme, those aged 60 and above will continue to be beneficiaries.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Welfare minister Chris Sun on Monday said the government has no plans to raise the age when older people can enjoy trips on public transport for just HK$2.
 <br>
  <br>
  Last month, the Hong Kong Economic Journal cited sources as saying the minimum age could be raised from the current 60, to 65.
  <br>
  <br>
  But in a written reply to a question from lawmaker Peter Koon, Sun said there are no plans to do this.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The government has stated clearly that it will maintain the policy intent of the HK$2 scheme to build a caring and inclusive society by encouraging the beneficiaries to participate more in community activities, and has no intention to cancel the scheme or change the existing beneficiary groups," Sun said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said a review of the scheme is ongoing and the result of this will be announced in due course.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The government would take into account the effectiveness of different options in containing the growth of [the scheme's] expenditure and factors including the practicability of these options in the review," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sun said the scheme is estimated to have cost nearly HK$4 billion in the last financial year, or 0.7 percent of the government's total operating expenditure.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the 2022-23 financial year, the scheme cost a little more than HK$3 billion.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Customs officers on Wednesday said three people charged over a drugs case earlier this year are now also suspected of laundering money to the tune of HK$53 million.
 <br>
  <br>
  A fourth suspect was arrested in Sai Wan Ho on Tuesday over the alleged money laundering. The man, 41, was later released on bail.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two women and a man, aged 23 to 25, continue to be remanded in custody in connection with the HK$28 million dangerous drugs case, officers said, adding that their investigation into the suspected money laundering is still ongoing.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Coordinators of a test event for the 15th National Games’ Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau road cycling race say the trial run on Sunday is to test traffic management and the spectator experience.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong portion of the race will take around 90 minutes, with cyclists entering the SAR via the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge and then going along the North Lantau Highway and Penny’s Bay Highway, before heading back to Zhuhai after passing Hong Kong Disneyland.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeung Tak-keung, the head of the National Games Coordination Office, said RTHK is liaising with the organising committee in Zhuhai to set up live broadcasting online for viewers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Those members of the public who want to watch the competition on site, they can go to the spectator zone in Disneyland, and we expect the area can accommodate up to several hundred spectators," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeung said organisers place a lot of importance on ensuring a smooth and safe competition and will also use the trial to identify areas for improvement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Experts from the mainland cycling association and the Hong Kong cycling association, we have conducted several site visits to go through the whole route. They found the whole current route is safe for high-level competitions for experienced cyclists," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For the Hong Kong section of the route, our high-risk department have conducted very thorough examination of the whole route and they used different technologies to inspect the route and to make sure it will be safe for the cyclists."
  <br>
  <br>
  Principal Transport Officer Ken Wong said the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge will be closed for certain periods on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lanes heading to Macau and Zhuhai will be shut from 7.30am to 12.30pm and lanes in the other direction will be closed between 9am and 12.30pm.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We expect, according to the prior publicity regarding the event, not too many passengers will make use of the bus to go to Zhuhai and Macau on the coming Sunday," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have already asked MTRCL to pay extra attention to the passenger demand during that morning. If there's any passenger demand, MTRCL will increase the services on the Tung Chung Line, Airport Express Line and Disneyland Line."
  <br>
  <br>
  The test event will be a men's individual 230-kilometres race, which is the first national sports event that connects Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macau, and will be the only National Games event next year held in all three places.

    Over 6,000 public flats recovered from tenancy abusers

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Housing minister Winnie Ho said on Wednesday that officials have taken back some 6,400 public flats in the past two and a half years after tenants were found to be abusing housing resources.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a written reply to a question from Heung Yee Kuk lawmaker Kenneth Lau, Ho said nearly 400 tenants were prosecuted during the period.
  <br>
  <br>
  Seven of them were given jail terms or suspended sentences for violating housing laws. In the most serious case, a tenant was given an immediate jail term of 30 days.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government is to launch a reward scheme in January, giving people around HK$3,000 for reports of tenancy abuse.
  <br>
  <br>
  The housing chief said the scheme is generally supported by the community and won't damage relationships between neighbours.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Regarding views that the Award Scheme may be a detriment to neighbourhood relationships, the Housing Authority believes that [public housing] residents would not welcome abusers in their neighbourhood," Ho said.
  <br>

  "[Tenancy] abuse would bring injustice, or even affect the living environment of public rental housing and bring nuisance."

  <br>
  She added that it is believed the scheme will enhance awareness of the need to cherish housing resources.

 The police on Wednesday were investigating a suspected criminal damage case outside Central Government Offices.
 <br>
  <br>
  At around 8.30am, a security patrol found red paint covering an area of three metres by two metres around a planter pot near Harcourt Road.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government strongly condemned the incident, saying the police will thoroughly investigate and hold any offender to account.
  <br>
  <br>
  A government spokesman said police officers have stepped up patrols in the area and the authorities have instructed security staff of the Central Government Offices to remain vigilant.

    Tsuen Wan hosts city's best and worst toilets

 The Hong Kong Toilet Association says the government should increase its ratio of women's toilets to men's and include urinals in its calculation.
 <br>
  <br>
  Henry Hung, the association's chairman, told RTHK that at the moment, there were two female public lavatories for every male one, but women could often be seen lining up outside the public facilities.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the government should increase the ratio to 1:2.5 and include men's urinals in the calculation of toilets.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hung was speaking in an interview with RTHK's
  <a href="https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/news-programmes/this-episode.htm?cmsid=77" target="_blank">
   Hong Kong Today
  </a>
  programme on Wednesday, to announce the results of its annual survey of the city's best and worst public washrooms.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hoi Hing Road public toilet in Tsuen Wan won top recognition, judged according to the association's CASH formula, which measures Comfort, Accessibility, Safety and Hygiene.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's very clean, and also very easy to go in to the toilet, and it's safe - that means the floor is not wet - and very hygienic. Most of the taps, or all of the taps, are using sensor control - no need to touch the toilet or the tap," said Hung.
  <br>
  <br>
  By contrast, Hung said the worst toilet was in Tsuen Wan Market, describing the washroom as dirty, smelly, with rusty facilities and a wet floor.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We asked the government to take action as soon as possible."
  <br>
  <br>
  Hung said over the past 10 years, after the government had injected about HK$6 million into refurbishing some 200 toilets, the image of the public facilities had greatly improved.

    OSC funding improves access to mental health therapy

<img alt="Dr Candice Powell expressed hope that with the help of OSC funding, students at risk of mental health problems could receive their services as soon as possible.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A pioneering initiative, one of the beneficiaries of this year's Operation Santa Claus (OSC), is hoping to improve access to mental health therapies, with practitioners providing free, short-term, and remote support to local citizens.
 <br>
  <br>
  Improving Access to Community Therapies (iACT) was designed and developed by Mind HK - a mental health charity set up in 2017 by Dr Lucy Lord to ensure no one faces a mental health problem alone in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last year, a report by the Chinese University of Hong Kong showed that 1 in 4 students suffered from mental health problems, pointing to the importance of early intervention to prevent student mental health further deteriorating.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dr Candice Powell, CEO of Mind HK, says their goal is to receive funding in order to serve at least 300 students to receive one-on-one psychological support based on the iACT model.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We believe that therapies shouldn't just be in the hospital but actually can happen in the community, so that's why we are launching this programme in secondary schools," said Dr Powell.
  <br>
  <br>
  Project coordinator Coco says she herself also benefited from the iACT short-term emotional support service after graduating from university and feeling anxious about her future.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The well-being practitioner used iACT as the therapy to how we live with our negative emotion and help me to find my life value. We can use another way to live with some negative emotion. We don't always need to fight them or eliminate those negative emotion," Coco said.
  <br>
  <br>
  As part of its pilot phase from 2021 to 2024, Mind HK trained over 100 well-being practitioners to work with youth and adults.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jointly organised by RTHK and South China Morning Post, OSC funds charitable projects that focus on children and youth, the elderly, the community, those with physical and mental disabilities, medical projects, and those concerning the environment.

    HK rejects latest US congressional report

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government said on Wednesday it strongly disapproves of and firmly rejects a US congressional report that criticised the SAR and central governments and the city's national security law.
 <br>
  <br>
  It said the US-China Economic and Security Review Commission (USCC) had used politics to prevail over law-based administration.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The HKSAR Government strongly disapproves of and firmly rejects USCC's wanton manoeuvre with politics prevailing over law-based administration and interference in the affairs of the HKSAR in the so-called report,” the government statement wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US report said changes in the SAR raised questions about Hong Kong’s ability to maintain its position as the financial connector between mainland China and the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  In response, the SAR government said the accusations are groundless attacks, slanders and smears against various aspects of Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The HKSAR Government strongly urges again individual United States politicians to discern facts from fallacies, respect the international law and basic norms governing international relations, and immediately stop interfering in Hong Kong matters, which are purely China's internal affairs," the government said.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said since the implementation of a national security law in 2020, the US had continued to turn a blind eye to the large-scale and incessant rioting which occurred in 2019 that devastated Hong Kong's society, livelihoods and the economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said the US also deliberately neglected the fact that the implementation of the law enabled livelihoods and economic activities to return to normal.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government said Hong Kong's rise in world competitiveness rankings to be among the world's top economies was testament to the fact that high-level security protection underpins high-quality development.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said the US enjoyed economic benefits in Hong Kong, with a trade surplus of some US$270 billion with the SAR over the past 10 years, and there were more than 1,200 US companies operating businesses in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government said all these demonstrated the close and long-standing economic ties between the two places, so a stable and prosperous Hong Kong was of mutual benefit to the US.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Observatory cancelled all typhoon signals at 10.10pm on Tuesday as Man-yi continues to weaken and moves away from Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  The T1 signal was issued on Monday morning and had been in force for well over 30 hours.
  <br>
  <br>
  The forecaster also noted that water level is expected to rise on Tuesday night and warned that minor flooding may occur in low-lying coastal areas.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Under the combined effect of spring tide, the northeast monsoon and Man-yi, the water level of the coast of Hong Kong will rise higher than normal tonight," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "From around 10pm tonight to midnight, a high water level of near 3 metres above Chart Datum is expected in Victoria Harbour, and a high water level of about 3.1 metres above Chart Datum is expected at Tai O."
  <br>
  <br>
  People are advised to stay away from the shoreline and remain on the alert.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday warned that anyone who intends to endanger national security will be punished in accordance with the law, after 45 opposition figures were sentenced to up to 10 years in prison for conspiracy to commit subversion.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, Lee said the court decision reflects the severity of the case.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The sentence shows the court confirmed that the offence of the defendants was extremely serious and they should be severely punished,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CE stressed Hong Kong is a society underpinned by the rule of law, and offenders must be held accountable.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Those involved acted under the guise of democracy and freedom to subvert the political regime of the HKSAR… This case shows that anyone who intends to subvert state power and endanger national security will ultimately be punished in accordance with the law.”
  <br>
  <br>
  A government spokesman, meanwhile, called on foreign governments to stop interfering in SAR affairs.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The HKSAR government has noticed that the United States and some Western countries, anti-China organisations, anti-China politicians and foreign media have recently made malicious attacks and smears on various cases,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The HKSAR government has stated on many occasions that like all cases, this case was handled strictly on the basis of evidence and in accordance with the law.”

    Power tariffs to climb by almost one percent in 2025

<img alt="Secretary for Environment Tse Chin-wan says the city's two power firms will raise their electricity tariffs by less than one percent on average next year. Photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1779930_1_20241119185403.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Electricity will cost slightly more for Hongkongers next year, with tariffs rising by 0.9 percent on Hong Kong Island and 0.98 percent in Kowloon and the New Territories.
 <br>
  <br>
  The city's two power firms, CLP and HK Electric, said even though fuel costs stabilised this year, ongoing geopolitical tensions meant they had to take on a more cautious approach.
  <br>
  <br>
  HK Electric noted that it also needs to pump in extra resources to further boost service reliability.
  <br>
  <br>
  "To handle more frequent extreme weather conditions, we need to improve our infrastructure so that we can still deliver reliable electricity to our customers even during bad weather. Also, we need to update our old and outdated facilities. All these investments will put pressure on electricity prices," its managing director Francis Cheng said.
  <br>
  <br>
  CLP's managing director, Joseph Law, pointed out that the company is dealing with challenges like inflation, rising material costs, and a tense labour force -- all of which are driving up its operational expenses.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But we understand that people are concerned about electricity prices, and we will keep working to improve our operating efficiency by managing our finances wisely and controlling expenses," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "While international fuel prices have stabilised somewhat over the past year, geopolitical risks remain, and global fuel costs are still relatively high, so the outlook isn’t too bright. We’ll continue to take a careful approach in managing our expenses."
  <br>
  <br>
  A climate economist said while the increases this time around are in line with estimates, he expects the tariff hikes to exacerbate in the years to come.
  <br>
  <br>
  "From the international perspective, I would say there is still uncertainty about the fuel cost, especially the fluctuation in oil prices that might affect the future natural gas price. I think we should pay more attention," William Yu, CEO of World Green Organisation, told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  Several lawmakers also raised concerns about the SAR's reliance on imported fuels, and urged the administration to speed up plans to find alternative energy supply sources.
  <br>
  <br>
  Environment secretary Tse Chin-wan said in response that the government has been negotiating with mainland officials about boosting its zero-carbon energy supply.
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted that there's land set aside in Tseung Kwan O for receiving nuclear power and the project is scheduled for completion by 2035.

    '50 percent more tourists to join mega events in 2025'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Tuesday said it expects mega events in the first half of next year to attract 840,000 tourists, a 50 percent rise when compared with the same period this year.
 <br>
  <br>
  At a press conference, officials said there will be more than 90 mega events in the first half of 2025, including festivals, conventions and sports events.
  <br>
  <br>
  They said the events are expected to generate total spending of HK$3.3 billion, which would be a 40 percent increase compared to the first half of 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked about the cancellation of events due to poor weather conditions, Deputy Financial Secretary Michael Wong said the government will have better arrangements by learning from the mainland and creating back-up plans for events like drone shows.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For example for some of the shows, the original plan was to have 2,000 drones in a show, and they lowered the density to around 400. This allowed the show to continue to be carried out," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I will learn from them, so for some of the shows in the future, that will be one of the alternative options that we will prepare for."
  <br>
  <br>
  Culture and tourism minister Kevin Yeung, meanwhile, said it is inevitable that outdoor events such as the cross-harbour swim run the risk of being affected by the weather.

 Secretary for Security Chris Tang said the sentences handed down on Tuesday in the city's largest national security case to date reflected the severity of the offence.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking after the High Court court sentenced 45 people for conspiracy to commit subversion, Tang also told reporters that the government will look into individual cases before deciding whether to appeal.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think different people may have different judgements about whether the sentencing is appropriate. But I think the important point is the rule of law," Tang said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, eight others, including former lawmakers James To and Roy Kwong, are currently on bail after they were arrested three years ago for participating in the unsanctioned Legco primary aimed at bringing down the government. They have yet to be charged.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For every case, if we have sufficient evidence, we will arrest and we will prosecute," Tang said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Barrister and Executive Councillor Ronny Tong told RTHK that the sentencing reflected the application of common law principles.
  <br>
  <br>
  "One can see that the sentencing may not be as severe as a lot of people originally think, but it has its basis by reason of the fact that the court is effectively sentencing these defendants according to common law principles," Tong said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "One must still remember that we are talking about serious crimes... A conspiracy crime may simply involve a situation where the crime has yet to be committed. Nevertheless from the sentencing, one can see that the court will treat it seriously and I think people should be aware of this."

 Transport Secretary Lam Sai-hung on Tuesday said the government will carefully review fare increase requests from bus operators before making any decisions.
 <br>
  <br>
  KMB and New Lantao Bus are asking for 6.5 percent increases, while Citybus wants to put fares up by 9.5 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We’ll consider several factors, starting with how the public feels about it and the bus companies’ financial figures. We’ll also look at the services the bus operators offer. We will strictly play our gatekeeping role," Lam told reporters after attending a transport event.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lam added that officials will gather opinions from legislators and the general public as well as the Transport Advisory Committee, based on the existing mechanism.
  <br>
  <br>
  Legco's panel on transport is set to begin discussions on the matter on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Lam also said implementing time-varying tolls for the Tai Lam Tunnel would be one of the many viable options when the government takes control of the infrastructure in May.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said he hopes to present Legco the amendments to the tunnel's regulations by the end of this year and promised that the tunnel's tolls will be much lower than they are now.

<img alt="The court hands down jail sentences of at least seven years to Owen Chow, Gordon Ng and Gwyneth Ho." src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1779873_3_20241119164309.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Three of the defendants in Hong Kong's largest national security trial to date received the heaviest sentences among those considered "active participants" in the scheme aimed at bringing down the government.
 <br>
  <br>
  Former activist Owen Chow was given a jail term of seven years and nine months, Gordon Ng was jailed for seven years and three months, and former journalist Gwyneth Ho got seven years.
  <br>
  <br>
  National security judges Andrew Chan, Alex Lee and Johnny Chan pointed out that Chow, 27, was one of the initiators of a pledge relating to the scheme, which "certainly pointed to the fact that [Chow] was putting every effort in binding the participants to ensure its success”.
  <br>
  <br>
  He had pleaded not guilty.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chow was already jailed over a riot case, and Tuesday's sentence will be served consecutively because the judges ruled that they were "separate and distinct incidents".
  <br>
  <br>
  As for Ng, who had also pleaded not guilty, the judges said the 46-year-old "willingly and intentionally" facilitated the scheme.
  <br>
  <br>
  “This was exemplified by the fact that he placed a full-page advertisement in Apple Daily on 3 July 2020 urging candidates who lost in the Primary Election not to participate in the LegCo election and asking people not to vote for anyone who had not participated in the Primary Election,” the judgement said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho, meanwhile, was the only defendant who did not submit mitigation.
  <br>
  <br>
  She had pleaded not guilty as well.
